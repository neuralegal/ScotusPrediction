John Paul Stevens  And for the maximum... what--   John Paul Stevens  --Okay.   John Paul Stevens  Would you just clarify one thing for me?  Suppose in this case, instead of having a through bill of lading from the sea all through the... through the railroad, there had been a delivery at the port to the freight forwarder or somebody else on behalf of the shipper and then a new bill of lading was issued to the railroad.  Would the liability then be different for the railroad?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And then if... would the rate be different in that instance?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I'm trying to find out whether the railroad would have a different liability under my hypothetical.  I'm wonder if it would have charged a different amount for the freight.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Should we assume that the railroad probably gave a special bargain to the shipper in this case because it had a lesser exposure for liability?

John Paul Stevens  May I ask a question referring to the... the matter you quoted a moment ago?  After the shipment arrives in the... on shore and there is an outstanding maritime bill of lading that has the COGSA limits in it, is the railroad entitled to rely on that bill of lading in quoting a rate to the maritime shipper?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But what you're saying, if I understand it, they did not do so in this case.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But would it be open to them, as a matter of law, to say, whenever we get a joint bill of lading like this, we're going to give a different rate because we have a different liability exposure?   John Paul Stevens  But... but in doing that, can they rely on the limits in the joint bill of lading?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But you're asking us to hold that they may not do that.

John Paul Stevens  The only...  the only thing I question is your statement that the statute itself is a grant of power to a local entity.  It doesn't grant any power to anybody.  The statute doesn't.   John Paul Stevens  It preserves power from being preempted.   John Paul Stevens  It is.   John Paul Stevens  May I ask you...  Isn't it also the case...   John Paul Stevens  May I ask you this one more sort of general question?  As I understand your theory, you read the statute as an anti-monopoly statute.  No State shall grant any exclusive privilege.  Isn't that...  you say that's really what it does.  And my question is if that were the purpose, why wouldn't they write it that way that no State shall grant a monopoly or grant exclusive privilege?   John Paul Stevens  But it's perfectly clear that this statute does intrude substantially on the...  on the State's ability to regulate.

Was that in the statute before the reorganization or is that part of the reorganization?   John Paul Stevens  It seems to me, Mr. Kneedler, this is an argument that you don't have an antitrust violation here, but we're concerned with the problem of whether you had a classic violation, say they agreed with somebody else on the prices they would charge for advertising the Olympics or something like that, where you had a clear...  here you don't have it clear.

John Paul Stevens  Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a basic question I just kind of forgotten that I thought I knew about, but I thought the Postal Service had a monopoly of the business of delivering letters and packages, and that these competing services are only allowed to exist by some special privilege granted by the Postal Service.   John Paul Stevens  But not for parcel, I see.   John Paul Stevens  So greeting cards?

0,"John Paul Stevens  May I ask this question?  I know you didn't argue about negligence, but you do seem to draw a distinction between affirmative conduct on the one hand and failure to act on the other hand.  And my question to you is, supposing that without asking the stewardess, the passenger had gotten into a...  a non-smoking seat seven or eight rows ahead of where he was sitting and then was ordered to return to his seat.  Would that have been an accident?   John Paul Stevens  That would have been.   John Paul Stevens  It would not have been.   John Paul Stevens  So then...  then you don't rely on a distinction for the action and non-action.   John Paul Stevens  Yes, but you...  you say you wouldn't draw the distinction I suggested.  So assume the case was the other way around, that the stewardess told him to get back to his seat.  Now, why would that not be an accident?   John Paul Stevens  But I want to be sure I understand your position.  If the stewardess had gone to the captain of the plane and said, we've got a guy in the back seat who said he's going to die because he can't stand smoke, he wants to sit in the front seat, and he's grabbed a seat up there, should I order him back to the old seat, and the captain says, yes, send him back, would that be an accident?

1,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Farr, can I interrupt for a second?  It seems to me that in the question of whether you move a passenger or not, you could have a situation which for security reasons, as they have around Washington, every passenger must remain in his or her...  her seat for 500 miles or 30 minutes or so, and refusal to move during that period could not possibly be an accident.   John Paul Stevens  Would you comment on the distinction between an event and an accident?   John Paul Stevens  I think it would affect the liability for loss of baggage and so forth.  That's triggered by an event, as I understand it.   John Paul Stevens  assuming that it could have happened somehow in an airline context, would you say that Justice Scalia's hypothetical was an accident?   John Paul Stevens  Well, is airline's fault even required?  Supposing that before the plane took off, there was a big fire in the area and smoke filled the...  filled the aircraft while it was on the runway and then he died from that smoke, would that be an accident?   John Paul Stevens  There's going to be an accident within the meaning of the convention is what I'm asking you.   John Paul Stevens  So then the smoke doesn't have...  the...  the...  whatever the accidental cause is, it doesn't have to be fault of the airline.   ",02-1348

1,"John Paul Stevens  Thank you.  Mr. Srinivasan.     Sri Srinivasan  I think the difference lies in the extent to which there was perceived to be a shortfall.  My understanding is that there was a shortfall already in BIA programs whereas the shortfall didn't really become evident with respect to the IHS until 1994 and beyond.  And that's why you might see the discrepancy between the two.  But Congress also acted, by the way, in 1998 in the 1999 Appropriations Act in enacting section 314 of the 1999 Appropriations Act.  And I think, if nothing else, section 314 at list... at least expresses the view of a subsequent Congress that the Secretary's allocation scheme from 1994 to 1997 was legitimate and was fully within his discretion under the ISDA.  And under this Court's decisions in Red Lion and its progeny, that determination by a subsequent Congress is at least entitled to great weight in determining what the Secretary appropriately exercised discretion in 1994 through 1997.  So even if you thought that there was some doubt on whether the Secretary had carried out his functions consistently with the ISDA, I think Congress' saying later in the 1999 Appropriation Act that its view was that Secretary had done so legitimately should push the Court towards ruling in our favor on the initial interpretation of the ISDA.  I want to address really quickly, if I could, the notion that the funds for administrative support for programs that are administered directly by the Federal Government are available.  And that would have significant consequences because one of the policies underlying the act is not only to protect the interests of tribes that are currently entered into self-determination contracts, but it's to protect the amounts that are available to tribes that might some day choose to enter into self-determination contracts.  And if, under the tribes' view, the Secretary was required to divert the entire amount of the increase in any particular year to contracting tribes or to... to divert the entire amount of administrative support for... for noncontracted programs to contracting tribes, the effect of that would be to freeze in place the amounts that were available for potentially contracting tribes in future years.

0,"John Paul Stevens  Can I--   John Paul Stevens  --Can I ask you sort of a basic question that I'm having trouble following?  As I understand, you're saying 98 percent of the appropriation have been allocated to programs, projects, activities, and so forth that can't be reduced.  Now, is there anything in the statute that would have prevented the Secretary from allocating only 96 percent of the budget to those funds?   John Paul Stevens  But his budget that he actually worked out with the 98 percent was not mandated by the statute, as I understand.   John Paul Stevens  In part but not in whole.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, that's the point.   John Paul Stevens  Is the... is the nub of what you're trying to tell me is that the 98 percent was, in fact, mandated by a statute?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Principal part, but--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --Does that mean that there was not enough?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  They could have made it 97 percent--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --and had enough money--   John Paul Stevens  --to pay these contract obligations.   John Paul Stevens  See, the thing that troubles me is it seems to me your reading of the statute makes the contractual problem... provision illusory because they can always allocate funds to all these other projects and say, well, we've already used up the money.   John Paul Stevens  Are you telling me that the committee reports are... are binding law?   John Paul Stevens  It seems to me you can interpret those comments as saying we don't... they did not leave enough room in the budget for the programs we now want to support and our prior contractual obligations.   John Paul Stevens  Yes.  It seems to me that you can interpret what you're saying as the... as the... the Government adopting a budget in which there's not enough room for all the programs it wants to support in the current year and continuing to honor the obligations under the existing contracts.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, why... why is it clear that it would be for this hearing because the judge followed up, after saying that, did you want to represent yourself at today's hearing, which would seem to me to imply that the judge did not know whether or not he had already decided not to have counsel at that hearing?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, of course--   John Paul Stevens  But it's not clear on this record, though.   John Paul Stevens  Well, if you draw... draw presumptions, maybe it is.

But if you just look at what was said to him at the hearing itself, it's not clear that he knew that he had... he had waived application for a court-appointed attorney.  He didn't necessarily say he wanted to represent himself.

1,"John Paul Stevens  Yes, but Mr. Smith, isn't it true that what the issue is sufficiency of your complaint?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And may I ask you a question that... that troubles me about the complaint?  It seems to me your complaint was drafted on the theory that you agreed with Justice Powell's position in Bandemer, but the position you've come up with in this Court is entirely different and not the one that I read into the complaint.  Your majority analysis theory is... is really quite different from... from that theory.  You... you seem to have abandoned Justice Powell.  And I... what I wanted to ask you is, under the theory of the complaint, as opposed to the theory on which you're arguing in this Court, if you were... you allege that there were no neutral justifications whatsoever for any district line.  And if you put in proof to that effect and the... and the other side prove there were neutral justifications for half the districts, say, but the... that there were a half that did fit your allegations, would... would... in your view, would the district court have the authority to review the districts that were totally unjustified without meeting your majority analysis claim?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Assume the effects, say you've got two plaintiffs, one from district 6 and one from 16, I think.   John Paul Stevens  If, for example, the... the court thought that district 6 had absolutely no justification, it's wildly, you know, the shape is so terrible and so forth, but the rest of the map was okay.  Under your complaint, could the judge do anything about that?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I know your complaint is drafted as a all-or-nothing, but I'm just wondering, within the... within the allegations, would... would it be open to the judge to say, well, they lose on the total picture, the majority theory is... is just too... too novel for me, but what they've said about district 6 pans out 100 percent.  Is that--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --In particular districts?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  They did that in the racial gerrymandering context... situation.   INTERRUPTING ",02-1580
0,"John Paul Stevens  May I ask you kind of a preliminary question?  Let's assume that them... that their theory won't fly, this majority theory is just too impractical and so forth.  But what about the theory advanced in their complaint that the... some of the districts, and perhaps all... they allege all... were... were drafted by relying exclusively on a principle of maximum partisan advantage?  And supposing the evidence shows that no neutral criteria at all were used except let's do the best we can to help our own party get as many seats as we can.  Would that raise a question at all in your mind?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, what if... what if they narrowed the allegation, said just district 6 or district 16 was clearly drawn for this purpose and no other, no neutral, no effort to be compact or contiguous or follow boundary lines or rivers or anything, we just want to get the maximum vote for one particular party here.  Would you say that was permissible?   John Paul Stevens  No, it would just--   John Paul Stevens  --It would just say to the... when you have a... a really strangely distorted district, the burden is on you to point out one neutral justification for it, and we'll assume that if you... you won't have to go into the minds of the legislature, just assume there is something we can point to, such as a boundary line or if it's fairly compact or it's... but you can't point to anything.  You don't have to go into anybody's mind.  You just say... you give them the opportunity to explain, and they... they say, well, we have no explanation.  We did it just because we want to get that to be a democratic district.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes.   John Paul Stevens  Is there any duty at all to... any duty at all in drawing districts to try to do it impartially?  Your answer is no?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I understand that.   John Paul Stevens  But then on the Constitution, what about if the legislature decided that the salaries of the majority legislature should be 10 percent higher than the minority legislators?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  There'd be a good reason for it, because they have more work to do.  They have to vote and they... they get statutes adopted and programs enacted, so would that satisfy the constitutional duty?  If there is a duty to govern impartially, do you think it would?   John Paul Stevens  But that the... all the members of the majority party?   John Paul Stevens  --Why not?   John Paul Stevens  May... may I again ask you just one question about the complaint?  Do you think it states a cause of action under the theory espoused by Justice Powell in his Davis against Bandemer concurrence in the judgment?  And if not, why not?  And then the final question is, and if it does meet that standard, why isn't that adequate judicially manageable standards?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, but the first question--   John Paul Stevens  --before you reach remedy is whether there's a violation.   John Paul Stevens  And his theory basically was, there's a violation if there are certain wildly... wildly-defined districts that have no neutral justification except to give partisan advantage to the people who had the power to draft them and who did not even consult the adversary party in drafting them.  That was his standard.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It's a matter of burden-shifting, and if they can't come up with any explanation whatsoever other than partisan advantage, that that's a violation of the... of the duty to govern impartially.  And either there is no such duty or it is a violation.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But again, under Justice Powell's standard, they wouldn't have to do that.   John Paul Stevens  They would just have to say, this is totally irrational unless you can come up with an explanation.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But, of course, the remedy would be that redraw district using some neutral criteria.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  That's certainly not an impossible standard.   John Paul Stevens  Historical boundaries, contiguity, compactness, maintaining incumbents of both parties.  There are lots of neutral criteria available, and any one of them might justify an other... what seemed on its face to be a very wild district.   John Paul Stevens  Not as much as some--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --Not as much as the one in Karcher or the one in this case do.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  That's a... that's true, and the only judicial call is you've got to use at least one.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --Even if that's true, is it not obvious from the configuration of some of the districts, that those who drafted the districts thought they could predict what they were going to do?   John Paul Stevens  Oh, okay.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Do you agree with your colleague that there is no need for any neutral justification when you're drawing districts?  That it can be done solely for the purpose... granted it be an attempt that might not succeed, nobody knows for sure how people are going to vote, but is it permissible for a legislative body not even to consult... I mean, the majority of a legislative body not even to consult another party, not even to take anything into consideration except trying to get the maximum results at the... the election?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But if you take that position, then you must be taking the position, I guess you are, that the... the holding in Bandemer that this was a just... justiciable issue is just erroneous?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  That's your basic position?   John Paul Stevens  May I ask you this?  Do you think the complaint states a cause of action under Justice Powell's opinion in Bandemer?   John Paul Stevens  That's why I thought I'd ask you.  You had fair warning of the question.     [Laughter]   John Paul Stevens  Don't tell me you didn't read the opinion.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, no.  He doesn't start down the road of electoral results.  He... he focuses on intent, that it's an intent to use nothing except a non-neutral criterion in drafting the regulations.  And you're suggesting that's permissible.  That would not require counting votes after the election.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And nothing else.   John Paul Stevens  --You can only... that's a matter of defense.  You can't presume that based on the allegations at the complaint.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, how did you find it in the... in the first racial gerrymandering case?  Didn't you find it partly by looking at the shape of that district in North Carolina?   John Paul Stevens  Didn't that shift the burden?   John Paul Stevens  The... the exclusive motive just is easier to respond to, because all you got to do is come up with one neutral justification and you use the neutral justifications that the Court identified itself in the racial gerrymandering cases, such as contiguity and compactness and so forth.   John Paul Stevens  Correct.  That's exactly right.  No, no, the premise of the... what the question is that there's a duty to govern impartially, and that if you have no duty except partisan advantage, the case is just like saying, we're going to pay the majority legislatures a higher salary than the minority legislatures.   John Paul Stevens  It can do that as long as it has some other basis for doing it, and that's history what we did over years and years and years, states have followed an attempt to get compact districts, your neighbors are in the same voting area as you are and so forth, not these fancy designs that are really a recent product of politics.

0,"John Paul Stevens  On... on the instructions in the red brief at page 8 and then at page 9, there are two different instructions set out.  This is in the respondent's brief.  And then the jury form which has to be checked is set out on pages 9 and 10.  In your view is that all we should consider when we interpret these instructions, or do you have some additional instructions that you wish us to refer to?   John Paul Stevens  Could I interrupt?   John Paul Stevens  May I interrupt with just one question?  Because I'm... I'm a little rusty on just what the sequence of opinions was.  And I... I think you have one impression of the case if you just read the instructions because I think you've got a very strong argument on the instructions.  I get a different impression of the case when I look at the jury form, the verdict form, which in effect requires a check to show the jury acting unanimously.  And my question is at the first go-round, did the court of appeals actually focus on the... the jury form as well as the instructions?   John Paul Stevens  It did.   John Paul Stevens  Because the jury form does seem to imply a concept of unanimity because they got to require... you know, the form definitely refers to unanimity.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes, but... but the key point is that in the mitigating circumstances are, there are one, two, three options.  They just checked one.   John Paul Stevens  And see, it isn't explicit here, and the check seems to me to indicate that they were unanimous on mitigating circumstance number 1, but they were not on the others.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And so it seems very likely that some of the jurors may have considered... felt they could not consider mitigating circumstance 2 or 3.   INTERRUPTING ",02-1603

0,"John Paul Stevens  But this is not a normal suit against the State.  This is a suit in which the debtor seeks authority to get a discharge, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So the proceeding itself is to determine whether or not she's entitled to a discharge on the debt at issue.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  If she... if she prevails in that disputed factual matter, then it will be just like any other discharge case.  If... if the hearing goes forward and she prevails as a matter of fact, then it would be just like any other discharge case, wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No.  I'm saying if she prevails on the disputed issues of fact, thereafter it would be just like a normal discharge case.   John Paul Stevens  Mr. Brand, can I ask you--   John Paul Stevens  --May I ask one question?  Did I understand you correctly to say that you did not contest the fact that if... if... that if they had a blanket rule that all student loans are automatically dischargeable, that would be true even if the creditor was a State?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And does that mean you also would agree that any ordinary commercial obligation to the State such as paying rent for an... an office suite or something like that could also be dischargeable and there would be no sovereign immunity problem there?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, but there has to be... there has to be a final order in the bankruptcy proceeding discharging... you know, giving the... the debtor a discharge.   John Paul Stevens  But the... but the net result is I thought your position in your brief was somewhat different from that.  That's why I wanted to be sure about it.  You do agree that... that the sovereign immunity is not a valid objection to a discharge of a bankrupt estate.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So, but the difference in the automatic stay if the... if the debtor had to go in and prove his name, serial number, and rank or something first, so it wasn't completely automatic, then you would say you have a sovereign immunity objection.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, I'm really not so much interested in the authority from the lower courts as I am curious about your position.  What exactly does the sovereign immunity defense protect for you?   John Paul Stevens  I know, but it seems to me somewhat anomalous to say that if you want to do it without giving us a hearing, you can go ahead and do it, but if you give us notice and a hearing and an opportunity to respond, then you're protected by the Eleventh Amendment.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  A rather strange position.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, you say--   John Paul Stevens  --it could well be that the State filed a claim and proved up its claim and then there's not enough money to pay it, the claim, but there would be some kind of proceeding to establish the claim.  Would that be different then?   John Paul Stevens  So that if the State voluntarily appears, it would automatically waive its sovereign immunity defense.   John Paul Stevens  I do have.  Would you tell me again, what... what's the cite to the case about the turnover that you just cited?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  What is the name of the case?

0,"John Paul Stevens  I was going to ask you to get out of the courthouse area of the case for a minute.  The Government's brief contains a statement that in 1975, approximately one million disabled students were excluded entirely from the public school system.  If that were true, and if... because of their disability, if that were true, would that constitute a constitutional violation?   John Paul Stevens  And then my next question is, there's nothing in the record... suppose you had several Congressmen who said, I'm going to vote for this statute because I'm convinced that this fact is true, but there's nothing in the hearings, but... but it definitely motivated the voting of people who voted for this statute, could... would it be valid in that fact, that situation?  Or do we have to have evidence in a... in a congressional hearing in order to justify a congressional decision?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Is it... is it--   John Paul Stevens  --Is it true then that in a case like this, we must examine legislative history in order to determine the validity of the statute?   John Paul Stevens  Well, it hasn't been... I'm assuming it hasn't, but it's just clear that the Congressmen who voted for the statute thought it was true.  They got letters from their constituents and acted on that sort of information, and that... but that can never be sufficient under your understanding of our cases?  It must be something in the congressional record?   John Paul Stevens  Yes, but--   John Paul Stevens  But is that quite correct?  Isn't it true that under section 5 they prohibited the poll tax and literacy tests, even though they'd been held permissible?  They were not unconstitutional, they were prophylactic measures.

1,John Paul Stevens  I'm not under... I really don't understand one... one argument that's going on.  I don't know why one violation wouldn't be enough to justify congressional action.

1,"John Paul Stevens  Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.  Mr. Thomas.     Kenneth L. Thomas  Yes, ma'am.  But they're all memorable.  [Laughter]  They're all... thank you.   John Paul Stevens  Thank you, Mr. Thomas.  Mr. Newsom.     Kevin C. Newsom  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:  I'd like to address, if I may, several concerns that have been raised during the... the preceding arguments.  One is to clarify some things about the scope of the administrative remedy.  The other side, with respect, wants you to think that without the implied right of action for damages and fees, whistle blowers are left out in the cold.  That is not true.  The administrative remedy... it's not just about funding termination.  34 C.F.R. 106.3 says that the OCR may use any remedy that it deems necessary.  The OCR, as we say in our brief, has itself touted its flexible approach to enforcement which includes, among other things, as this Court noted in Gebser, citing back to its earlier... pardon me... decision in North Haven, individualized relief in appropriate circumstances.  So the point, as Senator Bayh himself noted on the floor of the Senate, is that it is the threat of... of funding termination.  So while the OCR is wielding the club of funding termination, they can extract or leverage individualized relief in appropriate cases.   John Paul Stevens  Yes, but it did construe the word discrimination, didn't it?   Kevin C. Newsom  --No, sir.  Discrimination is not even in... is not even in title... rather, in 1982.  So the language is very different--   John Paul Stevens  Yes.   Kevin C. Newsom  Even granting your assumption, Justice Ginsburg, what is painfully not clear is that the... is that the Birmingham Board would be subject to... to a private right of action for damages and fees even in... in the event that there were some generally applicable anti-retaliation provision.   John Paul Stevens  Thank you, Mr. Newsom.   Kevin C. Newsom  Thank you, Justice Stevens.   John Paul Stevens  Mr. Dellinger, you have about 3 and a half minutes.     INTERRUPTING ",02-1672
0,"John Paul Stevens  Of course, you say it's not there, but the agencies interpreting the statute thought it was there.  Isn't that correct?   John Paul Stevens  No, but their reading of the statute was that the word discrimination included a retaliation claim.  That's the kind of regulations they drafted on the basis of their understanding of what Congress intended by using the word... the words in this statute.   John Paul Stevens  You cannot use the regulation that goes beyond the meaning of the statute.  That's what that holds.  But a regulation interpreting what the statute itself provides is in a different ball park.  And that's what I understand these regulations to have done, to say what the agencies thought the statute itself meant.   John Paul Stevens  It had never anticipated a private right of action, even though it read the Cannon opinion, which was written some 20 years ago?  Maybe more than that.  I don't remember.   John Paul Stevens  But Congress itself has adopted the rule set forth in Cannon.   ",02-1672
0,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Boyce, can I ask you a question about how far your position extends?  You say that it wasn't too late to... to raise the jurisdictional issue when you did.  Supposing there had been a trial and instead of your losing, you had won, and then you knew about the jurisdictional defect, and then you waited to see what would happen on appeal.  Then you lost on appeal.  And then you decided to raise the jurisdictional defect.  Would you say that was... they would then be required to dismiss?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  All right.  Suppose then it was affirmed and then you decided you didn't realize it until after the judgment had been entered and become final and so forth, and then a year later you find out about it.  Could you raise it then?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So you say it can always be raised on direct... while... until final judgment is entered, but it can never be raised on collateral attack.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Do you rely on a distinction between a defendant's right to a Federal forum and the plaintiff's to a Federal forum?  It seems to me they're exactly the same.  At the time it's invoked, it's... there's no Federal jurisdiction.   John Paul Stevens  Then are you... are you saying this is... is the rule you rely on a constitutional rule or a statutory rule?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  In other words, you don't say the Constitution would prohibit us from affirming.   John Paul Stevens  So there's a... there's no subject jurisdiction as a matter of constitutional law, just no subject matter jurisdiction.  But nevertheless, you say there could be no... no collateral attack on the judgment.  I'm not sure that I understand the... why there couldn't be a collateral attack if you're dead right on this.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I think you're right, but I'm just wondering why.   ",02-1689
1,"John Paul Stevens  May I just ask you one general question?  In... in your view is the rule that you advocate a one-way street in the sense that if there was jurisdiction when the case was filed, then the next week the plaintiff moved to the same State of the defendant, there would nevertheless continue to be jurisdiction all the way down the line?   John Paul Stevens  So it's... this... this rule, if we adopt it, is 100... it's... it's to... it's always to preserve or to allow a... a belated creation of jurisdiction.   John Paul Stevens  Okay.  Then the second question is... I just want to be 100 percent sure on your view... is if the original defect is discovered before trial, even though it had been corrected a day or 2 later, there would still be a duty to dismiss the complaint, dismiss for want of jurisdiction because there was no jurisdiction at the time of filing, under your view.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And I suppose you would argue that if we're looking for bright line rules, we shouldn't make it turn on what the nature of a particular jurisdictional defect was or they moved to another State or you let one partner resign of something like that.  The bright line rule, it seems to me, has to turn on whether it's equally bright line to say you can make this objection up till the time of a verdict in the trial court or it's equally bright line to say you can do it up to the time that the appellate court judgment is final.  You can't do it after... we all agree you can't do it on collateral attack.  And I don't know why one is any more bright line than the other, unless you get into these ramifications that there's a difference between removal and filing or a difference between the... the plaintiff moving to another State or... or adding a partner.  Those are all... it seems to me any one of those would depart from the need for a bright line rule.   ",02-1689
1,"John Paul Stevens  May I ask of you if the Government has procedures in place for the cases in which inadvertently they damage the car or... or maybe the thing might blow up on some occasion or something like that?  What... what's remedy does the citizen or the maybe an alien or the citizen have in that situation?     INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I would think there are a lot of cases, repair bills are getting pretty expensive now, where $1,000 wouldn't cover it, the damage to a car.     INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, I just... but it's... it's sort of in the background as we're asking whether it's reasonable in the... in the... in an ultimate sense, and I just... that's one of the things that I'm concerned about is--     INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, but not just on the... the... if you smash it unnecessarily, but suppose the only way to get behind the fabric in say a seat cushion or something like that is to cut it open.

John Paul Stevens  Well, I understand that, but... but if the law were followed and everything went perfectly, he would spend less than 2 or... what is it, 2 or 3 years?   John Paul Stevens  And he's going to spend 16 years in jail, is that right?   John Paul Stevens  Now, is that just, do you think?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I understand that you want to preserve the procedures, but do you think justice is being done?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I ask this question?  I always thought there was a manifest injustice exception to the procedural default rule, and as I understand it, the Government concedes there was injustice at the end of their brief.  They say it's less significant, it's a less... qualitatively less significance than if you put an innocent man to death.  But is it not manifest that there was injustice in this case?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, can you give me an example of when manifest injustice would exist other than a death case?   John Paul Stevens  Well, I understand that, but is there any... any content to the manifest injustice exception in your view?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, give me an example.   John Paul Stevens  Well, he's innocent of the crime he's in... in prison for.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, but if the law were followed, he would have been released a long time ago, would he not?   John Paul Stevens  Well, narrow circumstances, when the record makes it perfectly clear that an error has been committed and an innocent person is in jail, that's... what more do you need?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  There aren't many cases like this.   John Paul Stevens  Yes, but usually the valid claim is some procedural error in the trial, something of that character.  It's not that he's totally innocent and everybody agrees he's totally innocent.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I think it's a lesser injustice if he's really guilty of the crime.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  He is not guilty of what he's in prison for.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And I don't think the 3 days is an argument that has any merit.  You'd make the same argument if it was 10 years.  You'd make the same argument.   John Paul Stevens  If he could deliberately refuse to do it in order to trap the state into some kind of mistake, is this a case of, you know, in our original case that we talk about gamesmanship and so on, do you think this is gamesmanship on his part?   John Paul Stevens  Well, if the counsel sandbagged for the purpose of getting a 16-year sentence instead of a 3-year sentence, doesn't that demonstrate that he was incompetent?     [Laughter]   John Paul Stevens  Would it involve all those costs if we can find the exception to cases in which the state acknowledges the error?   John Paul Stevens  Would it be problematic if we limit it that way?   John Paul Stevens  Mr. Roberts, why is it--   John Paul Stevens  --Why is this qualitatively different from the rule in Jackson against Virginia that if there's no evidence to support the conviction, we set it aside, then you presume the guy's innocent?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, when the record is perfectly clear that--   John Paul Stevens  --When the record is perfectly clear that one of the elements hasn't been proved, why he had a... why isn't it the same here?  The record establishes that one of the elements necessary for this conviction has not been proven, the order of the... the two crimes.

1,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Estrada, can I just raise a question?  I'm sure you'll cover it in the argument and I want to get it on the table.  On your first point, that our prior cases have said that 502 is the exclusive remedy for actions to acquire benefits, is there a distinction?  Some of your opponents argued between denials based on the terms of the plan, that this just doesn't qualify for some reason, on the one hand, that you just should get the answer out of the plan, and denials based on a discretionary decision as to whether the medical treatment was appropriate or not, which would require the exercise of some kind of professional judgment.  The nurse might think he doesn't need an extra day in the hospital or something like that.  Is that a valid distinction or not?   John Paul Stevens  Yes, of course they could, but the fact that if we held there was no preemption, it wouldn't necessarily mean they would win on the merits.  I mean, you are... your drug formulary may be absolutely defensible, even though it could be tested in a state court proceeding.   John Paul Stevens  Yes, but let me just focus on the case involving the woman who may have needed a second day in the hospital.  Is it correct that they... an agent of the HMO had discretion to grant that second day if the nurse thought it was really medically required?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So the decision as to whether she would have the second day in the hospital would depend on a medical judgment made by an agent of the plan.  Is that correct?   John Paul Stevens  But the coverage is if it's medically needed, it would... she would get the second day.  But whether or not it's covered then turns on a medical judgment, does it not?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes, but is not correct, to make the coverage decision, one has to make a medical decision?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, I was focusing on the CIGNA case, because it seemed to me that it's a little clearer there that there would be a medical judgment required.   John Paul Stevens  Yes, but in the situation in the hospital case, there was no time to get relief.  How could they... how could they get relief from the denial of the extra day in the hospital between midnight and the next morning?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Unless it was medically necessary to stay an extra day.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And what does that mean in the hospital setting?  And what... was she going to file a complaint with the Department of Labor?   John Paul Stevens  Well let's assume the case... because your preemption item would cover even the most extreme case.  Assume the case in which the patient and the doctor both called the agency and appealed and they said we're too busy, we can't handle it and it later determines they were... did not exercise due care.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Why are you preempting the state providing a remedy for that situation?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It would have been a denial, but it wouldn't have given her the extra day in the hospital?   John Paul Stevens  I understand.   John Paul Stevens  --But the question we really are facing is whether the State of Texas is denied the authority to provide a remedy in that situation.

Right?  Because certainly in a motel room, it would be less time than it would in a mansion.   John Paul Stevens  Well, but may... may I just interrupt?   John Paul Stevens  It's not how long it would take a person to get to the door.  It's how long a period must elapse before it's reasonable to infer that the person has refused to come to the door.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But isn't it true that the... the purpose of the analysis is to decide whether or not the silence is the equivalent of a refusal?  Because the statute requires a refusal.  And if that's true, I... I am really kind of puzzled as to why the possibility of disposing of drugs affects the time period.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, but I'm still curious if you... if you do have a view as to what would be reasonable on the facts of this case.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I understand you think 15 to 20 seconds is unreasonable.  Do you have a view as to what would have been reasonable?

It has to go through the judicial review process.  Would... would that... would that answer your case or--   John Paul Stevens  --or am I misstating the theory here?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Okay.  Now, could... could the EPA have gone to Federal court and say, oh, well, this discretion was exercised in good faith and so forth, but it was... it was wrong?

I'm not sure I totally follow the argument, but I'm just looking at the... that statutory provision.  And are you saying that statutory provision does not apply even if the State acted arbitrarily and capriciously?   John Paul Stevens  Well, but this... that provision gives the... the EPA the authority to issue certain orders.

Suppose a person, aware of the policy, write... and has the history of this person, and say you would admit he's qualified.  I know there's some doubt about that in this case.  A qualified applicant, who has a history of drug or alcohol use and was fired for that 10 years ago, writes a letter to the company and says I'm totally aware of your policy of not hiring... rehiring people who were previously discharged for cause, but I want you to know I am a rehabilitated person and therefore I'm handicapped and I come within the statute.  And I think the... the rule against discriminating against handicaps requires you to make a special accommodation for me.  Please do so.  Now, why could you turn him down?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And if--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --a whole bunch of people.  He says... he admits he's the only person who fits.  So he can't make a disparate impact argument.  He just says you have a duty to accommodate under this statute and your failure to accommodate is discrimination when you know that the reason for the policy doesn't apply--   John Paul Stevens  --Is it your view there's no duty to accommodate for applicants?  I'm just trying to... is it your view that the statute does not require any accommodation for applicants as opposed to actually employed persons?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, the discharge isn't in question.  The question is whether a person who is now handicapped within the meaning of the statute and who was previously discharged for a reason that clearly does not justify rehiring now, other than the fact you want to have a rule with no exceptions to it.  I don't really... I'm a little unclear as to if you don't say the duty to accommodate has no application to applicants as opposed to employees, I'm a little unclear as to why this isn't like a rule in the gender discrimination cases, you can't lift over 100 pounds or something like that.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  That's right, and that's always the case of... of accommodation.   John Paul Stevens  It's always a discrimination in favor of the applicant.   John Paul Stevens  Mr. Phillips, looking at 114(c)(4), I think that speaks to the... what the company may do to employees, not... it doesn't speak to former employees--   John Paul Stevens  --or applicants for employment.

[Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You think with eight people in the minivan you could arrest all eight and hold them over for trial?   John Paul Stevens  But the distribution, as I understand it, was just enough to take care of a big party.  There was no evidence that they were for sale, was there?   John Paul Stevens  But if you had to reduce it to a percentage figure, what would you call the percentage required for probable cause?

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Because there's certainly nothing illegal about carrying money in the glove compartment, where it is illegal to carry drugs in the... behind the seat... the armrest.   John Paul Stevens  Well, I'm still curious about the answer to my question.  Assume the officer did accept the truth of the representation they were two... two hitchhikers picked up at different times, and maybe he was following the car, for instance, so he knew that was true, and then there's the driver and then there are drugs in the backseat just as there are here.  Would there be probable cause in that case?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But what is the answer?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, no, no.  I'm just assuming the only relevant facts are that it's undisputed they were two... two unrelated... they're three unrelated people, they're just entirely different backgrounds, one doesn't even speak English and one doesn't speak Spanish, but there are three of them in the car and the drugs are found exactly under the circumstances here.  What I'm trying to say... if there were no conspiracy theory, would there be probable cause?   John Paul Stevens  The only evidence that supports the notion that some were uninvolved is that as soon as one of them confessed, the police immediately dismissed the charge against the other two, and therefore abandoned the notion that it was a common enterprise.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You'd think if the... if the backseat person or whoever it was that confessed had confessed while the officer was arresting him, there would have remained the probable cause as to the other two?

1,"John Paul Stevens  But, Mr. Waxman, is it not true that there are many occasions on which the credit limit will, in fact, be exceeded and there will, nevertheless, come back an approval, and that the customer in those cases may or may not know that his... that, A, his limit was exceeded, and B, that he's going to be charged for it?   John Paul Stevens  Well, not necessarily.  You can have a card owned by two or three people in the same family and maybe the husband spent some money that the wife didn't know about while this was going on.  So it's at least possible that they would exceed the credit limit without the credit cardholder knowing it, their not being aware of it, not keeping track of it.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And... and I'm just asking you, is it not true that it is possible that he will receive an affirmative answer to using the card without knowing whether or not he exceeded the limit and therefore is going to be... be charged for it?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, but I'm not sure that's right.  If the... if the credit card issuer is informed of the overcharge, that it's over the limit, and decides this is a good customer, well, let's not charge him for it or let's okay it anyway, he gives that information to the merchant and the merchant may not tell the customer anything about it.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Isn't that true?   John Paul Stevens  No.   John Paul Stevens  But he may know.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  That's my point.   John Paul Stevens  The credit company may know and he will not pass that information on to the consumer.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, am I correct on my facts?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Is it not possible?   John Paul Stevens  Correct.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And so the consumer may end up paying a charge that he didn't realize he'd incurred.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Is that correct or not?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  If he has... if he knows two things.  He knows the fine print on the credit agreement and, two, he knows the status of his balance.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But if he doesn't have either of those in mind, it could occur... it could occur that he would run an overcharge and be charged $15 or $20 or whatever it is without realizing he's incurred the charge.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It seems to me you're unwilling to give me a categorical yes answer when the answer is yes.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, you've given me lots of examples where the charge would not be incurred.  I'm merely trying to get you to acknowledge there will be some cases in which a person who is not fully familiar with the... with the balance in his account doesn't realize he's gone over the amount and is being charged for an extra credit charge.   John Paul Stevens  If I understand the other side, they make kind of a plain language argument.  They... they talk to the merchant.  The merchant sends in... they want approve a $200 purchase and they get back, well, it'll go over the limit and is it okay.  And they say, yes, let them go over the limit, and so they've extended additional credit.  And... and they, if they're going to charge them $15 to do it, that would be a finance charge... I mean, that would be a charge for an extension of credit.  Why doesn't it fit the plain language?   John Paul Stevens  In... in exchange for the higher credit limit, yes.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And then the... but wouldn't the customer say, well, I didn't violate anything?  You told me I could do it.  Why is it a violation?   John Paul Stevens  But what if there were... what if there had been a communication?  Would it be different?  Would it be a different case if the merchant put the bank officer on the phone and said, you're over your limit, and the... and the customer said, is it okay for me to pay the extra 15 bucks for this... go over the limit $15?  He says, yes, we'll... we'll okay it.  And then they hang up.  At the end of the month, he gets a $15 charge for that.  Would that be... that would not be an extension of credit in your view if they talked on the phone and agreed to it instead of having to just go through these anonymous communications.   John Paul Stevens  There's no duty on the... on the part of the bank to say, of course, if we okay it, you have to pay an extra 15 bucks.

John Paul Stevens  Does it really.   John Paul Stevens  And what is the authority for that?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Let me just be sure I understand that argument again, Mr. Goldstein.  This says you, in effect, can retroactively require a longer vesting period.  That would mean require a longer period before you acquired an accrued benefit.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  That was 20... isn't that right?   John Paul Stevens  So accrued... the term, accrued benefits, applies to benefits that have not yet vested.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Could I just make sure I understand one thing?   John Paul Stevens  You're saying that a delay in the period between the time a benefit accrues and when it vests is not covered by 204(g), but a reduction of a benefit that has already both accrued and vested is... is not covered by it or is... you're saying they're the same.  That's what you're saying--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --for purposes of--  --Answer the question.  Yes.   John Paul Stevens  Could you address one... one question I have?

0,"John Paul Stevens  Yeah, but if he added, and therefore, it violated the Federal Constitution, then it would be a Federal claim?   John Paul Stevens  But why... why doesn't the state judge know he's raising a claim of inadequate assistance of counsel that violates the Federal Constitution?  Doesn't that give the state judge a fair opportunity to decide the Federal question?   John Paul Stevens  Well, certainly--  --But that anybody knows--  --but the question is whether it states a Federal claim that has been exhausted.  Doesn't it also state a Federal claim?   John Paul Stevens  Yes, but that... the change in position to allow the claim.  But we're only concerned with cases in which the state has denied relief.  If you could... if the state grants relief, there's no exhaustion problem.  He got the relief.   John Paul Stevens  And so if he's denied relief without knowing whether it's Federal or state, is there any possibility that if it were refiled, and clearly named Federal Constitution as the background, he would then grant relief?   John Paul Stevens  I don't see how it could possibly happen.  If the rules are the same, he made a conscientious examination, they claim, and said, you lose.  If he came back and added the words, cited some Federal case, he'd still lose.  So why hasn't the state had a fair opportunity to consider that claim and the interests of Federal is in par not, why are they not accommodated by that... by just saying, if you... if you made a claim that's clearly Federal on its facts and you've had a chance to decide it, why... why shouldn't that... that not count... be sufficient exhaustion?   John Paul Stevens  May I... may I go back to the question--  --Just to make it clear where... where your... what your rule is, the very asset Justice O'Connor said, does it suffice if you cite a constitutional provision, a case, a... a formulation.  And then we had another discussion, but that was only part of your test, because you also, I take it, assert that you... that the petitioner must set forth the factual basis for its claim... for his claim?   John Paul Stevens  So that that's a two-part test.  It... and it seems to me that in some cases it's going to be fairly obvious what the facts are and in some cases it's fairly obvious what the legal standard is, and depending.  In the case that Justice Stevens puts, where he alleges just the facts that his... that his lawyer was not even a lawyer and... and indicates why it was ineffective, but... but doesn't cite a Federal provision, it seems to me any judge knows you have to have adequate assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment, and that in the case put by Justice Stevens, it is simply a formalistic requirement.  Now, it may be that you're going to say, although it's formalistic in some cases, it's necessary to run the habeas system that we have this rule.  Is... is... is the latter your position?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Do you... do you think the hypothetical that I gave you would give a state court a meaningful opportunity to decide the Federal question?   John Paul Stevens  Then it would seem we would follow the exhaustion requirement is satisfied.   John Paul Stevens  Don't you think it's likely that Federal judges sitting in the state would be aware of those changes?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But are you thinking of changes that are favorable to the claimant or favorable to the state?

0,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Goldstein, let me just interrupt a minute.  You say if it lacks the... the business justification.  But is it not a part of... that is not a part of the plaintiffs' primary submission, is it, that it does not show?  That's an affirmative defense.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I ask a question at this point going really back to the question I asked you at the outset of the argument?  If I thought seniority or years of service was a reasonable factor other than age and if I thought this particular compensation program was based on years of service rather than age, can I look at the reasonable factor other than age in deciding whether your complaint states a cause of action?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And if I do look at it and if I do come to the conclusion I've suggested, would I not have to dismiss your complaint?   John Paul Stevens  The hypothetical... and I think it may be the case... that you have a compensation program which uses years of service as a basis for classifying employees which has a disparate impact on older workers, but it does... also it relies squarely on a reasonable factor other than age if you will call years of service such a factor.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I understand that to be this case.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, but the basis for differentiation was years of service, was it not?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, I'm just asking in the abstract.  Why wouldn't that always be a... a reasonable factor other than age?   John Paul Stevens  But the factor... if I understand it, it wasn't because they were line officers, it was rather because they had lesser years of service than the more senior officers.   John Paul Stevens  No.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I don't think the statement of purpose tells me what the... what the criterion for the different treatment was.  I still think it was years of service.   John Paul Stevens  What was the criterion?   John Paul Stevens  So in other words, the criterion was the kind of rank they had before.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Then why isn't that a reasonable factor other than age?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  In other words, you say the... the question isn't whether they used a reasonable factor other than age.  Your question is whether the use of those factors was overall reasonable.   John Paul Stevens  That's a rewriting of the statute.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Because title VII doesn't have this language in it.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Mr. Nager.     Glen D. Nager  It was added in as a safe harbor to address mixed motive cases.  There was a concern at the time that since employers had been using age as the decision-making factor, that they would continue to think about it, and the question was raised, well, would that mean that the very fact they thought of it, even though they had a nondiscriminatory reason, mean that they still violated the act?  And the Secretary said, no, we've put in this reasonable factor other than age provision to make it clear.  It... it was simply a safe harbor.   John Paul Stevens  Thank you, Mr. Nager.  I think you've answered the question.  Mr. Goldstein, you have 4 minutes, and let's make it 4 and a half.     ",03-1160

What... what part of 56a are you referring to?  (d)?   John Paul Stevens  Does it say what you just said?   John Paul Stevens  Mr. Nager, at the end of his report, Secretary Wirtz said the... a purpose, to eliminate discrimination in the employment of older workers, it would necessary not only to deal with overt acts of discrimination, but also to adjust those present employment practices which quite unintentionally lead to age limits in hiring.  And your point, as I understand it, yes, that was one of his purposes, but he meant that one to be accomplished with ERISA and other things like that.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  The quote... the reference to employment practices which quite unintentionally lead to age limits in hiring.  I see what you're saying.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But in your view, is based on reasonable factors other than age strictly an affirmative defense?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, did you challenge the sufficiency of this complaint on the ground that it did not allege that the... the program was not based on... was based on factors that were unreasonable?

Can you compel them to pay for warnings that are just industry-specific, in saying, ""This is dangerous""--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --But it seems--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --almost ironic, to me, to say that you have a greater power to tell the whole industry to publish something they don't want to publish than you do to let them--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --pay for what--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --90 percent of them want to say.

So that... but you're saying to Justice Breyer then is they have waived the $10 and they do it to a narrow class, those vehicles who are plated in Michigan because they've already charged them $100, a very heavy charge for the privilege of being plated.

That's the--   John Paul Stevens  --Of course, if you look at this statute as a whole, you don't find the overt act requirement in it anywhere, do you?

1,"John Paul Stevens  Yes, but I... if I understand you correctly, your case really isn't limited to cruise ships.  It's limited to ships that come into... passenger ships, which would include the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, all the rest of them.  Wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And the fact that it's based in Miami or it had mostly American customers really is not relevant to the legal issue.  Is it?

John Paul Stevens  But, Mr. Goldstein, there's another aspect that troubles me.  Your view, as I understand, only applies while the ship is in American waters so that if, for example, you complain about the training for a safety drill, if they conducted those after they'd gone out 20 miles to sea, there would be... there would be no violation of the... the statue.

To what extent was this whole problem of the application of this statute to the foreign vessels discussed in the legislative history of these statutes?

With respect to things like safety drills and access to gambling tables and all that, it seems to me that your answer to that would be, well, we'll just do that once we're on the high seas so there's no conflict with the statute when we're out there.

McKiever  Only to the extent that... that they are not payable for any of the reasons enumerated in the statute.  If... if they are available for payment at any time for any reason, then... then they would not qualify.  But the specified accounts, so long as they're payable for... for one of the factors and that there's a direct nexus between the right to receive the payment and... and the factors, then... then they would qualify for the exemption.  It is not, by any stretch, all IRA's.  It is just the types that... currently that the petitioners would have or that people would have that would allow the access at any time for any purpose.  So it's not that the trustee is looking to have IRA's not be eligible for exemption.  It's just the types of accounts from which all the funds can be withdrawn at any time for any purpose.  There are many qualifying IRA's that do exist, that can exist.  It's just that people have set these up from standard plans allowing them access.  Whether they access the funds or not is not the key, but the ability to access the money because it doesn't meet the statutory requirements.  There are several IRA's, though, that can and do meet the statutory requirements.  It's just that the petitioners' don't.  The case law in the Eighth Circuit was well settled, prior to the filing of this bankruptcy, that for approximately 12 years, that the definition of similar plan or contract did not include IRA's such as this, and that the on account of factors had to be satisfied to claim this exemption.  The... the debtors knew or... or potentially should have known that... that their IRA's were likely not exempt out of Eighth Circuit at the time that they filed because of the way that... that these had been construed for a long period of time.

John Paul Stevens  Now, what if there were a 50 percent penalty?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And what is it that makes it a prohibition?  Is it... is it because the purpose is to deter withdrawals, or it is that it becomes economically unacceptable?  What... what is the reason for drawing the line somewhere above 10 percent?   John Paul Stevens  But what is the purpose of imposing any penalty at all?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But 50 percent would not be a prohibition and neither would 90 percent.   John Paul Stevens  So it's a matter of degree rather than a difference in kind.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It seems to me the easiest black letter rule is no tax or some tax.  I mean, if it was totally free like an ordinary bank account, then you'd be dead right.  But the fact that for a... an important purpose there is a 10 percent penalty put in seems to me puts it into the category of things that are... you're not supposed to have an absolute right to get.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, but the right to receive 100 percent is... is dependent on a factor, isn't it?   John Paul Stevens  Yes.  At least as to the 10 percent that would be penalty, there's no right to get that money unless you have a certain age.   John Paul Stevens  Of course, the words, on account of, in this... this statute are sort of unusual, no matter how you construe them, because really the payment is on account of the years of service or it's on account of a lot of things.  You may become eligible at a certain time.  It would be better if it said a payment for which you became eligible for one of these reasons because the payment isn't really on account of all of these things.  You may get the same amount whether you're disabled or not depending on what the terms of the plan are.   ",03-1407

Would we have to disregard them, or say they were irrelevant?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But then why do you need to rely on the possibility of diversion?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yeah, but in my hypothesis, it's a nonexistent reality.   John Paul Stevens  But you're applying it to the opposite kind of regulatory... you're applying it to a regulatory regime in which the government wants to prohibit this subject... substances from being sold or... in interstate commerce.  And if you just follow the litter... the letter of this law, this marijuana won't get into interstate commerce.  In fact, it would reduce the demand for marijuana, because it would supply these local users and they wouldn't have to go into the interstate market.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --Well, I think--   John Paul Stevens  --Doesn't it depend on how you define the ""relevant class of activities""?

John Paul Stevens  No, but if it... ""trivial impact"", is it a trivial impact that enhances the price of marijuana or decreases the price of marijuana, in your view?

Now, my question to you is, if there were a similar disclaimer on this monument, would that be an adequate remedy, in your view?

John Paul Stevens  General Abbott, would the Texas purpose be equally served if the monument had on it the kind of disclaimer that the city in Wisconsin put on its monument?   John Paul Stevens  It reads this way.  What they did is they sold the parcel of land that had the Eagles' donation on it back to the Eagles and then they put a fence around it and then they put this sign up,  ""This property is not owned or maintained by the City of Lacrosse, nor does the City endorse the religious expression thereon. ""  Maybe as long as it's still on the property, it couldn't be the same.  But suppose you had a comparable disclaimer.  Would that defeat any of the purposes on which you relied to justify having the statue there?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And would it undermine the message that you legitimately seek to convey?   John Paul Stevens  General Abbott, I want to thank you for your argument and also for demonstrating that it's not necessary to stand at the lectern in order to a fine job.  Thank you.   John Paul Stevens  Mr. Clement.     John Paul Stevens  Can I ask you to address one thing that troubles me about the case?  As I understand it, it's the Protestant version basically of the Ten Commandments we have before us, which has significant differences from the Catholic version and the Jewish version.  And I understand it was the result of consultation and so forth.  But I noticed in your brief, you list the States in which the Ten Commandments displays are listed, there is none for Rhode Island, which I often think of as primarily a Catholic state, and the only one from Massachusetts is a frieze on the north wall of the public library which apparently didn't have the text of the commandments in it.  Is there any significance to the fact that this kind of display may be more popular in areas of the country where the Protestant religion is dominant as opposed to other versions of Christian religions?   John Paul Stevens  Of course, the other thing that's notable about your listing is most of the examples are examples of displays of the event itself rather than the text.  And there is an argument made I think by Professor Laycock that when you display the entire text, it's kind of a different sort of symbol than when you just have a symbolic presentation.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  A symbolic display is less objectionable when quoting the text as this monument does?   John Paul Stevens  Well, except the four commandments and Moses would avoid the differences between the three different versions of the Ten Commandments, whereas when you quote one, you must select one over the other two.

It was a nonlimiting provision.  The... the first part of the... the part that you read deals with what their rights to enforce were.  The second part was a proviso that simply said notwithstanding this, whatever else you're able to do, you may do.  Thank you for your time.   John Paul Stevens  Thank you, Mr. Somach.

1,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Minear, do you think it does waive sovereign immunity for suits brought by the district?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Did this suit begin as a suit by a water user against the district and then you were joined later?  Is that--   John Paul Stevens  --Well, in this suit, did not the district bring it against the United States?   John Paul Stevens  And was that a... was that jurisdiction proper at that time?   John Paul Stevens  But was it properly brought is what I'm asking you.   John Paul Stevens  Okay.   John Paul Stevens  Yes, but if contractual rights include a right to be paid for something, why wouldn't you get a money judgment in a case like that?  That first sentence certainly covers the possibility of a contractual right to be paid something.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  That's pretty clear language.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Certainly if it were not a... a United States and were a private individual, it would include money damages.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And... and the next sentence, as Justice Scalia points out, says the United States shall be treated just like a private party.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, I think you've got a very strong argument when you talk about an incidental third party beneficiary not being a contracting party, but now you're asking for a much broader holding than really necessary to dispose of this case, it seems to me.   John Paul Stevens  Thank you, Mr. Minear.  Mr. Somach, will you tell us what the district's views on this whole matter are?

0,"John Paul Stevens  Justice Souter, in fact it would be somewhat comparable because if you're teaching general biblical text, you wouldn't have all the different versions lined out.   John Paul Stevens  You certainly may do so.  Mr. Clement, you're welcome back for a second time.     INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Basically, and I think I understand you, you're saying, and I think you said it earlier, drop the intent clause and basically have a... try to move toward an objective criterion saying there are some ways you can display religious things and some ways perhaps that you can't and try to develop that kind of objective jurisprudence as distinct from an intent jurisprudence.  That's your point, isn't it?   John Paul Stevens  Thank you, Mr. Clement.  Mr. Friedman?     David A. Friedman  There is no reason why it couldn't be applied just as well.  My point was simply that it's even easier to do it when there is text.  The Court doesn't need to go so far as to decide whether to apply it to both text and symbol, although it certainly could.  It need only go so far as say when government posts religious texts, it must be presumed to endorse the content of that text.  It's a little more difficult when you're talking about symbols, depending on what the symbols are.  Some symbols are far more sectarian such as the Cross, such as the Star of David, than are other symbols.  At least when there is text involved, one presumes that the display of text is an endorsement of the content of that text unless the content and the context make clear that it is neutralizing.  The examples are obvious.  The display of religious art in a government owned art museum, the playing of religious music by a government symphony orchestra, the context of the orchestra, the context of the museum are sufficient to neutralize the religious message that is contained in the display itself.  Here... and the same thing I think would be said of a comparative religion course or a compare and contrast ancient moral code course.  There there is not an endorsement of a particular code, a particular text but rather a neutral educational display about several alternative ones.  That is different from taking one religious code, one revealed Word of God, placing it next to the revered documents that frame the American Republic and saying, these are all alike, these are worthy of equal reverence.  That is simply wrapping the Ten Commandments in the flag and, with all due respect, that constitutes endorsement.  Thank you.   John Paul Stevens  Thank you, Mr. Friedman.

John Paul Stevens  What does primacy have to do with it?

John Paul Stevens  Exactly what we've got in Exhibit 3 or whatever it is, that we don't have the statement of purposes, we don't have them saying it's the sole source or the primary source.

John Paul Stevens  Is it your position that what should have been done in this case, not in the hypothetical case, is the trial court should have just stayed the action pending the outcome of the Delaware case?

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And... and he has given you all the relief your entitled to.  Therefore, you go ahead and dismiss the case.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And therefore, my next question is why shouldn't we do exactly that now.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, maybe we could vacate the judgment of the court of appeals, say that was wrong, but still, order it dismissed after we vacate the judgment.   John Paul Stevens  But if you don't tell us what issue remains, I don't know why we shouldn't just direct the suit to be dismissed.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You may do so.  Mr. Castanias.  I hope you'll tell us also whether you think the case is moot before you're through.     Gregory Andrew Castanias  That's right.  But at the same time, the... the Rooker case also dealt with relitigation of the identical issues.  And if I could just sum up here, seeing that the light is on here, the issue in this case is limited to identical lawsuits, identical claims.  The Third Circuit's decision in this case, if it constitutes an extension of Rooker-Feldman at all, is only a modest extension because it recognizes, consistent with ASARCO, consistent with Heck, and consistent with the very notion, Justice Souter, of de facto appeals, not actual appeals, but de facto appeals being prohibited by the doctrine... it recognizes that claims actually litigated in a State suit to a judgment, if they are litigated anew in the Federal court, that is de facto appellate review.

It's just whether it's disclosed.   John Paul Stevens  No, I understand.  But your argument about how it would make the proceeding more cumbersome, it seems to me, is... is misplaced.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But they're not asking for that.  Am... am I wrong on--   John Paul Stevens  --And it's a particularly strong argument in a case... in several of the issues.  I remember Judge Fromm's opinion turned on the credibility of oral testimony, and in one case, Judge Fromm found the... the judge here made an erroneous ruling on credibility on one issue, if I remember correctly.  And it seems to me that's a case in which it would be particularly relevant to know the reasons pro and con on why credibility determinations were made by the person who heard the witnesses.   John Paul Stevens  Has been convinced that he was wrong.   John Paul Stevens  And the question is, well, what was his... what was the basis for his original position when you're evaluating whether you've got a valid argument to make on appeal?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, no, no.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Only if he is required by a rule to make certain findings and to deliver a completed report to someone else.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It doesn't forbid it.  You're right.  It doesn't forbid it in so many words.  But I just wonder, does it comport with your normal notions of a fair way to conduct a fair hearing, letting the parties know what the basis for decision was and who thought what about the witnesses and so forth?   John Paul Stevens  I don't think there's any... any question they can change the report, but the one... the one... I'd like to ask you a question as a matter of information.  The first sentence of 183(c) refers to the possibility that the judge to whom the case is assigned may direct the filing of additional briefs to receive further evidence and oral argument.  Does it ever happen that before the judge to whom it's assigned decides whether or not to go along with the recommended findings, that he will direct oral argument?  Does that ever happen?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Because if he did, it would seem almost necessary for him to disclose to the parties what the report they're arguing about would say.   John Paul Stevens  But it certainly seems to contemplate deliberation by the judge to whom the case is assigned about whether or not to accept the report and deliberation which might be informed from input... input from the parties.  That's a fair reading of the rule, I think.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Maybe it's not practiced.   John Paul Stevens  And if he did then ask for further briefings, do you think that there would then have been a requirement to disclose the report?   John Paul Stevens  It seems to me that the author of this subsection (c) must have contemplated the possibility of disclosure of the report.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  When they followed a different procedure, and the question is to how much... how much did they intend the... to change that prior procedure.   ",03-184X
0,"John Paul Stevens  Yes, but does that mean the... the judgment... the order denying release on parole is invalid?  There are really two parts to it.  One, you... we're not going to release you.  Secondly, your next hearing will be at a later date than you want.  Insofar as you challenge the date of the hearing... the date of the next hearing, does that necessarily imply the invalidity of the entire order denying parole?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But they're not entitled to parole.   John Paul Stevens  So that it doesn't totally invalidate the order that is at issue.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, it doesn't entirely come down.  It just... half of it comes down.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But not for release.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But... but isn't it true that one aspect of your order that's under attack is they had refused to grant them parole?   John Paul Stevens  And that remains.   John Paul Stevens  I thought the only relief they were seeking was a more prompt next hearing.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes, you may do so.  Mr. Lewis.     Alan Edward Untereiner  It is very close, Justice Ginsburg.  Dotson is essentially making two claims for prospective relief.  He is saying that these 1998 parole guidelines effectively rescind his eligibility for parole.  At the time of his conviction, he was entitled to parole after serving 15 years.  Under these guidelines, he'll have to wait till... until 32 and a half years have passed before he's eligible for parole.  And he's claiming that in... in his next parole release hearing, which is in June 2005 and beyond, the State is required to apply the old rules to him so that he'll be eligible.  So this is very much like what was at issue in Wolff.  The second claim he has is that he's entitled to annual parole release hearings in the future.  Again, it's a future... it's a prospective claim only.  In the future, he will be entitled to annual parole release hearings, and the new rules say that the State can postpone those hearings for up until 10 years.  So on both of those claims, he is seeking changes in the future, and these are classic 1983 type cases that have been brought, as I say, for the last 30 years in the lower courts.  Now, the Heck test requires a showing that if he prevails on his section 1983 claims, he would... that would necessarily imply the invalidity of his underlying conviction or sentence.  And I think this case is very different from the Balisok case.  There... there was a colloquy about that earlier.  I think that Balisok is clearly distinguishable because the administrative decision there would have had an immediate and direct impact on the duration of the prisoner's sentence by... by revoking the good-time credits.  Whereas, here, the impact is very, very speculative.  Justice Souter, you referred earlier to a durational consequence.  The durational consequence here is really quite hypothetical and remote.  If he prevails on his 1983 claims, all he will be entitled to are future hearings, and since parole is entirely discretionary in Ohio, we can't predict the outcome of those proceedings.  He'll also be entitled to... merely to be considered eligible for parole in the future.  So I think that the... the consequences... any impact on... on the duration of his confinement is... is really quite hypothetical here and it would require an expansion not only of the Heck rule but also of habeas jurisdiction to resolve this case in the State's favor.  Unless there are any further questions, we would ask that the Court affirm the Sixth Circuit's unanimous decision in favor of Dotson.  All 11 members of that court found that Dotson's claims were not barred by Heck, and this Court should affirm.   John Paul Stevens  Thank you, counsel.

If it showed they were tourists, they were just picked up by mistake, would you be here or would you not be here?   John Paul Stevens  Well, there is another problem.  At that time, that case was decided when Ahrens against Clark was the statement of the law, so there is no statutory basis for jurisdiction there, and the issue is whether the Constitution by itself provided jurisdiction.  And of course, all that's changed now.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, you raised the question of whether the territorial jurisdiction provision covered it.  There was no territorial jurisdiction if they were outside the district under the ruling in Ahrens against Clark, which means they had to rely on the Constitution to support jurisdiction, which in turn means that once they have overruled Ahrens against Clark, which they did, there is now a statutory basis for jurisdiction that did not then exist.   John Paul Stevens  No.  But Ahrens v. Clark was the law at the time of that decision, and it was subsequently overruled.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  What if the American citizen was in the middle of the battlefield in Iraq?   John Paul Stevens  Was it really... was it really under the Habeas Statute or under the Constitution?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Because if the, if the views of the dissenters in Ahrens against Clark were the law at that time as they perhaps are now, then there would have been statutory jurisdiction, which was not present at that time.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  The reason it said that was because Ahrens was then the law.   John Paul Stevens  And that was very clear in the Court of Appeals opinion.  They rested their decision solely on the Constitution.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, I understand all the cases since Cort against Ash support you, but we're construing a statute enacted a long, long time ago, and there was all sorts of... of opinion to the effect that there were at least two or three causes of action that did not need to be severally created: privacy, protecting ambassadors, and so forth.

John Paul Stevens  But, Mr. Clement, if I... if I remember, some of the briefs have taken the position that that's already an aspect of international law, a requirement that you should first exhaust in the country where the conduct took place, which would... would narrow the scope of the statute if we... if we adopted that view.

1,"John Paul Stevens  May I ask this question about substantial risk?  Say it's... there's always a substantial risk when you get in the car and you're intoxicated.  Does it make any difference whether you actually cause an injury or not?  There are two drivers, equally... equally drunk and equally negligent.  One hits somebody and the other doesn't.  Are they treated alike or are they treated differently under the statute?   John Paul Stevens  So if there's... if there's clearly the substantial risk but he was lucky enough not to hit anybody, then he's not covered.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I understand, but he would not be covered--   John Paul Stevens  --He would not be deportable.   John Paul Stevens  Whether or not you hit anybody?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Just... just following up on Justice Scalia's question, the point would be that shooting a gun is the threatened use of... of physical force against a person or property.  Getting into a car is not the threatened use of physical force against anything.   ",03-583X
0,"John Paul Stevens  But in your submission, as I understand it, the attempted use or threatened use is really a worse offense than the use because it involves intent, whereas use doesn't necessarily involve actual intent.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  What we're really looking at here, when you get all done with all this, is is this a person who should be sent back to Haiti because of this particular act that occurred.  And the irony of it, it seems to me, is that in terms of moral culpability and... and the kind of person we don't want to stay in this country, it doesn't really make any difference whether he hit somebody when he was drunk or not.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I ask you a question?  Maybe I'm repeating a little bit of what Justice Breyer asked.  But in the blue... statutory appendix to the blue brief, they quote from section 101, and they point out that the term aggravate... of the INA... the term aggravated felony means either a... for purposes of 1182, either any felony... any crime of violence or, 3, a crime of reckless driving described as intoxicated.  And it seems to me that statute draws a rather sharp distinction between crime of violence as defined in section 16 of title 18, on the one hand, and reckless driving that we're talking about in this case, on the other, which suggests to me that maybe Congress thought the two were different.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Was different.  Right.   ",03-583X
1,"John Paul Stevens  It seems rather strange to me.  If you take him to the airport, he either gets off the plane or he doesn't.  I don't see why you litigate that.  You know whether they'll accept him or not when you... when you deliver him.   ",03-674X
0,"John Paul Stevens  That doesn't make... can I interrupt here?  I want to ask the question I started before.  That doesn't make any sense.  If you read this as a mandatory requirement, the Attorney General shall do it, and if you assume an existing government... now, you narrowed the question.  So I'm not talking about the question.  If there's an existing government, he cannot command the other government to accept the alien.  The general practice among nations was they would not... the other nation has an obligation to accept people back.  But if they won't do it, we can't force them to take the person back.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  How... how could... say you send a person back to Great Britain and they say we're not going to take him.  How are you... what... what can... what could the Attorney General possibly do?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So the word shall cannot mean shall because he... he cannot in every case do it.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Unless there's acceptance.   John Paul Stevens  Let me just... let me get an answer to my question.  In your... under your reading of the statute, the mandatory... it imposes a mandatory duty on the Attorney General which he may not be able to perform because he may not be able to repatriate the alien unless the other country will accept him.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, then it's an exception to subparagraph (iv).   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So you are reading the language in subparagraph (vii) as a... an exception to subparagraph (iv).   John Paul Stevens  I'm at (E).   John Paul Stevens  And I'm saying if you read (E) your way, subsection (iv) is a mandatory command to the Attorney General that he may not be able to carry out unless he can comply with subsection (vii).   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It says shall remove.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  He can choose one of them.   John Paul Stevens  Right.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And wouldn't it always be impossible if... if the... if the other country will not accept the alien?

0,"John Paul Stevens  Yes, but did you object to the instructions in the trial court?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  One of the problems I have with the case, very frankly, is that the jury has already ruled against your client on the qualified immunity issue carrying out instructions given by the judge that were not objected to by your client.   John Paul Stevens  But whose fault is that?   John Paul Stevens  May I ask one other question about the proceedings in the trial court?   John Paul Stevens  Was there a motion for summary judgment by the defendants claiming, as a matter of law, they should be entitled to qualified--   John Paul Stevens  --And that was overruled.   John Paul Stevens  And then there was a jury trial and the jury disagreed with it and, in effect, said there... there was basis for qualified immunity.   John Paul Stevens  What is your understanding of the reason for the jury's verdict on this issue?   John Paul Stevens  May I ask one other question then too?   John Paul Stevens  In... in your view is the closely related doctrine a... a matter of closely related as a matter of law between two different offenses or is it a matter of... are the facts relevant?  For example, could one argue that these offenses were factually related pretty closely because they grew out of the same central group of facts?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes, but Mr. Phillips, let me go back first principles.  You are complaining about an arrest which you admit was valid.  Do you not... do... do you not that the arrest was supported by probable cause and therefore was a valid arrest?   John Paul Stevens  Yes.   John Paul Stevens  Oh, I misunderstood.  I thought we were just talking about qualified immunity.  But you challenge the arrest itself even though you admit there was probable cause for the arrest?   John Paul Stevens  And... and there's no need for the Ninth Circuit's rule unless there was probable cause because if there was no probable cause, you win on that ground.  You don't have to get into this closely related offense doctrine.  Is that correct?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No.  If there was no probable cause.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Then you win without this fancy doctrine.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  This... this doctrine only comes into play and is only required in cases involving a valid arrest and a... a mistake by the officer in identifying the wrong cause for the arrest.  So it's an extension of the qualified... it's a... it's a... an application of the qualified immunity doctrine to say you are not protected even though you acted lawfully.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, but if you say the arrest was valid, he did act lawfully although we didn't realize the reason why he did.   ",03-710X

John Paul Stevens  No.  The injury in the... under the statutory language, they has to... the plaintiff has to suffer an injury to his business or property, but you say that does not include the business or property that's conducted abroad?

Suppose there were contractors building a Canadian building for the Canadian Government and they had a big fraud scheme down here, and it was to deprive the Canadian Government of money?

John Paul Stevens  Ms. Brill, in the Court of Appeals, they treated the argument that this was not property as entirely separate from the revenue rule question.  And I thought your petition for cert was confined to the first question.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But the question, itself, doesn't refer to the property issue.

1,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Boas, I think you make a strong argument that Congress probably didn't think of this particular problem.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, there would have been a need to under your view now.   John Paul Stevens  But I suppose somebody on the committee might have said, well, we don't want this kind of person to have a gun, and the fact he's convicted in Japan rather than in Brooklyn really doesn't make any difference with regard to the purpose of the statute.

0,"John Paul Stevens  Ms. Millett.     INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --Yes, but--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --but let me just interrupt on your... your best case suggestion.  I don't think the test is when has the word any been used in different ways, but has the word any court ever been used by Congress to include foreign courts.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No.  I'm asking about just the words, any court.  What's your best case for the proposition that that would normally be construed by Congress to include foreign courts?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You don't have a case.   John Paul Stevens  And do they ever refer to foreign courts?  That's the question.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But the reason you often need qualification is there's... there's sort of basic question, does this include State courts as where as... as well as Federal, and it's often necessary to spell it out one way or the other.  But I don't... I'm not aware of any precedent for trying to decide whether it also embraces foreign courts.   John Paul Stevens  May... may I interrupt this--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --this colloquy to raise another question, if I may?  Would you concede that there are some tribunals in the world that are comparable to what you might call a kangaroo court that Congress would not have intended to include within the term court?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And how are we to decide whether such tribunal should be treated as a court within the meaning of the statute when there is no statutory definition of the term court?   John Paul Stevens  But if you concede that there are some tribunals that are not courts within the meaning of the statute, are you not conceding that the word court is inherently ambiguous?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But it's something less than the all-inclusive term, any court, in a literal sense.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Do you know any cases in which we've construed a statute narrowly on the ground that we're confident the prosecutor won't bring any such cases?   John Paul Stevens  But it's... it's been on the books for so long with very, very few prosecutions.  So it's one... it's not exactly an urgent question.  But it does seem to me if this... this problem had been brought to the attention of Congress, they would have defined the term court, and I don't... they haven't done that but probably because they didn't think of the problem.  And you can argue, well, they surely would have wanted to have this particular person prosecuted, but would they have wanted everyone with every foreign court all over the world.  That's the question.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You know, this is a very interesting case because there are three ways to answer the question of what is a court.  You can leave it up to us to do it, and that would be judicial legislation to fill in a hole in the statute.  You can have the executive do it, decide what case... what cases to prosecute, or if we should knock out this... interpret the statute in the... in a different way than you urge, Congress would then do it.  Now, which of the three is the better lawmaker on deciding which is the... what should the meaning of the word court be?  The executive, the legislature, or the judiciary?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, but it is pretty clear that Congress didn't really think about this problem.

John Paul Stevens  Well, but of course what the lower courts are doing may or may not be right as a matter of Florida law, but that's not before us really.   John Paul Stevens  Mr. Gornstein.     John Paul Stevens  Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.  Mr. Tillinghast.     Edward H. Tillinghast III  So, in conclusion, Your Honors, we submit that there are two... two approaches to affirming the Florida Supreme Court.  First is... is that it was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea without consent.  The second is that because of the nature of the statements, it was a complete failure of the advocacy process where the State's case was not tested in any way.  In fact, as I mentioned, there were 35 witnesses.  There were five very perfunctory questions asked such as what date was it and when did certain things occur.  There was not the material testing of the record to determine the truth, which is what is... is involved in the Sixth Amendment.  And none of... none of the challenges, that are pointed out in... to the facts in our brief ever came out because that there was no testing.  Simply we have an opening statement where counsel says the State will prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these events occurred.  Then we have virtually no cross examination.  We have no witnesses called by the State... excuse me... by... by the defendant throughout the entire guilt phase of the trial.  And in fact, at one point, the... the trial judge stopped asking... asking Mr. Corin if he wished to cross examine.  And then we have the closing statement where Mr. Corin stated that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that... that he is... Mr. Nixon was guilty of the crimes.  And all the while during that guilt phase, Mr. Nixon was not present in the courtroom.  So he had no ability to object to the opening or the closing statements because he wasn't here... there to hear them.  And further, as... as the record indicates, there are issues of... of Mr. Nixon's competency, that he's mentally retarded.  His own lawyer referred to him as nuts.  His own lawyer also referred to him as an ogre in his closing argument.  These are the types of statements, we would submit, are... even if they are not the functional equivalent of a guilty plea without consent, they... they substantially and completely destroy the advocacy process.  So there is no testing, and under Cronic, the Court should affirm also.  Thank you.   John Paul Stevens  Thank you, Mr. Tillinghast.  Mr. Lemieux, you have about 4 minutes left.     ",03-931X

John Paul Stevens  It was.  I didn't read it that way.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I'm sorry.  I want to be sure I follow you.  You say that somewhere on page 82 there is a finding that there was no hydrological connection?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  They don't find a--   John Paul Stevens  --I agree with that.  I'm asking you if they found there was no hydrological connection.   John Paul Stevens  But not on page 82.   John Paul Stevens  What page are you on?   John Paul Stevens  But I'm still puzzled--   John Paul Stevens  --by your answer to Justice--  [Laughter]  --Justice Kennedy.  What if there's no hydrological connection today, but there would be after you... after you built your project?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But it... would it be a sufficient reason to deny a permit based on the judgment that after the project is completed, there will be a... a hydrological connection?   John Paul Stevens  No.  It seems to me you could answer that yes or no.   John Paul Stevens  Perhaps you don't want to but--  [Laughter]   John Paul Stevens  But isn't it sort of foolish to say that we're concerned about pollution, but only if you... only if you catch it in advance?  That doesn't make sense because if the problem would arise when you did what you're seeking a permit to do, why shouldn't you be denied the permit?   John Paul Stevens  No, but my hypothesis is that we know it would happen, or they... they would find it would happen after the project is completed.  And it seems to me that... that that's what you should focus on rather than what's... you know, rather than what happens before.   John Paul Stevens  Of course, when we're talking about the scope of... of Federal power, we're not merely concerned with dumping refuse in the creek, but also deliberate attempts to poison the water system.

John Paul Stevens  He finds a gun when there really wasn't one.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Mr. Clement, following up on Justice Kennedy's thought, if we adhere to the strict language in Apprendi itself, as quoted below, any... solely on the facts reflected in the jury verdict or the plea bargain, that's... that establishes the maximum.  What percent of the total number of sentences that are imposed in the, by the Federal system today would violate that rule?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, let's look at the future and assume that in 97 percent of the cases which are plea bargains, you could agree on what the relevant facts are.  That certainly could be done.  And in the 3 percent that are trialed, it is my impression that a very small number of those actually involve violations of the Apprendi rule.  Is that correct?   John Paul Stevens  See, it's relevant because underlying all this is a question if the guidelines fail in toto, or do they only fail with respect to those relevant small number of cases in which there's a violation of the Apprendi rule?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  In raising the issue, it depends on what... the issue you describe.  A lot of people describe it as an issue when you just use the guidelines at all.  Do they raise an issue, involve it in a sentence over and above the amount that would be authorized by either the jury verdict or the plea bargain?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Do you think 65 percent of the cases do?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  They all, of course, involve a potential upward adjustment.  But do they all involve actual sentences above the amount that the jury verdict would have authorized?   John Paul Stevens  The thing that... I'm sorry, but I really, it's very important to me.  Raising an issue, the issue is always raised when there's a possibility of a higher sentence, but I don't think it's fair to assume that 65 percent of the sentences of tried cases actually resulted in sentences higher than what the jury verdict would have authorized.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It's potentially that every case does.  But if in fact, most sentences come within the maximum anyway, it's of course a serious problem in those cases, but system-wide, it's not nearly the problem that the figures you've mentioned suggest.   John Paul Stevens  Just consider the word court to mean jury.  Jury or a judge.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It just means that if a different procedure is followed, you'll reach precisely the same sentences the guidelines reached.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You think judges reach different results on factual issues than juries do?  Is that part of your submission?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But keep it simple because we're assuming that in most cases, there aren't a host of factors but usually just two or three, such as the drug quantity and did he... a gun.  Now in those where there's a fairly simple fact to identify, would it make any difference in the ultimate sentence that's imposed whether the jury finds it or the judge finds it?   John Paul Stevens  Keep to the bad example I've given you.  The gun and the drug quantity.  Why would it make a difference?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Would it make any difference?   John Paul Stevens  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And there's a difference in sentence depending on the on the amount of money that the fraud involved.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Mr. Clement can I... you don't have an awful lot of time left, and I want to ask you one rather important question, to me.  There's been a lot of talk about severability of the statute, and I can understand the concept that we'll only apply it in certain categories of cases.  But normally when I consider severability, I'm thinking of the text of a written statute.  Is there a particular provision of the sentencing guidelines that you think can be severed from the rest of the statute?

1,"John Paul Stevens  He sets the sentence within the range authorized by the jury's verdict.  That's the question.   John Paul Stevens  I'm not sure that I understand why you wouldn't have the same alternatives under your view.  Because is it not correct that if the, if the sentence... the change under consideration is a decrease, those findings should be made by a judge.  Whereas, if it's an increase, you'd say they have to be found by a jury.  So why don't you have the same possibility of a two-track system under your view?   John Paul Stevens  So you would say... you would say your proposal is closer to what Congress really wanted, because it would leave in place all of the sentences that would be commanded by the guidelines, but just require a different fact finder in some of the cases.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Could I interrupt for that?   John Paul Stevens  There's one thing that's running through my mind.  What if the defendant gets on the stand and testifies to a version of the events that the jury must have disbelieved in order to convict?  Could not the judge... in effect, he would be making the finding... he would say,  ""The jury has really found this fact, and, therefore, I can rely on it. ""   John Paul Stevens  How can you do that?  The statute that makes the guidelines mandatory applies to both upwards and downwards departures, so I have always had trouble knowing what provision of the statute anybody severs.  I can understand your saying that there's a bunch of unconstitutional applications of the statute, and you have to set aside the sentences in those particular cases, but I simply don't understand severing a single provision that covers both upward and downward departures.  How do you sever it?   John Paul Stevens  But that's the same, that's the same provision that allows departures of the same... by the same procedure.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It seems to me you're not severing a piece of a statute, you're just severing a bunch of applications of the statute you think are invalid.   John Paul Stevens  Correct.  I understand.   John Paul Stevens  And may I add this thought, that it seems to me, I don't know whether this is true; Mr. Clement and I had a dialogue that was inconclusive; I had been under the impression, perhaps erroneous, that in fact the number of unconstitutional departures if one follows Apprendi as being the constitutional rule, is actually a small percentage of the total, and if it should follow that only three, four, five, six percent of the sentences that have heretofore been imposed or will be imposed in the future would be unconstitutional, that's a pretty weak reason for saying the whole statute is unconstitutional on its face, or even in one provision of the statute.  It seems to me you just say,  ""Oh, okay, you can't impose those sentences in those three percent of the cases. ""  I don't know why that's a departure from our prior practice.   John Paul Stevens  No, my suggestion is everybody can be sentenced under the Guidelines; the only difference is that in three or four percent of the cases you may have to bring a jury in to get an enhanced sentence.

0,"John Paul Stevens  Of course, that means they comply with Lockett.  I want to ask you one question that goes back to your colloquy with Justice Souter and Justice Scalia.  Justice Scalia pointed out that the State has made a moral judgment on a certain state of facts, the death penalty shall be imposed and which you agreed with.  And that was true in the cases back in 1975 and '6.  There were some State statutes that mandated death based on the moral judgment of the State in certain circumstances.  I think one was a North Carolina statute.  Do you ask us to reexamine those cases?   John Paul Stevens  It... it does not rely on the proposition that there's a situation in which there's a mandated death penalty which is perfectly okay.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Of course, the aggravators... it would be permissible for a State to include the aggravators necessary to narrow the category in the definition of the crime itself.   John Paul Stevens  But you would say that if the State met that burden and there was no mitigating or no substantial mitigating evidence, it would be permissible to... for the State to mandate the death penalty.   John Paul Stevens  The answer is yes.   John Paul Stevens  And you think that's fully consistent with the North Carolina case.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, it... that's the way Justice Blackmun interpreted the majority, but the majority didn't quite say that because it said the burden on the defendant was to prove sufficient mitigation to justify something other than the death penalty.  And conceivably one could have met that burden with substantial mitigating evidence that came out even.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Under the majority's opinion... now, you're dead right about what Justice Blackmun said, but--   John Paul Stevens  --But you would agree that it would be consistent with the... the text of the majority opinion to say it really meant they have to prove enough mitigating evidence to make death the inappropriate sentence, which could be less than... even a 50/50 balance.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, that wouldn't be true if you amended the statute, would it?  If you... if they amended the statute to take the 50/50 problem out of it, which wouldn't seem to me all that difficult, you could still impose the death penalty on these other 12 people who haven't been tried.

""   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  General Kline, can I ask you this question?

Isn't that--   John Paul Stevens  --They're talking about a plural banking associations, not just plural branches of one association.

How we would have decided it is not before us.  We accept the jury's verdict.  What if the... on the merits of the underlying crimes, the South Carolina Supreme Court had written that kind of an opinion rather than there's overwhelming evidence of guilt?

It lacked that requirement of reliability to get over--   John Paul Stevens  But it's odd that they didn't say that.

Do you think there's a different possible approach between the two?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But your earlier point was we know that a whole lot of patents are not all that important.  But is it not fair to assume that when a patent can generate metering in this particular kind of situation, that it... that it's a likelihood that it has more power than the average patent?   John Paul Stevens  But if it's... if it is true, as your opponent says... and I don't know if it is or not... that you're able to get twice the price for the ink than you otherwise would get, does that... is that any evidence of market power?

And I'm just wondering if there's disagreement among economists, shall we take one view over the other?   John Paul Stevens  Can I ask you--   John Paul Stevens  --Can I ask you how far your position extends?  I think there's a good argument that if a patent is really a good patent, it doesn't really matter whether the patentee charges a very high royalty or gets a... reduces the royalty and gets profits out of the tied... tied product.  In your view, is the rule sound that if it is a monopoly in the tied product, that there is an antitrust problem?   John Paul Stevens  In... in the tying product.  Excuse me.  In the tying product.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I know that's all you're asking for--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --but I'm just wondering if it isn't... if it isn't the logical conclusion of your position that it really doesn't matter, even if there is a monopoly in the tying product.   John Paul Stevens  No, but I'm... I'm asking sort of an economic question rather than a legal question.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  If your position is all the economists say this is a lot of nonsense, I think maybe it's a lot of nonsense even if there's a monopoly in the tying product is what I'm suggesting.   John Paul Stevens  Well, it wouldn't be a new one.  It would be just following the old IBM case and all those cases.   John Paul Stevens  No, but that's the example they're saying it would be following.  It's not a brand new idea.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But your... your answer to Justice O'Connor is there should be no distinction even if there is evidence that there's a long term relationship, a requirements relationship, and an increase in price.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But isn't that also true even if there's monopoly power?  That's what... I really think it's a very interesting question as to whether it makes any difference whether the monopolist who happens to have a patent just charges high prices for product A or decides to charge a little less for product A and make hay out of product B.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No.  I understand it's not.  I'm just kind of curious about where we're going down... we're going down a new road in this whole area.

1,"John Paul Stevens  Well, is that correct?  I thought in most States, there has to be a statute that authorizes a non knock warrant.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And that most States do have such statutes.  And we got this case because Michigan chooses to go on on a separate path.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I ask this question?  As I understand it, the prosecutor conceded a violation of the knock and announce rule.   John Paul Stevens  And I'm just wondering.  In Michigan, since there's no adverse effect to it, do the prosecutors routinely concede that there's a violation because there's no point in litigating it I suppose?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So that if the issue arises, you can assume the prosecutor will always say, yes, we'll assume there was a violation.  There would be no reason not to assume that.   John Paul Stevens  So you'll never really litigate in Michigan how far they can go before they violate the rule.   John Paul Stevens  Let me just be sure I understand the hypothetical case, where, three times before, there had been warrants served, and, each time, the homeowner shot at the officer, the fourth time, they could go in without waiting.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I ask this?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I ask this question about the practice in Michigan?  Since People against Stevens and People against Vasquez have been decided, are there any cases, other than this one, in which a prosecutor has raised the knock and announce argument that got litigated all the way to the appellate court?   John Paul Stevens  So but there really is no incentive for the prosecutor to fight... argue about this anymore in Michigan, is there?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, it concedes there's a violation.   John Paul Stevens  So there's no point in litigating it.   John Paul Stevens  So it's a functional equivalent of conceding a violation in every case because there's simply no effective remedy here.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No effective remedy in the litigation itself.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Of course, there's always the possibility that the officer will be disciplined by his very zealous superior, I guess.   John Paul Stevens  But why would you bother making the argument?  The evidence can't be suppressed.  I don't understand why... why would there ever be any litigation over this issue in a criminal case?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And can you cite me any other example of a... a violation of the Fourth Amendment?  Maybe we shouldn't have held it's a violation.  I understand that argument.  Is there any other area of Fourth Amendment law in which the violation of the Fourth Amendment is not followed by a suppression ruling?   John Paul Stevens  It seems to me that your example it's... stomping up the stairs is like failing to knock and announce.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And so there should be a deterrent for the stomping up the stairs, and you've got no deterrent for the knock and announce.   John Paul Stevens  Mr. Salmons, may I ask you this... this question?  If you'd been the prosecutor in this case and you had... knew that the evidence would be suppressed if there were a constitutional violation, would you have conceded that there was a constitutional violation in this case?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes or no.   John Paul Stevens  So you would not have conceded.   John Paul Stevens  But you would not have conceded.  If you... if you thought there was a reasonable argument, you would not have conceded that there was a violation, would you?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, but you might have probable cause, but just not have the... have the warrant.  So, what is the difference between having probable cause to enter, but failing to get a warrant, and having a warrant, but failing to knock and announce?   John Paul Stevens  Is it your view the entry was lawful or unlawful, in this case?   John Paul Stevens  No.   John Paul Stevens  No--   John Paul Stevens  --that's not the question.  The actually... actual entry was lawful, yes?   John Paul Stevens  Oh, okay.   John Paul Stevens  I can understand the requirement there be causal connection.  Are there cases in which courts have held that there was a knock and announce violation, and there is a general remedy of exclusion, unless... except when there's a causal connection; but, in fact, the evidence was admitted because it was not causally connected to the entry?   John Paul Stevens  I mean, I can understand the hypothetical, but it seems to me it's really a hypothetical.   ",04-1360

John Paul Stevens  No, but that's a normal reading of the word, so that you... when you say a purchase or... it normally would be  ""in connection with the purchase or sale of securities by the party that litigates.

John Paul Stevens  Well, that's the only argument.   John Paul Stevens  But the... one of the differences... am I not correct, that at common law the prosecutor did not have absolute immunity?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Now does, but not at common law.   John Paul Stevens  Well, they're not totally identical because you didn't have the First Amendment interest involved in those cases, whereas you do have a First Amendment interest at stake here.   John Paul Stevens  But that doesn't--   John Paul Stevens  --Yes.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --a malicious prosecution claim.  You'd have a malicious prosecution claim.   John Paul Stevens  But, Mr. Kneedler, I understand your argument to be they should be treated just like a malicious prosecution claim, which is no distinction between a constitutional basis and a common... and just that he hated his brother in law.  I think you're saying they're the same.  That's what I understand Justice Scalia to be asking you.   John Paul Stevens  Which places no weight at all on the fact the Constitution is involved.   John Paul Stevens  That's how you'd get at least as much protection as if it was an ordinary malicious prosecution claim, but you don't get any more under your view.   John Paul Stevens  Mr. Kneedler, I know you're responding to Justice Breyer's question, but I think for purposes of our decision, we're not supposed to decide whether there was probable cause or not, but we're to give you the opportunity to prove there was if... if you win on your--   John Paul Stevens  --But that's a disputed issue, and we don't have to decide the probable cause issue.  Is that not correct?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But because the other side is arguing that even if there is probable cause, the burden shifts when they prove the retaliatory motive, and you have to prove that you would never... you made... you would have brought the prosecution even if there had been no retaliatory motive.  That's what we're arguing--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --And the question I would ask is why should this be different from a wrongful discharge case in which there's ample cause to discharge and the issue boils down to whether or not he would have been discharged anyway.  Why isn't it the same... same situation?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Wouldn't... wouldn't all those considerations justify a rule that makes the burden of proving the retaliatory motive very high, say, maybe it has to be by clear and convincing evidence or something like that?  But once you have it acknowledged... I don't know if they're really acknowledged here, but there's strong evidence of retaliatory motive... why shouldn't the burden shift just on that, on the basis of that proof?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And if you had a--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --if you had a heavy burden of proof at that stage of the proceeding, wouldn't that protect the interests that mainly concern you?   John Paul Stevens  Mr. McCartan.     Patrick F. McCartan  --If the... if the defendant in that case had established evidence tending to show the essential elements of the claim, it would present a question for the court, but I think the court would use the admission against interest as a basis for paying no attention to such--   John Paul Stevens  Thank you very much, Mr. McCartan.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And on that, they say you don't have a cause of action unless you're able to prove an absence of probable cause.   John Paul Stevens  Well, but there are two questions in the cert petition and it's the second one that's the qualified immunity issue, and the first one is whether there's a cause of action.   John Paul Stevens  Which opinion was that?  I missed that.   John Paul Stevens  Which opinion are you talking about?  I missed it... missed it.   John Paul Stevens  Okay.   John Paul Stevens  But would it... would it have been a complete defense?  Suppose the prosecutor, who is immune, gets on the witness stand and says, well, I know all about this... the First Amendment stuff, but I was going to bring this prosecution anyway because it seemed to me there was a serious crime here.  That's all he says.  Wouldn't that be the end of the case?   John Paul Stevens  But... but the question is the motivation for his decision to bring the case.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I'm not either.   John Paul Stevens  May I ask this question?  Maybe I should ask Mr. Kneedler.

John Paul Stevens  That's fine.  Mr. Schaerr.     Gene C. Schaerr  Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:  In the decision below, the Tenth Circuit stuck... struck down an election rule that has been adopted by nearly half the States pursuant to their authority under Article I, section 4 to prescribe the manner of holding elections.  In so doing, the Tenth Circuit in our view made three fundamental errors that I'd like to address briefly.  The first was the Tenth Circuit's per se approach to determining whether the alleged burdens here are severe.  That's an extremely important issue, of course, because to our knowledge, this Court has never invalidated a State election regulation under the First Amendment without first finding that the burden at issue was severe.  But instead of looking at that issue closely, the Tenth Circuit, at page 15 of its decision, simply assumed that a severe burden necessarily arises from any regulation that, quote, restricts the options of parties seeking to define the scope of their associational rights.  Now, one would have thought that it's for courts to determine the scope of a... of a party's associational rights rather than... than the party itself.  But in all events, that was the sum total of the Tenth Circuit's analysis on the... on the question of severe burden.  Now, the respondents cite that finding, but they... they make no attempt to defend that approach.  They argue instead that the burden here is severe because, at bottom, Oklahoma requires a Republican or Democrat, wishing to vote in the LPO primary, to... to disaffiliate from the party 2 months in advance.  But that burden is no more severe than others that this Court has found constitutionally acceptable.  The burden on voters, for example, is less severe than the burden this found... this Court found acceptable in Rosario, which was a... a requirement, as Mr. Poe mentioned, that voters, wishing to vote in a... in a party's primary, register as a member of that party some 8 to 11 months in advance.  The burden on the party is also less severe than a burden that this Court found acceptable in Burdick which is that a party wishing to qualify for a primary ballot gather the necessary signatures, in that case 1 percent of the voting population, 5 months before the primary.  It's 2 months here.  And it's also similar to a burden that all the members of this Court found acceptable in Burdick, which was... which was a requirement that a candidate wishing to run on a nonpartisan primary ballot collect the necessary signatures about 2 months before the primary.  And the message of these decisions... and I think it's fair to say the holding in Burdick... is that requiring participants in elections to take action a few months sooner or a few weeks sooner than they might prefer does not amount to a severe burden.  And that's the only real burden here.  The LPO has to--   ",04-37XX

Would he--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --And it'd be true if there were 20 competitors too?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Why?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I imagine the damages would be less, but why would it be any different analytically?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And then change it one other way.  Say, instead of defrauding New York, they defrauded the landlord and... and got a rent free office space, and that cut down their costs.  Would the competitors have a cause of action then?

0,"John Paul Stevens  But does the Givhan case fall within that?   Edwin S. Kneedler  --Yes.  Yes, it does.  But all the Court addressed in Givhan was the question of whether, if you take your concerns not publicly to the newspaper, but express them to the... in that case, the principal, that you don't lose first amendment protection.  But the Court did not address the question of whether those comments were within the scope of the employee's duties.  And I think a reading of lower court's decision in Givhan indicates that they were not.  She was an English teacher, and she was commenting to the principal about employment practices at the school.  That would not have been within the scope of her employment.  And then--   John Paul Stevens  And you're suggesting--   Edwin S. Kneedler  --in the course of those activities.   John Paul Stevens  --that a remark made internally could not provide the basis for discipline, but saying exactly the same thing publicly could.  I mean... or vice versa.   Edwin S. Kneedler  Well, if it's made publicly in the capacity as a citizen, assuming the public... it isn't a speech that he's making in the course of his duties... if he writes something to the press, he's speaking in his capacity as a citizen.  That doesn't mean that it would be constitutionally protected; it simply means that you get to step two of the Pickering balancing, because he's not carrying--   John Paul Stevens  Well, I'm assuming--   Edwin S. Kneedler  --out the job duties.   John Paul Stevens  --a case in which it would be constitutionally protected.  But you're saying if he says it publicly... assuming we pass the balancing test... that if he said the same thing to his boss directly internally, no protection.   Edwin S. Kneedler  No, that... at least not if it's part of his job duties.  And I would think--   John Paul Stevens  Which is a--   Edwin S. Kneedler  --ordinarily in that--   John Paul Stevens  --rule that would sort of encourage people to go public rather than--   Edwin S. Kneedler  --No, I mean--   John Paul Stevens  --exhaust their internal remedies.   Edwin S. Kneedler  --Two things about that.  When he's saying it internally, he's doing his job.  When he's going externally, he may be violating office policies.   John Paul Stevens  Do you contend--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --that his statement was false?  Do you contend the speech was false?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes, but the disposition by the... I mean, his grievance by the hearing examiner was that there was no retaliation.  He assumed that the speech was proper and there was no inefficiency or misconduct on the part of the speaker.   John Paul Stevens  And, in my understanding, that was the only defense that was made for the charge, that, ""We didn't retaliate"".  There was no claim that the speech was improper in any way.  Am I wrong on that?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yeah.   John Paul Stevens  So, we assume, for purposes of our case, that what he said was totally accurate and did not, itself, provide the basis for saying he was incompetent or something of that... like that.   John Paul Stevens  Can I ask you one--   John Paul Stevens  --No.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You would give--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --greater protection to a public speech than to a comment from... on the job from... to one's superior.  Can you give me an example of a statement that would provide... be entitled to complete first amendment protection if made in a speech, but could justify a discharge if made face to face with your employer?   John Paul Stevens  Could you give me an example of a statement that would be protected in a public speech, but, if made privately to your superior, could provide the basis for a discharge?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Which was--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --protected.   John Paul Stevens  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You're not--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --responding to my question.  My question is, Can you give me an example of a statement that would be entitled to protection if made in a public speech, but could be a basis for discharge if made face to face?   John Paul Stevens  No, I'm--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --asking you if--   John Paul Stevens  --what he says privately could the basis for a discharge.  Surely, he couldn't be discharged for what you just described.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But, Mr. Himmelfarb, in that case he could also be fired if he made the statement in a speech, could he not?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Right.   John Paul Stevens  But could he not be fired if the scenario you just described as--   John Paul Stevens  --It seems to me odd that the employee has greater protection if he goes outside the regular channels and makes a speech than if he does... he goes right to his superior and says,  ""I think this is what's wrong and should be remedied.

They did, in fact, extend the time because they didn't issue it.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, but the opinion of Judge Suhrheinrich...

1,"John Paul Stevens  May I ask this question, General?   John Paul Stevens  There are really two kinds of Batson problems as I see it.  There are some cases where the prosecutor is... just is deliberately keeping African Americans off the jury, and there... there's no question there's a violation there.  But I'm wondering if there isn't another category where persons are unconscious of their own subconscious bias and not realizing that they themselves have an unconscious fear that perhaps an African American might not be a sympathetic juror.  Would that kind of failure to really identify the problem within the prosecutor's own conception of the case... would that be a Batson violation in your view?   John Paul Stevens  If, for example, the judge saw that over a period of time, a particular prosecutor had hunches about jurors over and over again and they just happened to be black most of the time.  That would not justify a... a Batson challenge.   John Paul Stevens  But... but she's totally convinced of the good faith of the prosecutor.  And I'm not suggesting bad faith.   John Paul Stevens  But just realizes this person has an unconscious bias that shows up in the... in the pattern of challenges.  Would that be a justified challenge?   John Paul Stevens  Right.   John Paul Stevens  And if the trial judge determined--   John Paul Stevens  --based... based on the history of several trials and so forth, that this prosecutor unconsciously had this hunch with respect to black jurors but not others, that would be a sufficient basis for a challenge.   John Paul Stevens  Except in this very case, one gets the impression that the prosecutor was pretty confused, but maybe she was acting in good faith.   John Paul Stevens  May I ask just a... kind of a background question?  I noticed the judge pointed out after ruling that he was under... he...

0,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Chan, can I ask you a question, based on your experience?  I'm sure you've had a lot of experience in this area.  This particular claim was about six months beyond the statute of limitations when he asked to relate back.  It would seem to me that that would normally be the case, something about that amount of time would be an issue, because it takes time to process these, and they had to get counsel appointed.  And counsel comes in and wants to amend the petition, usually, I suppose, in a pro se petition.  Is it... would I be correct in assuming that normally in cases of this kind we're talking about a delay of only a few months?   John Paul Stevens  Well, no, normally... the issue of whether or not there should be... the petition may have the benefit of the relation back normally is... involves a delay of not more than, say, five or six months, in a normal case.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You still lose the benefit of the statute.  You lose an important right.  But I'm just wondering about how serious a problem it is.   John Paul Stevens  It seems to me that the reason for the... for defining the relation back the way the rule does is interest in fairness to the Defendant you don't want to let him be surprised; whereas, your claim, as I understand, is really based entirely on the interest in finality and repose.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, but the definition--   John Paul Stevens  --in the rule is really to protect the interest in fairness, because interest in repose is always the same.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, assume it's not Abbott.  Just say I come up with a novel method that's not covered by the patent that I can get the assay results.  And so a doctor says, would you test the blood under your unpatented, novel method and tell me what the results are?   John Paul Stevens  And I do that and then the doctor looks at it and says I think you've got a vitamin B deficiency, has he infringed your patent?

John Paul Stevens  General Clement--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --General Clement, before you go there, I want to question you about your distinction between Dr. Kevorkian and a doctor who uses controlled substances.  Why could not the Attorney General treat Dr. Kevorkian's conduct as conduct that may threaten the public health and safety, and seek his... cancellation of his license?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, he--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --he can rely--   John Paul Stevens  --on things like prior convictions, other things unrelated to a specific transaction.

I mean, the distributor knows the fuel is going to be resold to the United States... does he have an exemption from the tax, because he knows what's going to happen to it, or does he have to pay the tax, or accept the obligation to pay the tax, and then--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --subtract, later on?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I couldn't either.   John Paul Stevens  May I ask... excuse me.   John Paul Stevens  May I ask you what the--   John Paul Stevens  --may I ask you a question about the Federal exemption?  In your view, is that made available at the time of the initial purchase by the distributor, or does he have to, in effect, claim a credit later on?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  It... that way it works, in practice, Your Honor, is... and their form is in the back of the red brief... is that the distributor writes down the number of gallons received, and writes down the number of gallons sold to the United States, nets that out, and pays the tax on the net, so that it's... it's essentially done at the... at the same time.   John Paul Stevens  So that he... his obligation to sell the gas is... arises at the same time as his purchase.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  I'm not sure his obligation to do so, but the form is due on the 25th of the month... of the next month.  And so--   John Paul Stevens  And it shows both what they resell to the United States and what they acquired.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Correct, Your Honor.  It shows gallons received, gallons exported, gallons sold to the United States.   John Paul Stevens  And let me ask you this question, too, on that subject.  Do you think that the exemption that the State allows for resales to the United States is constitutionally compelled?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  Your Honor, I think the answer to that is yes, under our theory of the case, but no, under their theory of the case.  The exemption to the United States--   John Paul Stevens  And it's no under our--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --is constitutionally--   John Paul Stevens  --our precedent, I think, isn't it?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --I'm sorry?   John Paul Stevens  It's no, under our precedent.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  Well, it depends, Your Honor, on whether the legal incidence is on the United States or whether the incidence is on the seller.  Under this--   John Paul Stevens  But is it--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --the United States--   John Paul Stevens  --constitutionally compelled to do so?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --It's... it is, Your Honor, in this sense.  It comes in, in two situations.  First, it is... the Constitution and the Federal preemption doctrine prohibit discrimination.  And so, it is, in that sense.  But it also goes to the strength of the State interest here.  The State has not only... has accommodated the out of State interest, it has also accommodated the in State Government interests, other than the tribe.  It gives 30 to 40 percent of the fuel revenues to counties and to cities for roads.  Every other sovereign is accommodated here except for the tribe, and we think that's exactly what Federal law prohibits and why the strength of the tribal interest here, and the tribe's interest in imposing the tax to fix reservation roads, to advance that Federal interest, is exactly what deserves protection.   John Paul Stevens  But your--   John Paul Stevens  --your claim wouldn't disappear if they decided to tax all these other sovereigns.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  I'm sorry, Your Honor?

But the... in 1996, when they made the offset available against Social Security payments, they didn't enact a 10 year statute of limitations; they changed subsection, I think, (b) to (d) and said the 10 year provision is retained.  And when the 10 year provision was first put in... I mean, when the exception for student loans was made, in 1991, you had a statute that had a 10 year period for everything except student loan recovery.  And it seems to me that if you look at the 1996 statute as saying,  ""We're going to allow offsets against Social Security. ""  under the same scheme that was enacted in 1991, because we had just amended the 10 year provision to preserve it... they preserved the 10 year provision... that they seem to me to be preserving it in a statute that made this distinction between student loans and all other offsets.  Is--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --It isn't as though they enacted, for the first time, an authority to offset Social Security and, in that statute, said,  ""And... but, by the way, there's a 10 year period of limitations here.

John Paul Stevens  It seems to me that there is a reasonable basis for assuming Congress might have thought that student loans should not have a 10 year bar if you're going to collect from Social Security, because most Social Security payments won't accrue until many, many years... much more than 10 years after the student loan default.

In subsection (a) of 190.3, it says that the trier of fact ""shall"" take into account any of the following factors, if relevant.  And one of those is the existence of any special circumstance found to be true, pursuant to 190.1.  And under 190.1, one of the special circumstances is number 14,  ""heinous, atrocious, or cruel.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So, they were... they were directed to take into... they ""shall"" take into account an invalid factor.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, but the... number 14 clearly is not mitigating.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Because the underlying facts are already before the jury, and they can make their own judgment about them.   John Paul Stevens  See, one of the... one of the things that concerns me about this case... unlike Zant, most of the cases in which we have found the label of aggravating... immaterial... or findings like prior criminal histories... robbery, or something like... but whenever a pejorative factor of this kind has been found, we've generally found it did tilt the scales a little bit on the... on the... in favor of death.

1,"John Paul Stevens  I didn't understand one of your answers.  Supposing that today the management does not know of the prior discrimination.

Would there be liability or not?   John Paul Stevens  I thought you said the other.  That's why I was--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --Let me ask this question.  Supposing in the annual review before a promotion is concerned the officer making the recommendation was instructed not only to decide what increase would be appropriate but also to review past history and decide whether or not the employee was being paid fairly in a nondiscriminatory basis and that was part of the assignment.  Would you have a case if that were the case?   John Paul Stevens  You couldn't rely on the past history in that situation?   John Paul Stevens  Because I think that's sort of what Justice...

0,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Nager, can I test your theory with a hypothetical question?  Supposing 20 years ago, there was an actual written policy statement, we pay women 20 percent less than men.  And that was written up and everybody knew it.  And then nothing changed for the next 20 years, and the person then sued today.  Would she be... and there was no intent to do anything, this is just the way it's always been.  Would she have a cause of action?   John Paul Stevens  If present intent was merely to do what we have always done, you have to go back 20 years to find out that what we have always done is the result of a policy decision made 20 years ago that we can hire women at a less expense than men so we will continue to pay the same rate.  Would the per paycheck rule apply to that case?   John Paul Stevens  But there is a slight difference in that you're focused on whether discrimination occurred within the 180-day period.  And if I understand you correctly, discrimination would have occurred during the 180-day period if the employer knew of the policy that I described, because then he would be knowingly paying less.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I thought your answer to Justice Alito made that point.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But the question of whether just knowing that that's a source of the policy would be a gender-related reason.   John Paul Stevens  Well, in my hypothetical there was a policy established 20 years ago, a 20 percent differential, never been changed.  And the only question that would differ, in some cases the employer knows about it and in some others he doesn't.   John Paul Stevens  Well, what his reason is, this is always the way we did it.  That's his reason.   John Paul Stevens  But you could if the person making the decision was aware of the discriminatory policy.   John Paul Stevens  But you're changing the hypothetical.  My hypothetical was simply a pay case.   John Paul Stevens  You're saying, I think contrary to your colleague if I remember correctly, that even if the employer knew of the 20 percent differential policy established 20 years ago, it could still carry it into effect today.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Is there uncertainty on the basic proposition that these greenhouse gases contribute to global warming.

John Paul Stevens  May I ask you on that question, if we turn to the statute, to Section 201, there's reference to ""shall regulate"" if in the judgment of the administrator there is a for real danger and so forth.

And I'm interested in what your position on that is.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  To me, just reading the text of the statute is a little ambiguous.  I'm not entirely clear, but it seems to me that just reading that statute, I got the impression that Congress thought that the administrator had a duty to make a judgment when there was enough evidence out there that people were concerned about it and so forth, that there would be a duty there, but you think not?

""  Now, does that state a violation of the Sherman Act?   John Paul Stevens  It does not?   John Paul Stevens  I mean, you could leave out everything before plaintiff, the part you quoted, that's not part of the declaration in the sentence.  But the sentence itself alleges a garden variety of the violation of the Sherman Act, doesn't it?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It's got the language of the Sherman Act, a conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their respective telephone and/or high speed markets.  That's not in the Sherman Act, that's a description of the alleged conspiracy in this case.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But Mr. Kellogg, that's not a legal conclusion, it's an allegation of fact that there was an agreement to prevent competitive entry into respective markets.  There are dozens of antitrust complaints that are no more specific than that.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Of course, that may be true on summary judgment, you may be dead right on the merits, but are you telling me that an allegation that the defendants have agreed not to compete with one another is not a statement of fact?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, what if they said they agreed in writing not to compete with one another, would that be sufficient?  Or if they have agreed orally not to compete with one another, would that be sufficient?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  If they said they have agreed orally not to compete with one another, would that be a statement of fact, an allegation of fact?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Then why did you leave the words orally out?  Why is it not a statement, allegation of fact?

John Paul Stevens  They make it fairly clear that they may only have the evidence of parallel conduct that you describe, and that may not be sufficient, and maybe for that reason, you get a summary judgment.  But how you can say this is not an allegation of fact, I find mind-boggling.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It's clear it's not sufficient to prove it, but is it admissible evidence?

1,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Richards, can I ask you this question.  Supposing that you were allowed to have discovery and each chief executive of the defendant companies got on the stand and said: I never talked to my, my competitors at all, I never seriously considered competing in the other, other company's territory for the reasons set forth in the, in your opponent's brief on the merits here.  We never did agree.  And you're able to prove the things you've alleged in the agreement.  Would the, would it be appropriate to enter summary judgment against you on that testimony if you had no evidence of a specific agreement?

Would you not lose on summary judgment?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Prove what you have alleged, in effect, except for the key allegation of agreement among the competitors.  If you had no other evidence of that agreement, would you win.   John Paul Stevens  You mean the mere fact that you have alleged something is against their self-interest is enough to make an issue of fact on whether it's against their self-interest?   John Paul Stevens  They could have gone on the stand, they gave all the reasons in the red briefs... or the blue briefs in this case, that say it's not against their self-interest; you'd say that would be a jury question?

0,"John Paul Stevens  But, Mr. Frey, let me ask you a question.  Suppose this was a criminal case and the defendant was being punished for crime A and the judge in working out the sentence realizes he also committed crimes B, C, D, and E.  He could take those into account in determining the extent of the sentence given for crime A.  Why isn't that similar?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And if there was a second... the same defendant got convicted again for crime X.  At that sentencing the judge could again take into account the harm to defendants B, C, and D.   John Paul Stevens  That's not the same harm if it's a different defendant or a different plaintiff in the second case.  You're punishing him for the harm to be this time, and you can... just as in a criminal case, why can't you in both cases take into account that, the harm to the class, to the public at large?   John Paul Stevens  Isn't there a distinction between actual harm to others and the risk of harm?  Supposing a defendant fired a machine gun into a crowd of people.   John Paul Stevens  And he killed one, at least one.  And that one sued and said: I want extra punitive damages because all these other people were subjected to the same risk.  Wouldn't that be a proper consideration?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Would it be a proper consideration even if a second person brought the same action?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But you're not asking to recover for the actual harm to the others.  You're saying there was a general risk of harm to many, many people, which is similar to what we have here.  We don't know whether they're harmed or not, but that can be taken into account in fixing the ultimate verdict.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Isn't the time to determine what to do with the second lawsuit is when the second lawsuit is brought?

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And is it also true that the part the Chief Justice quoted from 199(a), it seems to me that could be an argument that you should take into account the extent of harm to others, but it does not seem to me to be an argument that you can punish on.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  They are actually divisions, in effect, of the national bank itself?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  At least they are not separate corporate subsidiaries.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes, but it is true, is it not, that as long as this mortgage company was a subsidiary of a holding company rather than the bank itself, the State would have done the visiting, the visitorial power, whereas once they changed the Federal Government assumed that responsibility?   John Paul Stevens  Well, as your co-counsel pointed out, previously this very company was a subsidiary of a holding company that also owned the bank, and at that time it was exclusively regulated by Michigan.   John Paul Stevens  And the change in the corporate structure is the sole basis for saying now it's exclusively regulated by the OCC?

John Paul Stevens  Let me ask this question.  It seems to me that there are two separate parts to the waiver issue.  One, did he intend to say I don't want to put on any mitigating evidence?  But then the second part of the question is, was that statement made knowingly and voluntarily, just as a guilty plea or something like that has to be.

John Paul Stevens  What do you say about his hypothetical involving Democrats versus Republicans?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, he says, well, this is content discrimination.  Is that--   John Paul Stevens  --Well, but it's content in the sense that only some speech has to be affirmatively authorized.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Can I just go back to, you mentioned my question.   John Paul Stevens  Your point of your answer to his hypothetical is, well, the viewpoint discrimination would be impermissible, but the content discrimination is permissible?   ",05-1589
0,"John Paul Stevens  May I ask this question on your overinclusive, or underinclusive rather, argument?  Supposing the statute was broader and said the union may not use any non-member agency fee collections for any non-germane purpose at all without affirmative consent?  Would that solve all the constitutional problems?   John Paul Stevens  Could you just tell me yes or no, and then explain?   John Paul Stevens  At least insofar as your argument under inclusiveness, the answer would have to be that was, that statute would be okay.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I'm talking about a statute that the individuals say I don't want to spend any more money, give any more money to the union than I absolutely have to.  And the legislature decides to protect the right, that right by saying you cannot use agency sock fees for any non-germane purpose.  What's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  If that's perfectly constitutional, this is a fortiori okay.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And it's less of a burden on the union and there's less protection to the employee.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So it's a First Amendment right that is waived by failing to make a timely objection.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It's gone under your theory.   ",05-1589
0,"John Paul Stevens  Can I ask this question about the shopping center.  Wouldn't your case be exactly the same if the shopping center incident had not occurred?   John Paul Stevens  So that we really don't have to get distracted by the shopping center?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, isn't the speed also relevant to the likelihood that... that running into a car at that speed would cause the death of a driver?   John Paul Stevens  Isn't it a fair high probability that if you hit someone at that speed that there will be something, either death or serious injury as a result?   John Paul Stevens  Well, do you contend that an officer can always use deadly force to stop a high-speed driver who's creating this kind of a risk?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Running into him with a high probability that he'll get killed.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Wasn't that acknowledged in the district court, in the trial court?   John Paul Stevens  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But the jury might find that it was deadly force.   John Paul Stevens  And do you conclude that the jury could not find that it was deadly force?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, but is your... is it your view that a jury could not find on these facts that there was deadly force?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Does a police officer have any obligation in a situation like this to consider other alternatives, and if so what other alternatives might have been available to this officer?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And even with letting him go, isn't it possible they could get other roadblocks up ahead or get other people involved in the attempt to catch him?   John Paul Stevens  Isn't it true that there's no traffic on the road at that particular time?   John Paul Stevens  Well, in that circumstance why wouldn't he just consider discontinuing the chase?   John Paul Stevens  Would that have been likely if the officer had discontinued the chase?   John Paul Stevens  Yes.  But that was while he was being chased, right?  Before being chased he hadn't done any of this.  He was going 72 miles an hour in a 55-mile zone, isn't that right.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No but if you're thinking of the likelihood of harm if they discontinued the chase, is it not reasonable to assume he might go back to going 72 miles an hour in a 55-mile zone?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  There isn't a question.  There is a question of whether it justifies the use of deadly force, to prevent this... this situation.   John Paul Stevens  What if they knew there were drugs in the car that he would dispose of if he had got caught.  Would that justify this using deadly force?   John Paul Stevens  I'm rather clear it would not, isn't it?  Because that would be no more serious than the crime in Garner, would it?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I just make this one point?  Is it correct that the issue is whether it's reasonable or is the issue whether a jury could find it unreasonable?   INTERRUPTING ",05-1631
1,"John Paul Stevens  Let me just ask this question.  In trying to assess the likelihood of harm to innocent people who would be hurt by this by this guy driving so fast, is that, do we measure it by assuming that the chase will continue?  Or do we measure it by assuming that the chase would be discontinued?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Just as we did in Garner?   John Paul Stevens  If it were... clear that a jury could find that there would be no unreasonable risk to innocent motorists if they discontinued the chase... assume that's a possible finding.  If that were true, would there be a duty to discontinue the chase?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You're saying there is a duty not to use deadly force.   John Paul Stevens  It is certainly the case that if there is going to be a, a risk of deadly harm to innocent third parties, there would be a duty to discontinue the chase rather kill him.  But you don't seem to buy that.   INTERRUPTING ",05-1631
1,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Katyal, will you help me?  Where is the conspiracy charge in the papers?   John Paul Stevens  Okay, thank you very much.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I ask this question about the charge?  The charge is not just conspiracy in the abstract, it's conspiracy to do specific things, one of which is attacking civilians and civilian objects.  And is it clear that the commission would not have... a military commission would not have jurisdiction to try a conspiracy to armed civilians in a war zone, for example?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I ask--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --this question?  Supposing the charge had been slightly amended.  Instead of saying,  ""The criminal purpose, and conspired and agreed with Osama bin Laden to commit the following offenses. ""  it said,  ""It and Osama bin Laden attempted to... aided and abetted in committing the following offenses. ""  Would it then be... violate the laws of war?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, the specific offenses are attacking civilians and attacking civilian objects.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And then--   John Paul Stevens  --what if the trial judge who looked at the indictment or ruling on a motion to dismiss the indictment, or its equivalent at this time... said,  ""Well, I'm going to construe these words ""conspired or agreed"" as the substantial equivalent of ""aiding and abetting"". ""  Would that let the charge stand?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But the language is ""conspired and agreed with"".  And ""agreed with"" is pretty close to ""tried to do it himself"".   ",05-184X
0,"John Paul Stevens  But let me just ask this question, Mr. Clement.  What sources of law have the commissions generally enforced over the years, beginning with George Washington and so forth?  Just Army regulations or American law or foreign law?  What are the basic sources of law that they can enforce?   John Paul Stevens  And what we have here is enforcement of the laws of war.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  If... just one hypothetical.  Assume that the laws of war do not prohibit conspiracy.  Just assume... I know you disagree with it.  Could the President, by his action, add conspiracy as a triable offense by a commission?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, if--   John Paul Stevens  --It's easy if it is a war crime.  I'm trying to wrestle with the question of, If we concluded that it were not, and just... and I'm asking... can the question add an additional crime that the commission could try?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You think he could.   John Paul Stevens  So, the basic position you're asserting is that we have... that the... this commission intends to try a violation of the laws of war.  And do the laws of war then have any application to the procedures that they have to follow?   John Paul Stevens  But, Mr. Clement--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --if you assume that the laws of war apply, and perhaps the treaty applies, isn't the issue whether this is a ""group of people"", on the one hand, or a ""regularly constituted court"", on the other?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, they argue very strenuously that this is really just a ""group of people""--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --because it's not a ""regularly constituted court"" within the meaning of the treaty.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes.   John Paul Stevens  May I ask--   John Paul Stevens  --May I just ask this, to clarify?  When they do take some jurisdiction of some habeas corpus claims, do you defend that, in part, as a permissible exercise of the power to suspend the writ, or do you say it is not a suspension of the writ?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, it can't be both.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, that--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --that's your position, they did not suspend the writ.  You're not arguing that it's a justifiable suspension of the writ.   John Paul Stevens  Okay.   John Paul Stevens  And there was a footnote dicta.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But I don't--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --think, Mr. Clement, the 200 years have approved of his adding additional crimes under the law of war.  I mean, he has never... I don't think we have ever held that the President can make something a crime which was not already a crime under the law of war.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And one--   John Paul Stevens  --of the issues is whether he's done that here--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --I think.   John Paul Stevens  If you're right on that, you're right on the ultimate question, too.   ",05-184X
0,John Paul Stevens  Do you think there's any constitutional difficulty with the preemption provision in this statute?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You can make a contract preempt State law.  Is there any precedent for that?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You don't have Boyle for that.   John Paul Stevens  I didn't think Boyle went that far.   ,05-200X
1,"John Paul Stevens  May... may I ask this?  Because I think your example overlooks the fact that at least your opponent claims that the Blue Cross contract provision would preempt the New York law that denies your client recovery for health benefits.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I think that would be their answer to your example.   John Paul Stevens  Well, if we... if we think Congress can provide that a contract provision would preempt a State law, it seems to me the example you've given is the precise example that that statute was intended to cover.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But if... if it does, it would eliminate the lack of uniformity on which you rely.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, but it affects the amount that your client can recover.  And they would say that they... because it assumes an absence of... it assumes a payment by the carrier, and under... I... I think they would take the position that they have, in fact, the... they have not, in fact, paid that insurance cost.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I'm not stating it very well, but I--   John Paul Stevens  --No. But the defendant would say, we don't have to pay those damages because they're covered by insurance.  And the response would be, well, they're not... they... they are only covered by insurance if they can be reimbursed.  I don't want to take up too much of your time on this.   John Paul Stevens  Yes, but this is a claim for $150,000 out of a settlement of $3 million or $4 million.   John Paul Stevens  What was your defense on the merits?   John Paul Stevens  Yes.   INTERRUPTING ",05-200X
0,"John Paul Stevens  May I ask?  I'm a little puzzled by the... the questioning.  Doesn't everyone agree that the predominant motive in all the districts was political?  You agree to that, don't you?   John Paul Stevens  And you don't agree that that necessarily makes it valid, that that's necessarily a defense to section 2.   John Paul Stevens  And... and the problem with section... with district 23, under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, is not the motivation.  It's the results that have changed.  Isn't that correct?   John Paul Stevens  And the question under the district court's opinion is whether the political motive was an adequate defense to what would otherwise be a violation of section 2.  Is that correct?   John Paul Stevens  Before you do that, may I just ask one short question?   John Paul Stevens  You've mainly attacked the plan as a whole in your briefs.  And I'm wondering.  I often look at particular districts, as you may know.  Are there residents of districts 23, district 24 that are plaintiffs?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But they're not identified easily--   John Paul Stevens  May I interrupt you just with one... one question on district 23?  Regardless of what the intent of the parties was, I'm just wondering why is the district court's finding on intent relevant to the section 2 issue when the test under section 2 is results?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So that even if the intent was primarily political, it would still violate section 2.   INTERRUPTING ",05-204X
1,"John Paul Stevens  But may I ask, General Cruz, are you talking about replacing the court-ordered map or the preceding Democrat gerrymandered map?   John Paul Stevens  Yes, but you don't think it really perpetuated the same degree of gerrymandering that was present in the earlier map, do you?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I'm asking you.   John Paul Stevens  Do you think it did?  Do you think--   John Paul Stevens  --the court-ordered map is just as bad as the Democratic map?   John Paul Stevens  But is your opponent correct in saying that in six of those districts, the Democrat won even though the district was majority Republican?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Does that sound like a gerrymander?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I ask you this question?  Assume you're correct that as a whole the plan is well-justified and makes gains and so forth.  Does that necessarily mean that every district within the... the plan is immune from constitutional attack?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I understand.   John Paul Stevens  And the... the next question I wanted to ask you is that if it is possible there can be a single-district challenge, what is the justification for the... the cracking of district 24, which was a majority Democratic district before, into five different districts, none of which would elect a Democrat.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But is it... is it defended by anything other than political motivation?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I mean in district 24.   John Paul Stevens  General Cruz, could I ask you another district-specific question?  Because I want to get it on the table and let you explain it to me.  Focusing on district 23 for a moment, assuming for the moment... and I... I know you probably disagree with this but... that the results of the redrawing of district 23 violated section 2, would you say that it would be a defense to that violation that the motivation was actually non-racial but purely political?   John Paul Stevens  Not a defense.  And the second question for me is that if there were a violation in district 23 of section 2, could it be cured by creating a district... the district farther to the east.  I forget the number.  25 I guess it was.  Would that be a cure in your... in your judgment?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Given what the Court said in Shaw II.   John Paul Stevens  Right.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Except for the fact the district court really didn't find a violation in section 2.  They didn't quite, as I'm suggesting, say, well, given a violation on section 2, can we cure it and have a defense by what we do in... in district 25.  And I don't think De Grandy is an answer to that, and I'm not quite sure whether you said yes or no on my question.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes.   John Paul Stevens  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So the argument... the question then would be whether district 25 is a wholly different area from district 23.   John Paul Stevens  But isn't that somewhat inconsistent with the decision to reshape the district?  Why did they do it then?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  General Cruz, if you've finished your answer... I didn't want to interrupt you, but that makes... reminds me of a question I wanted to answer you because... ask you, rather, because you make a very persuasive argument in your brief, which I found very helpful, that the... a State should be able to correct a prior gerrymander by... for... with political motivations.  I would like you to comment on this suggestion.  Supposing we said they have an absolute right to do that with one caveat, that any new district has to be more compact... no more... no less compact than its predecessor, wouldn't that avoid all sorts of problems?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  We have... we have quite a history, as you just identified in your response to Justice Kennedy, of being concerned about particularly grotesque shapes, and that's why they developed these tests of compactness for use in this very litigation.  And the fact that the lawyers have come up with this approach to it makes me think maybe it does have some relevance to the whole problem we're trying to confront.   John Paul Stevens  When I... when I was thinking about this problem, I looked at district 24.  The thing that was interesting to me is that most of the neutral justifications that you describe... and they're certainly in the... in the five new districts that replaced it, but in the key part of the population that was moved, it becomes much less compact than it was before.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Which it seems to me quite significant.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And its particularly... particular reference to the targeted group that was moved out of the district.   John Paul Stevens  No, but I'm suggesting the challenge to 24 should be a political gerrymandering challenge.   John Paul Stevens  And that's the standard I'm suggesting.  Right.  That's exactly the point.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes.   John Paul Stevens  No.  I was suggesting that would be a safe harbor, and... and it would just--   John Paul Stevens  --General Cruz, why wouldn't it be a... at least a helpful guide to what is reasonably compact to compare with the preceding districts?  Now, that fits 24 but not necessarily 25 I understand.  Wouldn't that make... make sense if the reasonable compactness is... is one of the tests?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I suppose if you have a plaintiff suing, it would be the one he lives in.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I ask you if you agree with General Cruz, that if the results of the 20... section... district 23 violated section 2, it would not be a defense that was politically motivated?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And would you also agree with the second question I asked as to whether if it were a violation... I understand you don't think it was... it would not be a defense that they were able to create a district... a Hispanic district in another part of the State.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Is that based on the premise that section... that district 25 and district 23 are in the same part of the State?   INTERRUPTING ",05-204X
0,"John Paul Stevens  May I ask you this hypothetical?  Supposing people like to work the forklift, but nobody had a... a right to do it, but they traded every day or something like that, and the company put out a notice that said anybody who... who files a claim will not be eligible to ride on the forklift ever again.   John Paul Stevens  That would be a violation?   John Paul Stevens  So anytime there's an advance notice that you will... there will be some kind of action in response to a... a claim, that would be retaliation.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Even though it was not an adverse job action.   John Paul Stevens  Even though it did not amount to... did not have any economic effect on the employee.   John Paul Stevens  So a quid pro quo violation does not have to be an adverse employment action.

In other words, supposing there was... instead of the $750,000 settlement, it had been $100,000 here.  $75,000 was medical, and they had a lot of substantial other claims, pain, suffering, loss of earnings, and so forth.  Would you always get your full amount if... if the amount of the settlement is over the amount of the medical expense?   John Paul Stevens  You think that's the equitable rule.

John Paul Stevens  Yes, but isn't it almost essential, in one of these inquiries, to... to invade the attorney client privilege over and over again to find out what they might have done with a different lawyer?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But, Mr. Dreeben, I think you're underestimating the importance of the autonomy interest because going through a criminal trial for a defendant is a very traumatic experience, not just what happens in the courtroom, but during the entire process.

For example, there is a statement that no current medical schools provide instruction in the procedure.  Now that's clearly wrong, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Do you think that finding is correct?   John Paul Stevens  Supposing there was a lot of evidence introduced in the district court that there were schools like Yale and New York University that did include this as part of a curriculum, could the district court disregard that finding and make a contrary finding?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, on other findings, is there a different standard of review of what the district court found as opposed to what Congress found?   John Paul Stevens  Well, I don't understand--  Congress to have made credibility findings.  As I read the... I read the whole finding.  There were six or seven pages of findings, and I don't find a single reference in those findings to the performance of an abortion on a nonviable fetus.  All of the language in the findings seem to be referring to viable fetuses just inches away from becoming a person.  And I don't think you can even find the word fetus in those findings.  The findings as opposed to the text of the statute.   John Paul Stevens  I'm talking about the findings.  Is there a single word in the findings that refers to a viable fetus?  It maybe refers to a nonviable fetus.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I interrupt?   John Paul Stevens  It's not preventing, It's requiring that the lethal act be performed prior to any part of the delivery, because there is no doubt there will be a lethal act.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Do you not agree that it has no chance of surviving, in most cases?   John Paul Stevens  Yes, that's right.

1,"John Paul Stevens  Can I ask you a preliminary question before you get too far into your argument?  Is it your understanding that the instructions to the jury were that finding that predatory price cutting was in itself sufficient to establish a Section 2 violation?  I know the Court of Appeals opinion reads that way but is it, do you think the jury was so instructed?   John Paul Stevens  You may consider it as an anticompetitive act, but it does not say you may regard it as a violation of Section 2.   John Paul Stevens  And as I read the instructions, it did require there be three elements of the violation of Section 2 which, two of which were not discussed by the Court of Appeals.   John Paul Stevens  Do you concede there is monopoly power?   John Paul Stevens  But is that relevant to the question whether, if there is monopoly power plus an attempt to preserve that power or require that power, plus an anticompetitive act, is that a violation of section 2.   John Paul Stevens  But you do agree that the conduct in itself is not sufficient to establish a violation, the question of whether the conduct plus the monopoly power--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --And so you're arguing not only that the pricing conduct was not itself sufficient to prove a violation, but it also was not even an anticompetitive act that may give rise to damages?   John Paul Stevens  Obviously, if there's just an anticompetitive act without a violation of the statute, then there would be no basis for damages.   John Paul Stevens  Of course in the Brooke case, it may not have even been a monopolist.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I ask this question?  Supposing the evidence was perfectly clear that the company did engage in a plan to get a total monopoly and there were minutes of the board of directors says that in order to do this we've got to drive company X out of business and so you, we want you to compete in every transaction with company X that you can and buy the logs at a higher price.  Would that be an anticompetitive act even if it did not result in loss to the defendant?   John Paul Stevens  No.  The anticompetitive... the plan is to drive the company out of business.  And the only anticompetitive conduct other than proving the whole objective is that you pick on this one competitor and outbid him every time you can.  Could that possibly give rise to a damage claim?   John Paul Stevens  Even if the whole purpose was to drive it out of business?   John Paul Stevens  Pursuant to a plan to acquire a monopoly.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, but only intent plus monopoly power.  You have to be able to prove monopoly power, too.   John Paul Stevens  There aren't too many cases that fit this.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, but unilateral conduct where you have monopoly power.  There aren't too many of these cases, as you know.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It was an issue that was resolved by the jury in this case and I don't understand you to be disputing the resolution of that issue.   John Paul Stevens  But that did not involve a monopoly.  That did not involve monopoly power.   John Paul Stevens  No, you have to have the monopoly power as well.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  In your view, if as the jury was instructed in this case there was proof of monopoly power and intent to maintain or preserve that power, plus anticompetitive acts, does the anticompetitive act have to be in and of itself a violation of the Sherman Act?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And if you do have all three, is that enough to prove a violation?   John Paul Stevens  And isn't that how the jury was instructed in this case?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes, but if it was not instructed it would be sufficient to find a violation of section 2 by those, by that accounting, is that not correct?   John Paul Stevens  Go back to my hypothetical.  Supposing you have the first two elements and you say in order to drive this company out of business we want you to compete with them and get the logs at whatever cost it takes.  Would that be an anticompetitive act?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Even if it was for the sole purpose of driving the company out of business in order to accomplish the goal of getting a monopoly?   John Paul Stevens  No, no.  I'm assuming this is not evidence of intent.  There's independent evidence of both intent and monopoly power.  With those two elements established, would this, the kind of evidence I described, be evidence of an injury to the plaintiff that could be actual in damages?   John Paul Stevens  Will you need to meet the prongs of the Brooker test even if you otherwise prove a violation of section 2?   John Paul Stevens  You prove monopoly power plus an intent to maintain or acquire it.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  That's insufficient to prove a violation of Section 2?

Is it your view... when the petition for removal was filed, did the district... Federal district court have jurisdiction to decide the preemption issue in your view?   John Paul Stevens  All right.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So the... there... there was jurisdiction in the Federal court to entertain the removed case.   John Paul Stevens  Then... then why... then how can you say the... the remand was based on lack of... of jurisdiction?   John Paul Stevens  Well, but they... they had held it acting on an interpretation of SLUSA before our decision in Dabit.   John Paul Stevens  And isn't it at least possible that they would... would have decided that issue had they reviewed--   John Paul Stevens  May I ask you one question, Mr. Frederick?  Because it's important to me.  Would you agree that a complaint that alleged that the defendant negligently used or employed manipulative devices and so forth would be covered by SLUSA... would preempt it?   John Paul Stevens  So the mere fact that it's negligently caused would not preclude preclusion.   INTERRUPTING ",05-409X
0,"John Paul Stevens  Could we just... can I ask you suppose they didn't waive it?  Would their... would their position have any merit?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Let me put the question just a little differently.  Suppose the... in Dabit, we decided that the distinction between the purchaser seller rule and the scope of 10b-5 did not prevent SLUSA from preempting.  But does SLUSA preempt a claim that is beyond the scope of rule 10b-5?   John Paul Stevens  May I ask this question?  Because I hadn't, frankly, realized the importance you attach to the Missouri Pacific case.  And the way you describe it as saying that the... the State court cannot be held to have decided against a Federal right... well, anyway, the... the point is there are two things that are decided by the Federal court when it remands a case.  One, there was no preemption, and two, therefore, there shall be a removal.  Now, as I understood the principle underlying that case, the... the correctness of the remand could not be reviewed.  That's litigated.  But could not the correctness of the reason given for the remand, namely there was no preemption, be removed by us on certiorari?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Under their theory, but it seems to me very strange to say that we could not, when we do get the case on a petition for certiorari... couldn't review whether it was... whether it was in fact preemption.

0,"John Paul Stevens  So, you would treat a State with a 2-day statute of limitations just like your State, with a 15-day statute.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It was--   John Paul Stevens  --available for 2 days, so that's had a... so, I suppose it would be okay for 6 hours, too.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Would that apply to a prisoner who claimed he'd been raped by a guard or something, but was afraid to bring the proceeding, for 2 or 3 weeks, until the guard was transferred to another facility?  And he alleged those facts, and then he was denied relief because it was over 15 days.  Would that be--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --Well, those are--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --his allegations.  These are just his allegations.  And when that... and they then said,  ""No, it's... you're out of time. ""  Could a Federal Court take that case?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, he... first he files a prisoner complaint, 17 days late, but makes the allegations I describe, and he's just denied because he's too late.  Could a Federal Court take that case, under your view?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And then he'd have to file a second... subsequently file a 1983 case.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So even--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --if it was seven--   John Paul Stevens  --even after the 17th day, the Federal Court could hear a... have a factual hearing.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  He's just alleged it as... in... and the only... the only response from the State is, 2 days late> [""].  That's all... that's all the State has said.   ",05-416X
1,"John Paul Stevens  Let me be sure--   John Paul Stevens  --I understand one thing about your position.  You do agree, do you not, that in order to exhaust, even if the time has run the 15-day period, there is an obligation to go to the State and ask them to hear the case, even though it's untimely?   John Paul Stevens  So that you do say that you at least will give the State the opportunity to decide whether it wants to try and remedy it in an informal or hasty manner.   John Paul Stevens  Yes.   ",05-416X
0,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Johnson, would you comment on the footnote on the... on the... drawing the distinction with regard to the dance contest that the defendant won in that case, between... it's over here; I'm asking the question... between facts that occurred before the crime and facts that might have occurred after.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I ask you about that?  This case is unusual, because it has that separate instruction that,  ""The mitigating circumstances are merely examples, and you should pay careful attention to those, but you may... but you may rely on other mitigating circumstances. ""  May I ask you, would it have been constitutional if the judge had added a sentence at the end of that instruction which said,  ""However, you may not consider anything mitigating unless it extenuates the gravity of the crime? ""   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I'm not sure you've answered my question.  Would it have been a constitutional addition to that instruction to say,  ""But I want to... you to clearly understand that it is not to be considered mitigating unless it extenuates the gravity of the crime? ""  Would that have been permissible?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Because that would have foreclosed consideration of the Skipper-type evidence, right?   John Paul Stevens  So, then the question in this case is whether the jury might have understood factor (k) to limit them to the consideration of factors that extenuate the gravity of the crime.   John Paul Stevens  General Johnson, I don't mean to interrupt you, but I want to be sure you answered your... you stick to your answer on... to my question, earlier,--   John Paul Stevens  --because you... I think you changed your answer after Justice... the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia suggested you might have made a mistake.  Are you... is it your position that it would be constitutional to instruct the jury that,  ""You may not consider any evidence mitigating, unless it extenuates the gravity of the crime? ""   John Paul Stevens  Is--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --that answer consistent with the position of defense counsel, who said he would not insult the intelligence of the jury by suggesting to them that the religious conversion of the defendant did not extenuate the gravity of the crime?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  That's right.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  If that were true would that have extenuated the gravity of the crime, if he could get along in prison?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And you think juries would clearly understand that what he did in the future in prison would extenuate the gravity of the crime.   INTERRUPTING ",05-493X

1,"John Paul Stevens  But you--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --make the concession, as I understand it, because it's a Federal felony, not because it's a State felony--   John Paul Stevens  --isn't that right?  Yes.   John Paul Stevens  But are you saying it would also include State trafficking offense, because it's described in the word ""trafficking""?   John Paul Stevens  May I--   John Paul Stevens  --ask this question?  It's... presuming... supposing we say it's not moot, and you prevail.  Could he be resentenced without being present in court?   INTERRUPTING ",05-547X
0,"John Paul Stevens  Yes.  We have a case in which we're assuming, for our purposes, we just have possession.  I mean, I understand the facts of this case.  And I wanted to ask... I have two questions, Mr. Kneedler.  One of them... the second one, I'd ask that... you were going to mention three different points, one about conviction; you had two other points you didn't get to.  I want to learn what those were.  But, before that, it seems to me that, when you put the whole statute... all the... all the different statutory provisions together, you really boil down and focus on 924(c)(2) and the words  ""for purpose of this subsection, the term ""drug-trafficking crime"" means any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. ""  And if the word ""Federal"" had been inserted before the word ""felony"" in the statute, would that not make the statute perfectly clear?   John Paul Stevens  It was a question of--   John Paul Stevens  --whether the change was intended to be--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --substantive--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --or merely--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --stylistic.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Just again, Mr. Kneedler... focusing again on that specific language, you're saying, in effect, that that phrase means any State or Federal felony punishable under the Federal statutes.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And is it ever true that a State felony is punishable under a Federal statute?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes, I know, but--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --but do you know of any instance where we've said a State felony is punishable under a Federal statute?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But you do agree--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --that the key to the case is how we read that one sentence.   John Paul Stevens  But is--   John Paul Stevens  --that a reasonable... let's say the statute's ambiguous, and you've convinced us there's no constitutional requirement of uniformity.  But is it reasonable to assume that Congress would want the different consequences to depend on the State of conviction?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Is there anything in the legislative history suggesting that?   ",05-547X
1,"John Paul Stevens  Let me ask this question as to the basic issue of whether you should be relying on Teague or the statute.  If you're relying just on the statute, how would it apply to a case which was correct under established law at the time that the state court made its ruling, but before the case reached the appellate court, in which there was a change in our interpretation?  What if this case... if Crawford had been decided while the case was on appeal?   John Paul Stevens  So it really makes a difference whether we rely on Teague or whether we rely on the statute if we disagree with you?   John Paul Stevens  The word was is somewhat ambiguous.  It could either mean at the time of the trial court's decision or at the time of the final judgment on appeal.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I know you win under either view, but--   John Paul Stevens  --it could mean either of those two things.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You make the same analysis if you say the right is not necessarily the right of confrontation but the narrower right of cross-examination.   John Paul Stevens  Because that is central to Crawford.   INTERRUPTING ",05-595X

1,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Kester, may I ask you this question?  Is it your view that Gen-Probe represented a change in the law?   John Paul Stevens  Were there... before Gen-Probe was decided, were there any cases, like this case, that were decided?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Where the... where the licensee brought suit challenging validity while the license was still in full--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --force?   ",05-608X
0,"John Paul Stevens  Ms. Mahoney, can I ask this question?  Supposing at the time they negotiate the license agreement there's some uncertainty about whether the patent is valid or not.  So, at the end of the license agreement... they agree on the royalties, the term, and the... everything it covers, but they put in a provision and say,  ""We're not entirely sure the patent is valid, so we reserve the right to bring an action challenging the validity of the patent. ""  ""We will pay royalties in the meantime, and the... you will accept these royalties as sufficient for the use of the patent, that, if we win, you don't have to pay royals, if we lose, you do. ""  Would that be a valid provision?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But would it--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --not be precisely the same issue as a jurisdictional matter as to whether there's a case or controversy?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  He's not being coerced, but he's bargaining a little better royalty rate than he'll... otherwise would have to pay.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, I'm really asking--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --whether the parties could agree to create a case or controversy.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Ms. Mahoney, can I ask you one question before your light goes off?  I know it's not... goes to the ""case or controversy"" issue, but, in your view, was the bringing of this action a material breach of an implied condition of the contract that would justify a termination of a license?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I'm asking you whether--   John Paul Stevens  --you think there was.   INTERRUPTING ",05-608X
0,"John Paul Stevens  And it's also, I assume, true that the demand letter would not toll a statute.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Mr. Lamken--   John Paul Stevens  --could we go back to Section (i) for a second more?  Is it also possible to say that there was this disagreement between the Department of Justice and the Comptroller General, and Congress decided that the Comptroller General was right?  And, if that's true, should we not accept the Comptroller General's reading of the entire statute?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Does the--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --legislative history tell us how detailed the congressional examination of the particular issue was?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  That's about all--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --Okay.   John Paul Stevens  Thank you.  Mr. Joseffer.     Daryl Joseffer  --fundamental point than that, too, is that what Congress was doing here was, when using these terms in their ordinary sense, to lay out an across... the-board rule that applies to suits in court.  And, finally, one thing I should also emphasize is that what we have in this context is a comprehensive administrative scheme.  Petitioners like to say that,  ""Well, we could just as easily be in court. ""  There's a reason that no administrative royalty proceeding has ever been brought by the Government in a court.  And that's, first, that Congress directed the agency to establish a comprehensive auditing and collection system, and then gave the agency administrative authority to enforce its administrative orders.  The only way the agency could administer thousands of leases with something like $9 billion in royalties every year is to do this in an efficient administrative manner.  Congress has not only authorized that, and ratified it, it has strengthened that scheme and told the agency, as I said, in 1982, to go back and look at old leases, precisely because Congress knew that is a standalone administrative scheme, and it's never provided the administrative limitations period for the standalone administrative scheme.  If there are no more questions--   John Paul Stevens  Thank you, Mr. Joseffer.  Mr. Lamken, as I understand it, you have about 11 minutes left.  You don't have to use them all.  [Laughter]     John Paul Stevens  Mr. Lamken, have you had any second thoughts about your position that it's the order, rather than the issue letter, that we should look at?   John Paul Stevens  May I suggest--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --this, Mr. Lamken, that when the... when the filing is made giving us the OLC opinion, you include a... an example of such a letter?

Because we're only talking about part of the claim, anyway, as I understand it.  Is that correct?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  There would be some in dispute.

0,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Fisher, may I ask you this question?  In your view, did the regulations create a legally enforceable obligation?   John Paul Stevens  And where may that obligation be enforced?   John Paul Stevens  By means of a private action before the FCC?   John Paul Stevens  Where the carrier... where they would file a complaint saying you owe us X dollars, and the agency could order them to pay X dollars.   John Paul Stevens  And is the obligation enforceable in State court?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I understand that.  I'm curious to know what your view is.   John Paul Stevens  Mr. Fisher, can I go back to the first question I asked you?  Would the FCC have had authority to create an administrative remedy that had a fee shifting provision in it?   John Paul Stevens  It could certainly impose penalties of some kind.   ",05-705X
1,"John Paul Stevens  Let me just be sure I understand your argument on 208.  You're saying that 208, like the earlier provision of the statute, requires a violation of the statute, not just regulations, in order for there to be an administrative remedy.   John Paul Stevens  So the same statutory requirement for the remedy that your opponent challenges is the one he acknowledges is available.   John Paul Stevens  Let me just ask this.  Is it the same with respect to fee-shifting?   John Paul Stevens  Is your position... I want to be sure I understand you.  Your position on the two different questions that the Chief asked you is, they get deference on question one.  And with respect to question two, it follows from the plain text of the statute.

1,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Phillips, may I ask you this question.  Assuming you're right on the doctrine of equivalence and you're wrong on proximate cause, for the moment.  Now, you said earlier in your argument, it is perfectly clear there was no harmless error here.   John Paul Stevens  It seemed to me that a possible interpretation of the record... and I'd like you to comment of the record... is that the jury either believed the one... one truck driver or the other.  And that the direct causation thing really didn't have an impact on the calculation of damages.  And I was going to ask you to comment on that and to tell me whether during the argument of the case before the jury, did the plaintiff's lawyer argue, in effect, that he had... the railroad has a much heavier burden of proving a causation than we do?   ",05-746X
0,"John Paul Stevens  Let me ask you this question, if I may.  Perhaps I should have asked Mr. Phillips.  Is there such an animal as the doctrine of equivalence?  I understand the restatement describes what the plaintiff's burden is on proving causation, and then it says the same rules apply to defendant's contributory negligence.  But that doesn't sound to me like any overriding doctrine of equivalence.  It just says when they wrote the restatement, the rules were the same.  Is there such a thing as the doctrine of equivalence?   John Paul Stevens  Beyond that, if the plaintiff's negligence was in whole the cause of the action, then the... there was no reason to get to comparative negligence or contributory negligence, because by hypothesis, there would have been no negligence by the defendant.   John Paul Stevens  I suppose employees have been under the rule for a long time.   ",05-746X
0,"John Paul Stevens  Could you... could you clarify one thing for me?  I just want to be sure I have it in mind correctly.  Is it correct that the firearm has to be an operable firearm?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But is... just again, I'm not trying to find out the answer to what happened here, but just as a matter of what the law provides.  Is it conceivable that a... a gun which was not operable could nevertheless be a deadly weapon because it can be used as a club?   John Paul Stevens  It could be.   John Paul Stevens  Ms. Millett, can I ask you this one question?  Would there ever be a case where it was not harmless error when the judge makes the finding?  Isn't it... wouldn't it be reasonable for the appellate court to assume, well, if the judge made the finding, it's probably supported by the evidence and presumably the jury would have come out the same way?   Patricia A. Millett  --No, I don't... I don't think that's true, Justice Stevens, that there will be times... I don't think this is one of those cases, but there will be--   John Paul Stevens  But there might be a rare case, but in about 95 percent of the cases, wouldn't it be true that the fact the judge made the finding is pretty good evidence that the jury would have made the same finding?   Patricia A. Millett  --I think it will depend on whether the evidence was disputed before the judge in a... in a... in the Federal system would have been sentencing hearing.

1,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Link, will you just... maybe I... I should know this, but the information charges an assault in the second degree using a deadly weapon.  If they had charged use of a firearm rather than a deadly weapon, what would the crime have been?  Would that also have been assault in the second degree?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  The firearm enhancement itself would not covert it from second degree to first degree.   John Paul Stevens  May I just clarify one other thing?  Capacity to fire doesn't mean it had to be loaded, though.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  An unloaded gun could be a firearm.   ",05-83XX

0,"John Paul Stevens  May I ask a question, Mr. Phillips?  Focusing on this question in the amicus brief which the EPA representative answered no.  Supposing the EPA had answered yes at that time.  Would that have been a permissible answer within the meaning of the statute?   John Paul Stevens  You know... what's that, page 7 and 8 of the... of a source to modified have to have a significant increase in the SO2 elements.   John Paul Stevens  And they answered no.  You say they were right.   John Paul Stevens  I'm just asking... want to know, under the statute, could they have answered yes and would that have been a permissible answer?   John Paul Stevens  So you're not basically relying on the fact that you were misled, you're basically relying on the fact that they have interpreted the statute incorrectly.   John Paul Stevens  Mr. Phillips, can I ask another sort of basic question?  In your view, would it be permissible for the agency to interpret the word... to adopt a regulatory interpretation of the... in the PSD regulations of the word ""modification"" that was different from the definition it used under the new source regulations?   John Paul Stevens  Substantively different.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You think the statute required the regulation to be identical?   John Paul Stevens  Your answer is no?   John Paul Stevens  Would it have been permissible for the agency to adopt one definition for 10 years and then change the definition to the other definition for all programs?   John Paul Stevens  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So either definition could comply with the statute?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  They make a kind of interesting argument, major modification is not a subset of modification.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Mr. Phillips, I want to be sure I understand your position.  Are you saying the statutory text in effect says every regulation using the word modification must employ the same definition, or are you relying on a general principle that when the same word is used it should be used in the same way?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So there's nothing in the statute itself that says that principle shall apply to this case?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But your reference of modification as defined elsewhere merely defines the scope of the statutory meaning.  That's not the same as saying every regulation that is a modification must be the same no matter what the program.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Let me just be sure I understand the point.  If instead of saying as defined in X, the second statute had merely quoted the same words that were in X, would your argument be the same?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So you're saying that if you used the definition as defined in another statute, that implicitly says all regulations defining this term must be identical.   John Paul Stevens  This is very helpful to me, because the government has accused you of abandoning the court of appeals approach to the case, and I think you're endorsing the court of appeals.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Mr. Phillips, can I go back for a second to the meaning in (a) includes the same meaning as in (b).  Is it not correct under your view of the statute that that meaning can include either of the two definitions that the two regulations identify?  So that either... whether you start with (a) or the second statute, either statute includes both... may include both alternative regulations?   John Paul Stevens  Yes.   ",05-848X

John Paul Stevens  Whenever he denies the motion, he must know about it.  He must have a reason to deny.   Lisa S. Blatt  --We're by hypothesis talking about an absolute right to convert, and what I'm trying to say, in jurisdictions where there is an absolute right, the practice of bankruptcy courts is not to simultaneously convert.  It does happen on occasion, but the more likely scenario is that a significant period of time passes.  But the other point is that if there's a simultaneous conversion it's a completely pointless and burdensome process, and here's why: A conversion and simultaneous conversion causes the termination and reappointment of the Chapter 7 trustee, the appointment and the immediate termination of the Chapter 13 trustee, and to the extent there's already pending Chapter 7 proceedings for dismissal or denial of discharge, the conversion would appear to us to moot those proceedings and require their reinstatement.  And this is a completely unnecessary waste of everyone's time and energy.   John Paul Stevens  May I just clear up one detail that's confusing to me.  The... are there two judges?  Does the same judge rule on both the motion to convert and the motion to reconvert?   Lisa S. Blatt  Yes, in the majority of jurisdictions.  There are one or two jurisdictions where there are different judges, but the vast majority it's before the same judge.

1,"John Paul Stevens  We've done it before, there's no doubt about it.  But the better practice usually is to have a case in which the issue really presents the hard question.  And you're asking us to make a ruling in this case that would govern failure to allege an aggravating circumstance in a death case, for example, which has a different atmosphere to the whole case when you're facing that kind of an issue.   John Paul Stevens  A judge's reaction to a case is often affected by just exactly what's involved.  And here it's just hard to see how anyone could claim any particular prejudice out of the error in this particular case or, really, it's arguable that there's no defect in the indictment at all because it was adequate notice to the defendant of what he's charged with.  This is much like a case in the State systems where you have notice pleading.  It doesn't seem very prejudicial.  But you put it in a different context, you might have a different reaction to the case.   ",05-998X
0,"John Paul Stevens  May I ask this question.  Should the test for the missing element be different for the test for the wrong element?  In other words, suppose the indictment alleged he walked up to the border and the evidence showed he rode a bicycle.  There's a variance.  Would that present a different legal issue than if they just leave the overt act entirely out?   John Paul Stevens  Why should the test for judging the two be different?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Between a variance and an omission?   John Paul Stevens  Well, it's clearly different.  He rode a bicycle instead of walking.   John Paul Stevens  So here you've got notice he made an attempt, but you didn't tell us whether he rode the bicycle or he walked.   John Paul Stevens  See, the problem I'm trying to think through is why should there be a different rule between those two situations.  It seems to me they're equally likely to produce prejudice or lack of notice and a failure to comply with the letter of the Constitution.   ",05-998X

And, and one of the cases that Ruhrgas quoted and relies on was the D.C. Circuit's decision in... Papandreou, which involved subject matter jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  And there the Court quite rightly said that it would be improper to force a foreign sovereign to undergo extensive jurisdictional discovery in this case when it was clear that at the end of the day the Court would dismiss day in favor of a foreign forum in any event.

We talk of course about the unnecessary burden on the litigants, but I wonder if there isn't even a more fundamental problem with the procedure that the Third Circuit followed here.  That is, is there really a case or controversy down there?

1,"John Paul Stevens  It's sometimes based on age.   John Paul Stevens  It's sometimes based on age, sometimes years of service.   John Paul Stevens  Am I correct in understanding that your plan does not provide a disability benefit just as a disability benefit?  The only time disability is relevant is when it determines whether or not a person will become eligible for the regular retirement benefit?   John Paul Stevens  So that for the old person who has already reached retirement age the fact that he doesn't get a disability benefit is common to everybody subject to the plan.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Isn't that the answer to Justice Breyer's question?   ",06-1037
0,"John Paul Stevens  That's because of the period necessary to qualify for retirement?   John Paul Stevens  Let me just interrupt you.  Is there... is it your position there is a disability benefit that is different from the retirement benefit?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I thought that all that disability did was determine... help get a man who is disabled eligible for the retirement benefit.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  That's the only function it provides.   John Paul Stevens  It seems to me your argument boils down to the claim that people who have already reached... become eligible for retirement by either age or period of service, the State has a duty to give them a chance to recover a disability benefit if they give a disability benefit to younger workers.   John Paul Stevens  The computation is for a different purpose in that... in... for the younger workers the purpose is to make them eligible for retirement.  For the older workers, they are already eligible for retirement.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  The term ""eligibility for retirement"", as used in that part of the statute, is referring to actually the same thing as retirement achieved by getting their... getting credit for post-disability years.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I ask this question right on that point.  Supposing you have two different people retire, one... that become disabled, rather... one because he's five years short of the age eligibility and the other because he's five years short of years of service, so it would be a younger person, and both would have become eligible for retirement in five years after their disability.  Are they treated the same way under the plan?  And if they are, where is the discrimination?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, first of all, tell me whether they're treated the same way under the plan.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  What other variables?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Years of service.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  That's a hypothesis.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So then how is that discrimination on the basis of age?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It's not even discrimination as far as I see it.   John Paul Stevens  It seems to me that your claim boils down to an argument that the statute requires someone who is already qualified for retirement to get a disability benefit that the younger person would.  It seems to me that's the basic difference.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I see you talking about two benefits.   John Paul Stevens  There not two benefits.  It's only one.   ",06-1037

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But the search is unrelated to the arrest, as I understand the facts.   John Paul Stevens  It took place later in a different place.   John Paul Stevens  Well, why is it present if he's not... he searched when he wasn't arrested?  I don't understand.  Could they wait a week and do it?   John Paul Stevens  It's an ongoing arrest, is it?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Incident to an ongoing arrest?  That's kind of a new concept.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Let me ask this question: You would argue it doesn't matter whether it violated State or Federal law; it's a question of Federal law on probable cause.  But does the character of the crime for which the person is being arrested have any relevance to the question whether the search is reasonable?  For example, supposing he is arrested for a tax offense; could you go ahead and search him incident to that arrest?   John Paul Stevens  The answer is yes, they could search?

John Paul Stevens  What do you do with Justice Rehnquist's sentence: ""We think this case affords us an opportunity to adopt a more general rule to govern the applicability of equitable tolling suits against the government""? Is there an implied exception for Soriano there?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I understand, I think I understand what you're saying, but I thought that the government's distinction of Soriano was that was the general rule for equitable tolling, so it doesn't apply here, which I think is certainly understandable. But you're saying it wasn't even a general rule for equitable tolling?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Let me ask this question, Mr. Stewart. Supposing we didn't have any precedent at all, just the whole -- this is the first time this issue had arisen, and we have the plain language of this statute. Would you not read this statute, without any background, supporting your opponent?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  When you read the plain language, you left out the words, ""of which the United States Court of Claims has jurisdiction.""   John Paul Stevens  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes, because it said it in a case -- the issue in the case was whether Franconia was overruled -- I mean, Soriano was overruled. And Justice White thought it was. He said so in so many words. And it's interesting that Justice Rehnquist in the majority didn't disagree with that. Rather, he cited Justice White's dissent as part of his description of why some statutes are different from others, then comes to the points that we want to adopt a general rule that applies to all statutes. So it seems to me that the implicit -- in his opinion he did not disagree with Justice White's characterization.   John Paul Stevens  But the interesting part about this is the discussion of the majority of this case is part of its development of the fact that we've got cases all over the lot and we want to adopt a clear rule to apply across the board.

0,"John Paul Stevens  Can I can ask you sort of an elementary, stupid question?  What is the Government's theory as to what this money was?  Is it the theory that it was a dividend or that it was salary?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So your theory, just to be sure I understand, it was not salary; it was not a dividend; it was the proceeds of an embezzlement?   John Paul Stevens  It does not have to prove that it was income.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I just want to be sure I have the right answer.  You do not have to prove that it was income?   John Paul Stevens  Ms. Maynard, may I just go back to your hypothetical for a second?  In the closely held corporation situation you describe where they pay a huge salary to the wife of the president and they decide you can't deduct that, that's really a dividend... that's what the Government normally does in that situation.  And don't they decide it's a dividend irrespective of the intent of the company making the distribution?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So there's no attempt on the part of them to satisfy with ""respect to stock"" requirement?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, but the only fact and circumstance in your hypothetical is they paid them a million dollars when they only earned $100,000?   John Paul Stevens  And it's clearly with respect to stock--   John Paul Stevens  --regardless of intent?   ",06-1509

0,"John Paul Stevens  I take it... supposing there's a dispute between the prosecutor and the defendant as to whether in fact he was a recidivist or not.  Is the fact that there was just an argument that he would be a recidivist enough or does the record have to establish that he was a recidivist?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Shouldn't the mere existence of a dispute be enough, because then at least he's potentially subject to being treated as a recidivist.   John Paul Stevens  How would you treat an enhancement--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --So it's not just recidivist and non-recidivist.  It's some enhancements, but not all enhancements?   John Paul Stevens  You're depending upon the guidelines.   John Paul Stevens  Well, I understand, but my point is I don't think your proposal just has two categories.  There... it seems there could be multiple kinds of enhancements that would fit your general description.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It's not just recidivist versus nonrecidivist.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1646
1,"John Paul Stevens  Of course, the recidivist doesn't necessarily be a recidivist because he committed the same crime three times.  He might have done two very different things under the California three-strike law.  Sometimes very minor crimes push the person over to qualify as a recidivist.   John Paul Stevens  Then for double jeopardy purposes you must look at the second offense as the offense, not the offender.  I mean, the prior conduct is... is not being punished as a matter of constitutional law.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1646
0,"John Paul Stevens  Does your case... does your case depend entirely on the fact that these are American citizens?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  If they were not American citizens, would there be jurisdiction?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So then citizenship is irrelevant on the jurisdictional issue?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I don't know how you can avoid taking that question.  That what bothers me.  How can you avoid addressing that question?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Are you aware of any cases in which we have held that habeas jurisdiction is available to a citizen where it would be not available to a non-citizen?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I ask this second question: Do you think the place of detention has any relevance to the issue?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Do you think whether or not it's a... there are ongoing hostilities would have any relationship to the issue?   John Paul Stevens  But you say that does not exist in Iraq today?   John Paul Stevens  But the place of detention has always been Iraq?   John Paul Stevens  The place of detention has always been Iraq?   John Paul Stevens  Would the legal issue be the same if there were violent ongoing hostilities in Iraq?   John Paul Stevens  Do we have any... any precedent in our cases for saying that that test would apply during an active combat in a zone of hostilities?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It's a very different place of detention.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So are you saying then that the zone of hostilities does not include all of Iraq?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So what if we thought otherwise?   John Paul Stevens  What if we thought otherwise?  What if we thought all... all of Iraq is a zone of hostilities?  Would we have a different result?   John Paul Stevens  How can you say that the United States lacks the power to transfer?  Suppose this fellow had been arrested in the street by a sergeant in the Army and he says, what will I do with him?  I'll take him to the Iraqis and turn him over.  Would that be an illegal transfer?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  A sergeant caught this guy, and he wants to turn him over to the Iraqis.  Does he... is there some law that prevents him from doing that?   John Paul Stevens  That applies to the sergeant in the city of--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --Why isn't all of this within the zone of military discretion?   John Paul Stevens  You're talking about a transfer in what I assume you said was a zone of hostilities.   John Paul Stevens  I thought you were talking about a transfer in an area that you say was engaged in active hostilities.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Does that affect the decision at all?

1,"John Paul Stevens  If it's in the materials, then perhaps I should have known, but did the... I take it Munaf was present and was represented by counsel?   John Paul Stevens  But how did that work?  Was he present in American custody and then he goes to the Iraqi court?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So then he just goes every day to the Iraqi court and then he comes back at night to U.S. custody?   John Paul Stevens  May I ask just one question.  Would your argument be the same if the place of detention was in the United States?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, could they be released to a lynch mob?   John Paul Stevens  Mr. Garre, is it the position of the government that this is a war zone?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Do you think any part of Iraq is like a battlefield situation?   John Paul Stevens  Why isn't it a war zone?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  That means you haven't made your strongest argument.   ",06-1666
1,"John Paul Stevens  May I just ask on that last point, does the government agree that the paralegals' fees are subject to a cap?   John Paul Stevens  But they do not agree with the bottom line that they are subject to cap?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --attorney's fees.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But may I ask you this?   John Paul Stevens  Supposing at the time the statute was enacted, paralegals' fees were not generally treated as lawyers' fees, but rather were disbursements, does that make a difference?   ",06-1717
0,"John Paul Stevens  At this discretion, let me ask this question.  Maybe it's the same question Justice Kennedy asked, but I want to be sure of your answer.  Suppose you had independent firm of paralegals.  I don't know whether the market contains them, but it surely could.  A firm that they are all paralegals, and they then bill the law firm at their own hourly rate, and then the law firm in turn bills the client.  In that situation, would the market rate of the independent firm of paralegals govern?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Do I understand the government's position that the... the result would different if a firm uses its own paralegals as opposed to outsourcing?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No.  But under my example they would be paying the market rate for paralegals, and I think you say they could be reimbursed for that.   John Paul Stevens  Well, they are not market to make business.  I presume the paralegals would charge the going rate.   John Paul Stevens  I assume that they also charged the market rate.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I go back--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --May I go back to the point, because I think you were cut off before you went into the full legislative history.  I'm still concerned about the argument that even if they are not fees but rather costs, that the costs should be those that are billed to the client.  And you think there is some conclusive answer in the legislative history that that's not the case.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Which took place when?   John Paul Stevens  At that time were they billing paralegal's fees at cost to the client?  Was it--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --Every expense that's reimbursed at cost has a profit element in it for whoever performed the service.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Business or otherwise.   John Paul Stevens  But the cap doesn't apply to expenses, does it?   John Paul Stevens  The cap does not apply to reimbursement expenses at cost?   John Paul Stevens  It seems to me just the opposite just as the Chief Justice suggests.  It seems to me you're creating an incentive for the firms to... to charge as much as they can... I mean, under market rates for everything under the... under the time of the lawyer himself.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, because other costs reasonably interpret to include overhead.  It's not just the paper and the accounting time.   ",06-1717
0,"John Paul Stevens  May I ask one sort of preliminary question.  Supposing the prosecutor misstated the law in his closing argument.  Would that be reviewable in this Court under AEDPA?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Do you think his argument here contained any misstatements of the law?   John Paul Stevens  You don't.   John Paul Stevens  Don't you think the argument based on the General Patton analogy told the jurors they had a duty to do what he suggested?   John Paul Stevens  What is the relevance of that argument otherwise?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Do you think if he said in so many words, you have a duty to return the death penalty, that would have been a misstatement of the law?   John Paul Stevens  And you don't think this could be so interpreted?  You don't think you could interpret that, that passage, that way?   John Paul Stevens  I suppose your concession about the duty is based on Chief Justice Stone's opinion in Viereck, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Which did involve the very word ""duty"".   John Paul Stevens  Chief justice Stone's opinion in Viereck talked about telling the jury that they have a duty and condemned that.  That's probably why you made the concession, I think.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I ask you this question about your position: We are trying to find cases that clearly establish law by decisions of this Court.  Do you include in that group of cases, cases such as Berger against the United States, and Viereck against the United States, which were direct review of Federal cases in which they say there was a denial of the fair trial, but they're not setting aside State cases?  Would it be proper for the Court of Appeals to rely on those cases?   John Paul Stevens  Even though those cases say in so many words it deprives you of a fair trial.   John Paul Stevens  May I go back to my question?  Because there's a legal question here about what law we can look to under AEDPA.  And actually, of course, it is a question of whether AEDPA applies, I suppose.  Because actually, wasn't this habeas petition filed two days before AEDPA was... there's a footnote in the red brief that says... raises that question.   John Paul Stevens  May I ask this question before you sit down?  In the Viereck opinion, Chief Justice Stone reversed in that case.  And one of the reasons was the prosecutor indulged in an appeal wholly irrelevant to any facts or issues in the case, the purpose and effect of which could only have been to arouse passion and prejudice.  That's part of our Federal law.  Is that law applicable in this case, do you think?   John Paul Stevens  Well, it is either directly... it's either yes or no.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  That rule can be ignored by State prosecutors?   John Paul Stevens  Well, it is--   John Paul Stevens  --Well, the question, I suppose, is whether that is a constitutional rule.  It is established by the Supreme Court of the United States, an opinion written by Chief Justice Stone a good many years ago.  But you're argument is it is not applicable to State prosecutors, as I understand it.   INTERRUPTING ",06-313X
1,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Blume, before your time is up, I want to ask you one other question.  I'm still troubled about whether AEDPA applies.  And was it argued in any court below?  Was the question actually ruled on after an adversarial presentation as to whether AEDPA applies or does not apply?  As I understand it, it either does or it doesn't and it doesn't matter whether it was argued.  But was it discussed in any of the lower court decisions?   John Paul Stevens  Two days before the act.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, I mean in this proceeding.   ",06-313X
0,"John Paul Stevens  How long has that been the government's... the EPA position?  How long has that been the EPA's interpretation of the statute?   John Paul Stevens  Has that always been the EPA's position?  Because there's an allegation in one of the briefs that you changed your position in this Court, to change the position you took even in the lower courts at issue.  Is that--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --But your position was they didn't have to?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Mr. Kneedler, may I ask a question about the memorandum of agreement?  That's kind of a new concept that I have a little difficulty following.  Is there... is that, is one of the nine conditions of approval that the State enter into a memorandum of agreement?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Is there not a regulation that issues, that requires the states--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --What's the statutory authority for the regulation?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  What if... what if the State just refused to enter into a memorandum of agreement?  Would that, could that be a ground for refusing to transfer decision?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Just says don't want... it just says we don't want to enter into a memorandum of agreement, period.   John Paul Stevens  --that require the making of a memorandum of agreement.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But how can that be consistent with your shall argument?   John Paul Stevens  And it's in your discretion... your distinction to the snail darter case is that the decision to built the dam is discretionary, not mandatory?   INTERRUPTING ",06-340X
1,John Paul Stevens  May I ask this question about changing position?  Have you agreed and conceded that the nine statutory criteria are satisfied?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You shift back and forth on that point.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  What is your view now?  Are they or are they not?   ,06-340X
0,"John Paul Stevens  May I go back to the Chief's question about the failure to object?  I think I got the impression from Judge Kozinski's opinion that he thought that the Washington Supreme Court found that with respect to two out of the three jurors at issue that there had been a finding that they were substantially impaired, but with respect to this juror, that the Washington Supreme Court seemed to rely on the failure to object as the principal explanation for their decision.   John Paul Stevens  Isn't this perhaps just such a case?  Because this finding by the Supreme Court of the State is based only on the written record, so it does not get any benefit of observing the demeanor of the witness... I mean, the demeanor of the prospective juror; isn't that correct.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So if we disagreed and thought there was not evidence in the written record that would support that conclusion, we should not give deference to that appellate court finding.   John Paul Stevens  May I ask to be sure I understand the record, because I did miss something before.  Did the trial judge say in so many words that Deal's views would have prevented or substantially impaired his ability to follow the court's instructions and abide by the rules of the jurors?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So that's the point of the absence of objection.  That's why he didn't make the critical finding.   John Paul Stevens  Because the judge didn't make the critical finding.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Please finish up the thought because you're equally well prepared.  How do we know the trial judge would have made that a finding if there had been an objection?   Michael R. Dreeben  --Justice Stevens, this is a record in which the trial judge showed that he was meticulously careful in applying the standard from Wainwright versus Witt.  In the joint appendix, I believe at pages 7 through 9, there's an extensive discussion of how the judge is going to apply the Witt standard evenhandedly.  He's going to eliminate those jurors who are like-biased.  He's going to eliminate those jurors who--   John Paul Stevens  Does that respond to the possible suggestion that Judge Kozinski made that what he really did was act on the basis of no objection, rather than on the basis of a finding that he failed to make?   Michael R. Dreeben  --I don't think so, Justice Stevens, because it's very clear that he told the parties, if you have any question, if you have any problem with any of the objections that are made, speak up and I will intervene and question the juror myself and clarify it.  And this is a judge who, against the background of the entire voir dire, clearly was making a good faith effort to apply the Witt standard.  There were 12 objections by the prosecution to various jurors that they should be excused for cause because of inability to apply the law as Washington gives it.  The defense objected, I believe, to seven of those; and the prosecution lost on five of those occasions.  So the judge basically went with the defense when the defense spoke up and objected.  There were two jurors that were excused over the defense objection.  The transcript is also in the voir dire on those and it shows that the defense objected and said these jurors can apply the standard under the law, and the judge found that they could not and excused them.  In the case of Juror Deal there is no absolutely reason to believe that the judge wouldn't have done exactly the same thing if the defense had objected.   John Paul Stevens  But doesn't it follow that his limited cases, the views about when the death penalty is appropriate would translate into views of whether he could or could not impose the death penalty if instructed properly by the court?   Michael R. Dreeben  --Not... not automatically, Justice Stevens.  I mean, this is an juror--   John Paul Stevens  Doesn't it have to be automatic in order to justify the result in this case?   Michael R. Dreeben  --No.  What has to be the case, and this Court in Witt made clear it is not going to apply an unmistakable certainty requirement, is that the judge has to conclude that juror's views would prevent or substantially impair juror in applying the law.  And the judge had to make a call based on what he saw and what none of us did, of whether this juror's views--   John Paul Stevens  Isn't there a world of difference, at least it has been my experience in trials like this of what a juror will do on his own and what he thinks the law might be, and what is fair, and so forth, as opposed to what a, the juror will do in response to proper instructions?   Michael R. Dreeben  --Yeah.   John Paul Stevens  The jurors mostly are pretty conscientious.   Michael R. Dreeben  Yes, they there are.  And--   John Paul Stevens  Is there any reason to believe this guy wasn't?   Michael R. Dreeben  --Well the judge found one.  By excusing him after having--   John Paul Stevens  Well... without... because there was no objection.   Michael R. Dreeben  --Well he made clear, if I may conclude, he made clear at the outset as I think I did when I started my presentation, that this record shows a judge who was conscientiously applying the Witt standard.   ",06-413X
1,"John Paul Stevens  May I ask, one of the most troubling parts about this case is the failure to object.  As I understand, under Washington law, that doesn't making any difference, the review is exactly the same as it would have been if there had been an objection.  But under our review as a matter of constitutional law, should it make a difference?   John Paul Stevens  Do you have any response to Justice Kennedy's concern that this really allows for a mouse trapping of the trial judge who very likely would have paid less attention to the issue as long as any counsel doesn't object, just as a realistic way that this kind of thing is handled?   John Paul Stevens  If I can get back to my concern about the failure to object again.  Supposing this defense counsel instead of just saying no objection, said no objection, I think he's a hanging juror?   John Paul Stevens  In other words, he thought contrary to the prosecutor, his appraisal of this man was that he's going to be pro-death penalty, and he let that be known.  Would that make a difference?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I don't think it would under Washington law.  I don't suppose it would.   John Paul Stevens  No, no.  The juror just did what he did, but everybody was evaluating his demeanor in the courtroom, and defense counsel's evaluation was to mean I don't want that juror, he's going to hang my client, and that's what he thought and he let it come out when he told the judge no objection.   John Paul Stevens  Would that make a difference?   John Paul Stevens  You did.  Do you think it should make a difference to us if we think that he didn't really want this guy on the jury?

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Mr. Shapiro, in your judgment, is the reliance requirement an element of the violation or of the private cause of action?   John Paul Stevens  Mr. Hungar, I want to be sure I understand one part of the government's position.  You do take the position that there has a violation of 10b-5?   John Paul Stevens  Were the other elements present?   John Paul Stevens  Do you have an opinion as to whether there was a violation of 10(b) in this case?

0,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Stern, can I ask you this question: To what extent are we dealing with a tobacco problem or a broader problem?  Do you have other products that are contraband such as... or have special restrictions on who can ship wild animals, prescription drugs, firearms; or are there other products that you regulate in the same way?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You allow shippers to ship firearms and poisonous substances without having this kind of restriction on it, do you?   John Paul Stevens  But I don't really see why the States have... have a different interest in regulating shipment of tobacco to minors than they would a variety of other substances that could be harmful to minors or contraband in general.  And you don't try to regulate any of those?   John Paul Stevens  By... by regulating how they may be shipped, I mean.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You mean it's akin to the health exception.     Excuse me.   John Paul Stevens  You say it's akin to a health exception.     No.  I... I say that it is a law of general applicability, and it does not require any change in the carriers' practices.  What... what the imputation of knowledge does, however, is require the carriers to change their practices so that they will get the knowledge when they can.  For example, take another example.  If Maine said that it would impute knowledge to the carriers of the tobacco contents if an X-ray scan would reveal the cigarette contents, it would in effect be requiring the carriers to install X-ray machines and pass every package that they get through those X-ray machines.  That's how an imputation of knowledge can be used to direct the conduct of the carrier, and that's what is so problematic about the second sentence of D.  They impute knowledge based upon whether the name of the shipper appears on a confidential list that the attorney general has provided.  In other words, even though, in their normal practices, they don't pay attention whatsoever to the shipper's name, they have to incorporate that into their practices in order to avoid the imputation of knowledge.   ",06-457X
1,"John Paul Stevens  Before you leave the alcohol point, I don't quite understand the relevance of the 21st Amendment.  It seems to me if you can pre-empt... if Federal law can pre-empt State laws that are authorized by the 21st Amendment, I don't understand how that has anything to do with the preemption issue.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Why isn't it still a State regulation of shipping, even if it's a law that's authorized by the 21st Amendment?  I don't see the difference.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  What if a new carrier said, well, I'd like to get into the business of shipping tobacco products, none of the other companies want to do it, I want to form... I'll form my own company.  It will meet all these requirements.  Would it... would it then be pre-empted?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, they're saying the retailer must use a service that fulfills these qualifications.  And if there are services out there, why would the law be pre-empted?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But that's the effect on UPS; is that not right?   John Paul Stevens  Does that foreclose the possibility that somebody else might just specialize in delivering tobacco products, for example?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, but they are presumed to have read the label, the stamp on the label; isn't that correct?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Would you answer my question?  May they presume that if the package is labeled cigarettes, that the delivery... the delivery person knows that?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  When they pick up the package, they don't look at the labels?   John Paul Stevens  That statute is definitely preemptive.  A State cannot insist on that.  Could they insist on firearms being slipped only in labeled packages?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Could the State do it beyond the Federal requirement?   INTERRUPTING ",06-457X
0,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Olson, suppose just the dealers in New York, the retail dealers agreed among themselves on the price.  Would that be lawful?   John Paul Stevens  Would you say that it's per se unlawful?   John Paul Stevens  Why should that be any different from the arrangement where those dealers all got together in the convention and recommended to the manufacturer that he impose a vertical restraint of precisely the same dimensions?  Why--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --No, but I'm asking what if he did, why should you draw a distinction?   John Paul Stevens  No.  They just passed a resolution asking the manufacturer to impose this vertical restraint and ways to do it.  Should that be different from one in which the manufacturer does it independently?   John Paul Stevens  No, but there was in the patent case, though, Mr. Olson.  We relied on the fact that the patent law changed.   John Paul Stevens  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Wouldn't your argument also apply to a conspiracy among the New York dealers in this product just to fix prices?  Because there's plenty of interbrand competition, I think.  I don't think you can say it's absolutely clear that that would always be anti-competitive because they would also agree to provide additional services.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I'm talking about a case in which it's the dealers who want to agree to provide extra services at higher prices as their method of better serving the public and they all agree that they have to be conscious about the competition from other brands.  Why can we be absolutely certain that's always going to be harmful to the consumer?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  They might be precisely the same as the manufacturers: We think we'll make more, all make more money if we concentrate on service rather than price.   ",06-480X
1,"John Paul Stevens  Yeah, but the conspiracy that it facilitated was just with intrabrand competition.  There wasn't conspiracy that affected interbrand competition.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So I'm not sure that economically it makes any difference whether the dealers are the one who decide to do it or the manufacturer was, or they all did it at the same time.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  No, but if we say the rule or reason should apply to all cases that just affect intrabrand competition, I'm not sure why we should keep this outmoded rule about horizontal conspiracies that only affect intrabrand competition.   John Paul Stevens  Am I correct on the congressional point that there was a period when Congress would have prohibited the Solicitor General from making the argument he made today?

John Paul Stevens  One of the amicus briefs talks in terms of the percentages, how likely the inference, the word strong inference means 50 percent, 30 percent, 60 percent.  Do you think the inference has to be stronger or less strong than the inference of probable cause in an affidavit for a search warrant to get access to the privacy of a home and so forth?   John Paul Stevens  A civil case would impose a higher standard for getting discovery in a civil case than they would for getting access to a citizen's private papers and the like?   John Paul Stevens  May I just... may I just, very briefly.  Putting aside the constitutional problem, do you think the standards are the same or different between the pleading stage and the constitutional stage... and the summary judgment stage?

John Paul Stevens  So you're saying those words, strong inference, mean essentially the same thing as reasonable inference.   John Paul Stevens  Mr. Miller, going back just to the word strong, forgetting the particularization from it, do you think you can categorize the strength in percentage terms?  They have to be more than 50 percent?  More than probable cause?  We're talking all abstractly here and I find it easier to think when I think about numbers.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  At least we know that in the probable world--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --Let me just reclaim the question.  Is it stronger or weaker than probable cause in a criminal context?   John Paul Stevens  It's not trial worthy, but rather discovery worthy.   John Paul Stevens  I think the question is not whether it's trial worthy, it's whether it's worthy for discovery.  That's really what's at issue in this.   ",06-484X
1,"John Paul Stevens  Would this case be different if the defendant had consented to the entry of a preliminary injunction?   Patricia A. Millett  No, I don't think so, and I don't think courts as a matter of judicial economy want to tell the government every time we agree not to oppose, to stay the removal of an alien, that we somehow would get a bill.   John Paul Stevens  So if this had been, if they had entered into a consent decree covering just the one event on the front burner, that would have been different?   Patricia A. Millett  A consent decree is a final resolution of a claim that legally obligates the defendant, final relief that runs in favor of the plaintiff.   John Paul Stevens  But if they consented to the entry of a preliminary injunction, why wouldn't that be equally binding?   Patricia A. Millett  Because it is not a final resolution.  Preliminary injunctions are important.  They're of value to the parties.  But there's a trade-off in getting it.  The reason courts can give them is they aren't committed to final relief.  They aren't committed to final obligation, and they can decide when--   John Paul Stevens  Well, they were able to go ahead with their one demonstration that precipitated the litigation, and they would have been able to do it the same way if they had a consent decree instead of having the other side not fight very vigorously in opposition to the preliminary.   Patricia A. Millett  --The defendant who'S been fully vindicated at the end of the case shouldn't have to write checks to two attorneys instead of just their own.  There's a fundamental fairness element here.  But also on the judicial economy--   John Paul Stevens  But then why isn't the attorney... if there were a consent decree... I don't understand the difference.   Patricia A. Millett  --Because the defendant's in the control of the fairness issue in the consent decree and is not in this situation.  But the other situation, concern, is concern about judicial economy.  And there's arguments in the amicus briefs on the other side that preliminary injunctions are common.  But remember, this is... the central justification is that the plaintiff is a private attorney general who doesn't just do what they want to do, but either resolves the issue of law or obtains enduring changes in defendant's behavior that are of utility to the community at large.

John Paul Stevens  But maybe the court of appeals is in the best position to determine whether they made an error of law or not.

They've had the demonstration so it's all over.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes but Justice Breyer made the very persuasive argument that it doesn't make sense to treat both sides of the transaction exactly the same; but isn't it the fact that in many drug transactions the buyer is not treated the same way as the seller?  It's a crime to sell poison drugs but it may not be a crime to buy the poison drugs.   John Paul Stevens  But generally speaking buyers and sellers are not always treated alike in the criminal law, are they?   John Paul Stevens  Yes, but the argument in Justice O'Connor's opinion was largely linguistic.  The natural use of the word ""use"" is to say: I used it to pay for the gun... I used it to pay for the drugs, rather.

John Paul Stevens  Mr. Salmons, can I ask you a question about the importance of the whole litigation.  Am I correct in believing that there's a provision in the law that protects the defendants from damages liability if they relied in good faith on the regulation, so that what we're really talking about is whether the regulation would apply in the future rather than there being a damage issue in the case?   David B. Salmons  Well, there is a safe harbor provision that allows for reliance by employers on a statement by the agency.   John Paul Stevens  That would clearly apply to this case, would it not?     John Paul Stevens  So in your view we're really faced with a question of whether the regulation should be given prospective effect.     David B. Salmons  I'm sorry?  What would be given prospective effect?   John Paul Stevens  As to whether the Government's position should be given prospective effect because the past liability doesn't... the damage liability just doesn't exist.   David B. Salmons  Well, that is our view.  Again, I think that would be an issue that would be litigated and I'm sure litigated heavily in the hundreds of cases that are being filed under this provision.  And I think it's... one of the concerns I think of the agency here was to provide a clear statement with regard to how these seemingly conflicting provisions of the regulation are to be reconciled and applied.

Would that be constitutional?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  In my hypothesis the person is a real Republican.  He is just not the one selected as the candidate.   John Paul Stevens  Even if the information is by statute true, in my hypothetical he must be a member, but still you make the same objections.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  You're stating to suppress information.  So the plaintiff says there is nothing to prevent the nominee or the convention from publicizing widely the fact that the convention picked me as their standard bearer.  The fact that some other member of the party gets his name on the ballot doesn't prevent the public from being informed about the truth, does it?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It would prevent him from running and saying he is a Republican.   John Paul Stevens  Well, but don't you think it's relevant information?  Wouldn't a voter like to know whether a person preferred the Democrats or the Republicans?   John Paul Stevens  Only if true.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Let me ask this question: This is a facial challenge, is it not?   John Paul Stevens  And what exactly... what relief did the district court grant?  Did he enjoin the entire blanket primary or just the designation of parties?   John Paul Stevens  Do you think that was the narrowest relief he could have granted to avoid the constitutional difficulty that you see?   John Paul Stevens  Do you think it would be administerable if it was severed, if the preference provision was just deleted?   John Paul Stevens  I'm confused about the difference between a facial challenge and an as-applied challenge.  On the one hand, it's very helpful to you.  There's no evidence out there that this has ever... this has ever been a problem, so you've got to attack it right away, but then you have this relief that basically enjoins the whole... whole procedure.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes, but it also seems highly improbable if you have a nominee as a result of a convention, everybody reads the newspapers, they know who the Republican nominee is, that there's going to be such confusion that everybody thinks it's one or two of the other people who also put an R after their name.  The likelihood of massive confusion seems highly improbable to me.

Which transaction triggered the exhaustion doctrine in your judgment, the general license to Intel or the sale by Intel to Quanta.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Was the license unrestricted?  That's one of the reasons I asked the question.  Wasn't there a use restriction on the resale?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  On the condition that it be sold to someone who would not use it on non-Intel products.   John Paul Stevens  Ms. Mahoney, I understand that's really the way it's been litigated, but I have to confess I was puzzled by the court of appeals' statement that the granting of the license constituted a sale for exhaustion purposes, and they cited the Masonite case for that proposition, but it doesn't seem to me to support that proposition.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It's not exhausted by the manufacturer, is it?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It's exhausted under this view by the licensee's sale of an article that it manufactured pursuant to the license.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And it seems to think there's no distinction between the sale itself and the basic underlying license, whereas I had thought for years that there was recognized a distinction between those two transactions.   John Paul Stevens  Are you saying that this case would come out differently if instead of just requiring a notice that the... the item should only be used on Intel products, that had been a condition of the license.  If the license itself said you may manufacture and sell to only people who agree to use the product exclusively with Intel products?

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But is there any explanation for it?   John Paul Stevens  Was there any explanation for it other than a tactical explanation?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But it seems to me it's relevant because if it was suppressed for a tactical reason, it seems to me hard to say that the prosecution thought it didn't make any difference.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  What they have seen, but one of the first questions that always troubles me in a Brady case is the conduct of the prosecutor and the ethics of the profession and the whole -- whole importance of the rule is to be sure prosecutors perform their public function.  And I'm just wondering if there is any -- if this was a case of just an honest mistake, it would be one thing, but if it appears to have been a tactical decision and a tactical program, it seems to me very difficult to assume that the prosecutor thought it was really not important evidence.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So do you think the prosecutor had an ethical duty to turn over this material?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It's a simple question, yes or no?

John Paul Stevens  What about just meeting on -- on the street?  The officer meets the man on the street and asks him where he's going or something like that, and he sees a -- a bulge in the pocket that is -- convinces the officer he has a gun, but that's all.  That's the only evidence of a threat to the officer.  Is that enough?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  What if he says yes?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  General Parkhurst--   John Paul Stevens  --General Parkhurst, I -- I seem to be a little confused about the facts of this case.  I had the -- remember the testimony that she thought the -- that the encounter had become consensual, which meant that he was no longer -- in her view, no longer under -- in custody.  But are you also saying she also thought he was about to assault her and, therefore, she was in danger?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  There seems some tension between being both in danger and saying, well, the arrest was all over.   John Paul Stevens  Let me ask you -- suppose it's a roadside encounter in which the driver is changing a flat tire and the officer stops and wants to talk to him for a while and then he suddenly thinks, well, maybe this guy's armed.  Is it okay for him to go ahead and search him?   John Paul Stevens  Well, maybe he has an articulable suspicion.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Is that any different from meeting somebody on the -- on the street corner?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  The flat -- my flat tire example.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But those are roadside encounters after a traffic violation.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So you don't rely at all on the fact this is a traffic stop?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  On your second point, that is.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Why is it easier?   John Paul Stevens  Yes, but those are all cases in which there's a violation of law that preceded the activity.

Am I correct that the granting of an evidentiary hearing was based on a showing by the Petitioner that he failed to develop facts which might change the result?   John Paul Stevens  Why did the -- why did the Federal court grant a hearing?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Wasn't he only entitled to do that on the basis of a showing that there was more evidence that the State court did not consider?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So maybe the district court was dead wrong, but the assumption I think we made when we took the case was that there was a body of evidence that had not been available in the State proceeding that might be available in the Federal proceeding.   John Paul Stevens  And if that were true -- I know you disagree with that and I understand your argument.  Maybe we shouldn't have taken the case.  But if that were true and the Federal court then had to decide on the basis of all the evidence, do you read the statute to say at that time he may only rely on the evidence presented to the State court?   John Paul Stevens  All right.  Suppose he looked at the State court evidence and he says, that was not enough.  The State court's decision on the merits was reasonable based on that record.

But what the -- what the State can't do and what in particular the State courts can't do in the name of formulating State trust law is to rely on considerations that are altogether outside the trust.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Let me ask you: If the case had gone to trial without any intermediate proceeding -- they just show up for the day of trial -- and there's no record of whether he accepted the lawyer earlier, would the State judge start out with the presumption that Faretta would apply and he's going on his own, or would they start out with the assumption that he is going to have a lawyer?

To what extent do you think the similar provisions in State constitutions that were adopted more or less at the same time are relevant to our inquiry?

John Paul Stevens  You think that is... to understand the amendment, you must pay some attention to the militia requirement?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  If it limits the kinds of arms to be appropriate to a militia, why does it not also limit the kind of people who may have arms?   John Paul Stevens  How do you explain the fact that you include self-defense, but only two States, Pennsylvania and Vermont, did refer to self-defense as a permissible justification and all of the others referred to common defense or defense of the State, and in the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution itself there is no reference to self-defense?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  1895.  I'm talking about contemporaneous with the adoption of the Second Amendment.   John Paul Stevens  Just the text of the State constitutional provisions, two of them refer to self-defense.  The rest refer only to common defense; is that not correct?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I understand that judicial interpretation sometimes is controlling and sometimes is not.  But the text itself does draw a distinction, just as the Second Amendment does.  It doesn't mention self-defense.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, if you look at the individual rights I suppose you start back in 1689, the Declaration of Rights in England.  And the seventh provision that they talked about said that:  ""The subjects which are protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law. ""  Now do you think the term ""suitable to their conditions"" limited the number of people who had access to arms for self-defense?

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  If you're looking for time, let me ask you one... one question that interests me but is a little divorced from the terms of the arguments so far.  I know it is not popular to refer to refer to international commentary on issues like this, but the English law lords have filed an amicus brief discussing the international principle that nations that retain the death penalty may not extend the death penalty to crimes to which it does not presently apply.  They suggest that as a matter of international law, there's sort of a correspondence to our evolving standards of decency that have generally governed our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.  It's kind of a one-way rachet, we look at trends in one direction but we don't look to see if you suddenly have changed gears and go in the other direction.  Could you just comment on that argument?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I'm not asking that.  I just used that as an analogy to our evolving standards of decency cases which has been part of our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, that sort of is a... one way direction in which these cases go.  Do you think it's appropriate... are you aware of any case saying we can turn around and go in another direction?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Do we know more about the crime now than we did 40 years ago?   John Paul Stevens  But has that sort of a different direction from evolving standards of decency occurred at all since we first announced the evolving standards of decency and jurisprudence in this Court?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But what about the comment on the international community's view that it is really a one way rachet?  MR. CRUZ: You know, the Law Lords' brief... I have to admit personally I found really quite astonishing, and I was harkened back to some of the issues this Court considered in the Medeillin case because the Law Lords' brief argued that the United States... that this Court has no ability to determine that any other crime is subject to the death penalty.  And there were two bases: One was a treaty that the United States has never ratified.  And secondly was this inchoate international law understanding that, because other nations have made a policy determination about the death penalty, that it is forbidden to the U.S. Congress, it is forbidden to the States of the United States, and it is forbidden to this Court to ever acknowledge there is a crime that is consistent with our Constitution.  That brief, to my mind, embodied all of the dangers of the very broad arguments that we're being presented in Medeillin, that ultimately the Constitutional and the people of this country determine what is permissible and what is lawful.  This Court has chosen to look to other nations for guidance, but that brief didn't say this is guidance.  That brief said the United States is foreclosed from ever doing this because other nations have made determinations under their law.   ",07-343X
1,"John Paul Stevens  Let me ask a general question here.  Why isn't the defense of stare decisis adequate to take care of all your problems?     --Well, because FOIA allows--   John Paul Stevens  Repeated requests--     --a number of defendants--   John Paul Stevens  --but if they're all the same, wouldn't they say, well, that's the same case we had last week?     --Well, FOIA allows the case to be brought in a number of different venues.  It can be brought in the venue of the... where the requestor lives, where the documents are located, or in the District of Columbia.   John Paul Stevens  All right.     And so a person such as Herrick could ask for assistance on his project, the project of rebuilding the plane, of people scattered throughout the country.   John Paul Stevens  Correct, and he's the one who raised the suit.     And they could maintain it throughout the country.   John Paul Stevens  But did any... defeat the suit by claiming there was preclusion because of a suit in another jurisdiction, rather than stare decisis?     Well, Your Honor, the fact is that in FOIA, especially an exemption 4 case, there are special burdens on the government.  The government has the burden of proving that the exemption is warranted.  So the plaintiff can just sort of lob anything in there.  The government... there is the burden of persuading the court in each case that the exemption is warranted.  Fairchild, a private party that wants to protect its own property interests in the trade secret, is forced to go around the country litigating this over and over and over again as well.  And the courts that have considered the question recognize that the public-right nature of the interest is one that makes application of the rule particularly appropriate because both the interests of the individual litigant, the plaintiff, is reduced, but also the opportunity for vexatious relitigation is increased multiple times because of the almost infinite number of potential plaintiffs.  This case was decided by the lower court on the basis of the relationship between Herrick and Taylor.  It was the fact that Taylor had taken up Herrick's own interest.  There was the interest in the project.  The project was the restoration of the plane.  Herrick owned the plane.  Herrick had brought suit based on that interest and lost.  He asked Taylor to help him in that project.  Taylor then brings the suit to get the same documents for the same purpose.  And we think that the U.S. versus Des Moines Valley Railroad case is an example where, just shy perhaps of an actual agency relationship, because there's no control in Des Moines Valley, that still the fact that the second litigant has volunteered to take their name to, in a sense, take advantage of the fact they have independent standing--   ",07-371X

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, but the word ""Indian"" -- it says the word ""Indian"", in the last sentence,  ""21 years. ""   John Paul Stevens  I'm looking at the Government brief.  That's--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --Mr. Olson, am I not correct that the membership in the tribe is just one category of persons who are included in the broader definition of the term ""Indian""?

""The term ""tribe"" wherever used in this Act shall be construed to refer to any Indian tribe, organized band, pueblo, or the Indians residing on one reservation. ""  Now, that reference to the term ""tribe"", as opposed to ""Indian"", doesn't have any limit on the time.   John Paul Stevens  Mr. Olson, let me just make sure I get this off my chest, and then I'll be quiet.  The first sentence in section 19 defines the term ""Indian"".  And that's the section you're talking about?   John Paul Stevens  --in this Act.  The second refers to -- the second sentence refers to Eskimos.

1,"John Paul Stevens  Ms. Maynard, would you clarify one other thing for me?  The sentence in question with the word ""now"" in it and so forth, does that have the meaning that it includes descendants who are less than a half-blood, quarter-blood, eighth-blood and so forth?   John Paul Stevens  So that is an expansive definition of the term ""Indian"", right?   John Paul Stevens  Can I ask you a question?  It seems to me that the limited definition of ""the tribe"" really is quite irrelevant to this -- to this case.  The term ""Indian"" is defined to include two classes of persons: One who are members of a certain category of tribes and others who have more than half Indian blood.  It seems to me that -- and then you get to the definition of ""tribe"" that comes later.  It seems to me that when you're talking about the definition of 1934, it said tribes located west of the Mississippi.  If they just limited it to that, that wouldn't have limited the definition of ""Indian"".  I mean the definition of ""tribe"".  It would have made the category of -- of persons of Indian dissent or eligible to be treated as Indians and whose eligibility is determined by tribal membership, limited but the -- not to include all tribes.  So you can limit it, as I say, to tribes west of the Mississippi.  But then when you get down to defining the term ""tribe"", there is no such definition.  So that I just think the fight about what ""now"" means is totally irrelevant to the meaning of the definition of ""tribe"".   John Paul Stevens  It just describes the subcategory of Indian tribes who -- for whom members can qualify even though they don't have half blood.  That's the point.

John Paul Stevens  But doesn't -- don't these rules apply to ordinary traffic arrests where there really is very little risk to the officer?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  The need to search the vehicle is primarily justified by the interest in officer safety?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But the interest in preserving evidence really should only be present when there is probable cause to believe there is some evidence.

And that's what Belton really opened the door to, was container searches.  It was not just searches of things in plain view.

John Paul Stevens  Do you agree that the California Supreme Court gave an incorrect explanation to the answer to that question?  They said there was no harmless error because the -- the jury made a specific finding that rebutted that, and that finding depended on the difference between the word ""and"" and ""or"".   John Paul Stevens  No.  I'm -- I'm questioning the basis for the Supreme Court's conclusion that the error was harmless.   John Paul Stevens  Right.   John Paul Stevens  Which meant that the jury really hadn't answered the question they thought it had answered.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  If you do that, you are removing the basis for the California Supreme Court's decision.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Is that not right?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  At least the basis--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --The basis--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --for the decision was a -- was a specific finding--   John Paul Stevens  --All right.   John Paul Stevens  Isn't the special circumstance finding the one that had the word ""or"" in it, and therefore allowed the jury to give a postkilling interpretation of the event.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I thought that was what the California Supreme Court relied on?   John Paul Stevens  But do you not agree that the harmless error -- the -- the rationale of the California Supreme Court was incorrect?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  In the harmless error analysis.  Actually, I'm agreeing with you that there should have been harmless error.  Did it perform the proper--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --The -- answer was incorrect, too, wasn't it?  And that answer was incorrect?   John Paul Stevens  The difference is when you only got one theory, you know what he relied on.  When you got alternatives, how do you know which one he relied on?     --Well, you don't -- you don't, Your Honor.  And that's what the reviewing court has to decide.  But in either scenario, if it -- if you assume that the jury relied on the defective theory, then we are in the same box as in Neder, and the reviewing court would decide whether there was -- you know, they would apply the harmless error review to the missing element and decide whether there was sufficient evidence to render that error harmless; or the court could ask, well, is that uncontraverted or overwhelming evidence that the defendant would have been found guilty under the valid theory.  And that would also be a permissible inquiry.   John Paul Stevens  No.  But in this case the question is whether the uncle did it or the nephew did it.  And if there is a lot of doubt about -- about -- if there is substantial reason to believe maybe it was the uncle, they might have taken the easy case out.  I think this is vastly different from a single theory case.     Well, Your honor, here's why--   John Paul Stevens  Because it's an -- there is plenty of evidence that he might have been guilty after the fact.  There is no doubt about that.  But there is doubt about the former.     --Your Honor, here's why I think the cases aren't that different, because, you know, at a minimum from the general verdict of guilt if you take a case like this, you know that the jury found that there was an unlawful killing.  You know that the jury found that there was a robbery.  You know that the jury found that Respondent was involved in the robbery.  The only element that we don't know--   John Paul Stevens  Perhaps after -- after the death occurred.  That's all we really know.     --It is possible that the jury would have found that, and that's the question that the reviewing court would perform in harmless error review, just like if there -- basically that is the exact same question the Court would form, would do under Neder if the timing element were omitted all together.  The reviewing court would look at the evidence and decide is there sufficient evidence to support an after-the-fact participation.   ",07-544X

John Paul Stevens  Does the legislative history deal with people who are stealing identities of people who have been -- or bilking identities?  I think that legislative history cuts the other way.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But the reason for that is it's an equally culpable act where you steal something off of a field as in Morissette.  I agree the Morissette case supports you, even though they relied on it, which is interesting to me.  But that's a -- you are distinguishing between two equally culpable acts.  It doesn't even make any difference whether he knows the owner was some private farmer or the United States.  In this case, you've got two really big categories of different crimes, and to say they are treated alike is the thing that troubles me here.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  That's the point.   John Paul Stevens  Yes, but in this particular case, if you talk about identity theft, it's inconceivable that the defendant would not know about fact that there's another person involved.  And so the -- the mens rea issue is easy in this case.  The only time it's -- it's difficult is when he didn't -- when he did not use it for an identity-theft purpose.   John Paul Stevens  And those are the category of cases in which Congress wanted to have a more severe penalty.

0,"John Paul Stevens  Mr. Schneider, can I just inject this thought?  It goes back to Justice Kennedy's question.  I don't think we are just concerned about the defendants gaming the system.  I think one other very important concern is plaintiffs sometimes in small communities want to sue somebody, and sometimes they would much rather be in Federal court, because sometimes the judges are better than the local judges, and so forth.  So there are a lot of reasons why plaintiffs want to get into Federal courts.  And it seems to me it's important to have a rule that makes it easy for the plaintiff to decide what is the citizenship of the defendant, can I get into Federal court or not.  And I see it as a great argument in favor of a very simple rule to benefit plaintiffs.   John Paul Stevens  But you must acknowledge that it's a lot easier for a plaintiff -- there is some place to get on the internet and say where is their principal place and they get a simple answer.  If you get a question, well, I got to analyze their business all over the country to decide, that's a formidable obstacle for a -- for a plaintiff to overcome.

What if it had been not only an allegation but an affidavit?  Would the case be different?   John Paul Stevens  I'm kind of curious to know what your answer to my question is.   John Paul Stevens  Would the case be different if the Petitioner had filed an affidavit of undue hardship with the papers?  Same notice, everything else exactly the same.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Why is it a harder case?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And I say it's supported by an affidavit.

So if there's not only an affidavit, but an offer of proof, and then there's no answer filed and nothing in response to the notice of the -- the lender did exactly what it did here.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes.   John Paul Stevens  But your legal theory would be the same if there had been an affidavit filed and the same -- the same response by the -- by the company?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Can I just get your answer to a similar question--   John Paul Stevens  --I asked your colleague?  If the facts of this case were changed by the -- the creditor had come in and stipulated to the plan before the court and explained at the time, we think it would be better to get what money's available now rather than waiting for the interest to be collected later on, if they had stipulated to it, and then the order was entered, you would still say, 10 years later, they could charge it?

Isn't it the case that this particular warning is used in one judicial district, and the warning that was approved in Traylor was used in the rest of the State?  And so there is an interest -- the Florida Supreme Court has, in effect, required the same warning throughout the State.

Could the -- could the Federal Government have the power to detain him at the end of the 30 days?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Right.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It may not call for it.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But, of course, that goes to -- that goes to the question of the wisdom of the statute.  I think, as the case comes to us, we have to assume that there are cases out there in which there will be no solution such as the one Justice Scalia proposes.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I think that's why Congress acted, because they think there are such cases.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But we are asked to decide a question on the assumption that there are States and there are governors who will not react to the problem of particular prisoners who are released in Arizona or some place when they originally came from Michigan or whatever it is.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Absolutely, and that's why it seems to me that the constitutional answer is the same in this statute as in the case of somebody who incurs a very communicable disease and the government wants to prevent him from infecting the community.  Why is it a different constitutional question?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  I understand.  It's purely backwards looking, and it takes care of the case that -- the premise of the government's argument is that the release itself is a Federal act that has to be done responsibly, and the very release, if it causes harm to the community, can be prevented.

INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It did discuss it precisely in that footnote and it said it's a different case.   John Paul Stevens  I don't think you are correct to say the Court said there was no distinction.  It said the distinction requires the use of magic words.

John Paul Stevens  No.   John Paul Stevens  Mr. Olson--   John Paul Stevens  --may I ask one question you can answer on rebuttal?  No one has commented on the National Rifle Association's amicus brief.  None of the -- none of the litigants have.  That's in response to Justice Sotomayor's thought that there are narrow ways of resolving the problem before us.  On rebuttal, will you tell us what your view on their solution to this problem is?   John Paul Stevens  No, but to answer my question, the line suggested by the NRA is the line identified by Congress in the Snowe-Jeffords amendment dealing with individual financing of speech which would separate all of these problems.  What is your comment on that possible solution to the problem?   John Paul Stevens  Much later than 1947.

John Paul Stevens  Oh, I'm sorry.  [Laughter]   John Paul Stevens  I don't think you -- I don't think you really caught what I suggested because you treated it as an enlargement of the MCFL example.   John Paul Stevens  But that is not what the National Rifle Association argues or what Snowe-Jeffords covers.  It covers ads that are financed exclusively by individuals even though they are sponsored by a corporation.

0,"John Paul Stevens  But that was before the statute was enacted.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But isn't the basic argument that you make that a forfeiture hearing is all the process that is due?   John Paul Stevens  Now, let me ask you this question: Suppose your statute said there shall be a forfeiture hearing with all the procedures you want, but the forfeiture hearing shall take place 1 year after the seizure.  Would that be adequate?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Yes, I'm saying the minimum.  The hearing will take place 1 year after the seizure, nothing earlier or nothing later.  Would that be constitutional?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Clearly, it's possible to do it in less than a year.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, there is no practice, no background practice.  This is a new statute.  So this -- you have to have a forfeiture hearing, as you describe it, that shall take place 6 months--   John Paul Stevens  --or a year later.  Would that be constitutional?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, I understand what the Court has held.  I'm asking your view of that hypothetical statute.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  And if you agree that it's unconstitutional, then you have to agree that time is -- is relevant to the question whether the forfeiture hearing--   John Paul Stevens  --So you would then say it would be constitutional to say one hearing 1 year later?   John Paul Stevens  May I just get you to answer what I thought you were going to do at the beginning of the argument.  How do you answer my hypothetical?  You have a forfeiture hearing, but you have a provision that it shall not take place for 6 months.   William M. Jay  --And that, of course, as I think the hypothetical recognizes, Justice Stevens, is different from a statute like we have here where there's a maximum time, but it may well take place within--   John Paul Stevens  I understand it's different.  I'm just curious to know what your answer is.   William M. Jay  --My answer, Justice Stevens, is that it might well be unconstitutional as applied.  And the Court, in 8,850, says--   John Paul Stevens  Wouldn't it be unconstitutional on its face?   William M. Jay  --It wouldn't be unconstitutional on its face, Justice Stevens, because sometimes the State has a valid interest in holding property for more than a year, as Mr. Castiglione said.  In 8,850 itself, the property was held for 18 months.  The Court has said in any due process case--   John Paul Stevens  Would that justify a statute that says in all cases it shall be held for at least 18 months without telling the owner?   William M. Jay  --I think, Your Honor, that if the State responded to an 8,850 defense and said -- and said nothing other than the statute says 18 months or 10 years, and -- you know, and we have done nothing during that time, I think that it would be unconstitutional as applied.  But as a practical matter, States and the Federal Government are not sitting around doing nothing after seizing property.  They are actively investigating who has a claim, they are notifying all claimants, they are allowing -- allowing those claimants to file claims if they wish.  A majority of all seizures are uncontested.  And then whenever a claimant wants one, that claimant is entitled to an in rem judicial hearing, where all -- all claimants come into court and have -- have the government's right to seize the property adjudicated and also the affirmative defenses, such as the innocent owner defense.  Now--   John Paul Stevens  Well, what good would a Munsingwear order do, anyway?  They'll just file another lawsuit, won't they?   John Paul Stevens  Yes.   John Paul Stevens  And then if the district judge said -- having read this opinion, which was vacated, says, well, I guess it states a cause of action, I will deny the motion to dismiss -- we would be exactly where we are now.   ",08-351X
1,"John Paul Stevens  Of course, all of these problems really arise out of the fact that the effect of the court of appeals' decision basically was to overrule the motion to dismiss, left everything open on remand.  So if we said it is moot, you'll just get another plaintiff and bring another lawsuit, which is what you do if the Court -- we are trying to get into the case much earlier than we should, it seems to me.  Just let the proceedings go ahead on remand and find out what all the -- all these factual answers that -- or these questions that should be answered.

Supposing a company appointed a committee to decide whether or not to fire X.  And the committee came back and said: Yes, you should fire him.  He's too old, and he's late to work every day.  Now -- and that's all the evidence in the record.  Would the -- would the judge be obliged to enter a judgment on summary judgment -- at the end of the plaintiff's case, to enter judgment for the defendant?   John Paul Stevens  Because all that would have been proved was that there was one motivating factor there, but not necessarily a decisive one.   John Paul Stevens  But he has only proved that it had been one of two possible motivating factors.  But that's sufficient in your view to get to the jury?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Mr. Phillips, let me just--   John Paul Stevens  --I'm not quite sure I understand one thing.  If it's a motivating factor, it's enough to get by summary judgment and get the case to the jury, but the -- the defendant will still win, if I understand all this, if he -- if the defendant proves, yes, I did do and it may have had an influence on it, but we would have fired him anyway.  And if he -- if he can prove under Mount Healthy that, yes, he thought about age and that -- what raised the issue and everything else, but after he got all through, he was clear he fired him because he was a lousy salesman--   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  --and he wins.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So he does not lose just because you say it's a motivating factor.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Well, but not only that, but the jury would be free to say, well, there were both causes, and the one was illegal.  But under the Mount Healthy defense, if they are convinced they would have fired this guy anyway, the company gets off.   John Paul Stevens  No, but inevitably in these cases the employer is really -- whether he calls it an affirmative defense or -- or just a regular resistance to the plaintiff's case, the issue is: Did -- would he have fired him anyway?  And -- and if he -- if -- if that's what the jury believes, you can take Justice Breyer's view and say that's -- that's not a sufficient defense because they acted illegally.  But if you are allowed that, you are saying, notwithstanding the illegal motive, if you show that the real reason I fired him was unrelated to that, then -- the compelling reason -- you win.

And that wouldn't necessarily mean you are excluding States from also enforcing.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  May I ask you this question?  Naturally, if it's State laws, clearly they can look at, but what if New York was trying to enforce its discrimination laws in an employment context or in context where they said you are charging minority depositors -- giving them lower rates of interest than you give Caucasian depositors?

Anders  The mother may have most of the custodial rights, what we would think of as physical custody, but the convention protects rights of custody.

Is that -- how did that get in the record, the revenue sharing aspect of their -- of the different teams' participation?   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Would -- wouldn't that -- that affidavit support the conclusion that this is basically a procompetitive agreement because it tends to make competition stronger on the playing field, and therefore, that's a sufficient defense under the rule of reason, and that's the end of the ball game?

0,"John Paul Stevens  Well, why not?  It is a successive prosecution.   John Paul Stevens  It is in the sense of an indictment that took place after the other acquittal.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Isn't there a difference in the fact that in the first case where there's -- where there was a conflicting simultaneous verdict, one can explain the acquittal on grounds of leniency or compromise or something like that, that says that, therefore, we will give effect to the -- the conviction when they're simultaneous because of the reasons why there may be irrationality in the conflict.  But there is no reason to doubt the -- the validity of the acquittal in this case.   John Paul Stevens  But if they had time.  And when you have 150 counts, it's entirely possible they just didn't reach a decision on it.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  When you have a case in which there is no conflict between a guilty and an innocent verdict, there isn't -- there is no reason to doubt the integrity of the acquittal.   John Paul Stevens  But the reason for that is there are doubts about the integrity of the acquittal.  They probably compromised, just to say not to be too tough on--   John Paul Stevens  --No, here you have sequential prosecutions, and there's no reason to question the integrity of the acquittal in this case.   John Paul Stevens  But the key to your argument is the government is entitled to one full and fair opportunity to try its case.  It had that opportunity the first time around.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  If there were no separate counts, that would have been -- that would have been a fair -- that would be the end of the matter.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But it has -- but it has the right to retry in the same position as it would have been if it had not brought the first proceeding.  And if it had not brought the first proceeding in this case, it would have been barred.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  Why not?   John Paul Stevens  Oh.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  That's because we have the Dunn doctrine, which itself is questionable.  It basically says there is a certain situation in which we will tolerate what may be an irrational verdict, and the reason we tolerate it is that the acquittal itself may be explained on other grounds.  Namely--   John Paul Stevens  --But the whole -- whole doctrine of inconsistent verdicts depends on the assumption that what appears to be an irrational inconsistency may have another explanation.   John Paul Stevens  But one hung jury followed by a second when there has been an acquittal the first time around is not customary.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  So the difference is in the -- in the first trial, you're not impugning the integrity of the jury's verdict.  You're following the acquittal, and that's true in the compromise cases, the Dunn case and those cases, but that's not the case here because you're talking about two different juries.  You're saying the second jury should have an -- an opportunity to correct what the first jury did, even though it would not have that opportunity if the first jury had not faced the issue.   John Paul Stevens  It should have, but it didn't.  We know that.  And we just know they did not reach a conclusion on this issue, but they did reach a conclusion on the count on which they acquitted.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  But you make the same presumption when there's an inconsistent verdict, but you say even if it's irrational we'll go along with it because of the one jury, and they may have had non -- unsound legal reasons for saying, well, we'll let the guy off on the one count.   John Paul Stevens  The jury did not take irrational action in this case.  The only action -- that's relevant was the acquittal.  The other they didn't act.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It would be irrational if they had returned a verdict, but they said we can't agree -- for who knows why.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  It's not all that clear, because, as you argue, the court -- the district court was correct in analyzing the -- the estoppel issue.  And it's obviously a very difficult issue because judges have disagreed about it and the government and your opponent disagree on it.  So, it's entirely possible that the jury just wasn't able to figure it all out.   INTERRUPTING John Paul Stevens  The jury could not have been as confused as the court of appeals was.   ",08-67XX
