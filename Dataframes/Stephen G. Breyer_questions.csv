1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What has that to do with it?  I don't see what that has to do with it at all.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, the reason I say that is I thought we were following a statute, and what the statute tells us is that the value of what they receive has to equal $4,000.  They receive a set of promises to pay so much a month and the right to repossess if those promises are not kept.  Now, that's what the statute tells us to do.  So let's do it.  What do we care how they arrived at the $4,000?   Stephen G. Breyer  Whatever it said in Rash, reading the statute, unless they actually contradicted that, doesn't the statute say what I just said?  So the problem in the case is how do we value the stream of payments plus the repossession value?   Stephen G. Breyer  I would have thought that that kind of thing is something bankruptcy judges are paid to make judgments about all the time.   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course, you do.   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course, you do.  There is a risk of nonpayment and anything that didn't take that into account would not be equating the property with the $4,000.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's evidence at a different time before you had all the considerations.  I mean, we're going in circles, and I mean, in some respects it's good, in some respects it's bad.   ",02-1016
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  How...  how many default?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, how do we know how...  how many...  what's the percentage of people in this chapter that default within a year on...  on a payment of about $128 a month I guess, that was a small percentage of what they were paying into the court?  What's the figure?   Stephen G. Breyer  60 percent fail within a year?  You said that 40 percent failed overall.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.   Stephen G. Breyer  I asked you how many...  this is...  or let's take it then giving you the benefit of the doubt.  The payment plan was for 17 months.  What is the percentage of people who fail to make a...  I guess it was about 10 percent or 20 percent of the amount he was paying into court.  How many fail to make that kind of payment within 17 months?   Stephen G. Breyer  Correct.  That's what I would think.  So what is wrong with us saying just by chance what the statute says?  What the statute says is, bankruptcy judge, here's what you do.  You create a stream of payments such that that stream of payments plus the value of the repossession equals $4,000.  Now, that's your job.  Go do it.  So I would have thought, if I were the bankruptcy judge, the way I'd do it would be by looking to the prime rate and then asking me...  asking you or others to tell me how much riskier this is than the prime rate, and I'd choose a number.  And I can't imagine how we're going to come one whit closer than that general instruction, but you'll tell me why it is possible to come closer.   Stephen G. Breyer  Contract rate...  if there has to be a number that's wrong, it has to be that one.   Stephen G. Breyer  The contract rate by definition was entered into at some significant period of time prior to the present, and the present, by chance in this instance, is 2 years later, and we know that interest rates fell at least 1 or 2 percent during that time.   Stephen G. Breyer  So...  what?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's impossible.  The prime rate...   Stephen G. Breyer  If that's so, then the risk went up.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.     It isn't?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, okay.  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, because it's a usury problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  So...  so you would be free with your experts to come in and say why it happens to be that the bankruptcy judge is wrong to take the prime rate and add a risk factor, but ordinarily a contract entered into in advance would not be good evidence of what the interest rate is today.  Now, where am I wrong in that?   Stephen G. Breyer  At a prior time.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, yes, of course.  I'm...  but I'm...  I'm simply saying isn't it true by definition that a contract entered into at an earlier period of time where interest rates fluctuate is not going to be very good interest...  evidence of what that interest rate is today.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that may be.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that may be, but what I didn't understand about your answer is when you said that the contract rate must be more accurate than the formula.   Stephen G. Breyer  Since the formula by definition is perfect...   Stephen G. Breyer  Since the formula is an instruction to equate the value of the stream of payments plus repossession with $4,000, the formula by definition is perfect.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why isn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  You're saying I take...  you're saying that...   Stephen G. Breyer  Wait.   Stephen G. Breyer  Answer...   Stephen G. Breyer  Would it satisfy you if we said this?  Suppose we said we see what we're after here.  The objective is to equate the stream of payments plus repossession with $4,000.  Now, on the one hand, we know it can't be lower than the prime.  On the other hand, if the creditor wants to come in and give a...  present his evidence, the contract, of how risky this person is, then in fact it is evidence absolutely.  And the bankruptcy judge will look at it, and he'll try to figure out the pluses and the minuses, what's happened to the interest rate, whether this particular person is a good or bad risk, and he'll choose a number.  Don't judges do things like that all the time?   Stephen G. Breyer  But no.  But does what I say satisfy you?   Stephen G. Breyer  If not...  because?   Stephen G. Breyer  Nobody is disagreeing with you about that.  That...  what we're...  I think what we're trying to get to...  it's a practical question.  I actually think my approach is more perfect than Justice Scalia's perfect approach.     [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  But the reason is it asks the right question.  Now, what you're telling me is that by asking the right question, the bankruptcy judges systematically have not done it right.  And...  and I see your point.  So...  so what we're...  so we're trying to think of a form of words we could say which would lead...  I can't say take the contract rate because I know that must be wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  We could say take the contract rate and go down, and then they'll have the same problem.  I...  I mean...  all right.  But that's what we want them to do, is to honestly equate the value of the payments with the $4,000.   Stephen G. Breyer  I think everybody wants that, and we're searching...  at least I am...  for a way of how to do that.  You keep telling me you take contract rate.  I hate to tell you I keep thinking no.   Stephen G. Breyer  I understand.  Tell me an...  a question I don't know the answer to.   Stephen G. Breyer  When...  when...  if you repossess...  if he defaults again...  I mean, the first time he got into bankruptcy.  Now, we've got the plan.   Stephen G. Breyer  And suppose he doesn't make the payments on the truck.  Does it then cost you a lot of money to go back even though you say to the judge, judge, this is the second time?  We'd like our truck now.  It's only worth $2,000 now.  And you still have to pay the $75, get your witnesses and everything the second time?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that compensated for to some extent...   Stephen G. Breyer  that factor by the fact they're using Blue Book value to value the car rather than what it'd actually be worth in your hands once you repossess it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe they're not.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what about then taking this idea?  I'm trying to figure out how...  we say, okay, we really mean it.  It has to equate those two things.  Now, that put...  and...  and then stop and say, you can do it with...  I...  I think, you know, prime plus or whatever, maybe the other.  But...  but then put the burden back on you to produce some real evidence and statistics about what happens to people we don't know about.  Now, who are those people?  We agree they've gone into bankruptcy, so they're risky, but they're also trying to get a second chance, and they also want to keep things like the truck because it will help them in their business.  And the bankruptcy judge has sat there and looked them in the eye.  And you have all those things about it which you don't have about the people you're giving the 21 percent to which is a great mass of undifferentiated people.  So then you have the burden of trying to bear it out with statistics and so forth that these people really are risky.  And the bankruptcy judge can't just sit there and say, oh, I feel sorry for them.  All right?  What about something like that?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I mean, you wouldn't have to go that far.  Maybe you just have to do it in one or two.  But at least we'd get to the stage of people who have trucks and use them for a year and, you know, at least we'd have somewhat better information than just knowing about the default rate in bankruptcy cases in general.  And we get a little finer than that.  You see, that's what I'm trying to work with.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't have an answer.   ",02-1016
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So what's your view of that?  Because if you're right on that ICC bill of lading and the limit is the same, we don't have to reach the other question, which I think is much harder.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So what are we... what are we supposed to do?  What do I look up to find out whether you're right about this and we don't have to reach the other question?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Why is it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why is it?  Now, this is maybe only me, but I don't think it is.  What... the basic question, in my mind anyway, in respect to the Hamburg Sud bill of lading is one I would have thought would have been answered in the law clearly.  I said the Supreme Court cases aren't clear because they don't say what the theory behind them is.  I read all these amicus briefs.  They don't really seem to me to come to the point.  You have a shipper of some goods.  He goes to an independent freight forwarder who then enters into a series of contracts.  I don't care if they were ships or trains or whatever.  And something happens to the goods.  Maybe they weren't shipped.  Maybe that independent freight forwarder went bankrupt.   Stephen G. Breyer  And the... Mr. Shipper wants to sue one of these carriers.  Well, he didn't sign the contract, and the person who signed it was an independent freight forwarder, not wholly his agent.  Okay.  Can he do it or not do it?  I have all about the law of France in one of these briefs, except they just don't tell you the answer to that question.  They just don't tell you whether in France, Sweden, or Finland or some other place, when the shipper wants to go and sue one of those carriers, he can recover.  There's a... there's a limit... liability limitation in the contract.  The contract is enforceable.  There could be 100 situations where it comes up.  What's the answer?  I'm amazed that that's never been answered in 200,000... 2,000 years of people shipping things.  All right.  So... so why is this so unclear?  Why can't I get an answer?  And I just can't find it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I agree it's very unreasonable.  But even I can't say there's a general rule of law against behaving unreasonably.  So, therefore, I look for a theory.  What's the legal basis?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is it clear that they're applicable... the tariff as a matter of law... to a shipper that hires an independent freight forwarder to arrange for the shipment?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   ",02-1028
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?  I mean, all over the world, people ship with these bills of lading.  The shipper simply gets a piece of paper.  It says it's a bill of lading and it's going to be sent to anyone of 5 billion destinations.  Four billion of the 5 billion will involve some little bit of inland travel.  Now, if suddenly the laws of 50 States were to apply to all those bill of ladings, wouldn't it be an all-time mess?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there anything I can read that would help me decide if it really would be a mess or wouldn't be a mess?   Stephen G. Breyer  But I mean, the... the argument, which I'm really interested in your addressing, is that overall, naturally any insurance company would like to get the money if it could.  But overall, a system that's developed where the shippers buy first party insurance and get their money if they're hurt and the carriers all know their tort liability is limited in contract liability is one that overall avoids lawyers, avoids lawsuits, avoids tremendous expense, and has led to lower rates and better service.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  This happens all the time.  If it happens all the time that the subrogated insurer goes and sues someone down the line with whom the shipper himself did not enter into a liability limiting contract, why, after reading these briefs, do I feel I can't find a case in point--   Stephen G. Breyer  --but for, arguably, this old case of the Supreme Court?   Stephen G. Breyer  Hartford Insurance, okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So maybe that is what's happened.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, let me ask you.  Is it necessarily going to be true that if we agree with you and shippers in general did want to have first party insurance and did want to contract for these lower rates, et cetera, you just couldn't create the system because carriers down the line would look back and see that the independent freight forwarder was the party in interest at the first contract for transportation would have no idea whether, behind that independent freight forwarder, there stood another independent shipper or there did not, and thus would not know whether his liability was really limited or not, and therefore would have to charge a price that in fact reflected a liability regime where he might have to pay up?   Stephen G. Breyer  But I'm now taking your answer to my question is your--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --No, there is no way to do it--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --if in fact... all right.  If there is a way to do it, I want to find out.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The problem with the professors was I thought not all, but most of the cases they cite, they're citing for the proposition that the person, i.e., the independent freight forwarder, is indeed independent and not the agent of the shipper.  I... I got that.  But what I wonder, of course, is whether that fact translates in their law into the conclusion that therefore the carrier ultimately is... that he cannot assert a liability limitation.  That's the ultimate question.  And there were one or two that did seem to say that, but most of them just didn't seem to talk about that issue.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Britain does it differently though, I take it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Britain does it differently in--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, you'd have to say... I mean, you'd have to say that Northern case rests on the principle that the agent... he's not an agent for most purposes, but he is an agent for the purpose of... of entering into a liability limitation.  And that's not unheard of in the law.  It... it's an agency type power that's given to a person who isn't an agent.  And the argument would be, well, that's the precedent here.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why, if that's right... let... just why... as a simple, empirical question, if... if this is so, you know, fairly clear, he's not an agent, independent, you can't enforce the liability thing, why aren't the case books filled or the... the reports filled with cases where an insurer went... and it subrogated, went and sued somebody down the line and they asserted a liability limitation and people laughed and said it's not... you can't assert that, he never entered into a contract with you?  Why isn't that true in all these eight foreign countries?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why can't we find those cases?   Stephen G. Breyer  To find judgments.  No, I'm sorry.  We would find in insurance records, for example... insurance companies... they're proud of the money they get back.  It would be easy to locate lots of instances where insurance companies did recover, subrogated, from carriers down the line who were unable to assert liability limitations.   INTERRUPTING ",02-1028

I'm not saying you even have to convince me to win your case, I'm just saying that for...  I'd like to know why, in ordinary, common-sense English, this isn't the most reasonable thing in the world?

I'm not...  not asking you facetiously because I think maybe you think you want to tie it in and I just want you to do it.   Stephen G.

But I have the right language anyway, and I better read it again is your point.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It says, nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a section... in the absence.  Now, does that create the right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

And then the last sentence means anybody can get a right for contribution any other time as well.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  This isn't much of a section.  I mean, it's sort of interesting what it's trying to do there.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  But in your view that's how we should read it.

It's emphasis because in fact during or after, the word during adds nothing.  The word, or after, adds nothing.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose you didn't give that very broad meaning to any entity, but you included State entities that had been in the business and were otherwise authorized by State law to go into this business and then the State changes its law and without having a section (b) requirement, because you have loads of power under section (b), so we assume the entity meets section (b)'s test, but it passes another law which says, by the way, the municipality can't go into it.  And previously they had.  So...  so we're not...  we're...  we're talking about only entities that have proved themselves fit, willing, and able to offer the...  the...  to offer the business.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, why...  why would that not be included?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what we want...  we want...  we have implicitly there and it would be necessary in the State case but not in the private entity case an entity that is fit, willing, and able.  And...  and an entity that is fit, willing, and able can include a municipality.  So what this statute is after is the State passing a new law changing the status of an entity that was previously fit, willing, and able.   Stephen G. Breyer  That...  that's correct, but it's defined by State regulatory law in respect to those entities at least that have previously offered the business.   Stephen G. Breyer  You see, in other words, but your argument here is coming down to the difficulty of trying to draw the distinction I'm suggesting.   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose they...  they did...  is it totally Ashcroft you're relying on?  Gregory v. Ashcroft?  The...  suppose you looked at the statute as saying it doesn't prohibit States from enacting all kinds of laws that have the effect of prohibiting people to enter the business.  Tax laws, for example, might leave them without money to do it.  It's only talking about specific laws aimed at saying you can't enter.  And if it's aimed at specific laws saying you can't enter this business, then couldn't you say where a State's entity otherwise would have the authority to enter, then the State cannot pass a law that says in those circumstances you cannot enter telecommunications such as municipality as well as private company?  Now, what's wrong with that interpretation?  What I'm doing is I'm trying to deal with what I thought of myself and they confirm is the major objection that this can't be administered once we start down the path I'm just starting down.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  It would be...  the question would be whether they had the authority to do it.  If they had the authority to do it, then the State...  what it could not do is it could not pass a law which aims at primarily...  aims at primarily their authority to enter telecommunications.  They could do all kinds of other things including removing authority as long as it were general, and then there would be middle cases where the authority, you see, is...   Stephen G. Breyer  It's a one-way ratchet.   ",02-1238
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But it doesn't mean any fish, for example.  I mean, there are a lot of things it doesn't mean.   Stephen G. Breyer  If...  if for purposes of...  will you assume with me...  and I may be the only one who thinks this.  But I think when you use words like any entity or the word any, that there's an implicit scope, and since I think there's an implicit scope, I'm trying to define that scope.  So I don't want to...  I mean, it's not going to help me for you to say, well, it's clear because I don't think it's clear.  But at that point, I now want to...  to find out whether...  explore what you said that, well, if we did apply this to the States and their municipalities, all we would really be doing is targeting laws.  Now, I did my best to pose some questions along those lines, but I was met with the answer which strikes me as a pretty good answer.  There's just no way to do what you're suggesting.  It's going to be a nightmare.  Justice Scalia suggested one reason it was a nightmare.  And I'd add that in the case of private companies, this statute is designed to give the private company the right to enter or the right to quit.  Once you apply it to a municipal entity, it has the right to enter, but it could never quit.  Now, that would be bizarre.   Stephen G. Breyer  So given the...  the sovereign immunity...  you know, the sovereign...  all...  all the things we've been talking about in general, given the difficulty of drawing a line, which seems virtually impossible or very hard, and given the one-way ratchet I just described, it can't be that Congress intended to include municipal entities within the scope of the word, any entity.  What...  what is your...  that's...  I'm trying to get to the merits.   Stephen G. Breyer  What's your response to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I see the answer to that part, which is you're saying they have to do it anyway, and I understand that.  Whether...  I'm not sure I agree, but I understand it.  What about the part that it's a one-way ratchet?  And there I think that local governments unlike local private businesses act through regulation, at least normally.  And so the statute talks about a requirement, a local requirement or a local regulation, and therefore, a State, State A, that does not permit its municipalities to go into the business, then passes a statute that does permit it, then the local council passes a regulation that says we'll do it, which is now a requirement, and when either tries to repeal either, they run right straight into your...  to this statute forbidding it as you interpret it.  And now, that's why I say it's a one-way ratchet in respect to municipalities, but not a one-way ratchet in respect to private businesses.   Stephen G. Breyer  But the State could not repeal the statute.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what does...  what does...  Is there any argument for putting...  leaving this up to the commission?  That is, can it be done?  Because I can see a complex interpretation that may be workable that you're suggesting and may be helpful competitively, frankly.  And I also can see some good arguments against, assuming Congress intended that complex interpretation.  But under those circumstances, maybe Congress purposely leaves it somewhat ambiguous permitting the commission to go one way or the other, and although you've lost it in the commission so far, maybe in the future, the commission would say, well, we think we want to Chevronize this, in other words.

I thought you answered Justice Souter by saying that they do have an obligation even there to break even overall?   Stephen G.

[Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  the...  the...  then under those circumstances, there would be no remedy...   Stephen G. Breyer  for the consumer of the stores.  There's no government agency anybody could appeal to?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  So that's...   Stephen G.

Breyer  I take it that the directors are appointed by the President of United States, almost all of them.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So nine out of the eleven are appointed.  Are they confirmed by Congress?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, all right.  So...  and they're represented by the Solicitor General, and their license plates have government on them.   Stephen G. Breyer  But, I mean, and...  and they say that they're part of the Government, and 80 or 90 percent of what they do is not what private industry does at all and you have remedies against all of it except...  under other statutes or powers of review within the Government, except for a small portion, I take it it is a small portion, this greeting card business.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, then, so you're...  in other words, I thought you were selling them sacks, you wanted to sell them burlap sacks.   Stephen G. Breyer  they're some kind of sack.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?  Why... why... suppose that you have a... a bank that guarantees a debt, and the debt is Smith's debt.  And the guarantee is to pay, including tax debts.  That's what it says.  It was a condition of the borrowing or some other thing.  Now, why wouldn't State law govern the period of time in respect to which any creditor, including the Government, has to assert a... a claim under that note, let's say, or under that particular written guarantee since the liability there is a creation of State law and the State would have the right to define its contours?  And after all, that guarantor is not the taxpayer.  The... the guarantor's liability arises solely out of the fact that he happens to have entered into a note with a guarantor who promised to pay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Say a private--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, yes, and then I'm going to say why isn't this that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  So if I... if I enter into a promise with you and say in return for my lending, you know, whatever it is, I... I promise that I will pay your tax debts, but by the way, I don't want to pay any tax debt that isn't definite before January the 5th, 2004 or 2010.  I don't want to pay anything that arises--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Okay.  So it's a substantive procedural distinction.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  See, that's what I'm really wondering about.  I mean... but... but I mean, A, they may have not have raised it below.  B, it's not within the scope of the question.  C, it may not make any difference because the State and Federal may give you enough time anyway.  But if you do have to get to it, I'm... I'm a little worried about it because I don't... I don't really see why it should be Federal.   INTERRUPTING ",02-1389
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  This would be an odd State law, wouldn't it?  Imagine that I guarantee a debt or suppose a partner is like a guarantor.  And suppose that the primary... person primary... primarily liable is in litigation with the debtor... the creditor, rather.  And because of delays and so forth, it takes about 15 years to resolve this litigation.  I've never heard of a guarantor who wouldn't become liable at the time the thing is final and that the... he just becomes... I mean, how does it work?  I would have thought a guarantor is liable for the debt the debtor owes.  How does the statute work, the State statute?   Stephen G. Breyer  It has nothing to do with exhaustion of remedies.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm... and I'm talking about States... the State insofar as it sees the partner as a guarantor of the liability that is created by a different entity, namely the partnership.  And I'm asking if under State law of California, wouldn't it be the case that if he's a guarantor and you get the statute of limitations on a matter to determine liability extended, that the guarantee also extends.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There's no State law that says you have to sue the guarantor before the liability that he's guaranteeing is determined.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If that's correct, what are we arguing about?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, yes.  You're back to your question of whether under partnership law in fact this is a guarantor or the equivalent or a surety.  I understand that argument, but it sounds to me as if that argument is resolved against you, this statute of limitations argument is a serious red herring because it won't matter.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  If the primary argument, which you want to argue, that they're taxpayers or that they are primarily liable, you win it or you lose it.  If you win it, you win.  If you lose it, your statute of limitations argument adds nothing.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's my... that's what I'm thinking.   Stephen G. Breyer  The last part.  They are for... they are not taxpayers in the meaning of the statute who are liable for something that is a tax.  And I don't know why that wouldn't be.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And State law makes them, in effect, guarantors of debts.  This is a tax debt.  So they're guarantors of the tax debt.  So, therefore, they're liable for the tax or sureties or some other equivalent word.   Stephen G. Breyer  What is the problem?  Suppose... I'm... I'm failing to see it but maybe... suppose it's true that what the Uniform Partnership Act says is true.  Partners are, quote, in the nature of guarantors, end quote, rather than principal debtors on the debts of the partnership.  So let's suppose they're like guarantors.  I would have thought that State law was something along the lines of a guarantor must be sued in order to collect a... a guaranteed debt within a period of time after it becomes determined that such a debt exists.  Now, I would think that that's how the normal State law runs.  So unless there's something Federal to the contrary... and by the way, if there is, they have 10 more years.  But unless there is something Federal to the contrary, there's no problem with bringing this case.  So the only question in this case is are they in the nature of guarantors.  And I'd be interested... well, A, I'm interested in your comment on what I just said, and I'm also interested in the comment of why they're not guarantors.   INTERRUPTING ",02-1389
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask you a basic question--   Stephen G. Breyer  --which maybe others understand, but I'm confused.  Imagine that this has nothing to do with Indians.  It is simply an ordinary contract.  Now, my understanding is that ordinary contracts say subject to appropriations.  So we have to decide was there an appropriation.  In our imaginary department of Government, the appropriation is $1 billion.  Nothing is earmarked for anything.  They enter into contracts that amount to $999 million.  Now, they pay out $990 million, and their... what the department says is, look, everybody knows we need at least $10 million to run our central bureaucracy.  So there's no valid contract here.  The appropriation wasn't made.  Now, my understanding of ordinary Government contract law is to decide whether that $10 million was in principle available for the contracts.  You look to something called the purpose-time-amount test.  So was it during the same time?  Yes.  Is it in an appropriate amount?  But is it available for this purpose?  Ah, I'm not sure.  All right.  Now, I want... if I have the... the theory of it right, I want you to tell me what the money was in your case that is the equivalent of the $10 million in my example that you believe in principle was available to pay these... for this Indian expenditure.  Just pretend it's a regular contract.  What is the equivalent of that $10 million?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, okay.  And anything else?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, forget this statute for a second because I'll stop you there.  I want you to tell me why those sums... I get the time.  I get the amount.   Stephen G. Breyer  Explain to me why it is one of the purposes for which those appropriations were made, i.e., the equivalent of the $10 million, to go pay for this.   Stephen G. Breyer  It was one of the purposes.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So you think... you and the Government agree then that were this an ordinary contract case, there is no doubt that a legally binding contract would have been entered into and the clause, subject to appropriations, would not work for the Government.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  Were it an ordinary--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --were it an ordinary contract.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So our issue as far as you're concerned... and I'll ask the Government the same question... is, is this contract different from an ordinary contract because of A, B, C, D Indian reservations, et cetera?  And your claim is, I can't find any difference.  And their claim is there will be some difference.  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  I think they disagree with you about the purpose in respect to the core Government function.   ",02-1472
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, they just did, the 2 percent.  So my question to you is the same.  I asked, let's imagine this had nothing to do with tribes, nothing to do with it.  It was a typical, ordinary Government contract for pencils.  All right?  Or for soda water.  Now, and everything were the same.  Under those circumstances, just an ordinary contract... and they point to that 2 percent and they say that is legally speaking... we didn't expect you to pay it.  We just won a lawsuit in the Court of Claims.  But... but we have... we have a contract here.  Okay?  That's what we're just saying.  The... the subject to appropriation clause doesn't nix the contract because that 2 percent is available, legally speaking, time, purpose, and... and amount.  Classic.  Now, what's the Government's view there?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is it available or not were this an ordinary contract?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm asking... all right.  Are... is the Government's view then let's treat this just as an ordinary contract?  Still it... there was no money available.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Legally speaking under the time-purpose-amount test.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I would like an answer to my question, yes or no.  If this were an ordinary contract with a subject to appropriations clause, is... would the Government be saying this is invalid because the appropriations were not there?   Stephen G. Breyer  There must be a yes or no answer to that.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  What it is is a contract for pencils.  Can you not... is it impossible--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --to make... you see what I'm driving--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Correct, and which are the funds that are... that would be available here?  Which are they?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If this were under Blackhawk.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Then let me do this then.   Stephen G. Breyer  You say if this were a classic, ordinary contract, the money would have been available legally speaking.  Nobody says practically speaking, and they could have brought their lawsuit.  Now, tell me specifically, if you can... and this may take you the whole time.  You want to make whatever argument you want.  What is it that's special about this contract that brings it out of ordinary contracting principles?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't say that.  What it says is otherwise contractable.  And they could certainly... for a lay person like me in this, you'd think, well, we could have a provision that says $180,000 is hereby authorized to be spent only for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or Secretary of Interior.  Well, if it said that, then that's not otherwise contractable because there's a statutory limit.   Stephen G. Breyer  So otherwise contractable sounds like a... a statutory question.   Stephen G. Breyer  That... that all may be true, of course.  They're talking about don't contract out to the Indians something that should be done in Washington.  But what has that got to do with the issue?  We're talking, I thought, about... about Government contracts.  People who enter into Government contracts need certainty.  They have to know whether that word, subject to appropriations, invalidates the contract or whether they have a valid contract.  And a set of principles have come up that are used to decide that.  And under that set of principles, money is available to pay for the contract if it's time, purpose, and amount.  Okay?  That's the principle.  And--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and I don't see anything contrary to that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, he's not.  But if... if... where I'm really coming from, to be honest... and I'd like... you might as well reply to what I'm actually... is why I'm asking these slightly hostile questions.  [Laughter]  I... I read here... look, the question really is was this money like the bureaucracy money.  Is it legally speaking an appropriation available, not practically speaking but legally?  And here it seems to me, in looking through this somewhat quickly, that you say no, but the Board of Contract Appeals say yes.  And so I think in my mind, you know, one group of people who really know about this is the Board of Contract Appeals.  So if they're saying that money from a contract point... a point of normal contract law is legally available, I promise you I'm predisposed to think they're right.  So I might as well expose that to you so you can tell me now why I'm wrong or they're wrong or whatever.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, there is... is... the kind... the money that's available to one tribe can't be taken for the other.  But I thought the Board of Contract Appeals was saying taking that into account, there's still enough money left over.  Am I wrong about that?  I thought you should take money from one tribe to give it to another.  What did they think?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

I thought what they said to him right off the bat was, Mr. Tovar, you're without counsel.  I see you waived application for a court-appointed attorney.  You want to represent yourself at today's hearing.  So what I thought the State was saying is that that's sufficient.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I didn't even think that was an issue in this case.  I didn't see it in the petition.  I didn't see it in the response to the petition.  Maybe it would be an issue for the lower court.  So I'm not sure what to do with that.  I can see it's ambiguous, but if you want to concede it, that's fine with me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, nobody is really... at least, is that an issue in front of us?   Stephen G. Breyer  So what is your... what everybody I think is trying to do is ask you what is your argument on the point that we thought was why we granted the case, or at least I thought why.   Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Did they say... did they... I mean, I'm... I am impressed by the fact that rule 11(b), which is a product of the rulemaking process and presumably, I'm sure, it reflects the experience of trial lawyers, which is not my experience, and... and they try to get in things like the ABA.  Yet, they do not require that you tell the lawyer how useful... you tell the... the individual how useful the lawyer will be.  They do require that you tell the defendant how... that he has a right to a lawyer at every stage of the proceeding.  So I took from the fact that the ABA and everybody else lobby nonstop for this kind of thing that they felt it was very desirable but not so important that you had to actually include it in the colloquy.  Otherwise, it would be there in rule 11(b).  So now, what... what does the ABA say?  Do they say it's a constitutional requirement?  Do they try to change even the rule?  No.  I don't think they do.   Stephen G. Breyer  But you're... you're saying that the Constitution requires the thing that the lawyers themselves through their groups have felt is desirable but not important enough to put in the rules.  Wouldn't we go to the rules first?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So if we agree with you about that, the thing to do is send it back.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that right?   Stephen G.

Breyer  Well, I guess if we just... what we'd normally do here is we say... suppose we didn't agree with your... on your basic argument.  We say, well, you lose on that one.  Now we send it back from appropriate proceedings, whatever is appropriate.  I don't know.  At that point, I guess you'd go back to the Iowa court and you'd say you didn't address this other issue which I had in my brief.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there a reason we can't do that?  I don't know.   Stephen G. Breyer  Do you think it would be valuable in California to have somebody there to say, by the way, this is the second time you've stolen a chicken and if you plead guilty and do it again, you may go to jail the rest of your life?  Or if you're in, say, Alaska, this seems to be an assault case but it's connected, in fact, with the charge of sexual assault.  So if you plead guilty, the rest of your life you're going to have to be registered as a sex offender.  Or to say, for example, if you're immigrant, you know, it may not seem to be important to you because it just happened to be hitting your child or something, you know, a slap or something like that, but you're going to be deported likely if you plead guilty.  Would it be useful to have a lawyer there to tell them that?   ",02-1541
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right. But then the problem is that I think I have and others is, what are these standards?  Now, you propose, one, look to the mind of the legislature.  We'll do that.  They'll always want party advantage, always.  Look to the extent to which they depart from historically drawn lines.  Well, the historically drawn lines themselves are random.  Third, history.  Why is history the key?  Third, look to see whether or not the minority party might get the majority of votes, but the minority of seats.  Whether they might in the future, that depends how people vote in the future.  There's no set of lines where you couldn't imagine results that could come out that way.  So how do we do it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You said look to see whether the traditional criteria are predominantly ignored.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I'm referring to.   Stephen G. Breyer  I've read it.  I understand it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I... my question is, how do your standards possibly work?   Stephen G. Breyer  Always can.   Stephen G. Breyer  You can't draw a set of lines such that I couldn't imagine a voting pattern such that that wouldn't happen.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but it's not... let... let me... you've got me up to the point of this 50/50 business.  Now I'm thinking.  Let's use party names.  It helps for clarity.  Suppose the Democrats have, under the districting, they're... they're the ones who are the victims.  Now, let's suppose that they did get 55 percent of the state vote for Congress in the next election.  Now, you're saying that if it were true by this map that they're getting that vote, 55 percent, meant that nonetheless, they had to get fewer than half the Congressmen, then it's bad.  And my problem with that is, I don't see how we're going to know in advance, unless this is going to be done by some experts coming in and measuring prior votes and getting into an argument.  And if that's what's going to happen, I keep thinking of Ken... John Kenneth Galbraith, who says, I'd rather be governed by 400 people chosen at random from the telephone book than the Harvard faculty.  All right, now--     [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  That's a joke, but nonetheless, is a serious point.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, do you see my--     [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I've exposed the entire problem.  I want you to respond to it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But if you're going to say it's not fair, fairness in what sense?  If we say it's not fair to draw lines that will pack and crack one party or another, you're going to end up with no geographical boundaries, because all geographical boundaries do that.  A random system in Pennsylvania would give the Democrats no Representatives--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --purely random.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So... so it's, I mean, my point is that politicians and the public, in fact, in form has one idea of what's fair and it's very hard for a judge to turn that idea into judicially administrable rules.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose I have in my--   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, sorry.  In... in my mind the, which I don't... I want you to assume for the sake of argument... that... that one thing the Constitution aims at, one thing though, it wants to leave all this up to the legislature as much as possible, et cetera.  But one thing it aims at is majority rule.  Therefore, if, over a period of time, we have a districting system where the minority... the majority who get the... the majority of votes end up with a minority of seats in a serious way, that undercuts the democracy that the Constitution foresees.  And with computers, that might happen.  Now, suppose I start with that assumption, and I'm looking for a standard.  So suppose I combine Justice Stevens' standard with the requirement to keep judges out of it, that this has really to have happened.  It's not the Harvard faculty.  It really happened.  And in fact, after really happening once, then we also have the experts who tell us it has to happen in the future.  Now, we have three things... three requirements there that really are designed to police the outer fringe.  And if I start with that assumption of what the Constitution wants, why don't I say it imposes those three requirements?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, I've rejected their test.   Stephen G. Breyer  I've rejected their test.  I've borrowed from it, but rejected it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So the test has the three elements that I said.  One, they're experts.  Two, it really happened.  And three, Justice Stevens' objective version of there-is-no-other-explanation requirement.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the... the... tell... answer... I'll ask you a question and then you will get away from your prepared argument.   Stephen G. Breyer  But the... the... the... in... in my own view, not... not the Court's... in... in my own view in the positive discrimination race cases, I believed--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --The positive discrimination cases, the cases that say you cannot draw a racial district, racial, minority district--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, correct.   Stephen G. Breyer  I said you could, I thought that the legislature could do that, primarily because if they could do that in political party cases, why couldn't they do it in race cases where it's meant to help the minority?  Well, I lost that.  So believing what I thought, doesn't the reverse hold true?  If this Court has found manageable standards to use to control positive discrimination in favor of racial minorities for drawing boundaries, then my goodness, why can't it find standards to prevent the Republicans from doing the same thing to the Democrats or the Democrats from doing the same thing to the Republicans?   Stephen G. Breyer  And in here, we're trying to... to isolate being a Democrat or being a Republican--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --from all other factors, because after all, as Justice Stevens pointed out, they've been able to come up with no explanation other than we did it because they're Democrats.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what the word predominate means--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and you'd insist on that showing--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --just as you do insist on the predominant showing in the race case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Ah, yes, there is, because what's wrong with it is if you carry it to an extreme with computers, you prevent the majority of voters from securing the majority of seats.  And that simple principle that the majority should govern is the basic principle of democracy.  So if you find that in the Constitution, it's just as wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  Correct.  What we would do is look at the state and we would look to see if in the... we could even give a margin of error.  The party that got 53 percent of the votes ended up with 45 percent of the seats, okay?  Objective, contrary to majority rule, and produced simply by intentional gerrymandering for no other purpose.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no proportionality.  Forget the proportionality.  I agree with you a perfectly random system will produce 100 Republican delegation, so I agree with you about that.  I'm only sticking to the majority rule.   ",02-1580

Now, one thing that could have meant... one thing... is that you cannot execute a person unless 12 people think that not only that crime is unusually terrible... that's aggravating... but also that it outweighs in this person's life any good things he wants to bring in.  That's his character.  And 12 people have to come to that ultimate judgment.  Now, if that's so, 12 people have to come to that ultimate judgment, 12 people have not come to that ultimate judgment when in fact 11 would let him off, but one blocks it by saying I don't agree that this is the mitigating circumstance.

I may get these cases mixed up, but I thought that Mills was characterized as a case that follows obviously--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --from Lockett--   Stephen G. Breyer  And so... so if in fact we have 12 jurors and all 12 believe that this person was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor and 11 of them think that means he shouldn't get death, but one of them thinks it isn't that much of an offsetting factor, on your reading of this, the... they could conclude after Lockett that it's death because we don't have unanimity on whether that Congressional Medal offsets the horrible crime.   Stephen G. Breyer  So if they had been... because let's... I... I was reading the jury form differently, and I might be wrong.  I'll go back to that.  But take my hypothetical and I want to go back to the retroactivity question.  And on that, you're thinking, well, before Mills a State that came to that conclusion would not be violating the Constitution.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, all right.  Now, suppose in Mills... suppose you're right.  And now in Mills you would say, well, that's not right, and the reason that's not right is because the role of the juror is not simply to find the facts, but also to weigh the significance of the mitigating fact against the horror of the crime.  That's what Mills then on that view would have said.  Well, why isn't that terribly important?  I.e., that is a radical shift in the role of the juror from what was previously viewed as simply finding facts, now to a person who is going to make the ultimate weighing question in his own mind in respect to life and death and the person's career.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But amazingly enough to fall within in... you see where I'm going?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm... I'm saying--   Stephen G. Breyer  --a watershed rule.  Is it a watershed rule?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If it is a watershed rule, then of course it's retroactive.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, it's not that--   INTERRUPTING ",02-1603
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's true, but now what are you... what do you say to a different reading of Lockett, which would be the following?  A State official reads Lockett and says, this is how it's supposed to work, that the defendant can introduce evidence on anything he wants and the jurors can consider any of this mitigating evidence, and they do consider it.  But when it comes time to vote, the only things that the jurors can use to offset the aggravating factors are mitigating aspects of the defendant's life, that they unanimously agree are, one, in existence and, two, are mitigating.  They look at Lockett and say, of course, the jurors considered everything.  Now... now it comes time to vote, and at this point these are the rules in our State.  Now, what I think is the hardest for you is, while that might not be the best reading of Lockett and it certainly doesn't prove to have been the true reading of Lockett after Mills, can we say it's an unreasonable reading of Lockett?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is... is... the point I was thinking before and I'd... it was Justice Kennedy actually.  I think when he... he wrote in concurrence.  It is apparent the result in Mills fits within our line of cases forbidding the imposition of capital punishment on the basis of caprice in an arbitrary and unpredictable fashion or through arbitrary or freakish means.  That's Franklin and California v. Brown and Furman and so forth.  All right.  Think back to what my... my effort to characterize a reasonable State interpretation of Lockett different from yours.  Well, can you say why would that be in your opinion, the State saying they consider everything?  You remember what it was.  Right?  Why would that be freakish or arbitrary?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is... a different question.  Is the jury form in the record... do we have it?  I'm... I'm looking at pages 66, 67, and 68 of the appendix where... of the joint appendix where you have the form.  And I'm trying to work out whether this is or is not ambiguous.  And it seems to me it might depend on the way in which it appeared on the page because you see the word unanimously appears over here in question 2 on page 66, and depending on how this is indented, it might be whether the jury would reasonably think that that word unanimously does or does not apply to the questions that are on page 68.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But the form itself is... it's indented.  If it were indented, it would seem that the unanimously would govern what follows thereafter, but if it's not indented, it seems to me a judge might reasonably think that that word unanimously didn't govern what... what follows thereafter.   Stephen G. Breyer  If it's not indented, then... and this is the other part of the case.  See, if... if it's not indented, then you look at the instruction and in the instruction itself, nowhere does the judge say anything about having to find the... the mitigating factors unanimously.  He doesn't say that.  And then you look at the jury form and again, if it's not indented, it really doesn't seem to say that they have to find this unanimously because the word unanimously seems to apply here on the page to the first three things that are blank.  And then we get a new section.  In the new section it doesn't say anything about unanimous.  So... so that was what I want you to reply to because the question is whether a judge in that State court could reasonably have taken this form and the instructions and said, well, it... it doesn't say they have to be unanimous.  They wouldn't have thought they did.   Stephen G. Breyer  All of those things.   Stephen G. Breyer  And... and if a judge... if a judge in the State says, well, I think it didn't, what would you point to in reply?   INTERRUPTING ",02-1603
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I... I don't understand what the statute has... how the statute is involved in this.  I mean, the statute just sets a standard for discharging a... a student who has an educational loan.  It says it has to be undue hardship.  What's wrong with that?  I mean, why can't... there are dozens of statutes... dozens of statutes that say... I guess dozens.  I'm not a bankruptcy expert, but statutes that say you get this kind of a discharge if there hasn't been a fraudulent conveyance, but if there has been, you don't get it, and if it's this, you don't get it, and if it's that, you do get it.  All these may involve debts owed to or... the State.  Are... are you saying... what has the statute to do with this?  The statute just sets a standard for getting a discharge.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right. Let's assume it's unique.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is it in the Constitution or the Eleventh Amendment that says Congress cannot set a special standard for discharging a bankrupt from a certain kind of debt?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What... what in... what in the Constitution says that if that kind of debt happens to be one that is owed to the State, Congress is forbidden to do that?  I don't... I just don't understand it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know and so why is the State, if it happens to be owed that kind of money, in any sort of a different position?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, then what you're quarreling with is, of course, not the statute.  You are quarreling, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, with a bankruptcy rule that happen to use the word adversary proceeding.  But suppose the rulemakers had simply said, this need not be done in an adversary proceeding.  It can be done in exactly the same kind of proceeding as discharging any other kind of debt.  I, the bankruptcy judge, will follow the congressional mandate as to when it is discharged.  You will notify all debtors, Mr. Bankrupt, including the State, and if they want to come in and protest it, they can.  Now, why... what would be unconstitutional about such a provision that never uses the word adversary proceeding?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And so did I.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'd rather like to get the answer to the question which is I understand what position you took in the brief.  I want to know why.  I want to know what the logic is.  I can't find anything in the Constitution that says that Congress cannot impose the same standard in respect to discharging a debt owed to the State as it applies to a debt owed to anybody else.  Now, either you agree with that proposition or you don't.  And if you don't... and I think you don't... I'd like to know what the theory is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  Once you agree with the proposition, then all your objecting to is the word adversary in the word adversary proceeding, and it takes 3 minutes or less for a good expert simply to get rid of that adversary proceeding and have the same thing done in an ordinary proceeding.  Now, I want to know the answer to what I say, not that you disagree with it.  I know you disagree with it.  I want to know why you disagree with it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, but there is a dispute about whether you could, in fact, call this kind of adversary proceeding, given the underlying standard that all it is is a way of getting to the same result, really not an adversary proceeding for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment, since it has no functional difference whatsoever from a proceeding that isn't labeled adversary but simply gives the State notice of what's going on and permits the State to come in, just as if it worked, which is ordinary proceedings.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's a good answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  --Now, what about--   ",02-1606
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The State lacked?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The State lacked?   Stephen G. Breyer  The Supreme Court.   Stephen G. Breyer  --So what is the situation there?  I mean, I don't want you just to drop this.  That is, is an adversary proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code... and there are quite a few.  You've said two opposite things now.  Your first time you said, well, if the other party doesn't show up, the bankruptcy judge can just say, debtor, you win.  Okay?  Without looking at the merits.  And the second time you said, no, that's not really so.  The bankruptcy judge has to satisfy himself that the statutory standard is met.  Now, I guess this isn't the only place where there's a adversary proceeding in the code.  So which is it?  Is it like an... and how do I find out?  If you're uncertain, what do I look up to try to find out the answer to that question?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, I see--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --No, I got that.   Stephen G. Breyer  So maybe there are no others.  Are there... are there any adversary proceedings, other than this, one which isn't like what you just described?   Stephen G. Breyer  We're trying to get... I'm trying to get the answer still to Justice Scalia's question.  Take the question the Chief Justice asked.  It's a preference action.  It's a kind of bankruptcy action.  It's in an adversary proceeding.  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, the other side doesn't show up.  Okay, forget this Eleventh Amendment business.  I just want to know the normal thing in bankruptcy.  What's the answer?  If he doesn't show up, is he defaulted like a regular case outside the court, or does the trustee... I mean, does the judge, the bankruptcy judge, look at the matter and make up his own mind independently about whether it was a preference or not?  How does it work in bankruptcy?   Stephen G. Breyer  I have one other technical question.  Suppose we were to say--   Stephen G. Breyer  If in fact we assume... let's suppose when we look into this... suppose I was to come to the conclusion that an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy is identical to a case that has nothing to do with bankruptcy in a court.  You say isn't, and maybe that's so and we'll find out.  All right.  Now, if that were so and if that meant under the Court's case law that this particular adversary proceeding were invalid under the Eleventh Amendment, would the bankruptcy judge under section 105 or some other section or would the Rules Committee have the power without going back to Congress to devise a different procedure that would get to exactly the same place, say, a procedure that had the bankruptcy judge adjudicate this under the same standard while notifying the State, like any other creditor, that it could intervene at is choice.   Stephen G. Breyer  And even without 105, could the Rules Committee then devise a different rule?   ",02-1606
1,NO QUESTIONS,02-1609
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but... what... what is the problem in the case?  I mean, I... I had thought, perhaps naively, that the reason that one opinion used the word judicial access, prompt judicial access, and the other opinion used the word, prompt judicial decision, is that there really isn't any difference between the two.  Once you have prompt judicial access, the courts have loads of devices to give you a prompt decision.  And if you feel the decision isn't prompt enough, well, you can ask the appellate court to make sure you get your quick decision.  What's the problem?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Once you say that, the courts have discretion to fashion the remedy, that's the end of it, isn't it?  Of course, you get into court and then it's up to the judge, and if in fact the judge, as I just said, delays unreasonably, you like any other litigant have a host of judicial remedies.  So what is it?  How do you win this case once you agree to what I just said?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We're all against delay.  I mean, I just don't... I mean, everybody is against delay.  And my question is what is it that you want in that respect that you haven't had.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You mean you have not had... you've had unreasonable delay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Aren't... isn't your client running his bookstore?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then what's the delay?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, that's a different matter.  You think it isn't enough, the ordinary remedies.  You want the ordinance to say in words judicial... prompt judicial review.  That's contrary, I think, to what you just said.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why would you think under the Constitution that an adult bookstore has to have something written into an ordinance which... it's entitled to a fast decision.  I agree with you about that.  But why does it have to have it written in an ordinance when a person who's put in prison arbitrarily who also should have a very speedy decision is required to rely on ordinary court processes to get that speedy decision?   ",02-1609
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If they're not relevant, do you think that the regulation which provides... do you think it's unlawful?   Kevin C. Newsom  We do not contest the validity of the regulation.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  If you don't contest the validity of it and you think it's lawful, do you think it's doing something other than interpreting 1681(a)?   Kevin C. Newsom  Absolutely, Your Honor.   Stephen G. Breyer  What... what is it doing?   Kevin C. Newsom  It... section 100.7(e), the regulation upon which Jackson chiefly relies, we readily concede is a valid, effectuating 902 regulation, but all... all it does by its text... and its structure makes clear all it does... is to govern the internal processes of official OCR investigations.  It does not go further than that.  This Court in Sandoval was very clear that it was... that it was only authoritative interpretations of a statute's terms that can be enforced pursuant to that statute's implied right of action.  Another point I want to make about the administrative remedy.  Justice Ginsburg asked whether funds had ever been withdrawn, and even there, again, if the answer is no, the point is not whether funds have been withdrawn, but that as Senator Bayh himself noted, that the threat of funds is where the heavy lifting is done in administrative enforcement.  Another point about administrative enforcement is whether or not there are sufficient resources.  That, obviously, was a valid concern in Cannon, given presumably the inordinate number of complaints about core, traditional discrimination.  But as the other side has made clear in its briefing in this case, at page 26 of the petitioner's brief... and then there's a brief filed on behalf of the Southern Poverty Law Center that spins this out in some detail... there just aren't many of these retaliation claims out there, either in the... either... either in the judicial system or at OCR.   ",02-1672
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask you a legal question, nothing to do with, you know, practicalities?   Stephen G. Breyer  But suppose you go back to the very old, bad days of the 1950's in the South, the '60's.  They pass some civil rights legislation.  A lot of legislation was passed in the '60's.  Now, under that civil rights legislation, imagine an individual had been kept out of a restaurant or he'd been treated physically badly, not because of his race.  He was white, but he was associating with people who were black.  And they both go into the restaurant and they both are refused service.  Maybe they're beaten up.  I mean, both of them.  Now, can the white individual bring a lawsuit under the... the civil rights statute?  I've always thought the answer to that question is, of course, he can.  Would you... do you think it's the contrary answer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, of course.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So therefore--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'd... I'd like to... I'm thinking of various civil rights statutes which make it unlawful to describe... to... to discriminate.  And now, I agree with you on that answer.  The white person could bring a lawsuit on the basis of someone else's race because he's being discriminated against not because of his own race, but because he's being... he's associated with people who are being discriminated against.  I agree with your answer.  And so my question is if that's so and if we have a long history here of the words, on the basis of sex, including retaliation not on the basis of my sex, but retaliation on the basis of someone else's sex... that's what I've complained of... why isn't this the same thing And to get out my whole question... there are two parts... why isn't this the same thing?  And the second part is, because I think it is the same thing... the second part is once it is included in 1981... in... is it 1681(a)?   Stephen G. Breyer  Once we include this in 1681(a), that's the end of this case because Sandoval then supports the other side.  It doesn't support you.  All right.  That's my question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you... you go ahead.  I'm doing it purely as a matter of logic.  I'm saying the old civil rights cases make clear it doesn't have to be on the basis of your own race.  History makes clear that retaliation on the basis of someone else's race does fit within... or gender does fit within 1681, and then that's the end of the case.  So I would like your response to that logic.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well... I mean, Sandoval is very clear.  It's a very clear opinion in my view.  Very clear.  And the key language I thought is, the language statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer the private right.  So they're looking at disparate impact and disparate impact, according to the majority... I was in the dissent... did not intend to protect the person discriminated against, but was a way of regulating people so they wouldn't intentionally discriminate.  I can understand that.  But I apply the same... I didn't agree with it, but I can understand it.  The... the... I apply the same reasoning here.  The reasoning here is that this retaliation thing is not trying to protect university behavior one whit more than the whole underlying thing is trying to protect university behavior.  This is about victims.  Retaliation and being fired is about victims.  And so given Sandoval, then we have the history, we have the language, and we have that sentence from Sandoval.  And all that suggests... it goes into 1681(a), in which case Sandoval says, a private right of action, given Cannon, would be inferred.  Now, what's... what's... that's how... I'm tracing out the logic of the thing.  So I want to see what you say.   INTERRUPTING ",02-1672

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You were going to go to the history or something else.  I... I don't want you to forget that, and the reason I don't want you to forget is I'm thinking yours is a plausible interpretation--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that could be... well, I mean, it could.  I'm about to say maybe it isn't plausible enough.     [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  The... the... but what I'm... what I'm driving at is that the... the Congress might have said that although Federal courts are in the business quite often, along with State courts, of deciding whether a State law is unconstitutional or violates some other Federal law, and although millions of State laws are very important, we're separating out a set of cases here where they can't do it.  Now, one reason for doing that would be we don't want to interfere with States getting money that they need for their business.  And that would limit these words to interferences with collection of revenue.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you were about to explain to me why--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --there's evidence that Congress wanted to do more than that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It wanted to do more than that.  It wanted, in fact, to say you just can't stop them from... you cannot, Federal courts, go and have our tax division here interfered with, even though it doesn't affect collection of revenue.  We... we don't want you to interfere with their rules, with their administration, with anything.  You can do it for the police department, but not the tax.  All right.  Now... now, what's the evidence that's what... what Congress wanted?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  The words... I think they're pretty ambiguous.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I know.   Stephen G. Breyer  Let's go beyond these words.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You don't have to send them a notice of... in other words, I file my income tax.  I thought there's some provisions that say if somebody thinks I made a mistake, they have to send me some special notice.  Some process takes place.  We have some other case on this.  I thought all that involved an assessment, that it was a particular thing under the IRC, not just my filing of a... of the return.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you just said to Justice Ginsburg that if nothing happens... like I try to pay my taxes accurately.  So I file these pieces of paper.  And now, nothing happens.  They just take the money.  They cash the check.  And... and you're going to say when that's all that happened, there was an assessment?  I thought it had a particular meaning that wasn't that, that was when you thought I was wrong, you did something and then went after me.  But... but it just... everybody is called an assessment?  Does it say that in the code where--   ",02-1809
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So... so there would be some interference.  But what do you do about the word?  I mean, I'm somewhat shaken by the fact that the... the Internal Revenue Code does... as I have just read 6201 and 6203, it does use that word assessment as apparently to refer simply to the record keeping function of the tax division which it says under rules and regulations the assessment shall be made by recording the liability of the taxpayer in the Office of the Secretary.  And therefore, what it seems to have in mind in the IRC is a simple bookkeeping notation of how much money this taxpayer owes which takes place in every case.  Now, the... the act says there shall be no suit that restrains the assessment of that tax; i.e., you cannot restrain the Secretary in noting the amount that the taxpayer owes.  Now, they're saying stop right there.  End of the matter.  Now, what in your opinion overcomes that argument?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's not an answer for the reason--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --that they're saying they're wrong, just as they say we were wrong in five cases not to notice this.  So continue, please.   Stephen G. Breyer  So your answer is this.  You say indeed they've got it correctly defined.  Indeed, it says assessment.  It says assessment, levy, or collection.  But that phrase does not refer to every assessment, levy, or collection.  Rather, in context it refers to those assessments, levies, and collections that will have, were they enjoined, the impact of cutting the revenue stream flowing to the State.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's your view.  So we should look at that in context.  That's why you go to the history and these other things.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  I understand.   Stephen G. Breyer  See, this... in... in... do you know this in State tax systems?  Apparently in the Federal tax system assessment refers to an official determination of the amount that the individual taxpayer owes.  Now, there are 50 State systems plus the District of Columbia.  Do you know if there are a significant number of States that would not consider that official determination of the amount owed to be an assessment?   ",02-1809
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why not go to that first and tell them to do that, because this is just very difficult, that that would be the reason?  The reason it would be difficult is because actual innocence is simply a way at getting at manifest injustice, I think, and a reason that this fits in the manifest injustice is we feel differently about substantive laws that govern how long a person is going to be in prison than we do about procedural laws, and sentencing is an aspect of that.  But if you take that and say, look, this is an absolute obvious case where there was just wrong sentencing, it's not actual innocence, it's wrong sentencing, but it's so obvious, it's so clear that this is just unjust.  Once we're down that path, I mean, how do we draw a line between that and every sentencing error?  Now, I'm just--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm getting you to--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I know that's just what you were going to say--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  But is the answer then not to deal with it when it's clear?   Stephen G.

I just... this is a case in which you yourself concede he shouldn't be in jail under the substantive law of Texas, and it is a case where you yourself agree there is a very big claim that the lawyer was incompetent.  If we send this Texas, is Texas going to move to revoke his bail?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He's out while it's being litigated?   ",02-1824
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But the other could be, couldn't it?  I mean, that's... what I don't understand about this area, and you've read the cases and so you may able to be clearer than I am and can correct me, I've thought that the real key concept is not actual innocence.  It's very hard to apply that to a sentence.  You're guilty of the crime, you're not innocent of the sentence.  That doesn't make sense, but rather manifest injustice, and the key word is manifest.  And so one could have manifest injustice in millions of possible situations.  You don't need absolute clarity as to it applies to in between the guideline but not beyond the guideline, but the key word is manifest, and it has to be unjust and injustice first and foremost has to do with being behind bars when the law says you shouldn't be, directly and simply, not through some procedural device.  So thinking about it in that way, I would like you to tell me what cases of this Court stand as obstacles to the way I'm thinking about it?   Stephen G. Breyer  You see what I... what I'm basically interested in is, is the... the concept actual innocence simply a subdivision of the broader concept manifest injustice?  And so that actual innocence of the crime itself, where manifest, is a basis for doing whatever happens in habeas law.  And if I know whether that's a subdivision, I then would have a better handle on the case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Everybody's going to say they're actually innocent.  All... I mean, you know, not everybody, but, you know, a very high percentage of prisoners in prison say, I was actually innocent, and the prosecution says, no, you're not actually innocent.  So if that's really an excuse, actual innocence, and if in fact that's really an excuse in respect to a sentence, then why wouldn't every case be open to the Federal habeas judge relitigating the lawfulness of the conviction in terms of the evidence and relitigating the sentence in terms of what was reasonable?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  In your view, under the true facts, a prisoner says the true facts are X, the state says the true facts are not X, and what's supposed to happen?   Stephen G. Breyer  So... so in your... in your view, every crime in a state court and every sentence in a state court, at least a big subset, are open to relitigation in the Federal court on the standard of whether there is clear and convincing evidence that adds the factual matters, it was that the... the state court was wrong?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but this guideline says the statute says, Judge, you must apply the guideline range unless.  Now, there are many situations where it isn't even arguably unless, okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  So that means there is a statutory requirement that the judge impose the guideline sentence, four extra units or points if you had a gun, say.  The prisoner says, I didn't have a gun.  The state says, I did have a gun.  And now you want to relitigate whether he had a gun or didn't have a gun, whether the victim was seriously hurt or only gravely hurt, whether there was a threat or a brandishment or an actual use of the gun, all of which add points, and what you're saying is all of those things would be relitigated in a habeas court, as long as the prisoner colorably can say, I have evidence that will show clearly and convincingly the judge was wrong.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, you were saying that, but judge... I knew you were saying that, but I think Justice Scalia's question was that he can't find, nor can I find, a logical basis for making that distinction.  That's the problem.   ",02-1824
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  How do they get out of it?  Because how do you say... I mean, suppose the person from behind the door says, oh, police, you'd like to come in.  I'll let you in.  Come right in, but just wait 1 minute while I flush the drugs down the toilet.     [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, he's not refusing him admittance.  I mean, he's welcoming him.  So how... how is the Court... with open arms.  He's delighted to have him in.  He says, it'll just take a second.     [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  And... now, how... how... how has the law reconciled that which is obvious that he ought to... the police ought to be able to get in there... with the statute that says they cannot come in unless he refuses the police admittance?  And he hasn't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't think they read it--   ",02-473X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  When you say it's wrong, well, the argument the other way is what they said.  In the lower court, the Ninth Circuit says that the police waited a maximum of 15 to 20 seconds, and the police say and the Government says that's way more than enough time to flush the drugs down the toilet.  All right?  So every other circuit has said 10 seconds, 15 seconds, is the maximum, 6 seconds, and even the Ninth Circuit has normally held that 15 to 20 seconds is long enough to wait when it's a small house, daylight so people are awake, and all it would take is about 2 seconds to get rid of the evidence.  So they've all said that.  And this case, they say, is an outlier.  This is well beyond what every other circuit has done and doesn't make any sense.  Because the drugs will just be destroyed.  Now, what's your response to that?  That's the basic argument.  I'd like to hear your response.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So your view is the Fourth Amendment then says even though you have a warrant, probable cause for believing there are drugs there, and it's easy to get rid of them, there's just nothing the police can do about it except not prosecute the drug cases in these situations.   Stephen G. Breyer  First, just a quibble.  But I read the lower court as saying 15 to 20 seconds, and I take it as 20 seconds because given that statement, had this been 20 seconds, they would have said it was unlawful.  And so if in fact you concede that 20 seconds is too long, then I guess I'd have to reverse or is... you know.  So... so what I want... I'm... I'm taking the outer limit of what they said.  Now, on that, I want to be sure I've got a complete answer from you because I was pushing you, and so far I've said all the circuits say 15 to 20 seconds is certainly enough time for the policemen to wait where it's a drug case, a small house, and you could easily get rid of the evidence.  In response to that, you said that you thought that 15 seconds... but you should say 20... is... is actually... they have to wait that long.  Now, is there anything other than your opinion, which I respect, but... but what I'd like to know is whether there is any basis in authority or reason or something, other than that, that would support your position.   INTERRUPTING ",02-473X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I think the... the difficulty is... is, well, what are the rules.  What you say sounds as if it makes a lot of sense, but there are three aspects to the case.  Starting backwards is, can a private party bring this?  The answer is yes.  You agree it's yes.  But you want to say not always.  So then you have a rule that you've just enunciated now of who definitely couldn't.  And as to the second, I guess... I mean, I'm not sure that's the right rule, frankly.  Maybe we'd figure that out.  Maybe it is.  The second part.  I found an opinion by Justice Ginsburg where she has a rule which is in the D.C. Circuit which says about how close it has to be in time, and my guess is that you will say that's okay, but I'd be interested if you don't.  And as to the first part about, well, yes, we agree this is a person who can get discovery, but not here, now, there I don't see any rule at all.  So I'd like to know your views on that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, you want to follow their... all right.  So my two questions are, is Justice Ginsburg's approach to the time problem okay with you?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that... her quote--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Let me... I better quote this.  It says you have to have to get this discovery reliable indications of the likelihood that proceedings will be instituted within a reasonable time.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you might win under that for the very reason you state.   Stephen G. Breyer  How does that fit in the rule then?  I mean, what kind of... what kind of a rule of law is it?  I mean, what do you... how do you fit that in?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you say if the commission doesn't want it, then don't give it to them, but if they do want it, do?  How does this fit?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How do you interpret the statute to get the result that you're arguing for?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, with a tribunal you... I don't think it is a tribunal probably, but I'll hear more on the other side.  But still, there is a tribunal in the offing and that's the tribunal that will be there if the commission decides to enforce this.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That would do it, but they have... I think they have the alternative ground here, that even if you're not a tribunal, the Ninth Circuit says it could lead to a proceeding in the court of first instance.  Don't they say that somewhere in their opinion?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So as long as they make that argument, then I can't say, okay, I've got the result there that... that they're arguing for, assuming you're right, that... that just by using this thing about the tribunal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, so... so what else could we use to get to your desired end with this statute?   Stephen G. Breyer  Interpretation of what comity consists of in this instance.   ",02-572X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  In Israel, for example, if you have a... a criminal prosecutor, it looks just like our prosecutor.  My understanding is that the one difference is that a victim could go to court to force the prosecutor to bring a prosecution.  So does that mean now under this statute, because of that one difference, all prosecutors in Israel are open to this... our tribunals under this statute?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I'm not... that's not the part I'm getting at.  I am saying it's easy to think of people whom, when we look at them, they are precisely like a human being in the U.S. Attorney's office, and everything they do every day is just like a U.S. Attorney, but for one thing, that somebody who wants a prosecution to be brought can get a court to review a decision, no prosecution.  Now, I'm asking you if that single difference is sufficient to translate this into a tribunal under the act.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Now, you're not getting my questions.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't want to just repeat it again.  Did you not understand the question?  The question is I'm imaging a person like a U.S. Attorney, exactly the same, and there's only the one difference I mentioned.  Somebody can go ask a judge to say did he abuse his discretion in not bringing this RICO case.  Okay?  That's the only difference.  Now, I'm asking you if we had such a person, does that make him a tribunal under the act.   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  If that's so--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and I agree with you... how does this particular tribunal differ from the one I just described?  I don't mean a tribunal.  How does the commission differ from that prosecutor I just described?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Forget Israel.  I might even be wrong about Israel.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You've got my question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I want to know how they differ from what I just said.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that differs from my case, which was our U.S. Attorney who can be brought to court for not prosecuting on those kinds of grounds.  You said it doesn't apply to him, and now you're more or less repeating what I said was the special feature of my imaginary U.S. Attorney.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So is... you can elaborate on that or give me another one too.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's very important.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so what is the difference there between... and I... I'm serious about this question.  What is the... what... all my questions are serious.  But this is... I don't know the answer to this.  What is the difference specifically between the EU saying you pay $10 million and the U.S. Attorney saying we want him to pay $10 million?  What's the difference there procedurally?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  When they review it, do they give a leg up to the commission?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If it goes to court, is the... is the issue in the court in the EU an issue like review of the NLRB, that the NLRB wins, unless they're quite wrong, or is it like a court reviewing a decision of the Antitrust Division to bring a tying case where the court will say, we'll make up our mind on our own?  You know, they know something about it, so do we.  Which is it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It has to be either one or the other.  They... they either have to give deference to the agency, as we did, or they're making this decision on their own.  And so--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --How about fact-finding?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not talking about process.  I'm saying does the reviewing court defer to the commission's finding of fact.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  My impression, which only comes from the newspapers, is that the courts there are taking a much more active role and it's becoming like they're vis-a-vis the Antitrust Division and it's not like vis-a-vis a commission.  But is that... my--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm wrong on that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but that's... that's... there are criminal investigations in most countries other than Britain and the United States where the investigating magistrate is a judge.   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course, they're a tribunal.  The key things here is that the people here are investigators who do not think of themselves as judges.  They are not judges.  And in addition, the proceedings are not adversarial, nor are they adjudicative in any sense.  And that is all the difference in the world between... you're talking... you think you could bring a... all we have is an investigation in France by the police judiciaire.   Stephen G. Breyer  And suddenly we're going to... we're going to start getting all... I mean, no.  It's a big difference whether it's a magistrate, a... you know, a judge.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I read through some, my clerk read through some, and I ended up by thinking there are some that are rather like the FTC, but then there are a certain number that are really very different.  And the thing that struck me as pretty critical is just what I said.  They do not think of themselves as judges.  They are... do not think of what they are doing as adjudicatory, and they don't even have a way of walling off, as we do, the investigators from the adjudicators.  Now, there are certain similarities too.  But where we have similarities and major differences, maybe we should pay attention to what they want to call themselves.   Stephen G. Breyer  It sort of sloughed over a point I think was pretty critical.  I mean, if the commission itself is not proceeding... not a tribunal, which I... you dispute, but if I were to disagree with you about that, I would certainly agree with you that the court of first instance and the further reviewing courts are.  But there you run into the statement in that D.C. case that I referred to earlier which there must be reliable indications of the likelihood the proceedings will be instituted within a reasonable time.  And as to those further court of first instance, the reviewing court and over in the ECJ, then... then... do they meet that criterion?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And it would be within this statute even if the only indication we had whichever... there would ever be a case is there's 1 chance in 50 that there will be a case 18 years from now.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That would fall within this statute and it's just some kind of discretion that keeps it out.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Even in the example I just gave?   Stephen G. Breyer  You want 800 judges to review this even in the extreme case I mentioned, and unless... as long as you can find some in your favor, you can just go file a complaint over there and get all your competitors' documents and put everybody to about $5 million or $6 million worth of costs, et cetera.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is this outside of Ex Parte Young?  I... I mean, the way I was thinking about it, which might not be right, is that what you were saying in the second part of your argument is that Ex Parte Young permits, without the consent of a State, an individual to sue a State official in his official capacity, asking for an injunction on the ground that the official has violated Federal law.  That's what Ex Parte Young says.   Stephen G. Breyer  And now you get that injunction, and that injunction contains provisions that aren't all about Federal law.  Some of them are about related State law.  And I thought perhaps the way to look at it was, and that injunction does not violate the Eighth... the Eleventh Amendment.  You don't need a State to give consent because it's all part of an effort to cure the Federal violation with related matters thrown in.   Stephen G. Breyer  Ex Parte Young authorizes such a thing.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, is that last statement right?   Stephen G. Breyer  So then it's not outside Ex Parte Young.  You're giving us an interpretation of what Ex Parte Young means.   ",02-628X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask you what is the purpose of doing this?  I mean, let's think of the Medicare provisions or the Social Security provisions, the regulations, the statutes.  They cover volumes.  Think of consent decrees.  Yours is only 80 pages.  I guess others might be hundreds of pages.  And so what you're saying is that after these have been entered, they've been entered because there was a violation of Federal law in the view of the plaintiff and the defendant agreed.  Okay?  Now, what you're saying is at any time, we go through these hundreds of pages and we try to figure out whether each word in these hundreds of pages actually in itself reflects the Federal law violation, of which, remember, there were 3,000 volumes, or the State law violation, of which there were 10,000 more volumes, and once we figured that out, then you're going to say you can do paragraph 867 but you can't do paragraph 868.  Now, I just wonder what is the purpose of this exercise?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I... I don't... that's not--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --That's not answering my question at all.  So would you please direct yourself to my question?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not asking about this case.  I'm asking about the purpose of the exercise that you are suggesting that the Constitution requires us to undertake.  My suggestion was that it is... I was trying to make it look absurd to go through that exercise because it would put everybody to a lot of work for no real reason.  That was what I was trying to suggest.  Now, I suggested it so you would respond to it because I'm sure you don't agree with that, and therefore, I'd like you to present the response.   Stephen G. Breyer  You're saying the cases require it.  Now, if that's so, that's the end of it.  You're right.  But I had the impression a different case had a much better solution to the problem that you raise, which is that there's some provisions in this thing that really have nothing to do with Federal law at all.  And that's called Rufo.  And what the... what... what you're supposed to do in that situation is you can make your argument.  You go to court.  You say rule 60(b).  You say, judge, you see this provision over here?  This has nothing to do with anything.  And if the judge is right, you win.  Now, why isn't that a much more practical approach for the problem that you're raising?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?  That's--  --For the reason that Justice Ginsburg stated, that all 60(b) enables you to do is to eliminate provisions that... that have been found too onerous, not to eliminate provisions that are not indeed terribly onerous but go beyond what... what the court had jurisdiction to impose.  It's a totally different question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but I want to know if you could go... could you go through 60(b)?  That's interesting.  Now, imagine... I'll give a silly example to make it clear... that there's a requirement in the consent decree you have to give every child a hair cut.  And Federal law doesn't require that, but there's a provision in State law that the barbers' union got in.  All right?  [Laughter]  So every child has to have a hair cut.  So you find the decree and you go say, judge, I want this modified.  Look what it is over here.  They give every child a hair cut.  That has nothing to do with Federal law whatsoever.  We don't want to give every child a hair cut.  Can you get the decree modified under 60(b)?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  All right.  Well, then if you could get it modified under 60(b), this isn't really a solution.  You don't need your solution.  You can go in under 60(b).   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So then there's no problem.  We're all in agreement.   Stephen G. Breyer  So if we think you have a right to go in under 60(b), is that the end of the case?   INTERRUPTING ",02-628X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why couldn't it?  Why couldn't it?  They simply proceed under 28 U.S.C. 1345.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what they do is they say, we're now in Federal court.  There's a State law here.  The State law happens to say that you cannot be arbitrary.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so now they say, we're making the same claim identically.  They were arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion.  But it's under State law.  And now, my goodness, what is this case about?   Stephen G. Breyer  You say that they should have gone into the Ninth Circuit under 1345 arguing it was arbitrary, capricious under State law, and they say that they should be in the Ninth Circuit arguing that it's arbitrary and capricious under Federal law, where I've never heard that there's any difference between arbitrary and capricious under State law or under Federal law.  It's just whether it's arbitrary and capricious.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They do go into Federal court, and I do see your point.  What I am curious about is I think there are like maybe a handful of administrative law experts who might have thought there was really some kind of difference between whether you're in Federal court under the State words or in Federal court under the Federal words when the words are identical.  And there may be somebody who thinks there's a difference between what you told Justice O'Connor and what you've told Justice Scalia, but I'm not one of them.  I don't understand how you reconcile those things.  So if we assume Congress is not an expert, why wouldn't they have just meant by this, well, EPA, you stay out of it unless you think what they're doing is unreasonable?  If what you think they're doing is unreasonable, you have the authority to come in and go to Federal court if you want.  That would be simple.  Everybody would understand it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't think they could do it.  Suppose that the... a State agency decides the best available control technology is a ceiling fan that they brought up to New Orleans... from New Orleans.  They bought it and brought it up to Alaska.  Now, EPA looks at that and says, no, no, this is going too far.  Now, what in your opinion is supposed to happen?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's the role of the Federal court?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, that isn't going to get... the reason I think we're... I'm having the same trouble Justice Scalia is because the kind of... in my mind anyway, I tend to think of a classical definition of arbitrary and capricious as sometimes involving they didn't follow what the statute told them to do.  Sometimes they did what the statute told them not to do.  Sometimes they didn't get the weight right.  And I put all those things... and I think a lot of people do... in the same box called arbitrary and unreasonable, capricious, and you try to draw some kind of line between those things.  I don't know how to do it, and I don't think many judges would.   Stephen G. Breyer  But on the facts here I thought... now, tell me if I'm right about this.  When I started reading it, I was quite sympathetic to your view that it makes no sense to have more emissions coming out as a result of trying to control this one generator.  Their job is to get fewer emissions not more.  But then when I read into the record a little bit, it seemed to me that the facts are that by the time this generator 17 came up, it was perfectly apparent that the company had to put the... whatever, some low technology, NOx technology or something on four of the other generators anyway.  So that the bottom line is that this bubble has nothing to do with this case because we're talking about one generator coming in in circumstances where the other generators have to be controlled regardless.  Am I right?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know, but then we... I had my law clerk go through and do the extra emissions from those other two, and it didn't really make any difference.   Stephen G. Breyer  It does?   INTERRUPTING ",02-658X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I don't think he is... I mean, my impression of their argument was, yes, you can review that.  What you have go is through the State procedure and then after you go through the State procedures, in fact, you can go into a Federal court and have them apply the State review procedure if you want.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I think that's what their argument was, or at least one of their arguments.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's a different thing.  Maybe yours is better, but you can't say they're leaving it without review.  So I just wanted to--   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, let's see what it says.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, Federal... are you aware of any State in the United States that does not have in its law the requirement that its own agencies have to act rationally, that they can't arbitrarily, abuse of discretion?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I don't know of any either.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And so that seems to be the same standard that you argue that applies, and since there is no State that doesn't have that standard and no Federal Government that doesn't have it, we all have the same standard.  And that's why I think the argument does boil down to which courts will apply it: the Federal court as a matter of Federal law, or the Federal court as a matter of State law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  It's a question of judgment and whose judgment gets some weight.  In respect to that, what I'd really suddenly stirred up again here... suppose we reach the second question.  Suppose we reach the question of whether Alaska did, in fact, do something that was pretty unreasonable, and suppose I accept your argument that this was totally unreasonable to say that they didn't have to put in this special technology because of cost when Alaska didn't even know what the cost was.  That's about like the fan.  That's close to the ceiling fan.  That's what you're arguing.  But then they've made another argument, and the other argument is bothering me a lot more.  And that is that the EPA has taken the position that you have to put this extra special converter or whatever on number 17, even if the consequence of that, because of the interaction of the regs and their desires with number 2 and number 6, is more pollution.  Now, that does bother me because it seems to me a State agency that's trying to get a result that is less polluting is not acting arbitrarily and capriciously except in rather unusual circumstances.  Now, what do I do with that argument?  Does that mean if I accept everything you say... but that worries me... I should send it back for another determination of whether this really is arbitrary and capricious?  What should I do with that argument?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's a... that's one point.  I've got that point.  That's a kind of technical point in my mind.  In other words, Alaska might really be polluting more, but because of this sort of which paper they wrote which in, we should just accept it.  Now, I got that argument.  But is there any other?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can you tell me?  I want to be very clear on what I didn't hear in answer to my question.  What I was concerned about... and I understand your legal arguments, but I was concerned about their claim.  If you win this case, what it means is more expensive technology goes onto number 17.  They run number 17 less.  They run 2 and 6 more, and the net result in Alaska is more pollution.  Now, you haven't said... I haven't heard you say, no, that's wrong.  What you have said is we shouldn't reach it.  There... there... they didn't make the claim in the right place with the right words.  And I want to give you a chance to say, no, that's wrong, if it is wrong.   ",02-658X

Breyer  No, no, but... but no, look, either there is a crime of being in a car knowing that or there isn't.  Is there or not?  I don't know.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, so... so you'd have to then make an inference that a person who says, yes, I knew the drugs where there, was also going to help later on.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But that's--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --And you think that's not reasonable either?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Am I right in assuming that the other two people in the car didn't testify at the suppression hearing?   Stephen G. Breyer  Or at the trial?   INTERRUPTING ",02-809X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Go back--  --It doesn't say it in the rule at all.  Could you go back to Justice Scalia's question?   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought that this was a very simple case.  Somebody really mucked up the warrant, okay?  They made a technical mistake.  Instead of saying, seize... look for and seize some guns, they said, look for and seize a house, all right?  Now, nobody could think that that made any sense.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Nobody.  No... you don't think it does, I don't think it does.  So you can say one of three things: A, that the warrant is constitutional, which is what you're arguing, which is a little tough, because I guess if we said this was constitutional, we'd have to say a warrant is constitutional.  If it says seize and then it says I'm not going to tell you, look in vault three of the Kremlin, you know, to see what we're supposed to seize.  I mean, that's a tough route that you're taking.  The second route is what Justice Scalia suggested, which is to say, well, it isn't really his fault, the search team leader, because he was in good faith.  For me, that's tough because I... if you cast his eye on this piece of paper and just glanced at it, he would have seen it was faulty.  Route three is to say, they're right in their lawsuit, let them bring it, damages, by the way, are going to be pretty low, okay?  Now you explain to me why it should be route two, which is Justice Scalia's question, rather than just route three.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now... now tell me why, because as I've made my point, it sounds to me that this man did not behave sensibly, because if he just looked at the piece of paper he would have seen in 3 seconds it says, seize the house, and we're not out here to seize the house, we're out to seize some guns.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So it wasn't like a minor, common mistake--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --so why was that reasonable?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He didn't have a bad motive?   Stephen G. Breyer  So do you say this is just a technical mistake?  If it said, go to the Empire State Building and seize the Empire State Building, that's just a technical mistake?  I mean, they may have made it for a technical reason, but you'd have no idea what they're supposed to look for.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, it isn't clear.  How is it clear?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you're saying here it's clear because the affidavit said it, but the affidavit's locked away somewhere and nobody can look at it.   Stephen G. Breyer  So, in fact, what a homeowner's supposed to do is if the warrant... he looks at it, by the way, it's blank, it's blank.  And the officer says, don't worry, I'm not going to tell you what I'm looking for, but just go somewhere to a court house and make a motion to unseal an affidavit and that will solve the problem.  Is... is that what the Fourth Amendment is about?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I did see it.  I did look at that and it occurred to me at that moment that all you're asking people to do is just glance at the document quickly to catch obvious mistakes, which this is.   INTERRUPTING ",02-811X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I see that there is a serious question, I think, underlying what you're saying.  You're saying that this is really a question of cross-reference.  The Constitution requires the warrant to describe the things to be seized.  Now, what the Government says is this... we have permitted in cases that requirement to be fulfilled where the warrant piece of paper is perhaps blank or erroneous, but it cross-references another document.  And you've said, it can do that where that other document is physically attached or, let's say, at least in the car.  There was one case that said in the car, but not where it's in a vault someplace.  And Justice Scalia, I think, asked why... why is that?  Because if the purpose of the Fourth Amendment is not to alert the homeowner, but simply to be certain there is a check on the searcher, why have the cases come out the way you've just described them?   Stephen G. Breyer  What kind of abuse?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --All right, fine.  I'd like to go back for one second to Justice Ginsburg's... one of her initial questions, is, what is it you are seeking here?  A dollar in damages and an apology?  Because, after all, if you accept my argument, they would have just gone back and gotten a better warrant and it would have taken them a couple of hours and all the same thing would have happened.  So... so what... what is it you're seeking in this lawsuit?  An apology and a dollar or something else?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, is there any way it could be more than a dollar?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any way it could be more than a dollar?  I mean, you must have thought this through, because, after all, you have filed a complaint and they hired you and--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Is different from what it would have happened an hour later?  Different from what--   Stephen G. Breyer  --would have happened if they'd corrected the error and gone back and done the same thing--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --because?   INTERRUPTING ",02-811X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What's... what's the citation of that?  I mean, you refer to Rule 6, and Rule 6 governs a whole lot of famous time limits, new trials, 60(b) motions, et cetera.  So, therefore, there must be a lot of cases where the following thing happened: Somebody made a motion under Rule 59, or whatever it is, out of time, all right, a day late--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --A day late.   Stephen G. Breyer  And then nobody said a word about it.  Then one year later, for the first time on appeal, the other side says, oh, I agree we never said a word about this before so we're raising it now for the first time, and the court said, fine, you can raise it for the first time.  Now, what are the cases that hold that?  I mean, I'm not saying there aren't any, I haven't faced this before, but I would have thought it comes up million... you know, quite a lot of times where people forget to... or they don't care or whatever it is, and they raise something very late.  What are those cases?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not talking about bankruptcy.  I'm talking about Rule 6, ordinary civil cases.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm talking about civil rules of procedure, ordinary civil cases.  Probably there are, I would guess conservatively 100,000 cases a year that may fall into this category.  In a certain percentage of those, the deadlines will be missed--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and in a certain percentage of that percentage, the other side will have said nothing--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --waking up on appeal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then there must be a lot of cases, if you're right, that would say, that's okay.  I'm just repeating myself because I think there are no cases and I think, to me, that shows you're wrong, but now I'm open to hearing that there are a lot or even one.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is Kirsch a bankruptcy case?  I'm not talking about a bankruptcy case.  District court... that's a district court case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right, so that would definitely support you, and what's the name of that case?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that's what I wonder... I'm asking because Rule 6, I think, would be analogous to that and so if you... there are some cases--   ",02-819X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is your view on this as a bankruptcy attorney thinking, I mean, I don't see that it affects your client one way or the other, but, I mean, obviously the Solicitor General in this case has suggested an affirmance on the very narrow ground that maybe they're quite right about what the rule should be interpreted, but still they lost the chance to raise the rule because they didn't raise it.  All right, that's a very narrow ground.  On the other hand, the split in the circuits is more on the broader question of how absolute are these rules in... how absolute are the deadlines in this particular rule, and that's a broader question, which is also a possible ground for affirmance, so either way your client would win.  But, as a bankruptcy lawyer, what's your opinion?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  A problem then about the other part that says you can't extend the deadlines in this main part except for the reasons that are there given, which is good cause, et cetera, what do we do about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where is... where is that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Was that in... did you make that argument in your brief?   Stephen G. Breyer  So you think this is a totally different issue and it's a much broader issue and more important--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --And you think, in other words, if they had come in and said, hey, we... I've been taking all the money out of wife's account, putting... put it in... you know, I put it all in her name, ha ha ha, and I had hired people to prevent the creditor from ever finding out, that then the correct defense there would be equitable estoppel, which is an enlargement of the time period?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm... I'm assuming they acted very inequitably.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You see, that... that's the argument the other way.  The argument the other way is you don't really need to import these defenses into the rule itself because there are other ways in the bankruptcy law that an unfair kind of conduct that can be dealt with.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's a hypothetical case.  I'm trying to get to the issue the... that's bothering me.  Can you just give me one word about whether my belief about the Rule 6... it refers to a new trial motion in a civil case, motion to amend the opinion, JNOV, all those time limits it says are absolute.  Now, I take it it's never been held or isn't at least normally held that a lawyer can sit there, notice that the time limits weren't complied with, wait to see if he wins, and then if he loses, bring it up for the first time on appeal.  Am I right about that?  Because they're saying, no, I'm not right about it.   INTERRUPTING ",02-819X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What other argument is there?  I don't understand.  I thought... and I'm just mixed up about this.  I thought that there is a Z regulation.  It's called Regulation Z. And I thought Regulation Z says the following is not part of the finance charge, a charge for exceeding a credit limit.  Now, are we talking about something in this case that is not a charge for exceeding a credit limit?   Stephen G. Breyer  What?   Stephen G. Breyer  Does it say on the paper this is a charge for exceeding a credit limit?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And so it's called an over-limit fee assessment and you pay it if you exceed the credit limit.  You don't pay it if you exceed the credit limit, or do you?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, okay.  Well, what is the answer to the factual question?  Do you pay for exceeding the credit limit or do you not pay it for exceeding the credit limit?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So--  --It depends, doesn't it, on--  --there's a new argument, the first time in this Court, that this is not a fee for exceeding a credit limit.  Was it made below in any form?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, yes, but, I mean... that may be.  I'm just asking, have you ever told any court before today that this is not the... I'm not... it sounds sarcastic, but I don't mean it to be sarcastic.  I want to know.  Have you ever before argued in this case, told a judge and... that this is not a fee, quote, for exceeding a credit limit?  End quote.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Ms. Goldsmith, we wouldn't resolve a whole lot in this case, however, if we didn't reach that question, would we?   Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't think that was the Government's argument in my... as I read it.  I thought there are some words here.  For exceeding a... it says, for exceeding a credit limit.  And as I understood the argument... I might not have perfectly well... is... I thought that their argument is basically when you exceed a credit limit, the company doesn't want you to do it.  Okay?  So it says, no.  And if you do it, we're not going to cancel you out, but we will charge you a penalty.  Now, sometimes it's what you say.  Sometimes the company would love you to do it and get the extra money.  In fact, they might make profits on that.  So they'd love you to do it.  But trying to distinguish between those two instances is too difficult, and because it's too difficult, we are going to have a blanket rule, and the blanket rule is if you fall within these words, exceeding a credit limit, this is not a finance charge.  Now, that's what I understood it to be, a typical administrative agency argument.  And they say Chevron, Mead, et cetera, we win.  All right.  Now, suppose let me... for the purpose of answering, please assume that you do have a charge here that falls within the term, exceeding a credit limit.  What is your response to the argument that I just made?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So how does that work?  I... I exceed my credit by $15.  My colleague exceeds his credit by $42.  Each of us is charged a $15 late fee.  What's the interest rate?  And, of course, there are an infinite number of possibilities.  So I guess I'd get a... a statement that would be every conceivable possibility of how much I go over with interest rates ranging from like.2 percent to 48,000 percent.  So, I mean, how... how is this supposed to work?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I think that's why Justice Stevens might have thought it's going to confuse the consumer if you win, not help the consumer.  I would think it's much more informative to the consumer to know that my interest rate for all of the things up to the... my credit limit has been this past month so much, and... and then see a separate charge, God, I got socked 15 bucks for going over my credit limit.  You think you're helping the consumer by... by taking that $15 separate charge and just mushing it into the general overall credit limit so that instead of thinking he's being charged 10 percent, he thinks he's being charged 11... 11 percent, and he doesn't know anything about the late... about the... the going over his over limit fee?  I don't think that helps him at all.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But, of course, the difficulty for you is all you have to say is that the view I was taking somewhat by argument is a reasonable one, and if it's a reasonable one, I guess it's a reasonable interpretation of the statute.  And therefore, Regulation Z doesn't violate it.  Now... now, you haven't been able to show us how we'd get on the opposite interpretation.  We didn't even know what the statement would look like.  So it's very hard for me to say it's not reasonable what the... what the... that Regulation Z, isn't it?   ",02-857X

Then you have to say Sixth Amendment of the Federal Constitution?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In your--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Right.  In... in your opinion, as a lawyer who, I take it, is involved in these things--   Stephen G. Breyer  --is there really a big problem of differences among the lower circuits... among the lower courts?  To what extent do we have to find a rule?  I take it the rule now is called fair presentation?   Stephen G. Breyer  And there are dozens of ways it could be done.  And so the court is just like... supposed to look at the individual circumstance, say was it done, was it not done?  Here you think it was done because the whole thing's two pages, they refer to the Federal Constitution in the... in the citation of authorities, and they have no particular, et cetera.  All right.  Now, is there a problem or isn't there a problem among the circuits in applying this fair presentation test?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is it... are they real differences in terms of what counts or--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --are they just differences in--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

If you don't remember, that's all right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Breyer  Well, I thought you acknowledged that it... that it imposes some legal duties; that is to say, that if... if the agency took action, took affirmative action, which would destroy its ability to follow through on the plan, you know, allowed development in a certain area that the plan anticipated would be left undeveloped, that an injunction would lie for that.

As to those four areas, are you saying as to one, two, three, or four, that the land use plan as it now reads requires them to be closed in part or in whole and they're not following the plan?

Am I supposed to decide the case on the assumption... you've narrowed it to four areas... to area one.  Let's take that.  Am I supposed to decide it on the ground that what you want is you think the land use plan as written is perfect.  You just want them to enforce it.  Or that you want them to change what it says in those words because you think it's wrong.  That's all.  I mean, you must think one or the other or both.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Breyer  Okay.  Now, my question then... and that's what I thought you wanted... is why isn't the thing to do, if that's the kind of relief you want, to file a piece of paper over at the BLM and say, we want this document amended because it seems to me that this document has the status of a rule and every agency... every agency... has a procedure through which you can request an amendment of a rule.  Why wouldn't that be the right procedure rather than to come into court and say we want a judge to do it first in the first instance?   Stephen G. Breyer  So if in fact this is the equivalent of the kind of document I said, then why wouldn't your lawsuit be to compel them to act on this request in a timely fashion?  Maybe the timely fashion would be in 4 days if it's an emergency.  But why wouldn't this lawsuit be designed to ask them to do what you asked them to do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly.  But this time it's a... in... in a form recognizable to men, women, and administrative lawyers.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  And when you say there is no precedent... I mean, I think a much more modest claim than you're making, the claim simply that a state cannot discriminate against out-of-state liquor... i.e., the physical liquid... which is really more modest and keeps the three-tier effect... now, your... that claim, that they couldn't do that, was really what was advanced in Young's Market.  I read the briefs in that case.  The briefs presented that Court... you could have written those briefs.  And the difficulty for you is, it articulated that more modest version very clearly, made a tremendously strong case, that was not forbidden by Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment.  And this Court squarely rejected it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The result, I understand, you could put on the basis of there being no discrimination.   Stephen G. Breyer  Reading Justice Brandeis' opinion, I can't believe that that was the basis for his result.   Stephen G. Breyer  I know you do.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know you do, but the principle of Webb-Kenyon, which was enacted when the Wilson Act was already there... very clear... is to stop the original package doctrine, stop favoritism of the out-of-state liquor shipment, which meant, in a dry state, you had to sell less.  I mean, that's what it's there for.  I didn't find a word, in other words, contrary to what I've just said; and if there are such words, now is the time to point them to me... to point them out.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I'm trying to think of what Brandeis could have been thinking.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, that's right.  And this is a reconstruction, because I have no doubt, and you have no doubt, that Section 2 was meant to end that part of the dormant Commerce Clause that would come under the name of original package doctrine--   Stephen G. Breyer  --which meant that the foreign liquor has to be treated better than domestic liquor.  Now, he's thinking,  ""Why is that? ""  ""What is that package doctrine? ""  And the answer is, the dormant Commerce Clause... it's part of the dormant Commerce Clause... the dormant Commerce Clause is the implication from the existence of the commerce power in the Constitution.  So if we have an amendment that says  ""that aspect of the dormant Commerce Clause doesn't apply. ""  that means the dormant Commerce Clause doesn't apply, because you can't divide the dormant Commerce Clause into six different parts, or even two.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, maybe... I think that's how he's reasoning.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if he is, and even if he isn't, why isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But could Congress pass a law forbidding it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  All right.  But I need an answer to it.  [Laughter]  Because, you see, what's going to come next is, if you say yes, I'm going to say,  ""Well, didn't it pass that law with the Wilson Act? ""   Stephen G. Breyer  What did--   ",03-1116
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You put your finger on exactly what's the part of this case that's bothering me.  Read through the language.  As you read through the language, disparate impact does seem to be called for, and this particular provision, reasonable factors other than age, seems a defense to that, just as BFOQ is the defense to disparate treatment.  And that all seems to work.  But you read the definition of reasonable factor other than age to mean business necessity or even Justice O'Connor's opinion, which is pretty tough.  It's hard for an employer to make that defense.  And while making it hard to make that defense in the case of gender or race discrimination, in fact works in my opinion perfectly well.  You start making it hard to make that defense here and you're going to have a nightmare because every effort by any employer to equalize to any degree pay or treatment of his or her employees is going to have a disparate impact in respect to age because the correlation with age runs into all kinds of things that it doesn't in the other cases.  So I can't believe that Congress really would have wanted that, but the reason I can't believe it is because I can't believe the business necessity part of it.  And so here I'm faced with a reg which, at one and the same time, pulls in disparate impact and business necessity, and now I don't know what to do.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Easier... easier is a matter of degree.   Stephen G. Breyer  And reasonable factor could be interpreted to say what the employer... but the employer just doesn't like paying these executives so much money when these new younger janitors make so little.  And so he says, I want to pay the new younger janitors more.  Okay?  There we've got it.  Disparate impact.   Stephen G. Breyer  And now you say, what's the business necessity?  And frankly, there wasn't one.  It's just that I found it sort of bad.  All right?  So there we are.  I've lost my case.  Now, that's what is worrying me, and I thought perhaps this reg that seems to say... and lower courts have accepted that I would lose my case... that this reg is outside Congress'... the agency's authority for that reason because Congress couldn't have intended that result.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --suppose I want--   Stephen G. Breyer  --So here... here you're saying you're not attacking reasonable factor other than age.  It has to be based on reasonable factor other than age.  And I take it here you're saying it's not based on what they advance as reasonable factors.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  But if I... I say my explanation for why I pay the newer people more is really I like to have that atmosphere.  You make less money in my business, but it's more democratic and people are happier even though no one will invest in my company.  [Laughter]  But still, I'd like a commune.  All right?  That's how I want to do it.  Now, that's not totally idiotic.  It's plausible.  So I just win.  Right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Ah, I lose a treatment case.  No, no.  I'm not... I'm just... it's I'm not paying the younger workers more.  I'm paying the newer workers more.  All right?  They happen to be much the same category, but I... I don't want it.  It's not age.  Or, you know, I pay the lower paid workers more.  How's that?  Do I win?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  I paid the lower paid workers more?  I want to bring them up to the executives.  I... I like it.  It's more democratic and it makes a happier group.  And... and so, now, do I win or lose?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I win.  And I don't have to say any more than that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it's not the number of cases either.  I mean, you could have... it wouldn't take much to have a single case that has a rule in it, say, that makes it very difficult for an employer to do things of type X or type Y, and that would have enormous impact even though you'd say, well, it was just one case.   ",03-1160
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  All that's true, but they... they did promulgate this guideline, as far as... I looked it up.  At that time, they said, look, it's going to be disparate impact, and they cited Griggs.  And people have put comments, which I haven't read yet, but I imagine the comments went to disparate impact.  And then when they rewrote it in this form, they have a little paragraph of explanation which makes pretty clear it's meant to be disparate impact.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, all right.  But I mean, they... everybody knew what they were driving at at the time they promulgated this.  So it seemed to me that if... if we're not governed by the reg, it must be because the reg is outside the statutory authority.  And it might be outside the statutory authority if in fact it embodies too tough a test.   Stephen G. Breyer  But now we've heard it doesn't embody that much of a tough test, and you know, the EEOC isn't here to tell us--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --what in fact it thinks.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So we don't know what the Government's position is.  They're not here.  So suppose I think, one, the language is against you, the language of the statute.  I do think it's against you.  Two, the EEOC reg does foresee a disparate impact test.  Three, the practicalities are absolutely with you, and that has to go with the scope of the statute.  And four, it might be possible for the EEOC to write a reg that deals with the problems you're worried about while advancing a disparate impact test.  Suppose I think all those things--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --which are at least consistent.  What would I do with this case?  That's my problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where the Government hasn't appeared and told us what they want to do or what they think should be done, et cetera.   Stephen G. Breyer  That would be a fairly easy burden... a fairly easy burden to me.  And... and to give you a fairly easy burden is consistent with the idea of trying to get employers to think about the problem.  An employer who uses a different factor which is correlated with age but it's... it's an unreasonable thing to do or it isn't the real basis hasn't thought about the harm that he's working.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So we could give you an easy burden and still accomplish the objective.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  How does that work?  Because the... the particular language, it shall be unlawful for an employer to classify his employees in any way that would adversely affect an individual's status... his status, it says... as an employee because of such individual's age.  Now, that sounds as if it's driving right at disparate impact.  It's... it's unlawful to classify an employee in any way that would adversely affect him because of his age.  That's what it says.  And then you turn to defense and it says, but there's the defense with a differentiation, i.e., the classification is based on reasonable factors other than age.  And therefore it would sound as if it says, look at the factor and ask is the factor reasonable.  If so, the employer wins if it's really based on that factor.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How do we get out of that language?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, but it says... it says that would adversely affect him because of his age.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, no.  It's not intent because if you read it as a part of classifying, which you'd have to do to get it because of intent, you'd have to say to classify his employees because of such individual's age.  Now, that's a little tough because you're talking about employees, and then you go to such individual.   Stephen G. Breyer  It would be the natural way.   Stephen G. Breyer  The natural way... wait.  The natural way is to read it as modifying to deprive--   Stephen G. Breyer  --or otherwise adversely affect.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's the natural way to read it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --suppose we read it that way.  Then what do you say?   INTERRUPTING ",03-1160

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's... that's the problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's the problem because here we're dealing with the fee to be paid by the people who are plated in Michigan, and it looks like that $100 is the fee for them.  Well, let me... I have a question.  I'm trying to test this.  Suppose that I have a company in Maine.  All right?  And I have... I decide all my... I... I have all Maine plates, by the way.  And I decide I want my... now, let's... one word is license plates.  I'm going to talk about plating.  Another word is the ICC insurance.  Let's call it a decal.  And the third kind of a concept is whatever you refer to in your statute by a fee.  The $100.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, suppose in Maine what I do with my trucks is I say I want Michigan to be my home State for purposes of... what do you call it?  The SS?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  And so I go to Michigan, and now I pay all the registration fees here.  Do I get a... a certificate of some kind, a decal or something to show I did it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, yes.  So... that's right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Do I get a decal after I go through all this procedure?  You have a whole form.  I pay $6 for Alabama.  I pay $2 for Idaho, and... but... but I do it all in one shopping place which happens to be Michigan.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then do I get a little certificate to put on the truck to say I did it.  I... I registered my ICC decal everywhere.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, it's not.   Stephen G. Breyer  I know for Michigan.  But I have to pay.  But Michigan is my... I can't ask the question until I get clear on this.   Stephen G. Breyer  Don't... when I... when I go under this... this 49 U.S.C. 14504 and I choose a home State--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and I make all the relevant payments to that State, but they distribute, don't I get a piece of paper saying I did it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  Now, I'm now plated in Michigan, and I make Michigan my home State for this.  And I go and I make... I say, Michigan, I'm going to give you this big check to distribute, but the amount I'm putting here for Michigan, by the way, is zero.  And you say pay me $100.  No.  I'm not going to do it.  So I haven't paid them the $100.  I haven't paid Michigan everything, but I paid $2 for Idaho.  Do I get the decal or don't I?   Stephen G. Breyer  Excellent.  Now, if I don't get the decal, because I didn't pay the $100, then that $100 is a charge that falls within the SSI.  It is a charge for a decal which shows that I registered the ICC and my insurance because otherwise, if it weren't, you'd give me the decal.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm talking about a fee.  I'm trying to... oh, fine.  If there's no fee charged and I didn't pay the $100 and I didn't pay anything else, you'd give me the decal.  But you said you wouldn't.   ",03-1230
1,NO QUESTIONS,03-1237
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What are the first few words of the sentence there that you quoted?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly.  And so, they are saying that they're wrong on their ground for thinking that the language and context don't embrace it.  Since they used the wrong standard, they never got to the question of whether the evidence warranted a directed verdict.  So I don't see how we avoid looking at all of what you'd call the atmospherics.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because they interpreted the statute in a particular way.  Isn't that right?  I'm asking.  I'm not--   Stephen G. Breyer  --No?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  That would answer that question?   Stephen G. Breyer  So they say that does not... the safe harbor does not reach, among other things, back down the chain of experimentation to embrace the development of new drugs that will be subject to FDA approval.  In your opinion, is that statement, as I read it... I left out the word ""identification""... as I read it, is that statement a correct statement of the law, or incorrect statement?   Stephen G. Breyer  That is a correct statement of the law.  So then, I take it, the other thinks that it isn't, because, for example, you could have a situation where you are developing drugs, and, in developing drugs, you do some experiments and you get some information that would be useful to the FDA and the IND process, and, therefore, they are within the safe harbor.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, this very dialogue makes me able to ask a question that I think will reveal better to you what I need an answer to.  Reading this, and listening to the discussion, and your use of the word ""atmospherics"", suggests that the opinion below is pretty foggy.  We have Merck, the Food and Drug Administration, the Government, the entire biotechnology industry, the drug industry of the United States, and everybody else telling us that they are wrong in the way they stated the standard.  And you, yourself, urge us to look beyond the way they stated it.  So, what's the harm, and why wouldn't we, given this and the unclarity, just try to do a better job at stating the standard, say, ""That's the standard"", and then send it back, and then you can make all your arguments there about how it applies.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's important.  They say they want to know the pharmacological action of the drug in relation to its proposed therapeutic indication.  The reason, I take it, the word ""efficacy"" is not there directly is because that word has a history, the Kefauver hearings, and it was involving drugs that don't do anything.  Safety is a different matter.  But of course when you consider whether something is safe, you must know, since, for example, cancer drugs poison people, the extent to which that poisoning is outbalanced by its effect in curing people.  So how could you possibly, particularly where cancer is at issue, know whether this is an appropriately safe drug, without knowing how effective it is, as well as knowing the side effects that are... that are harmful?  If I knew that there was any answer to that question at all, I might be tempted to agree with you, because it doesn't use the word.  But what's the answer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose that we concluded... well, I don't want to cut you off.  Go ahead, please.  I cut you off.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but the reason you brought it up is because the particular certificate that is for a safety-certified lab is not applicable to the lab that used this stuff.  That's why you brought it up, I think.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I understand that.  And you'd have to conclude, for them to win... but suppose I did conclude... suppose, for hypothetical... the sake of... for... as a hypothetical, suppose I thought, yes, this does include the safety part, looking at how effective drugs are, too.  Suppose I concluded that the statute meant sometimes you could do that, in an ordinary laboratory that didn't have the special certificate?  Suppose I concluded that, indeed, you could look well in advance of the clinical test period to get the information for the IND?  And suppose I concluded that sometimes, where it was reasonably related, you could, in fact, look at other drugs, too, that are related to the ones you do.  If I concluded that... and I'm not saying I would... then would you concede that a directed verdict would have been appropriate against you?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?  And what's your strongest argument that it wouldn't?   INTERRUPTING ",03-1237

If we do accept the continuous workday rule, why isn't it, in effect, the premise from which the conclusion for the other side falls?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But what do you think about the possibility,  ""it depends on the clothes and depends on the equipment. ""  so that, in Steiner and here, it's a lot of protective gear, it's really quite part of the job and special and unusual.  In Mt.  Clemens, it's a kind of uniform.  It's just washing your hands, putting on an apron.

Breyer  --that footnote... that's where I actually got the idea... it says,  ""We reserve, in certain situations.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask you about a... the other part of the case?  I mean, I think, as I've suggested, most of these things are up to the agency.  They're minor things in the law, so... but it seems well established in the agency reg, as well as in Skidmore, the famous line about waiting being,  ""Are you waiting to be engaged, or are you engaged to wait? ""  So, assuming that this is just putting on and off clothes that are essential... so, assume you win on that part... when they wait to put on the clothes, you would think... if it's like an airport, sometimes you wait; if you're lucky, you don't.  Well, under those circumstances, you wouldn't be engaged to wait.  You're waiting to put on the clothes, not... you know, it's a... so, why would you win on that part?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But suppose sometimes you have to wait?  Sometimes it's a minute, sometimes it's nothing.  Is it like an airport?  Or does the employer here say,  ""You must show up seven minutes early, because there'll be a wait? ""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that what the reg says?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

And, if it is, where does it say that in the regs?   Stephen G. Breyer  Do we have to decide the second question?  I think it's actually quite difficult.  I can find a lot of authority that seems to me just a random--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --No, no, no.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't mean that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I just want to ask one question.  Don't they have a claim interpreted favorably to them that this has nothing to do with a contract, totally nothing?  Okay?  But there happen to be some rules over there in the CIA in their books somewhere, which we've never read, and they say when we use a foreign person as a spy, we'll pay him some money or we give him something.  We have some procedures.  Now, we don't have to do that as a matter of contract.  We don't have to do it at all, but we do it.  And so there's a claim here that we want to see that they're following their own rules.  They say Totten doesn't apply to that because Totten is about contracts.  Our claim isn't about contracts.

If you're suing on promissory estoppel, you win because you're a spy, if you win.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is the percentage amount of the payments that are taken out of all IRA plans before people are 59 and a half?   Stephen G. Breyer  And the... the payment here... it says... the statute uses the word payment.  So suppose you simply have an IRA plan but you don't take money out of it.  Then is it exempt from bankruptcy?   Stephen G. Breyer  So... so... but I'm trying... what I'm trying to figure out is if a person were to take... just reading it in English, it sounds as if a person were to take the plan out before he's 59 and a half and pay the penalty, that that amount that he took out would not be a... a payment because of age, but one that he took out after he's 59 and a half and didn't pay the penalty would be.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's... I'm trying to figure out how... how... what the theory is.  Is... you say I have a right to receive payments because of age.  And you say, well, here I have a body of money and 99 percent comes out of it after you're 60.  1 percent comes out before.  So it's very tempting to say that that corpus there, of course, is a body of money that you're going to have a right to receive because of age because the practical effect of the 10 percent is... is... stops the... the younger person getting the money.  So does the case then turn on that?  I mean, suppose... suppose it were a 3 percent penalty and 40 percent of the people took out the money before they were 60 or a 1 percent penalty and 80 percent did it.  Then should I reach the other result?  I'm just trying to think of how does this analysis work.  What's the right analysis?   Stephen G. Breyer  What percent?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But as purely English... as purely English, I read it as saying it's a right.  What is that right?  The right is a right to receive a payment on account of age.  That's the... a plan.  That's the right.  Now, your argument, I take it, was... is that yes, it's true you also have a right under certain conditions to take it without respect to age.  So what we have here is a plan that gives you both kind of rights.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's a kind that gives you a right to take it with a penalty and a right to take it because of age without a penalty.  And thus, the question is, is that kind of plan which gives you both kind of rights covered?  And the language doesn't answer it.  So--   ",03-1407
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What... what--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Now, why?  Okay.  Once you're down that road, you have conceded, as you must, that a plan that says you get the money because of age but you also can get the money without respect to age in certain circumstances can be a plan covered by the act.  Now, that's the kind of a plan that's right in front of you.  So, therefore, literally it falls just as much within the language as the other that you want to say even though that is literally true, this plan is very different from the others in terms of the purposes of the act.  That's what I would like to hear because to me, I'm not so moved by holistic as I am by purposes, which is part of holistic.  So... so the... the point that I would like to know is why, since ordinary people think of IRA's as pensions... I do.  I think of it that way.  I don't know much about it.  It's designed to help in the future, help when you're old and sick.  But there is this extra thing in it which you point to.  So why, in terms of purposes is this different from the others?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know that, but... but... and you do it with a penalty.  We agree about the facts.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I want to know why that difference makes a difference in a world where only 1 or less 2 percent of the people do access it before they're 60, 59 and a half.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I... you've missed my point and I'm sorry.  I put you on the wrong track with my following up.  I shouldn't have.   Stephen G. Breyer  My question is we all agree that there can be plans where you can get the money not having to do with age, and they fall within the language of the act, and indeed, you say some are covered.  But this one you say is worse than the others in terms of the purposes of the act, and that's what I want to hear why.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But if that's the answer, excellent.  So now we have--  [Laughter]  --let's say--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Let's try... let's try a million percent tax and nobody in history has ever withdrawn the money.  Now, would... that you would say would fall within this.   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine, yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, if that would fall within this, going back to Justice Stevens, because that operates as a bar to prevent the bad world that Justice Scalia mentioned, why doesn't a tax that operates as a bar that's good enough to stop 98.5 percent of the people from withdrawing their money and having nothing left for old age... why isn't that just as good as the million percent tax in a world that is imperfect?   Stephen G. Breyer  93.   Stephen G. Breyer  Should we put any weight on the title, on the name?  I mean, I... I can't but thinking it's an individual retirement account.  Was Congress trying to fool people?  [Laughter]  Was the Federal Trade Commission?  Should they investigate?  What... I mean, the... the... I think of it as an account that's basically aimed, at least Congress thought it was aimed, at retirement, which has usually to do with age.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm reading the statute and if I were voting on it and put in the 408 reference and think of the word individual retirement account, is there any... I would have thought, knowing not that much about it, that of course, they'd be included.  Now, is there any indication, when people passed this, that they didn't think they would be?  Any... any reference in the terrible words, legislative history, that might shed light on it?   ",03-1407

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, I don't understand. Is there any authority in the commerce cases for... an X, which is there in the middle of a state, and it doesn't move one way or the other... now, Congress' power does extend to the X if the state doesn't say something about the X.  But if the state says something about the X, then Congress' power does not extend to it.  That's hard for me to accept, because I don't see... whether it's commerce or not commerce, whether it affects something or doesn't affect something, doesn't seem to me to have much to do with whether the state separately regulates it, and I can't find any support at all for that in any case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, here, they say... look, I take it you're using this because I was going to ask you.  You know, he grows heroin, cocaine, tomatoes that are going to have genomes in them that could, at some point, lead to tomato children that will eventually affect Boston.  You know, we can... oil that's never, in fact, being used, but we want an inventory of it, federally.  You know, I can multiply the examples--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and you can, too.  So you're going to get around all those examples by saying what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So now what you're saying is, in a Commerce Clause case, what we're supposed to do is to start to look at the federal scheme and the state scheme and see, comparing the federal scheme and the state scheme, whether, given the state scheme, the federal scheme is really necessary to include this.  That's a task, and I'm trying to make it as complicated as I can in my question.  [Laughter]  But I see it very well.  Here is what they say.  They say that,  ""By the way, a hundred-thousand people using medical marijuana in California will lead to lower marijuana prices in the nation. ""  ""Bad. ""  ""And, second, when we see medical marijuana in California, we won't know what it is. "" ""Everybody'll say, ""Mine is medical"".""  ""Certificates will circulate on the black market. ""  ""We face a mess. ""  ""For both those reasons, it does have an impact. ""  they say.  Now, what's your response?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, we don't want more people--   Stephen G. Breyer  --in the illicit drug market.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  And we don't want low prices, either.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, normally I would have said, it's up to Congress to figure out how to... the way that... you have one going one way, one going the other way, and balancing those factors would be for Congress.  That's what we'd normally say.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And you say all that stuff is not for Congress; that's for us.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what it is, is, it's non-economic, and it affects the economic.   Stephen G. Breyer  So this is a new framework, I take it, and it's very interesting.  And one of the things that interests me... I guess, on your framework, Lopez should have come out my way.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because it's essential to regulate guns in schools as part of a national gun-control regulatory scheme.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I thought we didn't need to reach all that here, for the reason that the connection here, which is an enforcement-related connection and a market-related connection, is actually, I have to confess, a little more obvious and a little more close than what I had to... what I had to say in Lopez to... was the connection between guns, education, communities, and business.  So I would have thought, given the... and I believe that, you know... but, I mean... but that was far further than this, which is just direct.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what the Court said, I take it... and I have quoted a lot of the language there... it says that the wheat farmer's consumption of home-grown wheat, not the part that went in... quote,  ""though it may not be regarded as commerce-- ""   Stephen G. Breyer  --end quote, still can be regulated, quote, ""whatever its nature"", so long as, quote,  ""it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce. ""  Now, that's the language, and I take it that Justice Scalia is exactly right, I thought, from that language, it's about the analysis, home-grown wheat, which is not economic, having an effect on something that is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Which is not commerce.  Sorry, not commerce.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the Commerce Clause speaks in terms of commerce.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'd like to ask you one question about the activity--   Stephen G. Breyer  --which was brought up before, and I just... I've never understood this.  I'm not an expert.  I don't honestly know, if I really think about it, despite all the papers and so forth, whether it's true that medical marijuana is helpful to people in ways that pills are not.  I really don't know.  So I would have thought that the people, like your clients, who have a strong view about it, would go to the FDA, and they would say to the FDA,  ""FDA, take this off the list. ""  ""You must take it off the list if it has an accepted medical use and it isn't lacking in safety. ""  The FDA will say yes or it will say no.  If it says yes, they win.  If they say no, they can come right into court and say, ""That's an abuse of discretion"".  The Court says yes or no.  If it says no, it must be because it wasn't an abuse of discretion, in which case, I, as a judge, and probably as a person, would think it isn't true that marijuana has some kind of special use.  So that would seem to me to be the obvious way to get what they want.  That seems to me to be relevant to the correct characterization.  And while the FDA can make mistakes, I guess medicine by regulation is better than medicine by referendum.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So that's... I just want to know why.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's all true, but as long as that hasn't been done, don't I have to take this case on the assumption that there is no such thing as medical marijuana that's special and necessary?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If has been done, maybe I shouldn't make it.   ",03-1454
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  That... that... what you've quoted many... much of this I wouldn't repeat in polite company.  You've reported one of the most mild, and in fact there are two findings.  One, this is not just defamation.  It was an action for defamation, as well as a tort of invasion of privacy.  And there is a finding, first, that this was done intentionally to create a negatively charged and ominous environment, and this is not a matter of speech-related issues.  It is simply the use of false and defamatory and privacy-invading communications, or worse, or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in tribute for... for desisting from that type of activity.  All right.  Now, those are the findings against you.  So suppose I agreed with you hypothetically that that, with all these findings, is nonetheless protected by the First Amendment.  All right?  Now, suppose, in other words, you convince me of that.  Now, I want to know how to write my opinion on that assumption to protect what I was worried about yesterday, that a woman who has a boyfriend or a husband is being continuously harassed in... with methods similar to this one.  It's easy to transpose those two cases which are both on my mind.  And I want to know if in your opinion that these restraining orders, which try to prevent this kind of thing, among others, are unconstitutional, if there's a way of distinguishing them, if you could possibly win on what theory.  And what I'm trying to get you to do is to say is it absolute.  Are there limits?  If so, what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Always?  Do you want to apply that to an harassment action too against a woman who has the restraining order?  No restraining orders in divorce cases in case they're against speech because even if violence is threatened, even if... et cetera.  I mean, how... how far do you want to push that principle?   INTERRUPTING ",03-1488
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So... so if... before leaving that point, what the injunction prohibits is that Tory and those acting in concert, cooperation, or participation with him from, in a public forum, orally uttering statements about Cochran.  All right.  That's what it says.  Now, do you think that if Tory or someone acting in cooperation with him says, I've had a change of heart, Johnnie Cochran is a marvelous person, and he says that on television... do you think that individual at that time has violated this injunction?   Stephen G. Breyer  Absolutely not.  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It said the words.  They violated the words.  It was a statement, but he has not violated the injunction because?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, no, no.  He does it in a public forum.  In fact, he hires Disney Hall.  [Laughter]  And moreover, he gets on stage and announces it.  Okay?  There's no problem about a public forum.  So, now, why doesn't it violate the injunction?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I thought what you were going to say... but you're not.  So I'm very interested in that, and I'm glad I asked.  I thought you were going to say when it says uttering statements, it means statements of the kind or identical to those we have identified earlier in this opinion.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But, now, you haven't said that.  I said it, and I think it's too late for you to say it.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  But it would be so easy.  I mean, it's virtually no burden.  I take it what you're saying is that this injunction in paragraph 2 at its heart is aimed at in public forums, keeping insults suggesting he was a crook against Johnnie Cochran unless you pay me $10,000.  Then I'll stop.  Okay?  Now, at its heart, that's what it's aimed at.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And you are saying if in fact it's ever enforced outside that heartland, you can have a defense.  It would violate the First Amendment.  But since it's so easy just to write those words we just said right in paragraph 2, why shouldn't the judge have to do it?  It's so easy.  Say this is aimed at the heartland just as I said it and you said it, and it doesn't apply outside of it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How does California work in that respect?  Because what I've been thinking of in my mind is that maybe we shouldn't decide this in terms of State law boxes, that California seems to have an action.  Let's call it a buzz action to get away from words.  And what that action is it's a defamation but a certain kind.  It's defamation accompanied by extortion.  And when you have defamation accompanied by extortion... call it whatever you want... an injunction is proper in these circumstances.  Now, can we decide it in such a way that we're not talking about all defamation actions?  We are talking about this beast in California which uses the word defamation but also finds injunction and therefore issues... also finds extortion and therefore issues an injunction.   Stephen G. Breyer  But then you run into the public figure.  I mean, that's a much more dangerous kind of rule of law, isn't it?  I mean, a pure defamation action against a public figure, which they want to say this is.  You can write all kinds of things about public figures.  People can and do, for better or for worse.  Do... is there any authority for issuing in a pure defamation action an injunction?   ",03-1488
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is it concurrent?  I mean, the... the statute I'm reading, the one you brought is consent is given to join the United States as a necessary party defendant.  Is that what happened here?  They were joined as a necessary party defendant?   Stephen G. Breyer  They were?  I... I think that's... isn't that... what rule of... I thought there's a... a Rule of Federal Procedure.  I can't remember what... what's the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.  Is that what they were joined under?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Well, all right.  Were they... there's technical phrase well known in the law to be joined as a necessary party defendant.  Given the normal meaning in the law of that technical phrase, is that what happened here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, okay.  If it did not happen, then how could you possibly sue in that court rather than the Court of Claims where the statute says you can sue on any implied, as well as express, contract?   Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't mean in any suit in sentence 2 of the kind referred to in sentence 1?  Does it mean any suit in the universe?  Any suit in the world?  Any tort suit?  I would have thought that sentence 2 refers to sentence 1.   Stephen G. Breyer  But don't... how can we, if we have... if... if I read this... this as meaning technically what it says and it's a jurisdictional matter, how could I do anything other than say, go to the Court of Claims, you're in the wrong court?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  It says--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --in any suit you can join the United States as a necessary party.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but it's a... see, I want to know what I'm supposed to do.  As I read the language, you're out.  As I understand the purpose of the statute, it makes sense to me if you're out, and it doesn't make sense to me if you're in.  And maybe there's some lower court precedent to the contrary, which I'd certainly read, but is there any Supreme Court precedent to the contrary that supports you?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  But that isn't the limiting part.  The limiting part is in any suit of a certain kind.   Stephen G. Breyer  What they give consent to is joinder as a necessary party.  And that is not what happened here.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's ordinary meaning, you're out because the ordinary meaning of joinder as a necessary party is you weren't joined as a necessary--   Stephen G. Breyer  --How does that help you?  Because it says any suit pursuant to this section, and of course, this section starts off by talking about addition of a person as a necessary party.  So how does the last sentence help you?   Stephen G. Breyer  You... you agree with that.  I... you're caught in between us here, and I understand.  [Laughter]  And I guess we have to figure out what is the right meaning of that initial phrase.   ",03-1566
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So that... so your view... I mean, what... what makes sense to me is that the section means what it says, that consent is given to join the United States.  That means join them in an ongoing suit.  And it makes sense because what the United States wants is anyone who sues them for money damages goes to the Court of Claims.  But of course, where you have an ongoing suit between two other people, we'll make an exception because there it's already in another district and we'll let you bring the United States in as a necessary party.  The other exception is when you don't sue for money damages.  That's in section 702 of the APA.  Now, that to me makes a lot of sense and it's consistent with the language.  Is that your view or do you have a different view?   INTERRUPTING ",03-1566
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  --Except that we... I mean, the... the meaning of that term varies.  In... in some contexts, we say, well, it's... it's enough if... if confidence in... in that the result would have been the same has been shattered.  In... in the case at the other extreme with a case... we... I think that is strongest for you, we... we've said in the ineffective assistance of counsel context, yes, you've got to show that he wouldn't have pleaded guilty or he's got to show that he wouldn't have pleaded guilty otherwise.  And... and it seems to me that the... the issue here is, is this enough... is the context here enough like the context in ineffective assistance of counsel to... to put the heaviest burden on the petitioner, or is it... are there... are enough distinctions so that maybe the burden shouldn't be quite that heavy?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  No.  Your... we--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Let me... let me suggest at least a reason why maybe it isn't.  I'd like your comment on it.  In... in the ineffective assistance of counsel context, one reason for putting a high... you know, the heaviest burden on the defendant is that it is so very difficult to police effective assistance as you go along.  The judge watching the... the plea hearing has no way of knowing what's going on or has gone on between the lawyer and... and the client.  Here, we're in a different position.  There... there are a couple of people in a position to... to avoid the kind of problem that we've got here.  One obviously is the Federal judge.  If he had a checklist in front of him, something like this wouldn't have happened.  The second is counsel for the Government.  The counsel for the Government can get up in a case like this and say, Judge, you forgot something, and avoid this problem.  So it may be that because there are easier ways to avoid this, the burden on the defendant shouldn't have to be so heavy.  What do you say to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Normally... you may know... I'm just drawing on your background.  Normally when you say did it affect somebody's substantial rights, when I see those words, I think the judge did something to this person.  And when I say did it affect his substantial rights, I think, well, did it matter in terms of what the judge or the jury did to him.  Now, is that a correct way to think about it?  Are there other instances where substantial rights means something different than that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not talking about... I'm saying something happened to this human being who is there in court, and when I say did this affect his substantial rights, I usually ask myself did this error make a difference in terms of what happened to him.  That's how I... it's very colloquial, but that's the question I normally ask myself.  Now, maybe all these years I've been doing it wrong or maybe there's some circumstances where I should ask that question.  You know, like a death case, which is a horrible case, sometimes there's harmless error and usually the question there is did it matter in terms of his being sentenced to death.  Those come up a lot.  I'm just asking you a general question.  I don't have a point here.  I'm trying to figure out how best to think about this.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  If that is the correct formulation, can you think of other instances in the criminal law where substantial rights meant something other than this formulation?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's my question.  I'm asking it to inform myself and I have the same question for the other side too.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Like structural error.  That's one kind of exception.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I don't think we normally speak in terms of substantial rights in those cases.  Maybe we do.  I don't know.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So... so structural error cases are an instance where my colloquial question is not right and nobody claims here this is a structural error case.   Stephen G. Breyer  But... but if you're doing a subjective test, you might as... as long as you're doing that, why not accept the Ninth Circuit test: did he know?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I... I thought that this was the Ninth Circuit test that you disagree with.  And my... my point is if you're going to go this objective route, you might as well ask the basic question as the Ninth Circuit did.   INTERRUPTING ",03-167X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  --I read the Ninth Circuit.  It seemed to me we said just what you said we said.  What the Ninth Circuit says is Benitez must prove that the error was not minor or technical, which by the way, has nothing to do with it because a minor or technical error could well affect the outcome.  And then it says, and that he did not understand the rights at issue, which again is a necessary but not sufficient condition.  Now, where did they say anything about substantial rights?  They used those words, but if substantial rights means what I... we just discussed, which I'd like your view about, they never talked about substantial rights.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, didn't they say just what I read?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So why isn't it like summary reverse?  We said this.  You say that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, I see.  Now, then what does affect substantial rights mean?  Now, we have an error here that's not minor or technical.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now he, in fact... let's say second... did not understand that he had a right to withdraw.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, is that the end of the thing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Ah, ah, where... that's... that's the point.  Where in this opinion does it say that's not the end of the matter?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, not the fourth prong.  Where does it say that's not the end of the matter under the third prong?  You see, I could have a nontechnical matter.  Correct?   Stephen G. Breyer  I could... it could have affected my understanding, but it might be that I would have pled guilty anyway.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what's worrying me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the most obvious case is where the judge gives me the sentence I hoped for.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, I'm sorry.  A terribly minor, terribly important error, terribly important.  Indeed, the judge has a whooping cough fit and nothing comes out of his mouth, but he gives them the sentence he asks for.  Okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  What about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  The... he knew nothing.  The defendant new nothing.  It was a major error.  He just got what he asked for.   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Of course.  That's what's bothering me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If in fact the major error... and he did not understand it... made no difference to the outcome, then, says the Government, he shouldn't be able to appeal it.  And that's the problem.  As I read the Ninth Circuit, they didn't make that last statement.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And they want an... do you agree with them that they should have an opportunity to go back and to say, judge, we want this client also to be able to show it made no difference to the outcome?  If you agree with that, that's the end of the case I think.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  But you're saying that you want to subjective test.  You want... you want to defend the Ninth Circuit which said the question is whether or not he knew that he had this specific burden, that he was waiving the specific right the minute he entered the plea.  And you want a... a test to say that he didn't, in fact, know that.  And yet, we can't put him on the stand.  That... that seems to me an odd test.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  An odd... an odd way to run the system.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All that... all that the person has to show is that he didn't understand his rights.  Now, what do you think about that question?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So let's assume... it's absolutely clear.  They can come in with 52 bishops who are prepared to swear that if he had understood everything perfectly, he nonetheless would have gone ahead and pled guilty.  But it's also clear he did not understand his rights.  Okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  What's supposed to happen?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, there... look, what happened was the judge never told him that you're stuck with your plea if I don't give you what you think you're going to get.  He never told him that.  It's clear in rule 11 he was supposed to.  And now, in addition, we know for sure that this person didn't understand that.  But we also know for sure it made not one whit of difference to his plea.  What's supposed to happen?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm talking what I think is about this case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  I think as it's presented in the questions presented and in the opinion that was written by the Ninth Circuit.  Now, I might be wrong and you could explain to me why I'm not.  But... but in any case, if you think that might be this case that's presented here, I... in the Ninth Circuit opinion, I'd... I'd like an answer or your best answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  But in fact, we know he never would have.  We know it for sure.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He's written secret letters to his relations--  [Laughter]  --and whatever.  Do it in any sort you want, but... but I mean, that's... that's a little bit of a technical matter here.  But I did think in reading the Ninth Circuit opinion and reading the Government's brief, that that's what they're worried about, that there could be cases where he does not understand the nature of that rule 11 right, but nonetheless it makes no difference to his decision to plead guilty.  So that... that's a bit of a technical point here, I agree.  But as I read the Ninth Circuit, I thought, well, that's what's going on in this case.  Now, you could explain to me, if you want, that I'm completely out to lunch, so to speak.   Stephen G. Breyer  And the trial judge told him, you know, if you don't qualify, I might give you 10 years.  Do you understand that?  And he says, yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  And he says, knowing you have a mandatory minimum, I have to give you 10 years.  Do you still want to go forward with your plea?  He says, yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So it's pretty hard to argue that... I mean... go ahead.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?  Because the plea agreement was read to him in Spanish.  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  That is right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  The plea... so he hears in Spanish someone read to him the words, you cannot withdraw your plea agreement... cannot withdraw if they don't accept it.  And that's conceded in this case.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Then afterwards the judge tells him, in addition, if... has anyone explained to you that... do you understand that if you... that if you don't qualify for the safety valve, you go for 10 years.  Yes.  Has anyone promised you you will qualify for the safety valve?  No.  So you realize you could get 10 years.  All right?  Knowing that, you still want to go ahead with your guilty plea?

Breyer  So just that first display, what was the purpose of that first one?   Stephen G. Breyer  The original one?   Stephen G. Breyer  Was there anything there that said we're interested in history and what we're not interested in is having this on the wall as... to encourage people to study the Bible and to encourage them to study religion and to understand that in their lives, religion should be important and this very solemn secular setting.  Nonetheless, religion is important.  Was there anything other than the document itself?   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know how much help I can get or not but I was thinking in terms of the involvement of the government, is the government involved in religion when it posts the Ten Commandments alone?  Yes, of course it is.  Now, there could be a purpose to it, that they want to just show the history of law but it's all by itself and there is a lot more history than that and context may matter a lot.  Not everybody will go with the Ten Commandments just by itself there and say, well, gee, this seems to go too far.  This is going too far.  Why?  Because it isn't really related to history, it's the only thing up there, it's involvement in religion, so forth.  Now, suppose I go down that track because what I'm really looking for is a key as to what's too far and what's not.  But for present purposes, let's assume it's too far.  Now, once they've gone too far there, the next thing that happens is they keep changing it but they change it pursuant to the resolution and it seems as if in context, all they've tried to do is to surround what went too far with a number of other things that would somehow make it legal.

The key words in Stone would be that this was posted, the Ten Commandments, because it would lead to, in the circumstances, the students remeditate, venerate, perhaps, and obey.  In other words, their reaction to it would likely be a religious reaction.  Now, here if you saw it just by itself, perhaps one would be concerned with the intent or the effect of calling to the viewer's mind the sacred character of the law, which is fine for religious people to do but not necessarily fine for the State to do; and that leads them to venerate, perhaps to meditate, perhaps to consider the relationship in a religious way.  If that's the problem, that would exist here only because of the history or most likely because of the history.  And if that is the problem, that would dissipate over time because it is the smallness of the audience and their familiarity with the history that would likely produce the similar religious reaction to the display.  Now, what's your reaction?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why is it?  It may be true.  These pilgrims came for religious reasons.  If all this was... so you have a display of the history of the origin of the law in the United States, what would be wrong with saying, this is a historical account?  It's like teaching religion in the schools.  Of course it stemmed from the religious beliefs of those who came to the United States.  You don't mean it religiously.  You mean it historically.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's not printed?   Stephen G. Breyer  Since you have a minute, give me your opinion to the right standard if hypothetically you start with the Goldberg-Schempp idea, that the government is not absolutely forbidden by the establishment clause to recognize the religious nature of the people nor the religious origins of much of our law and so forth but it's easy to go too far and it's easy in this area you are trading on eggs to become far more divisive than you hoped and really end up with something worse than if you stayed out in the first place.  In other words, it's a very delicate matter and it's very easy to offend people.  Now, suppose you start with that.  You're trying to define what is too far constitutionally speaking.  What's your test?  Of the many that have been in our opinions, which do you think works the best for that purpose or some other?   INTERRUPTING ",03-1693
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So what--   Stephen G. Breyer  --So if they do, it's not finished.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, all right.  I'll ask them that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the problem that bothers me... and I don't know that there's an answer to it... is you have plaintiff.  Plaintiff goes into State court.  He brings a lawsuit, a tort suit, a contract suit.  And then he decides he'd also like to go to Federal court.  He brings exactly the same suit.  And here we have two suits and exactly the same thing running along at the same time.  Now, I know there are principles from this Court's case law that says, well, that's what's supposed to happen.  They've always bothered me.  But now let's take a special instance.  The special instance is that in court one in the State, the plaintiff loses.  Now, what he decides to do is to say to the Federal court, we want you to review what they did in the State court.  Can't do that.  Right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So he brilliantly figures out I will omit the word review from my... from my motion.  I will ask for precisely the same thing just not use that word review.  I will ask them to go and make their decision which happens to be... in my opinion should be... 100 percent the opposite of what the State court did showing they're wrong.  But I won't use the word review.  Now, you say because he cut the word review out, he can do it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but can you... can you expand on this a little?  I'm not taking a view on it.  I'm trying to clear up what's a confusion in my mind.  I see how you could do this on the parallel business with... with delaying it on the docket and using the doctrine of preclusion.  I understand that.  But we've still got this doctrine called Rooker-Feldman out there, and as long as you have that doctrine, it strikes me as odd if... say, it weren't a plaintiff.  Say it was the losing party, you know, that was asking the Federal judge, Judge, you have this case on your docket.  Let's move it up.  Let's decide it now.  He doesn't use the word review, but everything else is the same.  He wants a decision out of that court that is going to be the opposite of what the State court did.  And what's concerning me... maybe I shouldn't be concerned, but what's concerning me is whether he can get it or not seems to turn completely on whether he uses the word review in the petition.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, suppose you don't have the check.  What's left?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You have a judgment.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I never heard of a case that isn't over until you get the check.  I thought the case is over when you have the judgment.  [Laughter]  And then if they don't give you the check, you have a different matter.  We have to get it enforced.   ",03-1696
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you're still asking for cert..   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then why is it moot?  Because something could happen.  We might get this case in theory, take it on cert, and discover a jurisdictional problem that somehow destroys the case without a decision, and should that happen, there luckily for them they have this other case going.  So as long as... you're prepared, I take it, to say you're going to ask for cert If that's what you're going to say, I don't see how the case is over.  It's up to you.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If for... somehow you won on that, even though it sounds a little like a State law issue, but nonetheless, if you won on that and they reversed it as a statute of limitations, then what they're saying is, well, that's just why we filed in Federal court.  We didn't want the Federal court to review the State court.  We wanted our Federal court suit as an insurance policy in case something goes wrong with the State court suit.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with Rooker-Feldman.  It is parallel adjudication, just what he said.  Now, what's your response?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's... you see, Justice Ginsburg answered that.  I... I mean, she wasn't answering my question, but she did say what was a perfectly satisfactory approach, that... that the second person says, you know, Judge, there's another one pending and the judge says, okay, we'll let that go first except in some unusual instance.   Stephen G. Breyer  So why isn't it that the end?  I mean, here it's not moot.  They filed the other action.  You point out that you not only think something could wreck the State claim, you would love it to wreck the State claim.  And... and therefore, they have this insurance policy in Federal court which they'll gear up if and when the State claim does get wrecked as you hope.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why is it moot?  Or even on... why does claim preclusion apply?  I mean, if you win, from what you've said... somehow convince us that this refusal to apply the State statute of limitations properly violated some Federal law, let's say... then that would show that the State statute of limitations applied and barred their claim.  Would that be sufficient to knock out the Federal suit too?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, is... does the State statute of limitations, if... if it applied to the State's case, does it also apply in the Federal cases, the identical ground that everybody agrees that the State statute governs?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, if you... if you win, then... then... if you win your State case, because of the argument you made, do you also automatically win the Federal case?  Is it the same issue?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So it may not be the same issue.  Then... then they say, okay, it's not going to be claim preclusion, and you'd have to say insofar as it's not the same issue, it's not claim preclusion.  And therefore, they could proceed with their Federal case, which is what they want to do I guess.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  So we can't say it's moot in any... and we can't say there's an alternative basis where they'd win, can we?  I mean, I'm saying... I'm thinking if we get into conference, we're discussing this case, and I say, well, I have to think this through, is it the case that if you're right and you end up winning in this Court, that their case in Federal court is over?  I think no, it may not be.  The answer is it may not be.  Then this is not moot at all.  This is not claim precluded at all.  They then might proceed with their Federal claim.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that right or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, well, but that... that isn't fair to them because, for all I know, they filed the Federal case because there's a different statute of limitations, say, that governs it that will have expired if you don't let them file it by the time... until this whole thing is over.  They just wanted it as protection.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's explaining the unclear by the incredibly hard to understand.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's explaining the unclear by reference to the incomprehensible.  But go ahead.  [Laughter]   ",03-1696
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Now, why... why do you say that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Would you elaborate for this reason?  Because the briefs and you again today keep talking about that first document.  You use the word report.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, to me that's the whole conclusion of the case.  I'm prepared to assume, at least for the moment, if you can convince me that that's the report they're talking about, you'd win.  But that isn't what the Government says.  The Government says that's a piece of paper, preliminary.  We... like my draft.  I write drafts all the time.  So... so do trial judges.  And he goes and brings the draft to the other two judges and says, let's sit down and talk about it.  And they sit down and talk about it, and he changes his mind and writes a different document.  And that different document, of course, is totally public.  The whole opinion of the Tax Court.  There is that document.   Stephen G. Breyer  How do we know that?  Now... now, what is the answer specifically in the statute?  Let's call it document 1 and document 2.  And it really didn't help me that much in the briefs to see document 1 continuously labeled with the word report when I thought that's the key question.  Is it?  Is it that report they're referring to?  So now, go ahead.   Stephen G. Breyer  Which--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Which... which brief--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What... what page?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, what... what was the page?  Please.  You're going quite... and I want to... because Justice Ginsburg referred to a statement in the Government's brief that you said yes--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What happens in cases in agencies, you know, where... where... suppose the agency itself or a member thereof is going to make a decision, and there might be other members who would hear the witnesses.  And I was thinking of that analogy.  It's possible.  It happens in the Federal Communications Commission where the staff, you know, consults back and forth in ratemaking cases.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's hard to find precisely the analogy, but it seems likely.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, which gives and takes away.   Stephen G. Breyer  You have to have an opportunity to refute the information that's going to--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  If you analogize the STJ to the administrative ALJ.  But you might also analogize him to a member of the agency itself, and if you make that analogy, it doesn't become so far-fetched, particularly when you look at Morgan as also not allowing you to probe at what's going on.   Stephen G. Breyer  What... what is... can I ask you a really esoteric administrative law question, which I have never been able to figure out?  It's probably relevant, but I... this is an agency.  That's what... my great tax professor, Ernie Brown, used to say there is no Tax Court.  He says, the Board of Tax Appeals shall be known as the Tax Court.  What he meant by that is it's not... it isn't the Tax Court, just known as.  So... so this is an agency, an administrative agency.  So I look to the APA for guidance, and the APA, when you look at the section, says this initial decision can be made by a 556-qualified person.  Now, a 556-qualified person can include the agency itself or a member of the agency or an ALJ.  Then when you to look at what happens in 557, after that presiding employee makes an initial decision, it says you have to give a chance to the party to respond to the initial decision, which you like, in the case where the presiding employee... presiding person is a subordinate employee.  And so, that's what I was just checking here.  And so... so what's supposed to happen where the presiding person under 556 for that initial or tentative decision is not a subordinate employee, but rather, quote, one or more members of the body which comprise the agency?  I've never run into that before.  Maybe you haven't.  Maybe they didn't mean anything by it, but maybe they did.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He was a subordinate employee?   Stephen G. Breyer  Rather than a member... is... is... if he's a subordinate employee, that's easy.  Then the case is easy I think.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I'm just looking--   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know if I'm getting... so that's his basic point.  The rule doesn't require the disclosure because they've interpreted it differently within their... within their discretion.  The statute doesn't require it and the Constitution doesn't require it.  If we have to go to the Constitution, I don't see exactly the implications.  So I'm nervous.  And now, the reports... he says, go read 7460(b).  That's what they're talking about.  And then... and again, I don't know what I'm getting into once I read it more broadly than that.  And what about all evidence received by the Tax Court, including a transcript.  Of course, this isn't evidence but neither is a transcript.  And... and so maybe that word evidence can be read more broadly, given the fact that it's to include a transcript of the stenographic report.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You think I'm right just suddenly for the for the first time?  You have thought of this?   ",03-184X
0,Stephen G. Breyer  So where does it say that?  Where does it say that?   ,03-184X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Here's... here's the difficulty that I... that I have.  When I read your brief, I thought, well, he must be right because this is really about custody.  It's really about custody.  They want to get out eventually.  But then when I... I... when I went back to Balisok, I thought, oh, here's the problem.  The problem is that it's a damage remedy in Balisok.  And normally you want the person to go into 1983 to get damages.  But he's going to get mixed up.  When do you send him to habeas?  Well, we don't want to send him to habeas unless it's clear that habeas should have been brought.  And so if he's just challenging, for example, introduction of Fourth Amendment violation evidence or something like that, don't go to habeas.  Don't go to habeas.  You didn't have to go to habeas unless you had to, unless you had... unless it was necessary to upset the conviction.  You see?  That's why that language is there.  Now, I got that far.  Then I said, oh, I see what you do.  We should have one rule for damages.  Well, that makes sense.  But there's no reason not to have a different rule when you have the injunctive action, and there maybe we could follow your rule.  But the next thing I come across is a statement that says, no, no, the rule is the same whether you bring a damage action or whether you bring an injunctive or declaratory relief action.  And I said, well, why did we write that?  You know, we're the ones who caused all this trouble.  But the... the... well, because we didn't want to make it too complicated and... and not have all the questions coming, well, what kind of an action is it really, et cetera.  Okay.  So once I got that far, I said, oh, well, I'm going to have to change something for you to win.  Either I have to change the thing that says the damages should be the same as the injunctive, or I have to change something else somewhere along the line, the word necessary.  I don't want to change the word necessary.  Maybe I could change the other, but why bother really?  Because all that's important here is people know which way they should go.  Now, that's where I am at the moment, thinking give him his 1983 action.  It's simpler.  It follows from Balisok.  Why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I thought.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, no, I've got that part.  But the... and... and you're right about that part.  But that... you know, that doesn't get over the... the hump here I think because of the... what we've written.  The... I mean, where I'm coming out now, what you've just said, is well, you know, there's going to be exhaustion in both cases.  And prison conditions, if we say that habeas doesn't... that 1983 applies here I think probably... I can't guarantee it... but those where prison conditions would then cover it, and then there would be exhaustion, and there... where it doesn't seem to make difference there.  And now I'm back to asking the other half of this, which is, well, all right, suppose I say I see your point, I think you're right.  Now, what... what is your recommendation?  What do we change?  Do we change the word necessary in Balisok, which I'd be pretty reluctant to do?  Or do we drive a wedge between the damage cases and the injunctive/declaratory relief cases?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, well.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  No, but then what you're doing is taking the first half because what you're reading is you're reading that word necessary, whatever those words were in Balisok that we were just talking about, as your case satisfying that condition.  And if your case satisfies that condition, then so does the case where a person wants to bring a damage action because of illegally seized evidence at his trial.  Doesn't it?  I mean, because all... I mean... and then we've swept... then we've done... we've really moved Balisok from what it was trying to do.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why is he bringing his damage action?  He thinks he's bringing it because what they did at that trial hurt me.  Now, how did it hurt me?  It hurt me because I went right to prison.   INTERRUPTING ",03-287X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But you're not challenging it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, fine.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then we take it as valid.  That's not a claim you're challenging.  But I take it your claim is in the year 2009 he will have another hearing.   Stephen G. Breyer  2005?  Okay, 2005 he'll have another hearing.   Stephen G. Breyer  And in the year 2005, I want not to have the... what are they called?  The 1998 guidelines.  I don't want my 1998 guidelines applied in the 2005 hearing because you have some theory, maybe good, maybe bad, but it's a theory that that would violate the Constitution of the United States.   Stephen G. Breyer  So you're saying he's going to have this.  I want an injunction or declaratory relief they can't do it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And he's saying it violates the Constitution in two respects: one, they won't listen to me; and two, they apply the 1998 guidelines.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's it.  Okay.  We're talking now about this 2005 hearing and he wants new procedures, and the question is, is this 1983 or is it habeas?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  My law clerk found two cases which we've just looked at briefly.  One is called Wilwerding v. Swenson and the other Johnson v. Avery where she says that in those two cases people were using habeas to challenge prison conditions even.  Now, so there are... there are two cases that, if she's... and she's usually right... that... that... where habeas was used to challenge prison conditions.  So I've thought, well, if they can use it, they certainly could use it here.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  It was a different issue, but it said habeas could be brought.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So habeas could be brought here?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, and they say sure... sure I am.  I'm saying I had terms.  You know, I was going to be here under conditions A, B, C, and A, B, C in my opinion mean I will be released sooner, and instead, they gave me D, E, F, and D, E, F means I'm likely to be released later.  I can't guarantee it.  That's what he'll say.  He says I can't guarantee it, but I wouldn't be bringing this case if I didn't think at least it was a shot.   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose we wrote an opinion that said, whatever the reasoning... I don't know what it would be right now... that said in the future your client should go ahead in 1983.  I'm putting you in a slightly awkward position, so don't answer if you don't want to.  But I mean, for the future all these cases will be brought in habeas.  Now, suppose that's what the opinion said.  We're absolutely making it clear just what the... would there be any harm done?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what would that harm be?   Stephen G. Breyer  And why would that be bad?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why would that be bad?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  But I mean, is... I'm asking you a practical question as a practicing lawyer.  Would it be bad?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean, leaving aside... Congress changed the statute.  It says absolutely it's going to be habeas.  Is there any bad consequence in the law?   Stephen G. Breyer  We'll catch them in habeas.   Stephen G. Breyer  Ah, so it comes down to that.   INTERRUPTING ",03-287X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, you have to think down the road, is there an alternative to the Geneva Convention that is on the substantive claim.  I was also thinking, and here I want your view on it, that if you have, if they get in the door, and now they have a claim that they are being held without a competent tribunal assessing it, you get to your route as well by saying that the part about the Fifth Amendment in Eisentrager is, in effect, overruled by Reid v. Covert.  And in fact, if you follow Harlan and by following Harlan, you apply some kind of due process, and the Geneva Convention comes in to inform the content of that due process.  Now, is there an argument there or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're not simply being polite?  I want to--  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  I can explore it with the Solicitor General possibly.   INTERRUPTING ",03-334X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it's obvious that there is language in Eisentrager that supports you, obvious to me, but you have just heard that judges don't always distinguish between 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), not even in this Court, at least we don't always get it right.  And there is also language, as you have heard, that's against you.  I think there is some in there.  So what I'm thinking now, assuming that it's very hard to interpret Eisentrager, is that if we go with you, it has a virtue of clarity.  There is a clear rule.  Not a citizen, outside the United States, you don't get your foot in the door.  But against you is that same fact.  It seems rather contrary to an idea of a Constitution with three branches that the executive would be free to do whatever they want, whatever they want without a check.  That's problem one.  Problem two is that we have several hundred years of British history where the cases interpreting habeas corpus said to the contrary anyway.  And then we have the possibility of really helping you with what you're really worried about, which is undue court interference by shaping the substantive right to deal with all those problems of the military that led you to begin your talk by reminding us of those problems.  So if it's that choice, why not say, sure, you get your foot in the door, prisoners in Guantanamo, and we'll use the substantive rights to work out something that's protective but practical.   Stephen G. Breyer  I grant you this.  My question has to assume that Eisentrager is ambiguous and not clearly determinative.  But then on that assumption, I'm still honestly most worried about the fact that there would be a large category of unchecked and uncheckable actions dealing with the detention of individuals that are being held in a place where America has power to do everything.  Now, that's what's worrying me because of Article III, and the other thing on the opposite side, as I said, is it's possible to tailor the substance to take care of the problems that are worrying you.  Those are my two basic points.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The battlefield, I might, since... all I mean by working out the substantive rights is what Justice Harlan meant and what Justice Kennedy meant in adopting Justice Harlan's view in Verdugo.  And that really derives from the insular cases, and I don't think it's something that requires witnesses and reticulated whatever they are, tax cuts.  [Laughter]   ",03-334X
1,NO QUESTIONS,03-407X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  And while this suit is being brought, we can't do the simple thing, which is to take a case from an indigent who's raising it that we happen to have on our docket and face it directly because everybody is tied up in these knots on standing.  I mean, what... what is it that... that you... led you to bring this case rather than just filing an amicus brief in a case brought by a real indigent who wants a lawyer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I see... I see that.  That's a good answer.  And the... the question I have is if I now, since we have real indigents, believe that there absolutely is a way for a real indigent to raise this claim that isn't even hard, you could file an amicus brief.  Suppose I believed that, and I do believe it actually.  If I believe it, then does your third party standing claim disappear?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, if it doesn't disappear and I hold in your favor, would I then be opening the door to any lawyer whose pocketbook is hurt by tort reform, by any change at all, you know, that means less money for him, and we'd be besieged with people?  Instead of the clients, we'd have all the lawyers in complaining that they want to be richer.  Now, that's what's worrying me.  So on my assumption, how could I possibly decide in your favor without opening that door?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's the question I'd like answered.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I assumed there's--   Stephen G. Breyer  --No.  I'm sorry.  I... I... Justice Scalia and I were assuming the same thing.  If I assume that there's no problem with the real person, the indigent, raising the claim himself... and I'm saying on that assumption, which I believe, then if I were to decide in your favor, how would I not be opening the door that I wanted to keep firmly closed?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, okay.  No.  I agree with you.  If in fact you think that there's a problem about a real indigent bringing a claim in Michigan, although we have two on the docket, if I accepted that premise, I would begin to think you were right.  So then what I was trying to explore is whether the whole thing comes down to whether I accept that premise.  And of course, that's what's everybody has been talking about, and I do see at the moment a couple of very good ways that indigents can bring it themselves, and indeed they have.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But everything comes down to that.  Right?   Stephen G. Breyer  I think I agree with you on that.  I'm just... the reason I think it's so easy is because we get indigents.  We get thousands of them.  And all you have to have is some indigent saying, hey, I want a lawyer.  Okay?  That's all.  He has to be able to write those words.  And at that point, you and the others come in with amicus briefs, if necessary, and support him.   ",03-407X

I mean, do you object to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  So your answer to her question is, of course it could be relevant.  Let the other side come in and show that it's relevant.

That's what we took it to decide, and that's... you agree with it and they agree with it, so everybody's happy.  We don't even have to write an opinion, we can just--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Now, suppose you establish it, maybe we can find some differences here, would you also agree that simply establishing confusion is not enough to overcome the fair-use defense, you'd have to also show that the confusion, along with possibly other things are such that it shows unfairness, or what's the other word, unfairness, or lack of good faith?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You agree with that, or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  Good, so now we have something I can disagree with you about.  Now, the question would be, why, it's the words are unfair, why, if you just show there's some confusion, which normally there would be, or quite often there would be, why is that enough to overcome their defense that they put here?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, so now, if we're going to go back into what the Court did, I would say that I was a little disturbed reading this as to why you get protection at all, because I was thinking ""micro color"", well, that describes very well what it is, it's a tiny, teeny, weenie, weenie bit of color.  And when I think of ""micro pigment"", I think of a farm animal, I think... I don't know what I think, it's confusing me.  So, for an average person, the word ""micro color"", I thought,  ""Gee, that's very descriptive of just what it is, a teeny weenie bit of color. ""   Stephen G. Breyer  But suppose IBM had used the word ""computers"" when they were the only company for ten or fifteen years to mark their product.  Now, another company comes along and they produce the same thing, they want to use the word ""computer"".  You're saying that that would be the end of it, they couldn't do it?   Stephen G. Breyer  People would be confused.  For a while they'll think that IBM, there would be confusion, but it's the best word to describe the product, in fact, at least a very good one.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, at the very beginning, IBM was the only one to do it, they didn't have to call it computer, they could have called it a word processor, they could have called it a ""think faster"".  I don't know what they could have called it, but I mean, you know, they chose the word computer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what is this fair-use defense for, since you're normally going to show confusion to show the infringement, what's it for, in your opinion?   Stephen G. Breyer  I also... it's very efficient to allow people to communicate, in English.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I guess that's the question, because sometimes people... I have no doubt--   INTERRUPTING ",03-409X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is that true of the drug statutes too?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, is it true whenever the Feds prosecute a person for a drug transaction, a jury has to determine there was a connection between these drugs and interstate commerce?  I've never heard of that requirement that... that the... that the jury would have to determine whatever facts are necessary for the statute to be constitutional even... even though that's not an element of the offense.  Does that come out of a case or someplace?  Where does it come from?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, there might be instances where there's no effect on interstate commerce, a home... you know, that... that will be an issue, homegrown marijuana.  So suppose there is some drug somewhere that has no effect.  It just didn't.  There could be such a thing.  We can imagine it.  But does that mean in all these other cases that Congress... that the statute is void because the jury hasn't found... I'd be repeating myself.  You answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They really say if we find a city council that takes money and... from us, the city council takes the money for us for some of its programs here.  There's a corrupt city councilman.  We want to prosecute that person.  Why?  Because we want council... members of councils to know that we're not going to tolerate corruption on behalf of the agency that's giving out our money, whether in the particular instance it involved our money or not.  Now... now, why isn't that sufficient connection?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true, but why doesn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Where... where does this... I mean, I've asked you this before, but I'm not sure.  Where does this jury finding thing come from?  It's quite interesting.  But... but where... I mean, suppose that Congress passed a statute under the Patent Clause criminalizing certain conduct in respect to patent, and at the border there might be an... a question of whether it does or does not fall within the Patent Clause, that particular criminal behavior.  But I wouldn't jump from that fact that you'd have a legal argument it's outside the Patent Clause to the conclusion that therefore a jury has to find in every patent crime... a jury has to find that it is within the clause.  I'd have thought that was a question for the judge, not the jury.  So you've been emphasizing the contrary idea, and where do you get it from?   INTERRUPTING ",03-44XX

The agencies are funnels funneling money to the... and say, look, we have a pretty strong rationale here.  We want clean funnels because a little bit of the money going through is Federal.  Take that as given.  If I were to say you're right, what's the standard where the Spending Clause is at issue?  What words would be used there?  And the reason that this is difficult at the moment for me is because this is not a condition imposed upon spending.  You're not saying to the State, we'll give you the transport money if you... this is really a Federal law protecting the... the spending.  You may be right in this case, but we're going to have to say some kind of standard.  Should we say it's just whatever would be necessary and proper to protect the object of the spending, which is quite far out because you can spend for things you don't have otherwise have the power to do?  Or should we say something else, or should we say we don't have to reach that here because if in fact the power would be there under the Commerce Clause anyway, that at least is good enough and isn't a stretch of the Spending Clause where there's a necessary and proper rationale?  What in your view is the proper way to write those words?   ",03-44XX
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  You wouldn't have to do that if you just asserted executive privilege as to each discovery request that you thought would be burdensome.  And then if that's granted, you have no problem.  And if it's denied, you immediately come up on that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why not do that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know that's your legal argument, and you may be right about that.  But assuming you are right about that, you bring up the broader issue on an appeal from the case.  See if you lose it.  And as to your being right, being right I guess isn't enough to get you to appeal a discovery order if... but maybe you can if you really need to.  So my question is, why did you really need to since you could have asserted executive privilege as to each individual.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I see that.  But that's an argument which you made in response to my question which is an argument on the merits.  And I want you to focus on the fact that... assume I agree with you on the merits.  You will have a chance to make that argument on the merits, even if you lose here and if you lose the case.  Now, my question is addressed to the need for an interim appeal from the discovery.  And as to that, what is your response to the fact that you could get your interim appeal or at least preserve yourself from harm if you had asserted executive privilege to the individual bits of the discovery order with which you disagreed.   ",03-475X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't want to delay this.  But to me this is important.  Assume that their interpretation of the statute is completely right.  Assume that.   Stephen G. Breyer  I know you don't want to, but for argument's sake, then what they are really asking for is a separate exception from the collateral order.  I mean, and a separate exception that allows them, the Vice President and the President, and nobody else, to take an appeal from discovery.  Now, executive privilege in my mind came in by asking, well, shouldn't they at least have to assert that it's that kind of imposition upon the President's office prior to being able to carve out, under whatever name, a separate exception that would permit an appeal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why isn't it wrong?  Why isn't, why isn't the Court of Appeals wrong on that, the argument being that this is not a discovery statute.  This is not an ex parte communications statute.  This is not a Freedom of Information Act statute.  This is a blue ribbon committee statute.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if you turn it into the latter, you will stop--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --you will stop every... you'll stop every lower level official in government when he is creating legislative policy from getting on the phone and calling up whoever he pleases.  You understand that argument.  I want your response.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They are arguing that it's not before us... what they are arguing is that this statute doesn't apply, so therefore there was no discovery.  The statute isn't one under which you can go behind the certification of the President, the Vice President, et cetera.  We both read their briefs.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Well then go ahead and make the argument.   Stephen G. Breyer  --Exactly.  Now, their problem with your interpretation of the statute, I take it, is the following.  Forget the Vice President.  You are Assistant Secretary of Antitrust.   Stephen G. Breyer  You are Assistant Secretary of HHS in charge of drug policy.  You are trying to develop a legislative proposal.  Every staff person in the Congress, given such a task, would phone everyone in sight who knows about it outside the Congress to try to develop sound proposals.  And if it's a serious matter, they'd have 50 meetings with everybody under the sun.  And if you assigned the same thing, try to do the same thing under your interpretation of the Act, every one of those outside people could be hit with a discovery order, what meetings did you go to, what did you say, what did you do.  And their final point is that Congress could not possibly have intended in this statute to have created that circumstance, putting government in a cocoon when it develops legislative policy.  Now, I have overstated what they said, but I'm trying to get a response from you as to what I take is their basic point.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you don't think it's correct.   Stephen G. Breyer  Cause.   Stephen G. Breyer  Explain the degree of formality that you think triggers the statute.   Stephen G. Breyer  The Attorney General of the United States turns to the head of the Antitrust Division and says I want a legislative proposal about Webb-Pomerene acts.  You get together with your counterpart at State, create an interagency task force and give me a document, and he announces the whole thing in a public speech.  Now, do we have the application, in your opinion, of FACA that would trigger the questions I mentioned?   Stephen G. Breyer  If the interagency task force creates the FACA situation in your view, imagine that I have repeated my first question, but simply applied it to interagency task forces.  If you remember my first question, it had to do with the cocoon.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, what is your response?   ",03-475X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, suppose they have a subpart (b) which said if the gun is in the attic, you get more, but the gun in the attic will be found by the judge.  That's just as if those words, gun in the attic, weren't there.  So it's just like the first statute, and that's Apprendi, you see.  That's Apprendi.  And you say, well, if you got that second statute that looked just like the first, this one does too.  I mean, that's the argument.  And you say, well, which way should we look at it.  I'm not sure.   Stephen G. Breyer  What will you do if... I mean, I absolutely accept your point, at least for argument, that... that if you go through the factors that favor calling it a watershed rule, you've listed several that argue strongly against calling it a watershed rule.  And I want your reaction to something on the other side.  And I have to say, though, I'm sure he... he will agree with these words.  Justice Scalia will not agree with the sentiment I'm quoting him for.  But in Ring he said... he spoke about the repeated spectacle of a man's going to his death because a judge found an aggravating factor existed and added that we cannot preserve our veneration for the protection of the jury in criminal cases if we render ourselves callous to the need for that protection by regularly imposing the death penalty without it.  Now, what I'm using those words to call to mind is that here we will have the spectacle of a person going to his death when he was tried in violation of a rule that the majority of the Court found to be a serious procedural flaw.  See, I'm not calling it absolutely overwhelming.  So I'm giving you that, but on the other side, I'm trying to focus your attention on the spectacle of the man going to his death, having been sentenced in violation of that principle.  What do you want to say about that?   ",03-526X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I agree.  I think you can see it as substantive or you can see it as procedural.  But I wonder, because you've read all these cases now, is that... is... do you... do you think that the Teague categories... how fixed are they meant to be?  What I'm thinking of in particular is the remark that actually the Chief Justice made about it did reflect something to do with administration of justice.  So suppose that you had a case in which it looks as if it falls on the substantive side of the line, but really to let everyone out of prison is going to... is going to just devastate the justice system.  Is there room, given Teague, for some flexibility there?  In other words, are the factors absolutely written in stone?  Is there any indication they're flexible to read in the light of Teague's purposes?  What's your reaction to that?   ",03-526X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I thought that what you were saying, which I understood, is that if somebody intentionally uses force and hurts somebody... might hurt somebody, that falls within the statute.  If they do it negligently, they don't.  If they do it recklessly, recklessly and often assimilated to intention in the law, gross... you know, recklessness and sometimes it isn't.  So I thought you were going to say we didn't have to decide that one.  Many States require negligence only for drunk driving hurting somebody.  Some may require recklessness.  So we may have to decide it some day.  Now, that... that's where... that's where I came into this argument.  Now, if you're disowning that, I want to know.  If you're accepting it, I want to know.   Stephen G. Breyer  Your answer might be recklessness.  I mean, I think that's a hard question, but... but I guess you could say recklessness in respect to shooting?  Of course, it's covered.  Recklessness in respect to drunk driving?  I'm not so sure.  It may depend on the nature of the crime, the nature of the underlying conduct.  But you may not accept that.  You may want an all or nothing answer, in which case you can answer.  I'd have to say I don't know.   ",03-583X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's why, I guess, reckless is a harder matter.  But you started with context, and when I looked at the context of this statute, the context to me seemed to be that this is not... this is a statute that has nothing to do with immigration.  16 is a definition that's a kind of receptacle that other statutes refer to.  And it was part of the original criminal code reform in the '80's.  And the purpose of that was to pull together words that are similar throughout the U.S. Code and give them a common definition.  And the history of this refers back to the D.C. Code.  The history of this and other similar language in the code makes clear that what they're talking about are things like murder, manslaughter, burglary, robbery, extortion, blackmail.  They give examples for all these things elsewhere in the code with similar language.  So if I look at the context, the context to me says, though the language can be read to cover it, this has nothing to do with drunk driving.  Now, that's when you talk about context.  I have that in my mind as context.  Now, you tell me why I'm wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I... I put aside the reckless argument, and I'm not relying on the D.C. Code.  That was but one example.  I'm saying this same language appears elsewhere in the U.S. Code, 924(e).  Wherever it does appear, they list things like burglary, arson, extortion, explosives, and otherwise.  And there's no indication that this is meant to be something different and there's every indication from the purpose of it being written in the criminal code reform that Congress is seeking a common definition.  That's what's moving me.  So your response to that is what?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, it could have.  I'm saying it didn't have.   Stephen G. Breyer  I want your evidence that it did have.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why in the... in the House... in the Senate report on this bill, the example that they use for the first is an assault or a battery.  Nobody has used, you know, blindly in your sleep knocking over a table and--   Stephen G. Breyer  --No.  Right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, it's pretty hard to assimilate your model to like an assault.   Stephen G. Breyer  So every driving accident is a crime of violence--   Stephen G. Breyer  --if there's negligence involved.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But any... any one that is criminal... let's see.  Criminal negligence in respect to driving becomes a crime of violence under your definition.   Stephen G. Breyer  And why isn't it if there's a traffic infraction involved?  A traffic infraction... you went through a stop sign.  In Justice Scalia's example, he went through a stop sign.   ",03-583X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is there... is there any on... on that?  Is there any indication?  I mean, I've never seen any either way, to tell you the truth, but... that Madison or Jefferson or whoever, when they were writing the Constitution, would have thought what happened elsewhere, let's say, in Britain or in the British... they were a British colony.  They did think Blackstone was relevant.  Did any... that they would have thought it was totally irrelevant what happened elsewhere in the world to the word unusual.  Is there any indication in any debate or any of the ratification conventions?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So if Lincoln--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Abraham Lincoln used to study Blackstone and I think he thought that the Founding Fathers studied Blackstone, and all that happened in England was relevant, is there some special reason why what happens abroad would not be relevant here?  Relevant.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not saying controlling.   Stephen G. Breyer  Absolutely, and they, I guess, were looking at English practices, and would they have thought it was wrong to look abroad as a relevant feature?   Stephen G. Breyer  Before you go off on this, the one statistic that interested me... and I'd like you to discuss its relevance really... is if we look back 10 years, I have only three States executing a juvenile: Texas, 11; Virginia, 3; and Oklahoma, 2.   Stephen G. Breyer  And those three States account for about 11 percent of the population of the country, 11.3 percent.  Now, if we go back a few more years to Stanford, we get three others in there: Louisiana, 1; Georgia, 1; and Missouri, 1.   Stephen G. Breyer  We have a very different number.   Stephen G. Breyer  So the reason that I thought arguably it's more relevant to look at the convictions is there are a lot of States.  Say, New Hampshire, I think, for example... when I was in the First Circuit, there were several States that on the books permitted the death penalty, but nobody ever had ever been executed.  And... and that's true across the country.  There are a number of States like that.  So if we look at the States that actually execute people, it's 10 years, say, 11 percent of the population are in such States.  You go back 15 years, and you get these three other States, which raises the percentage.  How... how should I understand that?  I'm interested in both sides--   ",03-633X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So that... that's... that last point was what I thought the scientific evidence was getting at, that it simply confirmed what common sense suggests, that when you execute a person 15 or sometimes 20 years later, a problem always is that that person isn't the same person who committed the trial in a meaningful sense.  And it's specially true of 16 and 17-year-olds who, observation would suggest, have a lot of changing to do because their personality is not fully formed.  Now, I thought that the... the scientific evidence simply corroborated something that every parent already knows, and if it's more than that, I would like to know what more.   INTERRUPTING ",03-633X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Do you know why?  Did you come across anything that explained why there was a change in language in that clause (vii) between the 1952 version and the present one?  The '52 one said, to any country which is willing to accept such alien into its territory, and then (vii) said, another country whose government will accept the alien.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do we know... is there anything?  Is that an accident, a drafting... just simply drafting style or something or--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, it does.  It helps you quite a lot that it says government, but it doesn't... at the same time it doesn't... it... it doesn't help you in respect to whether (vii) applies to the first six.  It does help you in respect to if you win that point, that's it because there's no government.   Stephen G. Breyer  Otherwise, you could argue--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What happened in China?  I mean, what... this all comes from the '52 act, and it was a big issue then that we didn't recognize communist China and they would take people to the border.  How... how did that work?  Were there... were there instances under the '52 act where they just would take somebody to Macau or something and push him across the border, or what... what happened?  How did it work?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, are there instances where we have deported people to places that they said, no, we won't take him, and we have anyway?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay. Then another--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But what's bothering me partly in this case is it's being argued on the ground that this is like a country that says we don't want him.  In fact, this is a country that hasn't said we don't want him.  It's a country that hasn't said anything.  It's not a country perhaps.  And... and that's what... really the issue is whether or not a place without a government is a place where you can send him at all.   Stephen G. Breyer  And... and maybe this is all evidentiary when they changed the word... add the word government, that the word country throughout is simply assuming a place that has an organized government.  Is there... is that so?  Is there anything you want to say about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, the word country probably appears in the immigration statute in the context of deportation since the first statute that provided it.  So have you done any work on that?  I... I hate to sort of have to look that up for the first time, but the... the... is there any work that you can report in respect to that word country?  There never under that... the easiest thing for you would be if... if this word country... there never has been under a statute that used the word country a deportation to a place that had no organized government.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you could affirm that that's so, then that would be very strong for you.  But maybe that isn't so.   ",03-674X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So it's much narrower.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  As I... as I understand it, following up a bit on Justice Scalia, the question presented is whether he can remove an alien to one of the countries designated without obtaining that country's acceptance.  Okay?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, one possible... prior... of the alien prior to removal.  That's... I'm just reading it--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --from their cert petition.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what the cert petition says, without obtaining that country's acceptance of the alien.  Now, I grant you it's sort of a hidden argument there, but it's mentioned or whatever.  Is... one reason the answer to that question is no is because where that country does not have a functioning government, it is not a country within the meaning of country as used in this statute.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, that's... that's an answer no to the question presented for a very narrow reason that does not get us involved in anything other than Somalia.  Is there... I mean, maybe we shouldn't reach it because it wasn't argued all that much, but it seemed to me just another argument being advanced in favor of their position.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you're not saying you can dump people in Antarctica or possibly send them to the moon.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Antarctica is a country?  So we could take all these people, send them to Antarctica.  They'll live with the penguins?  Is--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --But that... they can win on that one because it doesn't say anything about prior in (vii).   Stephen G. Breyer  Put the two questions--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But now, putting those three questions together, it seemed to me what you're saying it is possible to read the statute the way you're saying.  It is also possible to read the statute the opposite.  And the brief that I found very helpful on this was this Ali Ali brief where everything is set out really quite parallel.  You get every version of the statute right in front of you.  And as I read that, it... you look at the '52 version... and I think it's clearer on this point, and it's against you insofar as it's clearer.  But then, in addition, you have four circuit courts of appeals, including a decision by Learned Hand, all of whom say that Justice Souter's suggestion there is what the statute means, and there's nothing to the contrary.  And then after that, Congress reenacts those same statutes with all the little bits and I think some unclarifying changes in language, but they write in the report, we don't mean any substantive change by this.   Stephen G. Breyer  Some people actually read those reports and feel they are a clue to what Congress is trying to get at.  And here, if that is a clue, the clue says that there is to be no substantive change from a provision that was unanimously interpreted by four circuits, including Learned Hand, to be with the other side on this.

Now, the policeman might make a mistake about that.  He... he thought he threw a punch, but he made a mistake.  Now... now, why is a policeman less likely to make that kind of a mistake than make a mistake about what crime to label it?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  You said... you... you say everybody agrees in this case that if the policeman had reasonable cause objectively to arrest the person for A, but he arrested him for B instead, there are some circumstances in which that's okay.  And on their view, it's... as long as... it was always okay, really, as long as objectively there was reasonable cause.  On your view, you're going to add a little thing.  You're going to add, and by the way, it's not okay unless that conduct that he looked at was in fact illegal.  So you say... because policemen could make mistakes about labels, but they're not likely to make mistakes about throwing a punch.  So I just wondered why not.

But other countries have different laws, and as far as they're concerned, those laws... what they are doing in Holland is fine.  And so what business do we have telling Uruguay, which thinks depression cartels, or Japan, which thinks oppression cartels are the greatest thing, and they may be, and so does Holland think that.  And what business do we have saying that a citizen of Japan who's hurt by something that the Japanese think is just fine and the Dutch think is just fine come to our court and enforce our law against those other countries where it doesn't affect us?

Now, that, I take it, is the argument, not what the prosecution says.  So I'd be interested in your response.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It says it's illegal, period.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But I... if you're on a... it sounds to me like you're a verbal point, which I'm not against.  Of course we say it is illegal what they do in Holland.  It's illegal when they hurt us, it's illegal when we hurt them, we think it's illegal plain and simple.  I accept that.  But what I don't see follows from that is that we give a claim for damages by a... to person in Uruguay for activity that takes place in Holland, which we think is illegal, but the Dutch and the Uruguayans don't.  And so I can't get mileage for you unless I'm wrong in thinking that out of words in indictments that say American Tobacco, what they did was illegal everywhere.  I like... I think the antitrust laws are a marvelous policy, okay, so I'm tempted to say, yes, it's illegal everywhere.  But that isn't where I'm having the problem.  I'm having the problem about finding... I... I'd be repeating myself, so have you taken it in?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, what's the answer?   Stephen G. Breyer  Correct.  And if we had that alone, that would be strong support, and the problem is we have another sentence, which is the first sentence in the FTAIA, whatever it is, and then you get to the second.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But all of that is true and it does not necessarily follow that we do or should permit a cause of action.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I... I just want... don't want you to lose part 3, and let... let you focus on that, the comity.   Stephen G. Breyer  One possibility floating through my mind is that there are international quinine or maybe this, international vitamin cartels, where it's pure price-fixing, and in such instances, prices in one country may be interdependent on another, and in such instances if you lose this case here, now, you may still have a claim, because it flows in part, the injury, from effects in the United States.  But there are many other parts of the antitrust law which are highly controversial.  To name a few, information sharing, vertical restrictions of different kinds.  And if you win here, not only do you not have to show this interdependent thing, but anybody could come in under all those under provisions too, which many other countries don't like at all, and bring lawsuits and there's no way to prevent our law from becoming generally imperialistic in this sense that I've been talking about.  That's a way of focusing you back on the comity question, and you can answer mine, the comity, whatever you like.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't really see what it's doing on the table.  I mean, it didn't require a Nobel Prize winner to make me figure out that in fact the worse you treat the people who make the cartel, the less likely they are to do it.  But I mean, fine, you're right, if you hung and quartered them or whatever, they'd do it even less.  But what... what is that to do with the price of fish, so to speak?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you have flushed them all out that way.  Now, the ones you have left, which is yours which you like, why can't you bring... fit right within the language here that where this worldwide market is in fact such that its price in Bolivia is never going to hold up unless the price in the United States holds up if you've got the necessary causal relationship to effects in the United States.  That's the second half which you said we should remand.  I mean, maybe that's a good half.  What's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING ",03-724X

Breyer  See, he's saying it isn't, for the reason that, he says, that if England did it for independent reasons, it wasn't doing it because it wanted to help France get it's money, that then it wouldn't have been in derogation.  Of course, it would have been legal, either way, but he says it wouldn't have been in derogation, for that reason.   INTERRUPTING ",03-725X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, not just foreign policy.  The White Russians come here because they don't want to pay Lenin's taxes designed to equalize all individuals, in terms of property.  Country A has a tax law that makes everybody a criminal because nobody really ever pays all the taxes.  Country C has a set of laws that tax bibles.  Country D has a... I mean, you know, we can spin out the examples endlessly, and they're not farfetched.  So take all the arguments from last week, called ""any court arguments"", cross... or two days ago... just let's cross-reference them.  The problem is complexity of tax law.  The problem is many, many, many would be contrary to American policy.  And the problem is, nobody really knows what they are; indeed, they don't even know what American tax law is, no single individual, I suspect.  Let's put in Italy, France, Byelorussia, Belarus, Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, and 35,000 others.  Everybody becomes a criminal.  And then we say,  ""Don't worry, we'll only prosecute the real bad ones. ""  That's the argument, I think, on the other side, and I'd like to hear your perspective.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, only people who come over here because they don't want to pay taxes in those countries.  Sometimes we would agree with them--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, they don't tell Lenin that they're coming--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and they write to each other.  They have a cousin, in Brooklyn, who forwards them the money to get out.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So the question comes down to--   Stephen G. Breyer  --reason for it.  I just... you don't seem to know completely about Canadian law.  How much do you know about the tax law of Vietnam?  Because Los Angeles is filled with Vietnamese refugees, many of communities of such people in the United States.  Do we know how many of them perhaps might owe taxes under the law of Vietnam, and maybe are talking to each other about whether they really want to pay it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what about the wealth tax in France?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about the other reasons underlying it, which is what I was trying to get at before?  I see, literally, that the common law... you know, the enforcement... this is not literally enforcement.  So what I was driving at with my questions is, even though literally it's not, the problems of complexity, the problems of knowability, and the problems of there being so many, many foreign tax laws that we might think are basically unfair, that those considerations apply here, just as they do with the enforcement rule, and then add the fact that turning people into criminals under threat of prosecution by the Federal Government is really very much equivalent to enforcing the foreign rule in a court.  I mean, that's the whole thing spelled out.  And I meant it seriously, though I used foreign examples to, sort of, drive the point home.  What is your response to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about... what about a scheme--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Have countries also... just... here, I don't know, in respect to the principle... would it have been viewed as contrary to the principle if a country were to pass a law... say, England were to pass a law saying it is a crime in England not to pay French taxes?  I'm not saying they couldn't do it; I'm just saying, Would a law like that, saying it is a crime in England not to pay French taxes... would it have been viewed as contrary to an abrogation of... or a... you know, whatever you call it... a derogation from the common law revenue rule?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But do you see why I want to characterize it?  I mean, would you characterize... my criminal statute's absolutely clear... the clear is, it is a crime in England not to pay French taxes.  Now, would you, or would scholars, or whoever, view about the common law revenue rule, would they have said,  ""There is a derogation from the common law revenue rule. ""  or would they have said,  ""It has nothing to do with it? ""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, what would you have said?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Nobody says they can't do it.  That's why I asked you my question.  My question is simply whether you would consider an absolutely clear law...  ""We will... we... it is a crime not to pay your French taxes. ""  I'm asking whether you would consider that... I'm not saying they can't do it; I just want to know... would it be in derogation of the common law principle?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's where--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Oh.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That would be another one, too.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because the... I... that's why I want to know--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I got your point.  I think it is the... in my answer... in my clear example, you would say no, that's not in derogation for the reason that there's an independent local reason for doing it.  It's not being done to... whether it has that effect or not, it's not being done in order to collect the foreign tax.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's been your response throughout.   Stephen G.

I mean, are there any cases in which France or England has convicted people of an antitrust violation punishable by imprisonment for more than a year?  I... I didn't know that their antitrust laws had a criminal aspect, though I haven't looked it up.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  Well, I... I've never heard if anyone in any foreign country, other than ours, though I gather my law clerk found that in Japan, in fact, Japan does have a criminal antitrust law.  They may be the only ones outside the United States, and I don't know that anyone has ever been convicted under it because they're not too... or they didn't used to be too fierce on antitrust enforcement.

I mean, the... the... if you've used it only a dozen times or so in about 40 years, then it doesn't sound like a major threat.  What I'm weighing against that is the possibility that people are really convicted abroad of selling Bibles.  That really does happen, and there really were economic crimes in 1968 in all the Eastern European countries, and these aren't fanciful examples I've been giving you.  And so if you were in Congress... or... or why do you think that Congress would have wanted to get the courts into the mess of trying to decide why wouldn't those crimes be covered and were the procedures fair?  And we start distinguishing one country from another.  And what are the procedures in the Ukraine or Kazakhstan anyway?  I mean, my goodness, what a mess for the sake of a dozen cases in 40 years.

When a person comes in to get a gun... because I hadn't focused on this, and it actually to me it's relevant.  Suppose one of these people has been convicted in a foreign court and he doesn't have a clue, you know, that this means he can't buy a gun over here.  So he comes over here.  He goes into a... a gun store.  Now, does he get notice that that... this conviction over in Japan or Lithuania or wherever it was means that he can't buy the gun?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So... so what is... I see the First Circuit as trying to grapple with the very question you're raising, which is I think difficult.   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course, it seems to me fine, let section 3 apply.  No problem so far with me.  But that is so broadly stated that if you read it literally, my garage door is a boat or a vessel because, after all, it's capable of being used in navigation, if worst came to worst.  And now you're trying to narrow it to get out of that absurd result.  Well, so did the First Circuit.  That's what they were trying to do, and you got caught up in it.  But that's... so... so what... that's why I think we're struggling with the words, and... and perhaps practically... if you mean by practically that it is not practically capable of navigation, even though it really is, if it just hasn't been used for navigation for a long, long time and has connections to the land like Jimmy's Harborside probably or... or--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --What?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, yes, or one like that.  But is... are those the words?  Do we need some other words as well?  We say practically capable but practically capable has a technical meaning here that it means if there's close to permanent connection to the land, it doesn't apply?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So could we say... could we say that, as well, it must be unlike my garage door?  A, it must be a... a structure that normally would have a crew or that... a significant amount of the time.  We would have a connection to the water.  It would be capable of having a master or crew.  What about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why... why is this an easy case?  Because, after all, the First Circuit is struggling with the same problem and they came to the conclusion, use section 3.  That's fine.  But you know that the garage door is not a vessel, and you also know that Jimmy's Harborside is not a vessel.  And you also know that Justice Scalia's beached scow or something is not a vessel.  And I take it nor is a vessel a scow that's tied up for 364 days of the year and acts as a picnic place and one day they take it out to sea and... because they want to move it across the harbor.  I guess that isn't a vessel.  Is it?  Or maybe it is.  So why is this so easy?  Because the First Circuit--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --had a test, tries to make those distinctions.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Let's say it's wrong about that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now let's take section 3.   Stephen G. Breyer  And taking section 3, it seems to me, we have the same problems.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I'd like to know your answer and you just said to Scalia what I thought... Justice Scalia that I thought what was an answer isn't because I thought that word practical, as co-counsel recommended, has a rather specialized meaning where we get rid of a lot of these.  Now you're saying no, it doesn't.   Stephen G. Breyer  Your... your view of the word in navigation does all the work here.  And so a... a concert ship, which exists, which say is docked at a dock for, let's say, 300 days of the year or maybe 360, and those other 5 days they... they move it from one town to the next town where it stays for another 4 months, that is in navigation or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So then--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --the concert master and the... the... all the orchestra players and everyone else are covered by the Jones Act even though, by the way, none of them has ever moved whatsoever.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if that's so, that's--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But now we have, in my concert ship, the concert master and the whole orchestra covered by the Jones Act even if none of them, by the way, has ever been even to sea on that day when... they take the train.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But it says--   Stephen G. Breyer  --in terms of both its duration and its nature, i.e., a connection to a vessel--   Stephen G. Breyer  --in navigation.   ",03-814X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Should we clarify that?  Because I don't read the cases saying what Justice Scalia just said or what you... what it says is that a seaman must have a connection to a substantial... in terms of duration and nature connection to a vessel in navigation.   Stephen G. Breyer  Obviously, a croupier has such a connection.   Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't say anything about being connected to the navigating part.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So far.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If... if you go... I thought vessel... the word vessel appears in our cases.  It doesn't appear in the Jones Act.  Am I right or not about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So we have a degree of freedom on this.  But... but the... the question then is, is it... how... I'm getting the impression from you and... and from the SG that it's rather deeply embedded in the law, if we start reading the Fifth Circuit cases, that if we define X as a vessel, automatically it is a vessel in navigation, that the cases have said the word in navigation mean nothing, with one exception.  The exception is if you actually have like a physical cemented connection to the land so they can't escape.  Otherwise, if it's just tied up at a dock, even if it never goes to sea, those words, in navigation, have no meaning.  If it's a vessel, it's a vessel in navigation.  If it's my garage door, my garage door, which can float, is a vessel in navigation.  Now, how accurate is that assumption I'm now making?  What would I read in the law?  Is that definition of in navigation as meaning virtually nothing really embedded in the law?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know it is but what is your view?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, would it help? Suppose we were to say it was... had to be capable, at least, of having a captain and crew?   Stephen G. Breyer  Then we better not do anything for the first time.  [Laughter]   ",03-814X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why does not having a possessory right mean that the city could tax them or the state?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm just thinking, suppose you have a reservation but the tribel doesn't have a possessory right because in the middle of the reservation, there is some kind of long term lease or sale to a house that's owned by somebody else who is not a member of the tribe.  I would think... am I right that the city or the county in which that reservation sits can't tax it anyway?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know that but I mean it seems to me one thing that Oneida establishes is that the whole title doesn't just disappear if nothing else happens simply because of the passage of time.   Stephen G. Breyer  And we agree with that or I hypothetically agree with that.  They can't come in and eject people.  But then I'm back to my first question because I take it that the refusal in Oneida to the suggestion that they can't go, say, to Buffalo, New York or wherever or some town and throw everybody out of the house, that that, of course, does reflect the passage of time.  But for a city or state to tax the land, that doesn't involve the same kind of interference with people's expectations of living in the houses that they bought, that throwing someone out of his house would involve.   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought that perhaps the Treaty of Buffalo Creek is thinking of 50,000 acres where these particular Indian tribe members have their homes or at least arguably.  Just no one was thinking about the remaining 300,000 because they had long left those.  It had nothing to do with them.   Stephen G. Breyer  What is the precise language that you think relinquished changed the sovereignty?   INTERRUPTING ",03-855X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What happens about... suppose... I just want to follow this.  Suppose you don't evict the people who are there but it's 22 square miles in the center of New York state.  That's a lot of land.  And maybe that's worth a trillion dollars, I don't know.  So does that mean that the Indian tribe would have... would it mean that it would have the right to, let's say, hundreds of billions of dollars, the value of that property and it could sue someone for it, the state of New York or the Federal Government?  I guess the state of New York?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What was the acreage there?   Stephen G. Breyer  That may not be worth as much.  Maybe this includes several cities and towns?  What do you think it is?  In other words, the answer to my question is in principle, yes.  In principle, if the Indian tribes own 22 square miles, even if they can't get possession, they're entitled to the value of it, in your opinion?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, of course the people who are there have it, maybe it's not Buffalo.  I don't know, maybe it's all of Buffalo, New York, or maybe it's a town.  I'm not saying that that's the law but I just wanted your view of that.  And then I wanted to know this.  On the legal part, I would like your response to the... I take it your answer is yes, they're entitled to the value of it, which I'm right about that, that is your answer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What do you say are the merits, then, to the claim that there were 300,000 of these acres in 1838 or with the Treaty of Buffalo Creek... there were 300,000 acres that nobody was paying any attention to because there were no tribe members that lived there, so that when you have language in the treaty, under those circumstances, that says their home is now... where was it?  Illinois or--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Kansas.  Their home is now Kansas.  That's the nation.  That's the place.  And that... you've heard the language cited.  And even though a person says,  ""You can live here as long as you want. ""  that just means they can live there as long as they want; that doesn't mean it's the reservation.  The reservation's sovereignty may have gone to Kansas, though, of course, nobody had to move, unless he struck a fair bargain that he agreed to with the State of New York.  I take it that's their argument.  I just want to hear your response.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that may be true, but that's why I wondered about the damage part of it.  I'm still thinking that a trespass action for trespasses that occurred in 1850 or 1700 is worth millions today, even if it's tiny, because of the interest, passage of time, et cetera.  When you add that to the value of the land, I'm thinking of numbers that are astronomical.  And yet that hasn't happened.  And so, what actually, as a... and that's why I'm thinking, isn't a damage action far more serious than simply taking property off the tax rolls?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's why I want to know how, in practice, this works out.  Does Congress have the power, for example, to deal with it?  Is what we're considering in this case simply a negotiating position and strengthening people's hands, vis a vis legislation?  What's going on?   ",03-855X

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So... so you're arguing... then you are.  You're saying... this is coming to me a little bit anew.  I perhaps didn't read it carefully enough.  But I thought... let's assume you lose on 1231(a)(6), that I can't think of a way.  Let's assume that I can't think of a way of applying the same words to your alien to mean something different than were applied to the alien who was in Zadvydas.  Suppose you lose on that point.  Now you're saying, well, independently of that, we have a different statute under which we can detain him, namely 1182(d)(5)(A).  Is that--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Now... now is that argument... I mean, I'm sorry that I--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and that... and so is that made in the courts below and everything that they're doing in the cases--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Where does it say... I mean, the reason I guess I missed it is because when I looked at your table of contents and elsewhere in the brief, it seems phrased totally in terms of 1231(a)(6).  That's the heading.  Each argument seems to support that.  And then on page... you know, when you refer to this, I guess on page 26, you're talking in a section about what 1231 must be because of the structure of it.  And then you refer to other provisions such as the one you're now mentioning.  I just didn't pick up that it was a totally independent basis.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, but where does it say that?  I'd like to just glance at it even now.  Where does it say that in your brief, that it's a totally independent basis?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I read and it was in a structure called the statutory and... text and structure support the Secretary's detention authority, which is under a bigger heading saying the text, structure, and history of section 1231(a)(6) confirm the executive branch's authority.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So perhaps I could be forgiven for not understanding--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That's true.  That's true.  Absolutely we did.  And also, I'll assume for argument's sake that you're completely right on the constitutional point.  That's just for argument's sake.  But assume you are.  So there's all kinds of constitutional difference.  Still, I don't see how to read the statute one way for one group of people and another way for another.  The statutory words in Zadvydas, the words that the Attorney General may detain this individual beyond the removal period, are read in Zadvydas to mean beyond the removal period... may detain beyond the removal period means for a reasonable time, presumably 6 months, presumptively, related... reasonable time related to the purpose of the statute which is to find a country willing to accept them.  Okay?  Now, I haven't found a single case of this Court where you interpret these complicated words one way for one and another way for another.  My law clerk found a couple of cases, Communications Work v. Bett and Machinists v. Street, where in Bett particularly the Court strongly implies the contrary.  It says you can't read words differently just because we interpreted in one... you know, one statute, they were interpreted in light of constitutional considerations, and now we have... those constitutional considerations aren't here, but it's the same words.  You have to apply it the same.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, yes.  That's right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well... well, yes, but what... what... we put in the presumptively 6 months, but we said in our view the statute, read in light of the Constitution's demands, limits an alien's post-removal period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about that alien's removal from the United States.  It does not permit indefinite detention interpreting it to avoid constitutional threat.  We include that once removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable, continued detention is no longer authorized by statute.  Now, I don't know what those sentences are doing unless they're interpreting the words I mentioned.  And then later in the opinion, we say it's presumptively--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --not always, but presumptively 6 months.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it interpreted the statute as doing it.  Now, that brings me back to the original question.   Stephen G. Breyer  A person who runs in illegally, a person who crosses the border illegally, say, from Mexico is entitled to these rights when you catch him.   Stephen G. Breyer  But you... you... I thought there was a reg of the INS.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Am I not right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Tell me if I'm right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can I say what it is?   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought there was a reg... to be sure we're talking about the same thing... where the INS has said that Zadvydas applies to individuals who run into the United States illegally from Mexico.  Am I right about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Anyway, it's a little drastic.  I... I guess that before this happens, Congress might enact a statute like the terrorist statute.   John S. Mills  --Exactly.  That... that is exactly correct, Justice Breyer.  And if they think... whether a... a Cuban, a Mariel Cuban, can be put in jail... and these are in prison for the rest of their life... is a huge policy decision.  And this Court should abstain from putting its voice as... on to the answer.  That is a decision for Congress in the first place.  In Zadvydas, this Court said the statute doesn't clearly do that, so we're not going to... we're not going to answer that question as to whether it would be constitutional.   Stephen G. Breyer  But it... it's interesting.  In... in just my... for my... my own information, then Congress did respond.  And there were two areas in Zadvydas that, you know, didn't warn Congress off.  One is the one we're talking about now.  The other is terrorism.  And Congress responded in the terrorism matter.  Is that right?  But they didn't do anything on the--   John S. Mills  --That's absolutely correct.  And they're responding right now.  In the 9/11 Commission bill, there is a section that's being negotiated as to whether terrorist aliens who can't be removed because they would be tortured... whether they can be indefinitely detained.  And they're looking at the same limiting language.  One point that I'd like to make that I did not get to make directly in the brief, but it was raised.  Justice Scalia, you had a question yesterday in the Leocal case, and it... it raised an issue that I hadn't looked at before on whether a statute can be interpreted differently in a situation where the reason to interpret it is no longer there.  And that's the rule of lenity cases.  And I cited as a supplemental authority the United States v. Thompson/Center Arms Company, 504 U.S. 505.  It's a 1992 decision, and it involved a tax code provision.  And the question is, do we apply the rule of lenity?  And Justice Stevens, in dissent you said no, because this is a civil case.  The rule of lenity doesn't apply.  But a three-judge plurality, an opinion by Justice Souter, and a two-justice... two-judge concurrence by Justice Scalia both agreed that the rule of lenity applied because the statute applies both in criminal and civil contexts.  And you can't have one meaning in a criminal context and another in civil.  For the same reason, the rule of constitutional avoidance should not result in a statute being interpreted one way when there would be a doubt and another way when there would not.   ",03-878X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But still, is this another... could... could we do this?  I noticed that... that your... the petition for cert in Benitez has two questions, both of which are about interpreting 1231(a)(6).  The Government's petition, though not its brief... the Government's petition in Crawford says the question presented is whether 1231(a)(6) in Zadvydas compelled a release.  So this other... this other matter is a totally... seen as a totally separate ground.  Perhaps the thing to do is we send it back, and if they want to raise it, they can raise it, and it would be up to the circuit to decide whether they had preserved it or not preserved it.  Is that... is that a sensible thing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's your view of... of what 1182 means, and they're going to have a different view.  If they want to argue their different view, they could do it in the Ninth Circuit.  If they've waived it, they've waived it, and that's up to them, not up to us.   Stephen G. Breyer  Does the... Congress has passed a special statute with respect to terrorism, hasn't it, where it does authorize detention of any of these people who are engaged in terrorism.  Now, I don't know how that's defined.  Is that defined to relieve in a way that's broad enough to relieve some of the problem?   INTERRUPTING ",03-878X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I thought the class action distinction that the commissioner had was between opt in and opt out.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So if you opt in, then you did exercise control.  So all the money is yours.  But if you opt out, you didn't have control over the suit because you didn't opt out.  I mean, you just were lethargic.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's the basic thing.  I mean, I'm trying to understand what the principle is for the reason that it's pretty hard for me to reconcile the commissioner's view in the class action case with the punitive damage case because there the person has control over the lawsuit.  So why doesn't all the punitive damage, attorney's fees that come out of that, and so forth belong to... in other words, it sounds to me, as I read this, something of a mess, and I'd like to know what the clear principle is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --But can... can I ask you to go back for a minute?  I guess the IRS... you're seeing the lawsuit as the income-generating asset.   Stephen G. Breyer  And you're looking at the control of the plaintiff, for example, over the lawsuit as something that determines whether it's his income.  And he, of course, can't give away his income.  But on that theory, to go back to Justice O'Connor's original question, then the punitive damages also must be his income because he has equal control over them and they grow out of the income-producing asset.  And that, of course, is what's bothering me because it seems to me that your theory, which is a well-established theory, coupled with a Congress that seems to be willing to take away deductions for expenses that lead to the income, could produce an income tax that in many cases, not just a few, exceeds the income that an individual has.  And I would like to know what in the law is there to guard against that result.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any constitutional protection?  The Sixteenth Amendment refers to an income tax, and perhaps that doesn't include a tax that grossly exceeds in many cases a person's income.  That would be quite a far-out theory at the moment.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I... that's why I ask you.  Is there any protection in the law whatsoever?  Or if Congress decides to tax a set of people who, let's see... say, earn $10,000 a year and because they're small business people, they happen to have $20,000 expenses.  So it taxes them on $20,000, and the tax exceeds the income.  There's no protection in your view against that result.  And you just said, well, Congress decided to do it, it decided to do it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about an assumption, for example, that when we read the code, we read it with a view towards thinking Congress did not want to produce such unfair results?

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  And that isn't the question.   Stephen G. Breyer  The... the problem is you're... you're trying to get a theory in response to him that I think Justice Kennedy is asking about.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that theory, which is the problem for your side of the case... that theory has all kinds of implications.  I go out and I help the painter paint my office.  We have a joint venture.  I... so there's no problem.  I don't take it in... you know, I get a... this is great.  And so that I think, if I'm right, was the thrust of Justice Kennedy's question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's your third?  I just don't want you to miss your third.  You have the joint venture theory, an exception to an assignment in income, and you said you had a third.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if you took a settlement... his theory, I take it, was seeing the lawsuit as a capital asset.  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then whenever you settled a lawsuit, it would be... you'd have to pay capital gains instead of ordinary income.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Like somebody stealing a check out of my mailbox from my employer.  Right?  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what is your theory, I mean, precisely?  A, an assignment of income, what would otherwise count of A giving an assignment of income to B, and therefore still be A's income because the asset remains with A, the work, or whatever.  Now, your theory is but not in the case that.  Now fill in the blank for me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Precisely, please.   Stephen G. Breyer  Not in the case... it is an assignment of income to B, but not in the case where the funds are not in... when B... when B get... when B, the attorney, gets the funds, he controls them.  What's... what do you mean?  I don't get it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I want to know.  You have three... your problem on your side for me is that maybe all the equities are there, but I'd like to know the proposition of law that you want us to write in this opinion.  And now we had three theories, and one, the one that you seem to be adopting, is this exception to the assignment of income doctrine.  If that is what you're adopting, I'd like to know the precise form of words that create the exception.  If that's not the theory you're adopting, I would like to know what the theory you're adopting is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He did have control.  He could have settled the lawsuit or not settled the lawsuit.  He controlled when the income was generated, and moreover, he could have stopped it from being generated by settling the suit or dismissing it.  Moreover, if he had not entered into this assignment of income, it would have been paid right into his bank account at the end.  It sounds an awful lot like the Lucases or like the Horsts or whoever, Old Colony Trust.  It sounds an awful lot like those cases.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Your... your... you want to fill in the blank, in other words, and say where the assignment of income is such, such that B was in effect the person who really earned the income, unlike Mrs. Lucas'... Mr. Lucas' or maybe Mr. Earl... I don't know--   Stephen G. Breyer  --husband... the wife didn't earn the income.   Stephen G. Breyer  The husband did.  So you want to say where the... and then your answer, I guess... don't say I'm right if I'm not right, please, because I'll just find out later.  [Laughter]  The... the answer to the hypothetical about the agent and so forth is, well, so be it.  If a person wants to go to the trouble of carving out some of his income and assigning that over to the agent, let him.  Except for perhaps provisions of the code which we cannot now envisage... I can't because I'm not an expert... it doesn't matter since, after all, it would be deductible anyway.  Is that... is that what you're saying?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Tell me if I'm wrong, please, on this.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, I see. You say double.  Both the income is earned by the attorney, and at that stage the client does virtually nothing.  So it's the reverse of the Earls or the Lucases where the husband was doing the work and the wife is getting the income.  It would be as if the wife was doing all the work and the husband just sat there and clipped coupons or whatever.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Those were less enlightened times.   ",03-892X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but that isn't the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  So once you say that, you realize that there are billions and billions of searches that go on every day that the police don't have to justify at all.  They just look around.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay?  There are billions of them.  So the real question is do they have to give a justification for this.  And the argument that they don't is simply that it's not in the person's house.  When you go out in a public place, even in your car, you might run into people or animals with sharp noses.  And a lot of them can detect marijuana.  And you know, maybe it's a Limburger cheese.  I don't know.  [Laughter]  But people are sniffing things that they don't sniff through windows into your house, but they do get odors in your car on the street.  So this is the kind of search.  Yes, it's a search, but one that the police don't have to justify.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it's a specific investigative tool when I put on my glasses to look through a window.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't see why it has to... why that matters if in fact all... if you go into a car, a police car, and you have... drive through the neighborhood and look around, you are using a specific investigative tool, the police car, to look around and find out what's going on.   Stephen G. Breyer  What I'm trying to get to is in my own mind it's not a question of the tools.  It's a question of the expectation of privacy.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I still want to go back to my question because I think you may have an answer to it and I want to focus you--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I want to focus you on the question.  I think what you're doing, which is a reasonable thing to do, but it isn't my approach, look to the English definition of search.  I say forget that.  Let's look to the Fourth Amendment because there are a whole range of searches that don't even fall within the Fourth Amendment in the sense that we don't need a justification.  And I take Place as saying that dog sniffs is one of those, whether it does or doesn't use the word English search.  So I want to know why it is that this dog search is one of the ones that's a Fourth Amendment search, i.e., one of the ones that requires a justification in terms of what the Fourth Amendment is about, privacy.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but that isn't... I take it you don't--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Is there anything wrong with the policeman himself taking a sniff?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's the great Limburger cheese robbery.  [Laughter]  He stopped the car and he walks around.  Anything wrong with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So plain--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  So... so what you're saying is... and this must tie back to reasonable expectation of privacy.  All right?  Because it's okay for the policeman to do it, and it's okay for dogs to do it in the bus station, and it's okay to use a dog not in the bus station with a car if in fact you actually are going to put him under arrest, although here you had probable cause to do so, I take it.  And now you have to draw a pretty fine line.  But it's not okay where it's not the bus station, but it is the car and in fact the dog is doing the sniffing... and there are a lot of dogs around that can sniff... and you did have probable cause but you didn't say it.  And in face of Justice O'Connor's case which said that... you see.  Well, I mean, this is... this is--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I mean, I'm not saying you couldn't draw that line, but I'm saying it's pretty tough I think.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I don't know.  [Laughter]  I'm right?  Am I...

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I thought that Boykin and... Boykin and... and Brookhart were about really a somewhat different matter.  The language, functional equivalent of a guilty plea, is lifted from Brookhart.  Boykin and Brookhart are about what a judge does, not about what a lawyer does.  In Boykin, the judge accepted the guilty plea, and the Court said you can't do it without the express consent of the defendant.  In Brookhart, it was a judge who accepted... now, here it was an odd procedure, and it was that procedure that the Court called the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.  And therefore, we're talking about what a judge can do.  Here we're not.  We're talking about what a lawyer can do and when it arises to the level of improper lack of counsel.  So I don't think they govern it.  Rather, I thought... and I want your view on this... that the most relevant case was really Roe v. Flores, you know, where... where the lawyer did a weird thing.  He didn't file an appeal.  And here he's doing a little odd thing.  So what we said there is you have to consult, which is just what the Government is saying here.  I'm exposing that thought process to you to get your reaction.   Stephen G. Breyer  This is not a guilty plea and the words... a guilty plea is something accepted by a judge and the judge didn't.  But I grant you it's a very odd situation and very special, and that's why I wonder what the appropriate way to... what kind of requirement there ought to be.  Maybe there should be something.  I'm not sure why it should rise above the level of consultation since you know, better than I, you can have some awfully difficult clients who are virtually incapable of understanding what's in their interests.  And... and that's why I'm awfully reluctant to go beyond saying you have to consult with your client.  You start insisting on an answer, and you don't know what they're going to say.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why is it difficult to figure out what the Ninth Circuit was thinking?  I... I found it... am I right?  I thought they said the... the seller says we found gold.  The stock sells for $60.  They have loads of experts who say in the absence of that statement, which was a lie, we found gold, it would have sold for $10.  The loss is $50.  I mean, I take it that's their theory.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, what's wrong with that theory?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's clear.  I mean, it's certainly clear.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  They say it caused the loss, $50.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any other problem?  I'm trying to get a list of what the problems are with the simple theory.  Now, I've heard one that you've ratified.  [Laughter]  And... and is there any other?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, can we... can they prove this?  $60.  $50 is wrong, is inflated because of the gold.  It turns out that gold never existed and they knew it.  The stock is not selling for $60 anymore.  It's selling for $200.  They found platinum.  No one expected it.  All right.  They want to prove maybe it is selling for $200, but if we had found gold as well, it would have sold for $250.  Can they do it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's a loss.  $250 versus $200.   Stephen G. Breyer  If that's so then... then on the platinum/gold theory, you can't really recover what would have happened if there had been gold because it might be that the stock would have been worth $400 if there had been gold even though 15 years earlier when he only paid $50 for it, he's only out of pocket, at most, $50.  But if there had been gold, because of the gold market in the world, it would have been a lot more valuable.  And you're saying he can't do that?  I don't know.  Maybe that question isn't in the case, but that strikes me as a difficult question.   ",03-932X

And I don't see how you could understand it unless you have in the complaint what your theory is.  That's all.  Nobody is asking for some facts.  Is your theory that the loss took place at the time the person bought the stock because he overpaid $30?  Is your theory that the stock went down and, because of that, he lost the money?  Is your theory that the stock didn't go down but it would have gone up more?  All they're asking is not for evidence, but a simple, clear explanation of the theory, and plead in the alternative if you want.  But I mean, what's the problem?  Why is that so hard to do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And this case doesn't seem to do it.  I looked through the entire complaint.  I found exactly two paragraphs.  I didn't.  My law clerk did, frankly.  [Laughter]  But I told him to underline it.  In paragraph 179, he found the word, and it caused damage.  Okay?  And in paragraph 177, it says the same.  That's all he could find.  And they were harmed.  That's what it says.   Stephen G. Breyer  But it sounds to me as if the things you're saying now are matters for proof, and I... I think the wiggle room in the Government's position was it said it has to be disclosed to the market in some form or other.  Well, if you're prepared to be broad and turn those over to the experts for the proof, you end up with your theory.  The... the inflation comes out and it comes out because they didn't get the earnings that they would have had or there may be many reasons.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you just have to say at the pleading stage what your theory is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But then you're not saying what I think Justice Scalia and I actually thought you were going to say which is that the minute he pays $60 for a stock that should be worth $30 but is $60 because of the lie, at that instant he suffered a loss.  After listening to you, I now think you're saying... but I'm not sure because I've heard you say things that are... both... I now think you're saying, no, he has not suffered a loss until later on when that $30 comes out of the price of the stock.   Stephen G. Breyer  It might come out in many different ways.  It could come out because he announces I'm a liar.   Stephen G. Breyer  It could come out because he doesn't say anything but it sort of oozes out as earning reports come in, but it has to come out.  Now, if you're saying that, then I find what you're saying consistent what I think Judge Posner said.  And that's really what I'm interested in because I read what he said.  It seemed to me right.  Now--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --When we have this happy agreement and if you'll agree, you at least have to prove what you... you have to plead what you intend to do, that is, you have to plead and there was a loss and this is my theory.  I would like to know... maybe we won't get beyond this, but in looking at this, I wondered now suppose that the stock goes up in value because of extraneous things.  Can you recover because it would have been still higher?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What happens with the transaction causation?  Because I think you'd probably say with your transaction causation in the... in the case that the... that the lie wasn't there, we wouldn't have bought the stock.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If you say that, they come along and say, okay, you wouldn't have bought the stock.  I'll tell you, here's one bad thing happened.  You lost your $30.  But there were six good things that happened that you never thought of, and so the stocks were four times what it would have been and you'd never have those gains, just as you'd never have the losses.

And in those instances, is the presence of water in the wetland anything more than a coincidence?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Breyer  No.  I can't find any quantitative assessment.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  Now suppose we take a set, which you think exists as not the null set, of instances where there is no such transfer, which your opponents say is this case.  Now what's the justification for regulating those?  If it's simply flood control because water flows over the top and sits there, I guess you could say the same thing is true of any low depression, and therefore, the presence of water would be just a coincidence.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I've listed four categories of things that you think would be very difficult to prove to a jury at the trial, but not to a judge at sentencing.  The first is the vast amount of information now and prior to guidelines that were contained in the presentence report.  That information, most of which was used since history was begun, maybe a hundred years ago, is simply not available until the trial was over.  The second happens to be the things that the Chief brought up, matters committed at trial, such as perjury.  The third sort of thing are those things that just get too complicated when you try to list in indictment, such as victim... put them all together... victim, brandishing the gun, et cetera.  And the fourth kind of thing are the things that are too difficult to explain to a jury.  Try explaining even ""brandishing"" to a jury, and if you can do that one, which may be easy, try the multiple-count rules.  All right.  So I have those four things.  Now, are there others?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, all right if I believe that that is just out of the question, it's so complicated, nobody could do it, it would be a radical change, Congress could never have intended that, what about a much simpler approach?  What you would do is take 3553(b), and you say,  ""Read the word i.e. ""shall apply the guidelines""... to ""may"",. ""  so that the guidelines become advisory, either because the ""shall"" becomes a ""may"" or because you give each judge the power to give any reasonable reason at all as to why the Commission's guideline, they didn't actively consider this factor.  In other words, read 3553(b) as permissive.  And now, assuming I've expressed myself on the underlying Apprendi questions, so I, but suppose Blakely does apply, would you... is... what would be wrong with taking that approach?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, I have thought of one thing that might be wrong.  [Laughter]  So I'll ask you about it, if you want.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, well, I... you see nothing wrong with that.  That makes the guidelines advisory, and there are a number of objections... maybe not, maybe big, maybe small.  One objection I was worried about is... I'm giving you my thought process, you know, and I... because I'm trying to get a... your response... is that if we did take that approach, you'd leave the appellate section in place.  That means every time the judge didn't use the guideline, the appeals courts would have to review for reasonableness.  Now that would be in place.  We would discover judges all over the country having different views on that.  Courts of appeals would have different views about was or what was not reasonable.  We would be here to review those differences, and we would become the sentencing commission.  I thought I had escaped.  [Laughter]  Now, how, how serious an objection is that?  Or do you recommend that, if you lose on this point, we take the approach of, in that way, making the guidelines advisory?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, there are lots.  There are lots, actually.  If you... if... I ask, ""Is it right, that""?  [Laughter]  But, I mean, if you take common law to mean England, as well as the United States, there weren't here, because the sentences weren't appealable, but in England, they were appealable, and they had a common law work out of what they called the ""tariff"", which is what the range of reasonableness was or wasn't.  And the prosecution, I believe, could appeal it of being too low; and the defense, being too high.  And the question was, Was the sentence reasonable?  The appellate court could set it.  Now, if we had a system like that... and this is my serious question... is it unconstitutional under Apprendi if appeals court judges reviewing a sentence could say,  ""This is the range of reason, this is arbitrary up here, or this is arbitrary down there? ""   INTERRUPTING ",04-104X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose that the judge had simply sentenced the defendant, let's say, to ten years, but looked at these other crimes and said,  ""In my practice, I go to 15. ""  All right?  That's the basic situation.  Is that unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, there are no guidelines.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now suppose the people who do exactly the same thing is the Court of Appeals applying the word ""reasonable"", these officials of the judicial branch.  See, they're reviewing the sentence for reasonableness.  They say,  ""In our practice when a person commits bank robbery, if just an ordinary case, we think it's reasonable five years; but if he has a gun, seven years. ""  So if there's no gun, five years is the most that isn't arbitrary.  But if there's a gun, you can go to seven years.  In other words, an English-type tariff system.  Is that unconstitutional?   Stephen G. Breyer  You think it would be.  So--   Stephen G. Breyer  --now suppose the people who do it are the parole commission... as happen to be in the United States, executive branch officials.  For the last hundred years, they get sentences, for example, that were indeterminate, or might have been for 30 years.  And what they say,  ""It is our practice, assuming good behavior, that if it was just an ordinary bank robbery we'll keep him in for five years, but if he had a gun, he's going to stay in for seven. ""  Is that unconstitutional?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, what they have is an indeterminate sentence.   Stephen G. Breyer  California.   Stephen G. Breyer  And what they say is,  ""In our practice, what we do is, we think it's reasonable, and we will keep a person in prison for five years in an ordinary bank robbery, but for seven years if he has a gun. ""  I'm asking if that's constitutional.  Because that's the practice that they follow under parole commission guidelines, and they've done it now for a decade, I make up.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's constitutional.   Stephen G. Breyer  What I'm trying to drive at... and I'll be... is that I can't imagine a court holding that a parole commission in the executive branch that has exactly this same system would be behaving unconstitutionally.  It's difficult for me to imagine... though you say I'm wrong on that... a court holding it's unconstitutional when a court of appeals does the same thing reviewing for arbitrariness.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You know, I--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm not raising the question well.  I'm trying to imagine sentencing guidelines run by a parole commission, executive branch officials.  I'm trying to imagine sentencing guidelines run under the word arbitrary by ordinary courts of appeals panels reviewing the sentences.  And if those are both constitutional, then, I would ask, why is it unconstitutional to put the executive branch and judicial branch officials together in one group called the sentencing commission?   Stephen G. Breyer  I understand that.  And... well, maybe I'm just not going to get my question across.  I am trying to imagine Apprendi.  Would Apprendi apply to parole commission guidelines?  I should think the answer, unless we're going to reverse a hundred years of history, is no.  Would Apprendi apply to a court of appeals panel with the power to review sentences for arbitrariness?   Stephen G. Breyer  I would think the answer is no.  And, therefore, I wonder why it applies if we take judicial officials and executive branch officials, and they do exactly the same thing under the heading Sentencing Commission.   Stephen G. Breyer  Look, we're trying to go to the same point, and I think you're actually given me a pretty good answer.  The--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm imagining my system being the system that Apprendi forbids.  So I'm not doing increase/decreases.  I'll think of the very kind of system.  And I take it your answer is this... and remember, I dissented in Apprendi.   Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't agree with it.  Right.  But there we are.  And so I'm trying to see how far it goes.  So I wonder, we take our Apprendi system and now it's being administered by a parole commission.  We take our Apprendi system, and now it's being administered by a court of appeals using the legal standard arbitrariness.  And I take it your answer is those are just as unconstitutional.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now you understand what I'm doing, because I'm saying you either have to follow the force of your logic and make those unconstitutional, too, or you have to say there's a difference.  And, by definition, the only difference is who promulgated it.  And then, of course, I'm going to ask you, if there's a difference right there, why doesn't this one, which is executive plus judicial, fall on my side of the difference?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I... in my imaginary parole commission--   Stephen G. Breyer  --which I will argue a different point.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, I will argue it another time.  I've seen a lot of parole commission guidelines, and I would say they, a lot of them did fall within the Apprendi boundaries.  But if we did take it and have the parole commission do it... ""it"", being the Apprendi forbidden system, in your view, is it unconstitutional?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  And then the same thing is true of a... of a court of appeals panel.   Stephen G. Breyer  It does exist under the guidelines?  How does it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, only, only, only if you have statutes that have mandatory minimums that have lesser sentences.  That's true.   Stephen G. Breyer  But compared to the status quo, if you have the guidelines alone, one of their basic objectives was to prevent that kind of manipulation.  And, by and large, I thought they had succeeded on that point.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that lawful under the guideline?  Is the judge required to accept the facts as the... as the prosecution and defense agree to present them?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.   Stephen G. Breyer  What is your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question?  And I'd appreciate your focusing on what I thought were the two most important ones, which is, first, the... I thought that sentencing for a hundred years had gone on primarily on the basis of the presentence report.  And the idea was, the person is convicted and now we're going to decide what to do with this individual who's convicted, and we're going to read what the probation officer writes about it, and he'll go interview people after, as he does.  And many, many, many, if not most, of the facts in that presentence report were not available at the time of trial.  They're about the history of the individual, and they're more about the manner in which the crime was carried out.  And the other main thing is the... is the vast number of really complex operations, multiple-count rules, relevant conduct, all kinds of things that... try even ""brandishing"".  I mean, that's the second thing, the complexity.  So the presentence report--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and the complexity.   Stephen G. Breyer  Congress's basic... that's a good answer.  Congress's basic objective here is... was uniformity.  I think it was a noble objective, whether or not it's been achieved or, but are you saying to Congress, Sorry, the Constitution prohibits you, in Congress, from trying to create uniformity, or greater uniformity, of sentencing among district judges?  There's just no way you can do it, because if you throw everything to a jury, you know, you throw it right into the hands of the prosecutor to determine what to charge, what not to charge, what facts to agree upon, et cetera, no way to do it?  We're back to our two cellmates... one day served, 50 years served... though the real conduct was the same.   Stephen G. Breyer  As long as you're on the subject, I'm quite... you're going to... what is your reaction to what I've written, which you've, you used to say wrong, wrong, wrong, but I want to know why.  And what I know why in particular is I speculated somewhat, that the reason that this might work, your side of it, if it works despite the, the complication, the bifurcated trials, etc.  , is that 97 percent of the cases are handled through plea bargaining, and this will give you a little bit of a leg up, which I speculated the defense bar likes.  I'm not surprised.  But then, I thought with in the long run, you just can't have a system of justice that depends for its workable nature upon plea bargaining, which in fact depends on the weapons you give to prosecutors.  And so I ended up thinking, I just can't underwrite such a thing.  And I'd like to get your, your, your reaction to that.   Stephen G. Breyer  So can I ask you the same question?  Imagine that the statute says bank robbery is zero to twenty years.  Case one, a separate statute says a guideline commission will make distinctions, and the guideline commission says,  ""five years in the ordinary case, seven years with a gun. ""  Case two, the same thing but a parole commission does it.  Case three, the same thing, but a court of appeals panel does it, under the guise of what's arbitrary, what isn't.  They're all, in your opinion, to be treated alike.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, there is just what I said, just what I said.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  But the idea is that this works because most cases are plea bargained.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what you'll do if you're right, is all you would say is any time that the prosecutor wants to say that you committed the bank robbery or you committed the drug offense with more than a minimal amount of money or more than a minimal amount of drug, or there were guns, they get into a bargain, and they end up with a sentence once they bargain... if that's the sentence, because they're not even going to contest it before the judge, both sides will come in and agree.  But in those few cases where they do contest it, you would have to have the jury find the facts.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, the only reason that I find it disturbing is to think that Congress could have wanted such a system is given other developments in Congress, mandatory minimums and all kinds of things, that seems to me to be a system that would really, might make non-uniformity in reality, worse than it was before 1986.  See, I mean, my goodness, every prosecutor's going to be doing something different, every defense attorney; everything will depend upon the bargains.  The judges when they come in will think different things.  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Should we uphold something like that in the face of a Congress that wanted uniformity?   Stephen G. Breyer  Did you find out anything in your research on this where anybody in the... this discussion of the guidelines began, I think, in the early 70's, it's been around for 30 years.  The guidelines have been law for 17 years, and until recently with Apprendi, is there a history of anything being written about the guidelines being unconstitutional for this Sixth Amendment reason?  Did any group of judges, or defense attorneys, or academics or anybody write anything that we could look at until quite recently in which they thought this was a possibility?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, before we began with Apprendi?   Stephen G. Breyer  Nothing.   ",04-104X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I've listed four categories of things that you think would be very difficult to prove to a jury at the trial, but not to a judge at sentencing.  The first is the vast amount of information now and prior to guidelines that were contained in the presentence report.  That information, most of which was used since history was begun, maybe a hundred years ago, is simply not available until the trial was over.  The second happens to be the things that the Chief brought up, matters committed at trial, such as perjury.  The third sort of thing are those things that just get too complicated when you try to list in indictment, such as victim... put them all together... victim, brandishing the gun, et cetera.  And the fourth kind of thing are the things that are too difficult to explain to a jury.  Try explaining even ""brandishing"" to a jury, and if you can do that one, which may be easy, try the multiple-count rules.  All right.  So I have those four things.  Now, are there others?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, all right if I believe that that is just out of the question, it's so complicated, nobody could do it, it would be a radical change, Congress could never have intended that, what about a much simpler approach?  What you would do is take 3553(b), and you say,  ""Read the word i.e. ""shall apply the guidelines""... to ""may"",. ""  so that the guidelines become advisory, either because the ""shall"" becomes a ""may"" or because you give each judge the power to give any reasonable reason at all as to why the Commission's guideline, they didn't actively consider this factor.  In other words, read 3553(b) as permissive.  And now, assuming I've expressed myself on the underlying Apprendi questions, so I, but suppose Blakely does apply, would you... is... what would be wrong with taking that approach?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, I have thought of one thing that might be wrong.  [Laughter]  So I'll ask you about it, if you want.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, well, I... you see nothing wrong with that.  That makes the guidelines advisory, and there are a number of objections... maybe not, maybe big, maybe small.  One objection I was worried about is... I'm giving you my thought process, you know, and I... because I'm trying to get a... your response... is that if we did take that approach, you'd leave the appellate section in place.  That means every time the judge didn't use the guideline, the appeals courts would have to review for reasonableness.  Now that would be in place.  We would discover judges all over the country having different views on that.  Courts of appeals would have different views about was or what was not reasonable.

And I... and in respect to that, I read this as saying, specifically, that the plants... it doesn't include the substance if it is a substance clearly distinguished from the substance constituting its active principal... and the example they give is mimosa root, which contains DMT.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then, that's also true of the bananas and pineapples, et cetera.  And there's a court holding that hoasca's out of it, in France and one in the Netherlands, all of which I think was relevant to a Treaty.  All right?  Now, the Government has come in with a counterargument and said it clearly does cover, I guess, even mimosa roots, where they are imported solely for the purpose of extracting DMT.  Now, what's the response to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But, as... I understand the Treaty.  What the Treaty says is, you can't import substances listed in Schedule 1.  Then you look at Schedule 1, and it doesn't say hoasca.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It says DMT> [""].  And then it has another... and, interpreting that, it says the fact, if you look at that list and it says DMT> [""], means what it says, you can't import DMT.  It's a drug importation statute, and it doesn't cover plants that contain the substance DMT.  Otherwise, we'd have... throw out bananas and... or mimosa, anyway.  And we're not looking to intent on that.  Now, that's a possible interpretation that doesn't contradict anything.  And--   Stephen G. Breyer  --You're in trouble. That's harder, then, if it's--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, but--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I don't see... I mean, I see I was not right.  You do import drums of tea.  And they say, in the Treaty, that a preparation is a solution or mixture containing a substance.  And it would seem to be a solution or a mixture containing DMT.  And the commentary that I thought helped you does concern plants, but you're not importing plants.  So, now I'm rather troubled to see if there is any way that this Treaty is interpreted in a manner that allows you to win.  What is it?   INTERRUPTING ",04-1084
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Justice Douglas says there that as long as it's an objective within Congress and legislature's legitimate grant of power, they can do it, I mean, as long as there's a... so why does there have to be a limit within that broad limit?   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course, there can't, purely.  But there is no taking for private use that you could imagine in reality that wouldn't also have a public benefit of some kind, whether it's increasing jobs or increasing taxes, et cetera.  That's a fact of the world.  And so given that fact of the world, that is law, why shouldn't the law say, okay, virtually every taking is all right, as long as there is some public benefit which there always is and it's up to the legislature.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  It could only be taken if there is a public use and there almost always is.  Now, do you agree with that, or do you not agree with my last empirical statement?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, that's, of course, my question.  The question is, if you agree with the empirical statement that there almost always is some public benefit attached, then my question is, why must there be a limit within that broad framework?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The latter.  I mean, I understand the former.  That's a big retreat and it comes to me now you're getting to what I think is a possible realm of reason here.  But the second part now you said and minimum standards.  What minimum standards?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I mean, are you advocating particular ones?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask you about the standard.  Go back for a second.   Stephen G. Breyer  I gather that the Iowa courts have a standard that includes whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the intended public use will take place.  Now, is that the standard you're advocating?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there a lot of disagreement about this?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, it seems to me you might... whether there is a reasonable assurance that there will in fact be the public use which the state uses as the justification for taking the property.  Is that going to help you that much?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean, I don't see how this Court could get into the business of saying you have to have this by a particular day or you have to have 14 witnesses.  I mean, we couldn't impose that sort of thing, could we?   Stephen G. Breyer  There needs to be a reasonable assurance.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, they might well need it here.   ",04-108X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But he doesn't... he doesn't, his second test does not adopt that.  The second test which he was arguing at the end is just that there has to be a reasonable assurance that the public use, and it could include all those things, will in fact take place.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That may be, but what do you think of that test?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, can't the courts at least... can't the courts, could the courts... do you object to this, and I'm not advocating it, I want your reaction.   Stephen G. Breyer  Could the courts, under this clause, at least review what you've just said for reasonableness?  I mean, look at the reasonableness of a claim that this is for... basically for a public use.  Look at the reasonableness of the claim that we should do it this way, rather than excusing the people who don't want to sell their houses no matter what and doing it a little bit differently.  Reasonableness is a concept that's already in the Constitution in terms of what the legislature can do, but I'm thinking of the stronger kind of reasonableness review that you might have in an administrative action.  Now, is, Overton Park, if you want a case.  Is that a possible kind of review that you might find appropriate here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the reason that you would apply a somewhat higher standard is because the rational basis, with tremendous deference, applies to the power of Congress to act in an economic area in the absence of a particular constitutional provision designed to protect a minority from the actions of the majority.  And if you read that public purpose doctrine, a section here as having that in mind, you might want a somewhat higher level of review.  Now, that's the whole thing spelled out.  I'm not advocating it.  But I am putting it forward to get... to get your reaction.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, and indeed with equal protection, we very often do have a somewhat higher standard of review.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That may be.  Now, that's why I'm back to reasonableness.  You see, we are told in the briefs that the people who often might hold out, might be doing so to get more money, but it might also be because they are poor, they are not well connected politically, and their only hope is to go to a court and stop this thing.  So you'd give them two weapons.  Weapon one is you have to pay them.  That's correct.  Compensation.  And weapon two is they can put you to a test of being reasonable.  That might be quite a deferential test, so you might have every leg up.  But they at least could catch the instances where this is really not reasonable to do to them what you're doing to them that they don't want.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm accepting that you can't make that kind of a distinction.  That's where I'm focusing on a test that would possibly apply only where you transfer property from one private person to another, but still wouldn't make those distinctions of blight or not blight.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true.  But now, put yourself in the position of the homeowner.  I take it, if it's a forced sale, it's at the market value, the individual, let's say it's someone who has lived in his house his whole life.  He bought the house for $50,000.  It's worth half a million.  He has 450,000 profit.  He pays 30 percent to the government and the state in taxes, and then he has to live somewhere.  Well, I mean, what's he supposed to do?  He now has probably 350,000 to pay for a house.  He gets half a house because that's all he is going to do, all he is going to get for that money after he paid the taxes, or whatever.  And I mean, there are a lot of... and he has to move and so forth.  So going back to Justice Kennedy's point, is there some way of assuring that the just compensation actually puts the person in the position he would be in if he didn't have to sell his house?  Or is he inevitably worse off?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is the remedy?  Let's repose the problem to which I want to remedy then.  And maybe this isn't the right remedy.  But the remedy that they are saying, and I'm really repeating it, is an individual has a house and they want to be really not made a lot worse off, at least not made a lot worse off just so some other people can get a lot more money.  Now what, what is the right... is there no constitutional protection?  If this isn't the right case, what is?   INTERRUPTING ",04-108X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, somebody will be if it's random.  If you have thousands of people, somebody will be if it is random.  If there were nobody who was picked seven times, that would show it wasn't random.  So, you know--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --whether he has a good constitutional claim here I guess is rather doubtful, and maybe it is--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --What are they?  How many people are there?  How many people are tested if you try to calculate it?  How many--   Stephen G. Breyer  --in the Federal Government?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All you do is you get a bell curve and you ask the Library of Congress and they'll do it--   Stephen G. Breyer  --No.  It's... it's not hard to do.   Stephen G. Breyer  But it's not hard to do.  You just ask someone at Stanford.  They'll do it for you.  [Laughter]  But the... the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  Regardless, this is beside the point.  I... all right.  Can I... I just want you at some point to get to not just the constitutional question.  Maybe he can go in and raise his claim.  I don't know if he should have exhausted or not, et cetera.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I find it hard, in reading this, to believe the following.  Like any other worker, I mean, normally you have a collective bargaining agreement, and the union takes up your minor things.  And here, what you're saying is although if it's a major thing, like a personnel action, there's a special thing where you get in... you know, you... you get into court way down the road.  It's very complicated.  This individual, even though he classifies it as a grievance where the union is supposed to take it up and the union tells him we're not going to take it up, we don't believe in your claim, that then he can run in to a Federal judge.  Now, that... that I find surprising, and I'd like you to explain how in your theory that works.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why isn't the thing to do here... I... I see that you are raising a significant question in respect to... at least in my view, in respect to the... an action that violates a regulation that violates a statute.  Leave the Constitution aside, but it might violate a number of practices, good practices, et cetera.  But why isn't focusing on that the thing for the plaintiff here to do if he goes to the union... I'm just reading from page 6 and 7 of your brief... and he says, I would like you to invoke arbitration?  And they might do it.  Now, if they do it and it comes out in a way they don't like, he then... they might file exceptions and they might win.  But what you're worried about is if they don't win or if they don't do it, they can go to court only if it involved an unfair labor practice or a major adverse personnel action.  That's what's worrying you, I take it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why isn't it, at that stage if he doesn't get into court, you then say that that isn't true?  They should be able to come to court in other instances as well, making the same kinds of arguments that you're making now.   Stephen G. Breyer  You... you... I... I believe that there are millions of instances, perhaps.  Now, I'm... when I think something like this, I'm quite often wrong.  But I thought that the reason that exhaustion is required is not always because statutes require it.  It's partly because of the word final in the APA, which applies here as well, and it's also because of the common law of administrative law that requires people to exhaust their remedies.   Stephen G. Breyer  But it's not rewriting.  I mean... I mean, it's perhaps.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  You think... fine.  The... the... but the... the issue it seems that could be dispositive of this, in respect to the nonconstitutional claims... and this is why I want to get your response... is simply that it is a fair implication from Congress having set up on nonconstitutional matters a system of arbitration to require your client to go through that system before seeking to get review of the nonconstitutional matters in a Federal district court.  Now, that's the normal rule in administrative law.  What is the argument that it wouldn't apply in your case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now you want us to hold you don't have judicial review--   Stephen G. Breyer  --under the statute.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, but the answer... please, I didn't mean to cut off your answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  I want to hear your answer to the question that if I agree with you that on nonconstitutional matters, if this system doesn't work for your client, he gets review in a Federal district court.  Suppose I agree with you on that.  What is the argument against requiring him to exhaust the remedy that is there, namely a request for arbitration--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --as an implication from the statute?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, is there any other claim... any other answer to the argument other than they waived it?   Stephen G. Breyer  What?   Stephen G. Breyer  Did I... could you give... give the same answer--   Stephen G. Breyer  --in respect to your constitutional claim?  Why, given the presence of section 705 of the act--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --one's... forget it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Your time is up.  That's--   ",04-1131
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So I guess you're saying, as to the constitutional claim, it's obvious they have to exhaust.  There's no reason why they don't have to exhaust in respect to the 12th test, which has already occurred, and in respect to the 15th, which might be threatened, if it does come about that it's threatened, they can go in, I guess, under 705 of the APA and ask for an injunction.  Any reason they couldn't do that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  What they do is they follow, like any other agency action.  An agency action has taken place.  I think it's unconstitutional or you do.  We exhaust our remedies and then get to court at the end of the day and make our claim.  An agency action is threatened.  I am threatened with irreparable injury.  I can go to court, I think, at the time it's threatened, and say I want a protective order.  I think 705 provides for that specifically.  And... and, therefore, I'm protected.  I can't imagine why they couldn't do that if they have a... not just a plausible, but a... a good claim that it does violate the Constitution and they need the protection.  Is there any reason they couldn't?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, they wouldn't.  Their point is that the very... availing myself of the administrative remedy will work irreparable harm of... in violation of my constitutional right.  Now, maybe that's not true, but let's imagine it's true.  Then couldn't they go in and ask for a protective order?  I thought that you could do that, but I might be wrong.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  And is there any reason that they shouldn't be able to do that here?  Because they are going to say that... I don't know they ever can make it out in this case, but they are going to say that my having to go ahead with the number... test number 15, which, by the way, may never be threatened, but if it is, it will, the very fact that I have to do it, violate an important constitutional right that I need to have protected before undergoing the text... the test.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You think they could not do that under 705.  So there is a difference between you on that.  As to the statutory claim, I mean, I find... but others may disagree with this.  It's my personal view that the notion of private right of action in this area simply mixes things up.  It's apples and oranges.  It has nothing to do with anything.  That if a person, in fact, is adversely affected or aggrieved by a Government action, he usually, almost always, indeed, can get judicial review eventually.  But what you're saying there I take it is that may be so, but this impliedly says no.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, my question is do we have to decide that.  Because, after all, this individual may get relief through the statutory procedures that you admit are provided by asking for grievance arbitration.  He may, the first time he asks for it, be given a piece of paper that shows him he wasn't hurt.  Or he may have been hurt, and they'll say we don't it again.  There are a lot of things that can happen.  Do we have to decide the issue today of whether if he goes to the union, the union says we won't arbitrate, or they say we will and they lose and it isn't as an unfair labor practice... do we have to decide that issue as to whether a person in those circumstances can then subsequently go into court?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So we have to say the easier matter is it's clear that as to such matters, you must exhaust.  It's so clear that there is no reason for us to decide whether there is an implied repeal of the right at the end of some days to... to judicial review, a matter which is disfavored in the law.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  My... so I don't know why it wouldn't be.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What their brief says is that they can go on a personnel, as opposed to major personnel, to the OSC if, and only if, the complaint has to do with whistleblowing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And this doesn't have to do with whistleblowing.   Stephen G. Breyer  And therefore, even if this were a personnel action, that route to the OSC is not open to them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I want to know what it is you're arguing for.  That is, I... when I get through all these words in the attorneys fees cases, I've got it in my mind that, like the civil rights statute, they say,  ""You normally get fees, unless you shouldn't. ""  All right?  That means you're normally gonna to get 'em.   Stephen G. Breyer  The plaintiff, anyway.  All right?  Then we have a case with a copyright.  The copyright says it's all the way up to the District Court, really, which means a grab bag, and what the particular judge thinks is fair in the instance.  And I guess you could have a rule saying, ""You hardly ever get fees"".  So, in my mind, I got it, ""Well, who knows""?  and,  ""No, you almost always do. ""  or,  ""No, you almost always don't. ""  Now, is that a good characterization?  And what... which one of those three are you arguing for?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know you're not arguing for ""You always don't"".  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  All right. Then, which one do you want?  Do you want the thing--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, if you want ""you always get them"", in the civil liberties cases there is a good policy reason, according to the court, underlying that judgment of how Congress wanted to give this to people to vindicate civil liberties.  I've never heard of a policy of closing the Federal Court door, because if, in fact, you were to have that rule in this case, it would simply discourage people from removing it in cases where they think they have a good claim to remove it, because they'd have to pay huge costs if they were wrong.  So, I'm not aware of any closing doors of Federal Court policy.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I--   Stephen G. Breyer  --unfortunately, I guess, from your position, I don't know what Congress meant here.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Therefore, I'm trying to figure it out in terms of the policy--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --as well as the language.  Okay, in terms of the policy, I'm simply saying that I don't know why you have a better claim than a copyright plaintiff, and I can think of why you don't have as good a claim as a civil rights plaintiff, the reason I said.

And I can imagine Fogerty, where you say,  ""As to an ordinary one, it's ordinary. ""  ""Ordinary"" means it's up to the discretion of the District judge.  And there may be many reasons.  Do we want a third one, where--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --let's say they pass this... and it's ""unusual""?  I mean, we're going to get several categorizations and shadings of statutes.

And the doctor thinks to himself, he thinks, well, immediate abortion, no question, immediately deliver the child.  If I don't, I don't think she's going to die but she'll never have children.

We have aggravating factors and break them down into molecules on a scale, and for every molecule of aggravation here, there is a molecule of mitigation there, so that the juror who is very conscientious ends up with the same number of molecules of equal weight on this scale.  And in our made up instance, Kansas says, if that's the situation, you must say death.  Now, if that's the case, how would you reconcile that with a view of the Eighth Amendment that says if you're going to sentence someone to death, there has to be something special about his case that means it's somewhat worse than the ordinary case because, after all, for every molecule of specialness that warranted death, we have a molecule of mitigation that doesn't?

Breyer  Well, you see, my hypothetical is designed to cut free of the language of the cases.  I have no doubt you can go through the language and show that.  And it's designed to say, but the very point of those cases is you do not send someone to death unless the jury decides that the circumstances here make him somewhat worse, at least one molecule worth of worse, than the typical person.  And given the evenness of the balance, I don't see how we can say that, though I grant you, when you go back to those words in the cases, you're right.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  Do it.  Make the reasoned moral choice.  And the facts are that we have, because of the balancing, molecules or not... we have by the balancing made a determination that anything for the bad that distinguishes this person from the ordinary is... is equally balanced by the good.  Now, make the moral choice.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is the reason?   Stephen G. Breyer  Leaving law out, which I'd like to do, just for the sake of argument, imagine you're a juror, and this is a totally contrived situation, which I think we're deciding... I don't know if there's ever been such a situation... but you're a juror, and you're told the following by a fellow juror,  ""The reason that we have these aggravating circumstances, which are hard to understand here, is, we want to be sure this fellow is, morally speaking, somewhat more deserving of death, in the average. ""  And then he says,  ""And the reason that we have these mitigating circumstances here is because everyone of them means that he's somewhat less moral... he's not as morally undeserving, cuts the other way, it reduces... it makes him less deserving of death, morally speaking. ""  Now, you're the juror, how do you feel about this?  And you say,  ""They're absolutely in balance, absolutely in balance. ""  ""For every fact here on the aggravating side that puts me thinking, morally speaking, he's more deserving of death, there is a mitigating factor which makes me think, morally speaking, he's less deserving of death. ""  ""So, I'm in perfect balance. ""  And your fellow juror says,  ""Now, will you please give me, then, one moral reason why he should be executed? ""  And what's your answer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, but if the law says,  ""You have to be able to give, morally speaking, reason... you have to reason your way towards the moral conclusion that he's deserving of death. ""  --that's why I tried to take the law out of it.  I don't want you to be a lawyer.  I want you to be a juror.  And I want you to give a moral reason--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --why, when this is in equipoise, he is more deserving of death than the average.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well--   ",04-1170
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  They're... they're saying it is appropriate.  They're saying it is appropriate.  We have the people put in the box.  The box is are they in a situation that is different from the average murderer.  Yes.  And they're making the determination that although they're in that box, that morally they're no different.  Morally they're the same--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --because for every factor that makes them morally one way, there's a factor that makes them morally the other way.  So they're different, but they're not morally different.  Now, that's... that's what I think this case presents.  And I... I mean, I imagine a juror who's thinking just what I said.  I don't know if there ever was such a juror, but if there was such a juror, the statute in this instant tells him what to do.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It says where you think there is an equivalent, but not a moral difference, death.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's different from saying not decided.  I thought the Kansas Supreme Court didn't speak of not decided.  I thought it didn't speak in Kleypas about a jury who... a juror who can't make up its... his mind.  I thought it said the jury has made... it assumed the juror has made up his mind.  That's why I think it's artificial.  It says where the jury finds.  It finds equipoise as to the mitigating and aggravating circumstance, then death, that the jury has to find that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's true I... I think, isn't it?  And then the question is, does a State have a right not to do with burden of proof, not to do with anything else, but to have perhaps the artificial situation where the jury finds that the evidence is in equipoise whoever has the burden of proof.  Put it all on you, whoever had it.  That was their final conclusion.  I find it is in equipoise.  Next question, what happens?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, I agree with you.  That's not the problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there--   Stephen G. Breyer  --anything--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Okay, well, what do you say to--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But the difficulty, I think, in the case is, it's artificial.  I think it is.  We're in an artificial situation, and we're imagining those 12 jurors saying they're in equipoise between mitigating and aggravating.  We don't know.  They... even.  All right.  Now, you could look at this as saying,  ""You have to have a reason for thinking these people are... this person is morally worse than the average. ""  And then we imagine some fungible commodity, like moral badness units.  And for every one we go up on the aggravating side, we go down on the mitigating side, so we're back to zero.  And then, some people, like you, are looking at this and saying,  ""See, you're at zero. ""  ""You went up, you went down, so they're no worse than the average. ""  But other people can look at it and say,  ""We'll tell you about... one thing about this individual. ""  ""This is an individual who did do the aggravating things, and he has counterbalancing mitigating things, and that's good enough to separate him out, morally speaking, from somebody who doesn't. ""  Now, my problem is, you either look at it the one way or you look at the other way, and you... and I'm trying to find a reasoned... if you... can... do you want to add anything?   ",04-1170

""  ""No problem there, just whether you have to walk up the steps or don't, and we'll give you a trial down below. ""  Was there... it's the right of access to courthouse, specially?

That is, I don't see how you can say that Lane was not giving... saying it's constitutional to have prophylactic rules.  And that's why I raised the reporter.  I've never heard of a First Amendment right of a paper to send a particular reporter.  I mean, if there's a disabled reporter who couldn't get into the courtroom, I guess they could send a different reporter.  Maybe that's a First Amendment right, but I have not heard of it.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I'd like you to get to the meaning of the Hobbs Act.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I'll try to focus my own thoughts on this by saying two objections to what you're arguing, related, that when they passed the Hobbs Act, it had a section 2, and section 2 said,  ""This is an Act that forbids robbery and extortion, all involving interstate commerce. ""  ""And robbery/extortion involve property. ""  Then it had a section 5.  And section 5 said,  ""This Act forbids physical violence or threats of violence related to section 2. ""  Now, all that happened since then is, there was a recodification.  And the recodification wasn't meant to change anything substantive.  Second and related point Enmons.  For 35 years, working people in this country have thought they had a right to strike, free of the Hobbs Act.  And your interpretation, as the AFL CIO points out, will gut the right to strike.  Now, those are two strong arguments against you, and I'd like to hear your response.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But that's a jurisdictional hook, isn't it?  When you see something in a criminal statute that forbids ""affecting commerce by"", that means that Congress wants to prevent the conduct that will follow the words ""by"", and it needs a jurisdictional hook, so it puts in ""affecting commerce"".  That's how I've always understood the Federal criminal code.  Am I--   Stephen G. Breyer  --wrong in that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Mr.--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I want to give you a chance, because you're quite right in thinking that I'm moved, in large part... or worried, in large part... not about this language, but about the change in Federal criminal law.  And the change in Federal criminal law, if you're right, way beyond this case, would transform virtually every threat of violence made anywhere in the United States into a serious Federal crime.  At the least, it would... and make a major change in threats of violence on the picket line.  And those are two aspects of the same thing.  And I'm worried about the upsetting of expectations way outside the context of this case and making a major change in Federal labor law, for example.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What does it... 1951(c) says what?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but I... then perhaps I... that's an old statute, 1951(c), isn't it?  Is it something brand new?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  What is it--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, the case that interpreted the Hobbs Act, which is Enmons--   Stephen G. Breyer  --seems to rely, for the labor union exemption, on the fact that a threat of violence in effort to obtain legitimate wages is not within the Act.  But if we read ""legitimate wages"" out of the Act, then I guess we would be left with ""the threat of violence"".   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, the... it's not a... that's wrong.  It says ""affect commerce"".   Stephen G. Breyer  And, therefore, we have the instance of any threat of violence that affects commerce becomes a Federal crime subject to 20 years of imprisonment.  And, of course, in today's world, as you know, I believe almost everything affects commerce.  And if I'm even close to being right, this is a major incursion of Federal law, serious criminal Federal law, into what could be fairly minor matters of State criminal law.   INTERRUPTING ",04-1244
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I mean, the question is, I take it, in most of the arbitration associations, once you have arbitration, you will get paid even though... the arbitrator will be paid, won't he, whether--   Stephen G. Breyer  --he decides one way or the other?   Stephen G. Breyer  So he has no particular interest in getting paid in upholding the contract or not.   Stephen G. Breyer  They can logically because they say the arbitration clause, when embedded in a contract that is voidable... i.e., A and B enter into a contract.  B says it's voidable.  I void it.  And there they say, fine, there was a contract and therefore this arbitration clause, which is separable... you go to arbitration.  But if it's void, where B doesn' t have to say I void it, I void it, you never had a contract in the first place.  Now, that is a logical position.   ",04-1264
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  When I was working on the first options in those cases, I thought there was from Southland a pretty clear distinction between whether the person is attacking the arbitration clause itself.  If he says that's not valid, that probably goes to the court, unless there's some other special thing.  But if what he's doing is attacking the rest of the contract as illegal, that doesn't.  That goes to the arbitrator.  Now, I really did think that was the law.  And even if I was wrong in thinking that was the law, it seems to me the whole community, the whole business community in the United States thinks it's the law.  Everybody else thinks it's the law, and the briefs on your side don't even say that it isn' t the law, except for yours.  They say go and overrule the cases that make it the law.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, logically you're right.  I accept all that you're saying logically.  You could make those distinctions, but you also could come out the other way logically.  And so to expose to you what's really bothering me about the case are two things.  One, I think you're worried about consumer contracts, and there are a lot of good arguments on your side.  But this rule also applies to business contracts, and there what's bothering me is that... that the whole business community seems to have developed an arbitration system throughout the world that depends upon the distinction I just made.  And if we decide for you, we're going to throw a large section of those contracts back into the laws of the 50 States and arbitration will be seriously injured as the commercial community has come to rely on it.  Now, that's what's worrying me because I wouldn't want to reach a decision, in the absence of it being clear anyway, that would make a significant negative difference to the gross national product of the United States, for example.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm putting it dramatically because I want to get your--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, what about--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --It's not... the workability of it depends on how many challenges you get to people saying this contract is void, you know.  And if there are a lot of them, then that takes a whole wide set of cases out of arbitration and puts them into the courts, just where they're trying to escape.  And... and so I don't know the answer to how many, to be truthful, and I suspect no one does.  So I'm wondering if there isn't another route to the problem you're getting at, which is, as I think in other countries, you say there's a doctrine of kompetenz kompetenz.  You know that?  You know what I'm thinking of?   Stephen G. Breyer  It's arbitration generally.  They don't even look to see whether people agreed about the arbitration clause.  It says arbitration.  It goes to arbitration regardless.  Now, the safeguard is, A, maybe the arbitrator will get it right or, B, if the arbitrator doesn't get it right, they have to come to court to enforce it.  And at that point, you could say, you know, this arbitrator is out to lunch.  Our cases say he has to be really out to lunch, but you could make some distinctions there, you see.  And... and if this is really a problem that arbitrators are upholding illegal contracts, that might be the place to begin to make the distinctions.  Say, Judge, look at this a little more closely where it's illegal, the whole contract, et cetera.  What do you think?   Stephen G. Breyer  I had thought that the interstate commerce question was like Crowell v. Benson.  You know, it's like a constitutional fact.  And in fact, if you can't... if there's not the constitutional... if there's not the connection with interstate commerce, Congress, at least arguably, would lack the constitutional power to tell the State court what to do in this case.  So it's not as surprising if there is a difference between that kind of fact and the kind of fact that goes to whether the... the contract is void ab initio.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, it is.  It's both.   ",04-1264

Breyer  I don't know what they are.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --they're not there--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

""  ""Quite right. ""  ""We'd like to amend. ""   Stephen G. Breyer  And we don't--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --have to decide--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Why, just out of curiosity... I'm not familiar with the actual practice of a lot of civil cases, but when somebody... let's say the defendant in an ordinary tort case forgets to put in the statute of limitations, and the case is all tried and finished.  At the very end, he says, ""Oh, my God"".  And now he goes in and asks to amend it under Rule 15.  Do judges normally say, ""Fine""?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because it's--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why, though, would we have a special rule in this respect for habeas cases?  Same question I've had throughout.  Treat it like any other civil case.     It's not really a special rule that we're advocating.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, if it's not a special rule, then the answer to this is, just say,  ""No, you don't have to raise it sua sponte. ""  ""Moreover, you cannot raise it sua sponte, except in exceptional circumstances. ""  cite the three cases that said that.  And, as far as you're suggesting it to people, you could do it just as much as you do in any other civil case, no special rule.  If they want to move to amend, fine, end of case, we did it in a paragraph.     The relevant analogy in the civil context is not to what a court would do with a statute of limitations defense in the civil context, it is to what would the court do with respect to an affirmative defense that, like the habeas limitations, implicates broader social interests?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the same with strike suits.  You know, there are a lot of class action strike suits and so forth that at least one group of people think are terrible and the other group think are great.  So, you say,  ""Well, we're going to have a special thing here for amendments in strike suits. ""  ""Have a special amendment for some. ""  --you know, why proliferate law?     Well, the Court recognized... Arizona v. California is an example of the broader social interests that are implicated by the affirmative defense of res judicata.  And the Court noted, in Arizona versus California, that it would be appropriate for the court to raise that defense sua sponte.  And, of course, Plaut versus Spendthrift Farm says the same thing.

The new area of law consists of habeas law involving what is the equivalent of an amendment suggested by the judge to bring up a statute.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose that everything in this case were the same.  Everything is identical except what the court of appeals or the State supreme court holds is that we think under rule 403, which happens to be the rule in our State, the probative value doesn't warrant admissibility in light of the risk of prejudice.  But everything else is the same.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, in your opinion is that constitutional?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what they'll say--   Stephen G. Breyer  --if they want to build it out, is they'll say, look, there... there is DNA evidence here.  It's absolutely conclusive, and all that the light... the... the only doubt of the... the defense has cast on it is they found that there was some opportunity that the police could have tampered with it.  That's true of 60 percent or so of all chain of custody cases, and that is not sufficient to overcome what it shows.  And therefore, it's not worth the jury's time and it'll prove very confusing to the jury.  Now, why would that ruling under 403 be unconstitutional?   Stephen G. Breyer  Good.  Now, that's what I want you to get to.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the key points that suggest that what I just said is not a fair characterization or a correct characterization are?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Your point is that we're quibbling with the language.  Certainly the language can't be right.  I mean, Gregory is quoting America... Am.  Jur.  It's totally right.  And I don't... in my opinion.  I don't see how there's a problem.  It's simply a way to prevent the defendant from confusing the jury with evidence that's not... doesn't have high probative value.  That's... so we--     --I think that's correct.   Stephen G. Breyer  --They don't agree with that necessarily, but I'm taking that as a premise.     I think that's--   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, he describes this, the writer of the opinion, and if I hadn't been guilty of this sin myself, I couldn't criticize others, but he uses language that's absolute.  He says, where there is strong evidence of an appellant's guilt, especially where there's strong forensic evidence, the proffered evidence about a third party's alleged guilt does not raise a reasonable inference as to the appellant's own innocence.  I took that to mean doesn't tend to show that the appellant is innocent.  And you do have to have when faced with guilt.  It's not relevant if it doesn't tend to show he's innocent.  So that wasn't the problem.  The problem is that this sentence is wrong.  You could have incredibly strong evidence that this person is guilty and it could be incredibly strong evidence that the other person did it.     --Absolutely.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so it should come right in.  So what should have been there is the word automatically, the word doesn't automatically show, but the word isn't there.  It doesn't say automatic.     It doesn't--   Stephen G. Breyer  And he goes on to write as if it isn't that automatic.  And he then favors you because he says the standards set out in Gregory and Gay, as if they aren't different.     --That's correct.   Stephen G. Breyer  But the language says they are different.  So what do we do?     And I think we also have to remember that the... the South Carolina Supreme Court was viewing this simply as a matter of State common law.  They weren't looking at it as a matter of Federal constitutional law.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so what do we do?  We get the... we read the opinion literally, and moreover, that's why I asked it.  If you look into the evidence, it looks... you know, maybe it's closer than you might think.  And if we start looking at the evidence in every case in the United States, it's going to be a problem for everybody.  But... but... so what do we do?  That's my question.     I... I think we can look at a much narrower approach that also evolves out of this particular judgment as determined by the trial court.  There was essentially a... a lack of persuasive assurances of trustworthiness in the statements that were, in fact, given.  They lacked corroboration, the particular statements that were alleged to have been given by Jimmy McCaw White, in ways similar to situations where evidence should not be deemed relevantly admissible because of that lack of reliability and trustworthiness.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What do I do in this case?  I'm totally with you if I read American Jurisprudence and others as saying the following.  Judge, there's a particular kind of evidence that really has a tendency to mislead the jury, that's that somebody else did it because they start trying the other person in their minds.  So if you have a strong case that this guy did it, don't let them even introduce that evidence unless you have some reason to think it's really going to show this guy didn't do it.  That's what it's saying, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, that gets us through Gregory.

Breyer  As you're defining it.  As you're defining.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  Then you're talking about patents where the person who paid for the attorney went to the Patent Office and so forth.  That was just a mistake.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But then are you relying on that, the existence of valueless patents?   Stephen G. Breyer  If you're going beyond that, which patents are you talking about?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I see.   ",04-1329
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that, I would think, would be one of the strongest cases for not having a per se rule because if, in fact, you have a justification, in terms of sharing risk with a new product, that would be one of the cases where you would expect to find a tie.  And... and so I'm not really very persuaded by the effort to draw a wedge between requirements and other things.  But what I do find very difficult about this case is... you can see from what I'm saying... that at the bottom, I think there are cases where tying is justified.  But the way to attack that would be to say here, here, and here it's justified and that would have to do with the tied product.  It would abolish the per se rule, making it into a semi per se rule.  But here, we're attacking a different thing.  We're attacking the screen, which is a... the tying product.  Now there, that's just a screen.  And... and so I'm... I'm not certain whether attacking the screen and insisting on a higher standard of proof is better than nothing or whether you should say, well, leave the screen alone and let's deal with the tied product on the merits.  That I think is what Justice Stevens was getting at too.  And... and I'm... I'm not being too clear.  You understand where I'm coming from, and I... I want you to say what you want about that.  But that's what's bothering me here.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  This case isn't what's bothering me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that isn't so.  I mean, you could have a patent that was valueless or didn't itself confer very much, but the person is trying to establish the market for the product.  It's a component, and he attaches this tied product as a counting device knowing that if it's successful, everybody makes money, and if it's not successful, he and everybody else lose.  That's... that's the kind of justification.  And that could happen with--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Let me be more specific.  A person has a patent on an item in a machine.  This is a great machine.  It's fabulous.  We've all had friends who have tried to get us to invest in such machines.  We don't know what it does, nor does anyone.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  To tie something to the great machine.   Stephen G. Breyer  Correct, if it takes off.   Stephen G. Breyer  If it takes off, everybody will be rich, and if it doesn't take off, who cares.  Now--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --that could happen.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And there often does, I guess.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'll put this machine in your store for a penny.  A penny.   Stephen G. Breyer  By the way, a penny and you have to buy marvelous component.  And by the way, if it takes off, you'll buy a lot of marvelous component, and if not, not.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let me try this again, and I'm thinking of a way of saying this more clearly.  This is my actual dilemma.  If I decide this case against you in my view... and suppose it came out that way... I would be concerned lest there be a lot of big companies in the technology area that have real market power in tying products and get people... and they extend that power through a tie into a second market and thereby insulate themselves from attack.  I would be afraid of that really happening, and everything gets mixed up in a war of experts in a technology area about do we have the power, don't we have the power, who knows.  If I decide this case in your favor, I would then be afraid that particularly in the patent area, there will be lots of instances where new technology, uncertain technology, uncertain new technology, does not get off the ground because a very easy way to finance the risk through a requirements contract, for example, so that we make the money if the product succeeds, because people buy the required product at a higher price.  That will never happen.  And patents is an area where new technology is particularly at risk.  So I see a problem both ways, and I'm really not certain what to do.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean, once you start that, then you're saying that... which I thought was the... I would have agreed with the dissent... the concurrence in... in Jefferson Parish, but that's not the law.  And so now what you're saying is, well, we have to go and really make that the law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you're going to give me... if you're going... well.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There are no... I thought we were just talking about several.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Price discrimination, I gather, sometimes good, sometimes not.  If it pushes out sales--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --on the low side, it's good.  If it just extracts profits on the high side, it's bad.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And so I think most economists... in fact, everyone I've ever read agrees with that.   ",04-1329
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I can understand, I think, what a teaching is.  I take it a teaching is you put all the prior art... that's what I guess that's what Judge Rich explained, which I thought was very enlightening to me in I can't remember the name of the case, Wigmore, Winsmore--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Winslow.  You put it all around the room.  All right, we've got it all around the room, and I begin to look at it and if I see over that it somehow teaches me to combine these two things, if it says, Breyer, combine this and that, that's a teaching and then it's obvious.  Now, maybe it doesn't have the teaching, it just has the suggestion.  Maybe it says, we suggest you combine this or that; okay, then it's obvious.  But I don't understand, though I've read it about 15 or 20 times now, I just don't understand what is meant by the term ""motivation"".   Stephen G. Breyer  I tried.  You've read a lot of cases.  You're a patent lawyer, and so what is the understanding as best you have it of what is just meant by the term ""motivation""?  To be more specific, if they mean motivated to go look to the prior art, well, anybody would want to look in the prior art.  If I want to invent something I'll look anywhere.  I'll look to the prior art.  I'll look to the Library of Congress.  I'll look to my cousin.  I mean, I'll look wherever I can find it.  So they can't mean that, and if they don't mean that what do they mean?   Stephen G. Breyer  Say that again?  You wouldn't have a motivation to look to the prior art to find your problem.  What's an example where you have a motivation distinguishing you from everybody else?  I mean, everybody has a motivation to look to the prior art.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right person to ask.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine, that's fine.   ",04-1350
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if that's all it means, why don't they say it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then what is this word that confused me a lot, motivation?  I found a lot of enlightenment in Judge Rich's idea of taking all the relevant art and putting it up around the room in pictures.  And then I thought, well, okay, if that art teaches me to do what your client did, okay, it doesn't.  Does it suggest it?  Not really.  Well then, you say motivated.  Where does that get you?   Stephen G. Breyer  For who?  For me?   Stephen G. Breyer  For me the inventor?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know that, because otherwise--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That's true.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You look at that thing, you think what this genius did, and I don't doubt that he's a genius, is there are wheels that turn around.  And the wheels turn around to a fixed proportion to when you make the accelerator go up and down.  Now I think since high school a person has known that if you have three parts in a machine and they each move in a fixed ratio one to the other, you can measure the speed of any part by attaching a device to any other as long as you know these elementary mathematics.  I suppose it wasn't Mr. Engelgau, it was probably Archimedes that figured that one out.  So he simply looks to something that moves, and he sticks a sticker on it.  Now to me, I grant you I'm not an expert, but it looks at about the same level as I have a sensor on my garage door at the lower hinge for when the car is coming in and out, and the raccoons are eating it.  So I think of the brainstorm of putting it on the upper hinge, okay?  Now I just think that how could I get a patent for that, and that... now that's very naive, that's very naive.  But the point is, I don't see what we're talking about, and what is supposed to happen with all these affidavits.  And the... the... Mr. Asano himself, I would think at some point when the Ford company decides to switch to electronic throttles, of course will have every motivation in the world to do precisely what your client did, because he can't use that thing that pulls back and forth anymore.  Rather, he has to get a little electronic cap and attach it to something that moves in fixed proportion to the accelerator going up and down.  Now those are my whole reactions when I saw this and I began to think it looks pretty obvious.  What's supposed to go on, I don't understand it.   Stephen G. Breyer  As you know, we've had a series of cases and in these series of cases we have received many, many briefs from all kinds of organizations and there are many from various parts of the patent bar that defend very much what the Federal circuit does and there are many from parts of the patent bar and others who are saying basically that they've leaned too far in the direction of never seeing a patent they didn't like and that has unfortunate implications for the economy.  So if you're going to these very basic deep issues, is there a reason for me to think, which I do now think, that there is a huge argument going on in those who are interested in patent as to whether there is too much protectionism and not enough attention paid to competition or whether it's about right, or whether it goes some other way.  In other words, your argument now suggests all this is well settled, but I tend to think maybe it isn't well settled and maybe it is a proper thing for us to be involved in.  So what are your views since you brought it up?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't have to go on top.  It's just to say what you've been saying, that what you're supposed to look to ultimately is whether a person, as the statute says, who is familiar with the subject, of ordinary skill in the art, whether to such a person this would have been obvious.  Now, there are many, and this Court has listed several, factors that might count in favor of it not being obvious, such as people have been trying to do it for a long time and they haven't been able to figure out how.  That's a good one, and there are some other ones here.  If there's a teaching right there, it seems to cut the other way.  But to hope to have a nonexclusive list seems to me a little bit like Holmes trying to hope to have an exclusive list of what counts as negligence.  In the law we have many standards that you can get clues about, but you can't absolutely define them, and why isn't this one of them?   Stephen G. Breyer  Supposing we then were to say exactly what this Court already said, that the standard here is obvious, we list a few of these additional factors that they've thrown in, and just as the Court said before, all these additional factors are there.  They can be considered in an appropriate case, but it is important to remember that the ultimate matter which is for the judge is to apply the word ""obvious"" or not in light of the evidence and what the experts say and the facts as found by a jury or whoever is the factfinder.  Would you have any objection to an opinion like that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is it basically an invention where in fact there are only four or five moving parts on the thing that we have seen, every one of the moving parts is moving with a fixed ratio to the accelerator going up and down, as it must be because they're also moving in fixed ratio with the throttle thing coming out.  And so, whichever of those four that you figured out you were going to attach it to, it's obvious, isn't it, that you have to attach it either to the pedal or to the throttle thing that comes out, or to a part of the machine that moves in fixed ratio to the movements of one of those two?  Now, that's what I would find fairly obvious.  Why isn't that obvious?   Stephen G. Breyer  And it so quickly modified itself.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm sorry.  Doesn't the axis turn?   Stephen G. Breyer  Isn't there an axis, and the axis turns?   Stephen G. Breyer  The pivot rotates?   ",04-1350
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Sorry.  I have laryngitis.  Can you hear me all right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why is it retroactive validation?  I would have thought Segura and those cases are Silverthorne cases.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All that it is is it's an independent chain of events.   Stephen G. Breyer  An independent chain of events that almost certainly would have led to the discovery of the evidence despite... not without... despite the unlawful entry.  And if that's so, all we have is a... is a set of cases where deterrence is most unlikely to play any significant role because no policeman could possibly counter that kind of thing getting the evidence in--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But that's... that's actually what's disturbing me about this, because I thought the knock and announce rule was a rule that would allow a policeman to go in without knocking and announcing when he has reasonable grounds for thinking he might get shot if he didn't.  So, I... as I read the briefs, I thought maybe that's not how it's being implemented, that the policemen are supposed to run the risk of being shot.  I didn't think that was the situation.  So, I'd appreciate your explaining that to me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Would it be sufficient if the officer says,  ""One, this is a drug gang; two, they don't let people into the house whom they don't know; and, three, they have guns? ""   ",04-1360
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, now you're talking about other cases in other courts.  I looked through with my law clerks 300 cases since Weeks, not Mapp, Weeks.  That's what we're talking about, 1914.  I couldn't find in 300 cases one single Supreme Court case that did not suppress evidence where there was a Fourth Amendment violation with one exception.  The exception is there are sets of cases where deterrence is really not a factor.  For example, good faith; for example, it isn't going into a criminal proceeding.  Okay?  Now, what I'd like you to do is to tell me if I missed some, which is certainly possible, or second, if you want us to change the rule and go back 300 years or 300 cases back before 1914, or are you going to tell us that deterrence doesn't play a role here or whatever you want?  I want to put to you the state of the art as far as I can see it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, there's a causal connection absolutely here.  It is a but for connection.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  This person being in the room and a child of 2 would know that if you get into a room, as a result of your being in that room, you're likely to find evidence.  So it's both but for and it fits within the problem.  There we are.  That's the same, by the way, as it is with making a false oath to a magistrate.  You make a false oath to a magistrate.  That permits the magistrate to get into the house with... the policeman gets in there with a warrant.  It doesn't take the court long to suppress that.  About a second.  And... and how... how is this somehow different?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  He read Segura.  We read Segura, which happens to be a case--   Stephen G. Breyer  --He is not... well--   Stephen G. Breyer  --important exception.  The exception which comes from Silverthorne is when there is an independent chain of events such that it will be... not could be, but would be... in fact, discovered anyway, despite the unlawfulness... Silverthorne... Holmes says, of course, you don't keep it out then because that's not going to impact deterrence.  Now, that's Segura.  That's Silverthorne.  That's case after case.  Of course, I accept that.  And if you can show that this case somehow fits within that chain, fine.  Then I... then I maybe appear I have my mind made up on this, but I'm open to change.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  That's... I... I understand that point from your brief and I'm glad that you brought it up.  But I have never... I have never seen Fourth Amendment matters cut that finely.  I have never seen the courts say I want to go back to the reason why this policeman is unlawfully in the room and then try to connect each piece of evidence with that reason.  Rather, they ask is he unreasonably and unconstitutionally in the room.  So my concern about that, which I'd like you to address, is if we took that approach, I think we'd be doing it for the first time, and we'd let a kind of computer virus loose in the Fourth Amendment.  I don't know what the implications of that are.  I can't tell you what you're saying is illogical.  It's not illogical.  It's conceivable, but it strikes me as risky and unprecedented.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's common, when you have a chain of causal connection, to say it ends somewhere.  It's common, and in Harris, it ended once they left the home and now they're over in the station.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  This isn't over in the station.  This is in the home.  You speak of interests, but this doesn't interests.  What about Boyd?  I mean, the most famous statement in Fourth Amendment history to all invasions on the part of the government and its employees of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life.  It is not the breaking of his doors and the rummaging of his drawers that constitutes the essence of the offense.  But it is the invasion of his indivisible right of personal security, personal liberty, and private property.  Now, I thought... 1886... that's what's governed these cases for about 100... and far more, a century and a half or a quarter.  And... and the... then suddenly you say, well, it's this interest in the one or the other one.  I mean, doesn't that describe it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Correct?  I'm sorry.  That is correct?  I... I thought that this warrant does not say you can enter the house without knocking.  I mean, I have a warrant.  This warrant lets me search the house in daytime.  I search it in nighttime.  Is my search authorized?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I have a warrant--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --What... what happens with my example?  I'm curious.  That's not a rhetorical question.  I have a warrant which says, search 1618 5th Street.  I search 1518 5th Street.  Was it a warrant... a warrant back search?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't have a warrant to search 1518.  I don't have a warrant that allows me to come in in the middle of the night when it says day, and I don't have a warrant here that allows me to come in without knocking.  So where's the warrant?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, how is that different from saying the entry is lawful, its only problem is, it was done without a warrant?  I mean, you know, he's--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --inside the building; just, unfortunately, the means wasn't right.  No warrant.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The means wasn't right.  No knock and announce.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, in fact--   Stephen G. Breyer  --if they had a bazooka--   Stephen G. Breyer  --And the same would be true if what they had was a bazooka, and blew the house up.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, I see your argument now.  I think your argument is, most of the fourth amendment rules are really designed to prevent warrantless entries.  But this one isn't.   Stephen G. Breyer  This one is designed to prevent damage to property--   Stephen G. Breyer  --et cetera.  So, let's not have the exclusionary rule and rely on the damage remedy where that kind of thing actually occurs, which isn't often.   Stephen G. Breyer  And if we buy that principle, suppose we were to apply it in the Miranda area... purpose of a Miranda warning is really to make certain he can have a lawyer, if he wants one, for example.  So, now we prove this guy wouldn't have asked for a lawyer anyway.  All the evidence comes in.  I mean, it's an interesting principle.  I see the logic.  But it seems to me to have a lot of implications that this Court has never bought.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I can't think of any other area, fifth or fourth, where we've bought it.  And I've tried to explain, in the question, why we haven't bought it.  Now, you go ahead.   Stephen G. Breyer  It depends, of course, on whether you... what you're doing.  Now I see what you're doing.  You're applying a kind of Palsgraf causation analysis within the risk... I think that's what you're doing... to saying it's outside, it's not a cause.  You're saying... you don't say it's not a necessary condition of his being there.  It is.  You do say,  ""Well, the being in the room there is not within the risk, the reason for which we have a knock and announce rule. ""  But, of course, that's a matter of judgment.  I mean, you could say the purpose of the cause... of the knock and announce rule is to keep people out of there without knocking and announcing.  And if that's the purpose of it, it's right within the risk, right cause.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You just are looking at the harms that his being there in that room without announcing might bring about.  That doesn't mean that's why we don't have the rule.  We have the rule to keep him out of there without announcing.   Stephen G. Breyer  So, you do--   Stephen G. Breyer  --No, no--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --the difference is--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right, look, this... you know, I'd appreciate your explaining this... this seems to me what you're saying in your brief was the inevitable discovery.  The inevitable discovery rule, in my... the way... the way I've thought of it, and I'd like you to correct me if I haven't thought of it correctly... to use a kind of analogy, it's like a primitive tribe that beats a tomtom every morning so the sun comes up.  Hey, the sun's going to come up anyway, and the bodies are going to be discovered anyway, in those cases.  And, in Segura, the warrant is going to be issued anyway.  So, it isn't a question of whether it would have been issued if they had behaved properly, it's a question of what will really happen in the absence of the illegality.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, that's what I thought inevitable discovery here was, and, in the absence of these people entering the apartment illegally, they wouldn't have found a thing, because--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --there was nothing else in motion.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, which--   Stephen G. Breyer  --case is contrary to what I said?   Stephen G. Breyer  Segura?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You have just said--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that, in Segura, they would have gotten in, anyway, under a legal warrant that had nothing whatsoever to do with the illegal entry.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The sun rose, anyway.

I see that... then what's worrying me is this, that... one thing worrying me is that... let's take an ordinary buyer case.  All right?  And what happened is that the... some buyers would like to bring a fraud suit in Federal court.  They have to go to Federal court now.  They can't go to the State court.  But they have a little brainstorm, or the lawyers do, and they say,  ""Well, in any case where a buyer would have a claim, and we don't want to go into Federal court, there surely are going to be a class of holders that would also have the kind of claim you say. ""  So, there we are, same actions, all in the State court, just happens to have found a different class of claimant.  And there always will be such a class.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's fine.  And I--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and what I'm not facing, in the antitrust area, is what, it seems to me, on your interpretation now, would be, Congress passes a law, which becomes a futile act, because what they're anxious is... to do is to get the cases in the class actions... not all the cases... but the class actions in the Federal court.  And then, in every single case, or 99.9999 percent, where we've kept this action out of Federal court, there's going to be a comparable action, with holders as the plaintiff, in a State court.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what... that's a... my concern.  What do you--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Can you... can you ease my concern there?  Is there anything you can say that could ease my concern that we'll have the same set, that they'll just be in State court with a different class?   Stephen G.

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  That's just--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --But why, in your theory... suppose you're right.  I mean, you're right.  I assume that.  You can have these holder claims.  But why couldn't any buyer, who's... has to go to Federal court because he has the buyer claim, just say, ""I'll bring a holder claim""?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know.  But what I'm asking is, What's the logic of that?  I mean, you're either right or you're wrong.

But that's the trouble.  Because, in order to make the Second Circuit's argument, you have to say the following,  ""Congress couldn't have intended to allow people who have a buyer claim to make a totally separate holder claim, because that would gut the statute, and they wouldn't want to engage in a futile act. ""  But now you're asking us to do about the same thing, when you talk about a person who doesn't have the buyer claim and you're trying to get us to say,  ""Congress thought... Congress thought an individual action there, their own separate action in the State court, wasn't good enough; it would have wanted to preserve the... hold your claim for them.

Stephen G. Breyer  I mean when this particular--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --provision was passed--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --a week later, he goes to a lawyer, and the lawyer says,  ""You'd better get out of here fast, because if you're caught while you're here, you're married now, and you won't be able to take advantage of that. ""  ""It would be terrible. ""  ""So, go to Mexico. ""  ""Then there is no problem. ""  And if, in fact, I'm right, you see what I'm... I find your argument excellent on the first part, but so is the Government's.  So, I think there's a kind of wash there, so I'm looking to the second part.  And there, you're just said, it attaches new consequences to old behavior.  So, I'm asking you, if it doesn't attach the new consequences to old, but, necessarily, plus new behavior... namely, remaining.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Being... if you get married... if you're outside the country and you marry an American, you're married to an American and you can't come in for 5 years?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  As a result of--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --the initial deporting order.   Stephen G. Breyer  So, his choice is this Act or... in which case, you never can get back, if you're caught... or go to Mexico, wait 5 years.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Ten to 20 years?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I mean, he either stays in the United States--   Stephen G. Breyer  --in 10 to 20 years--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Is caught.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you lose this--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --case... if you lose this case, then his choice would be, stay here, get caught, and you never can come back, or 10 to 20 years?   Stephen G. Breyer  I see.   Stephen G. Breyer  Or go to Mexico, and you can come back in 5 years.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, a person who just leaves voluntarily, having reentered illegally, cannot come back for 5 years, no matter what, under 1156(a)(6)(B).   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That was repealed.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING ",04-1376
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I... but I... I didn't understand this now.  I guess I don't.  Forget the '94/'96 periods.   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose it had stayed the same throughout.  Would you say, then, that someone who came illegally into the country, and he's caught, and he's married to an American, there's no possibility he can stay, no matter what, no matter how appealing?  Is that the answer?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm... yes, but you're talking technically.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe there's--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --some other way you could stay.  What's the other way?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Which was what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Well--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --then it comes to the--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --same thing.  So, that... what I'm thinking is that a person who is here, and they marry an American... all right +/?  they marry a citizen.  Now, before this Act was passed, there was a way that if they're really good... let's assume they're the best human beings around, and the attorney general finds all that out, and everybody knows this is like a saint, and they say,  ""Okay, you behave well enough. ""  ""You can stay. ""  Now, after the Act is passed, all those relevant actions have taken place in '86, long before.  Now, there's absolutely nothing they can do.  All they can do is go home.  And now I've learned that when they go home, they will be told,  ""You cannot come back, no matter what, for 5 years. ""  Now, that's a pretty harsh consequence, to separate yourself from your family or have your family come to a foreign country.  So, if I think the first part of this is a wash, you have a great argument, they have a great argument, and I look to the second part, does it attach new consequences to old and unchangeable behavior?  I say, yes, it sure does.  Now, why doesn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Ah.  So, then, you're saying the answer I got before was wrong--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --that, in fact--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I now have my client in, he's come after IIRIRA has been enacted, and he says,  ""I've heard about this in IIRIRA, and what in heaven's name am I supposed to do? ""  And the lawyer says,  ""Get out fast, next train. ""  ""Go back. ""  ""And if you get across that border, you're safe. ""  ""Because at that point, you can apply; and you're a saint, and you've been married, they'll let you right in, because they'll find out. ""  That's what your view of the law is.   Stephen G. Breyer  It must be the one way or the other.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, in... and this is not... I was saying the question--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --would be, Is this Act attaching consequences to old things that you couldn't do anything about?  And you're saying,  ""Not entirely. ""  ""You can. ""  ""You can leave. ""  ""In which case, you'll be no worse off, except for the train fare. ""   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING ",04-1376
1,NO QUESTIONS,04-1414
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't see--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  I... I have a question that you could just clarify a confusion.  You want to bring into this case the question of whether or not anticipatory warrants are ever valid.  I had a case in the First Circuit where I explained my view on that.  I thought they would be reasonably described.  So I don't know if that issue should be brought up here.  Maybe.  I can't figure out what issue should be brought up here.  There's a Van Treska case that says we ought to read these things in a common sense fashion.  All right?  I read it.  My common sense says I have a warrant here.  It says nothing about anticipatory anything.  It says you can go and search for any of 16 items, 14 of which are in his house well before the delivery.  After all, he's had all this correspondence with these people about child pornography.  They have terrific reason for thinking he might have some.  And that's all it says.  And then it says, is there probable cause for a warrant that says go in any time now and search for any of these items, including what will be delivered, if that's when you do it?  I say I look at the probable cause.  His probable cause is he thinks that another package is being delivered, and he's right to think it.  Now, whether it is delivered or not doesn't add anything really to the issuance of the warrant.  It might add to his personal confidence.  But that's my common sense opinion.  The common sense is the only question here is do they have probable cause to issue a warrant that allows them to search now, because that's what it says.  So now how... how, given that... I grant you the Ninth Circuit went into all kinds of other things, but you explain to me, please, how I'm supposed to reach those other things and what I'm supposed to do, and why I'm wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, no, it's not supported.  It's specific.  It says go to Jeffrey Grubbs' residence and then it has an attachment A which describes it with great specificity.  And go and search for and seize the records and materials described in attachment B, and then we have 16 different kinds of items with great specificity.  That's it.  That's the end of this warrant, and that's what it says to do, and that's what he did.  And then he has a different affidavit which gives him the probable cause for issuing the warrant I just described.   Stephen G. Breyer  Where does it say that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I'm reading the warrant.  I'm not reading the affidavit.  It happens to say that the affidavit is... that that affidavit is... it's in appendix A, appendix B, but it doesn't say anything about going in on... where does it say that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It says... mine says, you may command to search on or before April 27th for 10 days the person/place named and make the search in the daytime between 6:00 and 10:00.  That's what mine says.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then there's an affidavit about probable cause.  That's true.  So--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --What's not stated?   Stephen G. Breyer  Where is there a limit?   Stephen G. Breyer  It is?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is it that tells us that?  I just happened to read an affidavit where the... the person says that he won't enter until this package is there, but there are a lot of cause I would think--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well... well, he says in his affidavit he's not going to execute it until this package is delivered, but that... if I read it in a common sense way, say, of course, he isn't going to because he wants to get everything at once.  But after all, he's in the place.  I would say there's a lot of probable cause for him to looking for 12 of these items which are there whether this package is there or not.  Of course, he's not going to execute it till later.   Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe that's the answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  Will you... will you just help me with this?  Justice Stevens answered my question.  The word anticipatory.  The word anticipatory does suggest it isn't valid for a while.  Nothing else in the warrant does.  What am I supposed to do if I think there's adequate probable cause for issuing that warrant right now in respect to 12 of the things?  And it's really pretty hard for me to try to understand what this warrant is about if I'm supposed to understand it, by reading through about 15 or 20 pages of small print and there discovering somewhere in the back of it some... the post office says I'm not going to execute this until this other package gets there too.  Now, that does make me nervous.  That... that supports you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I understand that, but it's not going to support you enough unless you connect this anxiety I'm having now about this being buried in page 28 of an affidavit when it's an important condition of the warrant, the only clue to that fact being the word anticipatory.  And there we are.  Now, you tell me why this anxiety, which is going to help you, is connected to something in the law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, please don't.  I start with an assumption that an anticipatory warrant is constitutionally valid.  I start with that assumption.  I'm assuming that the conditions have to reasonably describe.  My anxiety is resting only on the fact that this warrant doesn't seem to be an anticipatory warrant but for one word, and to know what it's about, you have to look through 28 pages of fine print.  Now, you connect that anxiety to something in the law.   ",04-1414
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  How did they find him, by the way?   Stephen G. Breyer  --how in your opinion?   Stephen G. Breyer  How did they find him?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I'm not saying how did they?  How in your opinion should the Post Office Department or the government have found him?   Stephen G. Breyer  So they find 13 people called Gary Jones or G. Jones in Little Rock.  Now, what do they do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  His wife is living in the house?   Stephen G. Breyer  Were they divorced?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So he owns the house.  She doesn't.  She must not pay any taxes, and she sees these letters coming from him registered and says, oh, they're his problem.  That's basically what could have happened.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you have that kind of relationship with your wife, doesn't he have an obligation to watch what's going on?   Stephen G. Breyer  Did they leave a notice?   ",04-1477
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe this day... in today's world, a registered letter is worse than ordinary mail.  That is, I don't think... my understanding is that the post office, unlike FedEx and unlike UPS, if you're not home, they leave a... a notice, you know, and you check a box, and if you check the box, they'll leave it off the next day.  We don't live in a... my wife isn't home.  My wife works.  And... and most wives no longer stay home to get the mail, and we don't all have butlers at the door.  And you call up the post office.  They say, oh... if you get through to a human being, which takes 15 minutes, after you go through the menu, they say, phone the post office branch.  And they say go get in the car, find a parking place, get in the line, and there's half a morning gone.  Now, why is that a reasonable way?  Why can't they do what FedEx does?  This is a world... husband works, wife works, two children are screaming.  We've got to get them to the doctor.  We have to have them at school.  They have appointments all morning, and there's nobody home.  So whatever they did with Mullane and said registered mail is fine, why isn't it unreasonable to use that system rather than use FedEx's system?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why not?  It says calculated.  It may be.  Now, you tell me why it's so remarkable because I think I could take judicial notice of what life is like for most families in the world today, that they don't have butlers, et cetera.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Wait.  Let... let them do that.  Fine.  Just have a little box and the person signs and says, tomorrow leave it at the house, just like FedEx does.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  See what you think of this.  If in fact the letter--   Stephen G. Breyer  --No, we skip that.  What about... you know, I was thinking precisely the same, but just with slightly... if you get the letter back and you don't have the FedEx rule, you either have to have the FedEx rule or send a letter.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, because the purpose is to get reasonably calculated to get notice, and in the world today, there are an awful lot of houses where nobody is home, you know, and there's no convenient way for them to go to the post office without giving up a certain amount of work.  And so they say, forget it.  If it comes from the lands division or something, who cares?  Now, that... I don't know how you'd know how many there are like that, but it's a question of reasonable calculation now to get the mail through.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is it a tiny minority--   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but redeliver... you have to be there to sign for it again.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Well, then... then the problem--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm thinking... what I'm thinking is that where... where you're trying to reach a person, the means has to be reasonably calculated.  I'm simply saying a means today is not reasonably calculated to reach the average person unless it gives him the choice of getting it when he's not home.  All right?  Now, there are two ways that could happen.  One, you could modify that form or, second, the simple rule would be if it comes back undelivered, mail them a letter.   Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't say all that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I said do either.  What I... what I was thinking of, which isn't clearly I think coming across, is send it certified mail, by all means.  Fine.  He either has to sign and say, leave it off tomorrow, I'm not home, or if the post office doesn't make that available, then if the letter comes back undelivered, the person who's trying to send him notice has to send him an ordinary letter.   INTERRUPTING ",04-1477
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But you really want three things.  You say we want the protection, number one, of there... if you're... if there's probable cause, that's the end of it.  Number two, if you're trying to show there wasn't probable cause, you have to bear clear and convincing evidence, and number three, we also have qualified immunity.  And I guess, number four, you have to prove the whole thing by clear and convincing evidence.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It sounds a little bit like the person who has the overcoat, turns up the heat, you know, five or... what about one?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about this one?  And I want to know... you simply say you need clear and convincing evidence that that was the motive and it wouldn't have been brought otherwise.  And the existence of probable cause is a strong factor, maybe even a presumption, that suggests to the contrary.  Now, have States and other places tried things like that without the world collapsing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So as far as you know, every State and every jurisdiction where... and investigators if they don't have absolutely immunity, whatever... in all those jurisdictions, nobody has ever said that even a constitutional violation, if there's probable cause, that's the end of it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, I'm not focusing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I want to know--   Stephen G. Breyer  --if--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --We have no experience.  We don't know.  Okay.  As your... as far as you can tell.  The other question I have, which you might want to be brief about, is in looking through this record, as far as I could see from the briefs, they went ahead and prosecuted this man with only two pieces of evidence.  The first evidence was that he tore some pages out of his notebook.  But he introduced lots of notebooks to show he always tore pages out when he gave them to his secretary.  And the second was that he told some witnesses be very careful and answer the question.  Now, you know, he said a few other things, but they all seemed like the kind of things that people would always say to witnesses.  Now, if that's the only evidence, except for the fact he owns the company, how is there probable cause here?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I didn't see any in the brief.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I saw a lot about other people in the brief, but not about him.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There are all kinds of things about other people.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I would like you to limit yourself to what I didn't concede.  I concede it's his company.  I concede that he tore some pages out of his notebook, and I concede that he told... which he did a lot of times.  And I concede that he told witnesses answer the question, et cetera.  Now, is there anything else connecting him, not his company?   ",04-1495
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  If it is applied here, I... I thought we just granted question one.  There were two in the cert petition.  I... my notes say we just granted question one.  And that means what they have is the screen.  We're going to screen out absolutely any such claim as yours if there is probable cause.  Now, the reason they advance for doing that is that in the... a reason is in the absence of a screen like that, here's what's going to happen.  Every single case... not every one, but millions of cases or thousands, anyway... involving companies... well, companies are going to Congress all the time.  They have ads all the time.  They run into agency hostility all the time.  The Hell's Angels?  That's a pretty unpopular defendant.  They say things all the time that investigators disagree with.  And what will happen is in a vast number of cases the defendant will decide to bring a Bivens action, particularly if he gets off, and then we'll have discovery and we'll look into every statement that the... the investigator made to the prosecutor, and before you know it, we have a nightmare of tort cases.  And they say that's unfortunate to cut off a claim like yours, but after all, the prosecutors totally cut them off because they have absolute immunity.  Now, we're saying at least let's restrict them, where investigators are involved, to cases where it turned out there was no probable cause, otherwise the criminal process itself will be seriously injured.  Now, I take it that's the argument.  I'd like to hear your reply.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, but are you going to... I mean, is there any light you could shed?  And that's why I asked in my question initially.  I thought maybe there were some jurisdictions somewhere that... that survive without the rule they want, but maybe I'm wrong.  And... and how do I judge this?  I would be concerned.  I don't... the... after all, these other cases you mentioned are civil tort cases and... and they don't involve the criminal process.  And when we get into criminal prosecutions, we have rules on selective prosecution that are designed to screen out all but the very worst.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's what he's arguing for here.   Stephen G. Breyer  Leaving... is there anything you can say before I give up on this?  And maybe the answer is no.  Is there anything you can say that would relieve my concern, which is completely practical at the moment, that if I decide in your favor, there suddenly are going to be large numbers of criminal cases where defendants will say the reason I was prosecuted was because of something I said?  I was advocating motor cycles.  I was advocating beating people up.  I was advocating a congressional change of something.  Many, many such cases.  They'll all get at least discovery, and the prosecutor's door will become open to the world.  Now, that's what's concerning.  Can you say anything to relieve that concern?   Stephen G. Breyer  So he's a witness.  Suppose his testimony--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Suppose that the person is convicted.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Can you bring your Bivens claim anyway?   Stephen G. Breyer  Really?  So that's a... but it's not a civil case.   Stephen G. Breyer  So you say that if he's convicted, after all, he may have been convicted but it may be because of the retaliatory motive.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So you... so you say--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --if he's convicted, that's the end of it--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --whether there was a retaliatory motive or not.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, that's 1983.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So what he does is he--   Stephen G. Breyer  --he brings his action and he says here I am 20 years in prison and I agree I'm guilty, but they never would have prosecuted me without the fact that they hate the Hell's Angels and they, in fact, criticize everything that we say.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  He's saying I was... I was guilty, but the... all right.  Anyway--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I won't force you into that.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'll take basically virtually never if he's convicted.  They concede that you could bring this kind of action if there's no probable cause.  So we're talking about that range where there was probable cause but acquittal.  That's what we're talking about here.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you're... you're in the cases, but I'm... I'm trying to pursue this.  You've given me another idea--   Stephen G. Breyer  --which is I would like to say one word about this.  I'm sorry to interrupt your train of thought here, but look.  I'm looking for other screens.  Is there... is there... the particular point that they're worried about is you say we want to establish the retaliatory motive.  That's what's worrying them because they see, in that establishment of the retaliatory motive, discovery, and discovery means you not only talk to the investigators, but you're also talking to, as a witness, the prosecutors to find out who said what to whom in order to see if you could establish that they didn't like the speech of the defendant.  Now, can you give me any screen, not your case, but any kind of a screen that will help--   Stephen G. Breyer  --weed out the sheep from the lambs--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --the goats from the sheep or whatever--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --in that area?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But that... that's true.  I now think we're making some progress.  I don't think it is quite a qualified immunity.  I think it's possible and don't... I'm putting words in your mouth and deny them if I am.  One, he's convicted, no case.  Two, no probable cause, everybody agrees there's a case.  Three, now there is probable cause, but he's acquitted.  Okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  In that circumstance, suppose you say we cannot even allow discovery.  You don't even get to discovery on your retaliatory motive unless you show clearly, question mark, or unless you show likely, question mark, that the investigator not only retaliated, but he retaliated under conditions where any reasonable person would have known that what he was doing was contrary to the Constitution.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if you don't show that as a... as a threshold, you don't even get discovery.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'd like to ask you one other question.  Suppose you win on this on the grounds we've been discussing.  What happens in the middle of the trial when a defendant wants to say the same thing?  Can he avoid conviction by showing the same thing?   Stephen G. Breyer  What happens when the same claim is made in the middle of a trial that I... whether I'm guilty or innocent?  I haven't been convicted yet, and I want to show that this prosecution wouldn't have been brought in the absence of the retaliatory motive.  Can he make that claim in the middle of trial or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, no, he believes it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  He's not acquitted.   Stephen G. Breyer  He's in the middle of trial and he wants to say--   Stephen G. Breyer  --It's a criminal trial.   ",04-1495
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's true, but... so, you said it's conceded in this case?  I thought, in answer to Justice Kennedy, you said something that... I was surprised, if it's conceded.  I thought it wasn't conceded... tell me if I'm wrong... that the States have water quality standards.  Those water quality standards may or may not have something to do with point source discharges.  They don't have to.  They want water to be good enough for recreation.  They want water without algae so there are more fish.  They have a lot of things.  And this statute seems to say the F... what used to be the FPC.  I... is it now FERC?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, okay... used to be the Federal Power Commission... tells them,  ""You have to get approval to build your dam. ""  ""And we're not going to give you approval unless you comply with State water quality standards. ""  This seems to me to go back into ancient history, like 1920.  And of course you have to comply.  And so, isn't the purpose of... is there agreement that it only concerns point discharges, or does it concern water quality standards?   Stephen G. Breyer  Really?   Stephen G. Breyer  In other words... discharge from a point source, what is... well, then EPA concedes you win?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, fine.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, what's--   Stephen G. Breyer  --the problem?  So, they're saying, as I thought was true since 1920, that you're going to get your dam only if you comply with State standards, including standards about fish, algae, junk in the water, all kinds of things that might be put there by the dam.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  And they're saying,  ""Of course there is a discharge. ""  ""The discharge is a discharge of water. ""  Okay?  The water runs into it.  Now, that's enough for you to have to comply with the State standards before the F... FERC is going to give you a license.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, have you got anything... I've heard you argue about the word ""discharge""; and you say ""discharge"" doesn't mean ""discharge of water"", it means something else.  And I think that's a very logical argument.  Is there any other argument that you'd have, related to the purpose of the statute for the objective?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, but it doesn't... it doesn't say... it says they have to comply with State water quality standards, doesn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I thought... it says that you have to get your permit.  You have to be compliant with State water quality standards.  Now, suppose a State has a nutty water quality standard.  Doesn't EPA have some authority there to make sure that a water quality standard of a State, under the Clean Water Act, is... makes sense?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, if a State were to say,  ""Our water quality standard is the following. ""  ""We never build a dam in our State, no matter what. ""  Okay?  Now, there's no authority in the EPA to set that aside as it not being a proper Clean Water Act standard.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It has to be just a Clean Water Act standard.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not an expert on the Clean Water Act.  Is that a proper Clean Water Act standard?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, this decision... I'm not asking you about this decision.  I'm asking you if a State, under the Clean Water Act, were to say, ""We have the following Clean""... now you understand what I'm--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Does EPA, or anyone else, have authority to say,  ""That isn't a proper Clean Water Act standard, however good you may think it is? ""   ",04-1527
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, I--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I think the question... maybe it just... I don't understand, totally, how the Clean Water Act works, but I thought that what we're talking in this statute is a State rule that's called the State Clean Water Act rule.  It's a creature of the Clean Water Act, isn't it?  A water quality standard?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And, therefore, a State, I would think, that had some totally bizarre Clean Water Act standard might find that it had a standard that didn't fit within the scope of the Clean Water Act.  And, therefore, it wasn't going to be enforced here.  Is that right, or not right?  Maybe the Federal Government will explain this--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Just for the few of us who think the dictionary doesn't answer the case, is it possible you could say a word about why Congress would, or would not, have wanted, in effect, to incorporate all State water quality standards into a permission to build a dam?   Stephen G. Breyer  Also to protect fish?   INTERRUPTING ",04-1527
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  You like this... apparently you like this argument, although you say you're miles away from probate.  Well, if you want to get into that argument, I guess the strongest argument against keeping it... for keeping it is bankruptcy jurisdictional statutes shouldn't be interpreted differently than diversity jurisdiction or any other statute, and Markham at least recognizes that there is such a thing as the probate exception and that Congress implicitly adopted it, just as they did the domestic relations exception.  Therefore, if we are going to find for you on this ground, we'd have to go back and overrule that case and a lot of other water that's flowed over... under the bridge or wherever the water flows.  [Laughter]  And we ought to take what's given as given, whatever the true meaning of ecclesiastical courts having jurisdiction over certain probate matters or not in the 18th century.   Stephen G. Breyer  I guess what you're going to hear in 5-10 minutes--   Stephen G. Breyer  --you might as well deal with it now--   Stephen G. Breyer  --is that the inter vivos... a... a claim for a... the Texas tort of interference with inter vivos gift, according to Texas law, must be brought at the time of the probate proceeding.  And for that reason, it is bound up with probate, and for that reason, they didn't have jurisdiction.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, let's suppose you're--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --suppose they're right about their interpretation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the strongest case for you on that is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You said this Court has repeatedly said.  So what--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but did those documents... did those boxes contain the key documents--   Stephen G. Breyer  --about the catchall trust?   ",04-1544
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But this is all... this has nothing... I mean, I... you have the total differently... different understanding than I do of this case, and I did read Judge Carter's opinion.  I thought that case simply held that because your clients had interfered with an effort by J. Howard to give quite a few millions of dollars to Vickie Marshall... because of that interference, they had committed the tort of inter vivos interference with a gift, and they had to pay damages.  Now, they said a lot of things by way of what the evidence was.  Indeed, they did say, as you point out, that your clients forged three pages of the will.  But that was simply evidence of their bad intent, and it did not invalidate anything in the probate proceeding, as I read it.  Now, what have I said that's not right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not interested in what he said.  I'm interested in what Judge Carter said--   Stephen G. Breyer  --because that, it seems to me, is... and what is it that Judge Carter did that was wrong in this respect?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But that... that sounds to me like a matter of preemption, but... but... or not preemption but, you know, res judicata.  But just out of curiosity or... because I think it is relevant, did the Texas probate court have in front of it the documents among the lawyers that the district judge, Judge Carter, relied upon in showing that there was an intent to create the catchall trust?   Stephen G. Breyer  It had all those documents.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  That is to say, what the finding is, is that there was a different matter, a catchall trust, and he told the lawyers, go draw it up so I can give gifts to her, the increase in the value of my property during the 13 months we're married, do it, and they never did it.  Now, that seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with the GRAT trust or with the will.  It just happens that those are evidentiary, what went on there, of what likely happened with the catchall trust.  So I don't see why those are necessary.  I don't see why they're more than evidentiary, and I don't see whether or not those are barred, those particular facts have anything to do with this, as far as jurisdiction is concerned.  Now, explain to me why I'm wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's just one of the things.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Among other things that went on were they hired private detectives to go after Vickie from the bed.  I mean, you've read that opinion and they're like about 30 things in there.  And I grant you that one of those things is the fact that three pages of the living trust, according to the judge, were created after the event of that trust and slipped in without his knowledge.  I mean, it's quite a story.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And... and so I... but as I read it, there were many, many, many things involved here, and this is just one of them.  So how can Texas say that you have to prove this particular one as... as opposed to proving a lot of others?   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't think they're going to impose a constructive trust, are they?  All... all they're going to say is pay her the money.   Stephen G. Breyer  They're going to say it because they make a finding that through a whole variety of various devices, all of which were listed, that J. Howard, who wanted to give her money through something called the catchall trust was prevented in about 15 ways.  And even if you're right that there's a Texas finding that those three pages weren't slipped in, well, how do we know?  Maybe it was a valid GRAT trust, but if only they hadn't tried to isolate J. Howard from contact with her, J. Howard would have figured out what had happened before he died and he would have told his lawyers, hey, cut this out.  Do what I want.  Revoke it.  But all that is just hypothetical.  I'm just using that to show you why I think this is evidentiary not a matter of what the elements of the crime are... or the elements of the tort are.   Stephen G. Breyer  What's the cite on that that I... that I need for--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --You're saying you can't bring an inter vivos trust... an inter vivos... interference with an inter vivos gift action in Texas unless you show that a will, for example, is invalid.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  By the way, in Texas if you have to go through all this probate stuff and everything, and they want to claim 15 years ago my mother gave a ring to my cousin who stole it, is that precluded to bring that tort action when the person who, you know, was supposed to get it finds out about it?   Stephen G. Breyer  So... so, in other words, if it... when the guy is 2 years... 15 years old, he gives a ring to somebody, and now he dies at age 93, and when they find out about that incomplete gift at age 15, nobody can bring a lawsuit anymore.  You have to go to the probate court.   ",04-1544
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  If... if it's the fact that you go to the Web site and that's what's supposed to make this what it was in McConnell which, by the way, we said was illegal, what they... the first thing they're going to see when they get to the Web site, which I agree with you... four times in 3 of the 12 sentences of this ad... in 3 of the 12... it says, [befairDOTorg,] visit [befairDOTorg,] go to [befairDOTorg.]  And the first thing that they're going to see when they get to [befairDOTorg] is a big headline in bold... gold... bold letters which says, Feingold and Kohl continue to support unprecedented filibusters of judicial nominees.  So, in fact, if [befairDOTorg] is brought into the picture, that makes this ad look much more like an effort to... to defeat Senator Feingold than the ad that we considered in our previous case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Doesn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  But the basic question I think is this.  All of us... or almost all of us who are here... spent an entire summer reading through one of the longest set of opinions I've ever seen from the lower courts and going through a record that they had compiled over months reflecting 6 years of congressional effort.  And what that record showed with dozens, hundreds I think, of examples was the basis for Congress' conclusion that there's simply no way to know whether an ad like yours is a genuine issue ad or isn't.  And the only way that we have a hope of stopping rich people or corporations or labor unions from simply trying to defeat candidates by writing sham ads is to have the rule that we have.  Now, you have a very good argument, but it's an argument that I heard right in that case.  And we considered right in that case issues like yours, just ads like yours, ads that were even less sham like than yours, if you want to call yours a sham... I don't mean to be pejorative.  But we considered all that, and then we used them as an example.  And of course, it was close.  5 to 4 this Court said ads that are even more apparently neutral on their face than yours, Congress can impose this requirement.  Now, what's different about your ad than the ads we put right in that opinion as examples of what we'd allow Congress to control?  What's different now or are you asking us to go back only a year later and undo what we did?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So what is the test?  Because I... my vague recollection from a year and a half ago is that there was in that testimony political consultants who said if you really want to defeat a Senator, here's how you do it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Run an ad that just speaks about a group of Senators.  It's plain that they're bad, and then put in some words that mention his name and everybody will get the point.  They said that's even better than saying, vote against.  And then our opinion said there is little difference between an ad that urges voters to vote against Jane Doe and one that condemns Jane Doe's record on a particular issue while exhorting viewers to call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.  That was the opinion.  So, now, what's your test to decide whether that's what's going on or whether this is a genuine issue ad?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If you can do this, can a labor union do it?   Stephen G. Breyer  And a corporation?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Well, then... then we're back to... I mean, I've heard this.  This is very familiar music to me and I think you raise a tough issue.  I just thought we perhaps had decided it.  But the... the reason that this was so tough was then these very, very wealthy individuals... and since I once read through the list, I know who they are.  And they... they say, I'm going to give $15 million.  You know, I'm going to give $15 million.  So they hire this genius political consultant that's there in the record.  And what happens is ads that look an awful like this, and this consultant says, hey, we have $15 million to pay for it from this one person.  And they run them all over the country.  And Senator after Senator is boom, boom, boom, boom.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It becomes a question of motive and how do we know what the motive is?   ",04-1581
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is the difference with this?  I mean, in my mind are possible as applied challenges.  Bread for the City.  Never supported the candidate, worried about the hurricane in Louisiana.  Vote for relief for New Orleans.  Write your Senator, Senator X.  Organization two.  Never supported a candidate one way or the other, but has an issue they're always interested in, and they run ads cycle after cycle after cycle and they don't want to pull them just because October has come along.  All right?  Now, think of those organizations where I think maybe, sure, maybe they'd win their as applied challenge.  And here, you're not arguing it... he doesn't have a right to bring it.  You're arguing, of course, he can bring an as applied challenge.  He's just going to lose given our rationale.  Why?   Stephen G. Breyer  But--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --That's what I want to know exactly.  I didn't think... I thought Congress considered this impossible question.  I thought that 7 percent figure was from a study, in fact, dozens of studies, where these people who were experts, quote, decided that about 7 percent of the ads like this one distinguishing between really interested in issues or interested in issues but, in significant part, defeating the Senator.  In the latter, of course, it's campaign and it's part of the regulation of campaign funds.  But they didn't think we could do it.  They thought first they could do it, and then they told the FEC to go and produce a set of regs that would, in fact, try to screen out that legitimate 7 percent.  Am I wrong about how the statute was supposed to work?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why haven't they done it?  And I had thought also that they were supposed to control 527's by having regs or individual cases that would decide whether there was a mix of personnel between the campaign and the 527, whether they talked to people and planned their strategy.  Have there been those regs written?   INTERRUPTING ",04-1581
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose... suppose a person has a piece of property, and they zone it suddenly, no building... no building... which destroys the value of the property pretty much.  Now, should we just... I think those might be the cases where this language began to appear, something like that.  Should that be just a simple rational basis review too?  Because I'm trying to put the case where it might be... arguably you should have something stronger since the property value is... is seriously hurt and--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --No.  They're going to say, well, we can imagine a reason, but if you look at it realistically, you know there's no good reason.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

And maybe if it's... they have no reason for it at all, they can't do it.  Period.  And if they have some reason for it, even a sort of bad one, they can do it.  But if that's the context... we're in the game where they can do it... why should it matter, in respect to paying compensation, whether their reason is quite a good one or just barely good enough?  And that's... that's the puzzle, I think, that the other side is putting to you, and I must say I'm rather moved by their argument because it seems to me whether it's a very good reason or just a barely adequate reason has nothing to do with whether they should pay compensation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But the burden on--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Maybe I'm not... I thought... are we in the world in which you agree the government can do it even though their reason... or is your basic argument, no, they can't do this at all?  In which case it's not a compensation question.  It's a question of whether the Constitution of the United States forbids them from doing it.  Period.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's a compensation issue.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the... let me go back to my question because I haven't heard the answer.  And I'm in a world, imaginative if you like, where Hawaii passes this statute, and what we're interested in is not whether they can do it, but whether they have to pay compensation.  And my question is, what in heaven's name has the goodness or badness of their reason to do with that question?  After all, I can imagine instances in which their reason for the regulation is pretty bad.  It just barely survives, and they shouldn't have to pay.  And I can imagine cases where their reason is wonderful and they should have to pay or maybe they shouldn't.  It's neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition.  It has nothing to do with whether you should have to pay.  Now, that's their argument I think, or at least as I understand it, and I want you to explain to me why the goodness or badness of the reason, once it has passed the minimal point, has anything to do with whether you should have to pay compensation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Holmes said, though he didn't hold that... what he said was you have to pay when the regulation, a legitimate regulation, goes too far.  So I will repeat.  Why does the goodness or badness of the reason, past the minimal point, have anything to do with whether a regulation goes too far?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But he... he didn't go into this question.  Let me give you an example that will make it clear.  Let's take a case where there's the best reason in the world, fabulous reason.  We're taking this property to build a highway, which is absolutely necessary.  Would you suggest that compensation doesn't have to be paid?   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course, it does.  Now, let me suggest the other side of the coin, a really terrible reason.  You cannot build your house without using metal pipes.  That's our building reg in this State.  Now, everybody knows... I'm imagining anyway... plastic pipes are just as good, but not quite, so they have a barely adequate reason.  Do you think that they have to pay compensation to have a general building code saying you can't use plastic pipes?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it is an... it does regulate the use of your property and it means added cost, in fact, several thousand dollars added cost, to the building of a house, and come up here and argue we agree there's a rational reason, but it isn't so you can do it, but it isn't a really good reason, not substantial.  Now, do you think that has anything to do with paying compensation?   Stephen G. Breyer  Explain it... explain your theory in terms of the example.  That is, imagine that the benefits of the network of dealers of gasoline into the community are fabulous and obvious.  So there's a great reason for doing this.  Now, why is it that, on your theory, the government shouldn't have to pay compensation then, but it should have to pay compensation just because the benefits are not obvious, that they're bizarre, that they don't... may not really exist?  That's... you see why I'm having a problem?   INTERRUPTING ",04-163X

You have the Equal Employment Advisory Council that represents dozens and dozens, I take it, of businesses.  We have your own client.  We have you in the firm.  Everybody.  I imagine you all racked your brains to say has there ever been such an example, and I take the answer is no, never.  Not all of you could even find one instance where this happened.  Now, am I right?  Because that's what I think unless you provide the example.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So... so what would be so unreasonable about a Member of Congress concluding the following?  We want these things to end after 6 years, you know?  And there's never been an example of this horrible that you think of, and so we are going to end them all after 6 years from the time the thing took place, the cheat took place.  And that's it.  And if there's some other problem of the kind you're worried about that comes up, we will worry about that later through amendment, tolling, et cetera.  Why is that an... we don't want 30 day statutes of limitations or 90-day statute of limitations.  We want 6 years.  That helps most people.  And if there's an odd case that doesn't, we'll worry about it.  What's the answer to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, that's true, it would be.  And the reason we're doing it is because there's a period of time when somebody lies to the Government and we don't want actions that are related to that.  We'll have to go into that proof to take place more than 6 years later.  Now, that would be the reason, and I agree it would be contrary.  But the difficulty for me is the language seems to point to that reason.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I can't find that reason idiotic.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But don't we have to do that anyway when... when in fact a person brings an ordinary claim?  I mean, Joe Smith brings a claim that XYZ company cheated the Government.  Now, that doesn't mean it was committed.  It just means he says it was committed.  After all, he might lose.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You mean if in fact the plaintiff loses because the jury finds for the defendant in the qui tam action, then it should have been dismissed on statute of limitations grounds.

Both are located in Toledo, both hire a certain number of people, have a certain payroll, have a certain amount of property, and have a certain amount of business.  Identical.  And they're charged a tax.  And now, what... company B, when it's thinking of building a new plant or make new investment in machinery, if it goes to Wisconsin, it will discover it pays less taxes on all those things that were already in Ohio.  And, therefore, the people who sell land or machinery in Wisconsin are discovering it isn't being bought, because that old tax, which really had nothing to do with this new investment, is now less because of the new investment.  So, that hurts businesses in Wisconsin.  As I understand it, that's their claim.  And if I've got it wrong, I'm sure you'll correct me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then I'm probably wrong.  [Laughter]   Stephen G.

That is, my reading of the California State court opinion says you came into their court and you said, look, this ordinance in San Francisco violates the Fifth Amendment, I guess, because it doesn't make any sense.  The... there's no good basis, no sound basis for requiring us to pay a fee in order to convert rooms.  Anyway, the room isn't a house.  Anyway, it makes no sense as applied to us.  Anyway, they admit they just want to raise revenue.  Anyway, we're going to give the tenant a place to live for the rest of his life.  All right.  Those were the claims.  And in each case, the California Supreme Court said you're wrong.  You're wrong because it does help preserve rooms, because it does have a reasonable purpose in a city that's crowded, because the tenant who's there for life might move out, and we want to keep the room even if he moves out because he dies.  And anyway, it's not an issue of whether your case is special.  This makes sense as a general rule.  All right?  They decided it.  You raised it.  Now, what else is it you want to raise in Federal court?   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know if you said it.  I just said that that is what I read in the California Supreme Court opinion that Justice Werdegar wrote.

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I thought it decided a different thing.  I thought that it decided that in part that was the reason for their decision.  But the reason they reached their decision is they thought on each of those five matters that the City of San Francisco had a reasonable legislative purpose for its ordinance.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Just as, suppose, for example, they had decided that the hotel clerk or the temporary manager did speak English, and in fact, he was a scholar of English.

And the word ""impede"" goes well beyond what I've said, both because it does not cover the three things, but, most particularly, because it does not say that it was dishonest or that the person who did the persuading knew that the jury or the grand jury or the investigation would have the legal right to get the material and there was no right to withhold it.  The words that Arthur Andersen suggested, while they don't say precisely that, were at least a step in the right direction.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but it sounds like... actually, I'll grant you that it appears in the statute, but that's, in a sense, my problem.  The statute talks about  ""corruptly persuading another person to destroy a paper with the intent to impair that paper's availability for use in an official proceeding. ""  So, then we look at the instruction, and the instruction speaks of  ""destroying the paper with the intent, at least in part, to impede. ""  Fine.  It sounds like it's just the same as the statute, but for one thing, the omission in the instruction of the word ""corruptly"".   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So to define ""corruptly"" as  ""doing the same thing that the rest of the statute does. ""  seems a little strange.  If I were a juror, I might think that there is missing here any dishonesty of purpose.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's not perfectly redundant.  One can imagine driving a wedge between making something unavailable, which the jury would find relevant, or the investigator would find relevant, and impeding the fact-finding ability of the investigator.  They're not logically identical, but they do strike me as so similar that it's hard to expect a juror to make much of a difference between those two phrases.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, the... in general terms, when you speak of ""general interpretation"", I suppose I think it possible to approach ambiguous criminal statutes with the following idea.  Congress did not intend to try to make of the statute a highly general weapon for the Justice Department to pick and choose.  That's a notification problem.  It's also because we don't want one law,  ""It is a crime to do wrong, in the opinion of the Attorney General. ""  You know, I mean, we want to have narrow criminal statutes.  Now, is it reasonable to start with that frame of mind?  And if it is, doesn't that tend to cut against you in this case?   INTERRUPTING ",04-368X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right, now suppose... I don't understand all these legal terms here.  Imagine.  [Laughter]  It may be close to the truth.  Now, we have a case, a hypothetical.  The defendant is sitting there, the police say, ""Question""?  And he says,  ""I want to see my lawyer. ""  And the policeman says the following,  ""That's fine, go ahead, we'll get him. ""  ""By the way, if you see him, we'll execute you. ""  ""Are you sure you don't want to talk to us? ""  That's plainly unlawful, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Now--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Now, the same thing happens, but what he says is,  ""You'd better talk to us, or you'll be executed. ""  ""Think about it. ""  Equally unlawful, right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, a minute--   Stephen G. Breyer  --passes while he's thinking about it.  Okay?  Is it... is it unlawful now, because a minute has passed before he says yes?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I just--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I don't... I don't want legalism.  I just want the conclusion.  A minute has passed before he says yes.  Has that changed everything, and it becomes lawful?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Now it's 15 minutes.  Now it's 30 minutes.  Okay?  Now, a court says 30 minutes is the same as one minute,  ""We don't think the passage of 29 extra minutes made a difference. ""  And what's your reply?  Not in legalism.  You're going to say,  ""Oh, no, the passage of 30 minutes, rather than 1 minute, makes all the difference. ""  And I would like to know why.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, that's fine.  I'm not... I'm... I want you to say that kind of thing.  You're saying it's not just 30 minutes, it's ""also some other things happened"".  What?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, that's--   Stephen G. Breyer  --possible.  That definitely cuts in your favor, unless, of course, it sounds like a good cop/bad cop routine.  And--   Stephen G. Breyer  --people--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But that's--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --subjectively true.  And so, I'd simply wonder if the fact that it's subjectively true, and there is a finding that the defendant... here, we have 30 minutes, and we have the fact that the other detective said,  ""He said he can't talk to us. ""  ""We can't do anything about it. ""  We have that.  Is there anything else?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Right.  So--   Stephen G. Breyer  --we have a passage--   Stephen G. Breyer  If you're going to the standard, which is, I think, the... actually, the difficult question here, what's wrong... should you say... what's wrong with saying... which is what I was pursuing... that, where there is a question that's improper, as there was here, by the police, the only real question is, Is a later initiation ""the fruit""?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And you say the State has to show it wasn't the fruit.  That would have the virtue of making the law quite consistent here, as it is with Fourth Amendment/Fifth Amendment cases.  That's a well known concept.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why... I understand that--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --there's a lot of language--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is it fact, or is it not fact, law, in respect to the following?  He's sitting there.  And there is a question of what motivated him.  Did it motivate him totally that his... this thing about his codefendant, or was he moved, in significant part... moved, motivated... by the earlier, 30-minute earlier, improper questioning?  That sounds like a fact.  Or do you think it's not a fact?   ",04-373X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well--   Stephen G. Breyer  --what about just simple thing like this, that there is an implication in what Reese said, that he listens to in his cell,  ""I guess you'd... he'll want to talk to us now, huh? ""  The implication is that he faces death, and he'll be better off by talking to them without a lawyer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, suppose Johns had said to the defendant,  ""Mr. Blake, I want to tell you something. ""  ""My colleague here has implied that you will be better off, because of the death possibility, in talking to us without a lawyer. ""  ""We want to tell you, that isn't true. ""  ""There is no way that you'll be better off talking to us without a lawyer. ""  ""You will be at least equally, from your point of view, as well off if you talk to a lawyer. ""  Now, that might have cured it, I guess.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but if you're looking... if you're taking your standard seriously--   Stephen G. Breyer  --The reason that my... I was able to give my hypothetical before--   Stephen G. Breyer  --the reason that you'd have to say,  ""You will not be better off... you will not be worse off in respect to the death penalty, by... you know, we... it won't-- ""   Stephen G. Breyer  ""# make you any better off to talk to the lawyer-- ""  Sorry.  Strike.  The reason that the policeman, to cure, would have to say,  ""Look, it's not going to help you, in respect to the death penalty, to talk without your lawyer. ""  is because that was the implication of his question, that was the implication--   Stephen G. Breyer  --of the wrongful statement.   Stephen G. Breyer  The implication was,  ""You're not going to get death if you talk to us without a lawyer. ""   Stephen G. Breyer  But if it had been some other questions, some questions, for example, about the crime, all you would have had to do was eliminate whatever negative implication came out of those questions, which might have been nothing.   Stephen G. Breyer  So timely--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, so--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --maybe you should modify the standard.  Maybe the standard ought to be that where you have an improper line of questioning, after the warning, that the police either have to negative the implication of those questions, the relevant implication, or the State has to show that some other series of independent events, such as Justice Kennedy mentioned, made the difference.  That is, caused the later request to talk without a lawyer.  And if they can't show the one or the other, then they lose.   INTERRUPTING ",04-373X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose that we have an instance where it is job related.  He is not speaking as a private citizen, and it's also a public concern.  Now, in such an instance, could we say that, at least if the matter of public concern rise to the level where it's related to an independent constitutional protection... say, founded in the due process clause... under those circumstances, the employer cannot unreasonably... though we give him an area of discretion, he cannot unreasonably retaliate.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?  And here is an independent obligation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's very unusual--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --but it's there.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You'd only lose... the Government would lose, only where you can conclude that they could... ""they"", the Government... could not... could not reasonably conclude that he'd been insubordinate.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, we covered the case of the Democrat, Republican, et cetera.  In other words, we'd give him... should we give him total discretion?  Can't we limit that discretion of the supervisor?   INTERRUPTING ",04-473X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That doesn't--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That isn't the point.  I think the point is, at least for... I think point is who is going to decide whether there was some justification here.  And I read this memo.  I thought that the DA had a pretty good claim, that the police didn't do anything wrong.  And there's also an argument they did.  All right.  So, who decides that kind of thing?  A constitutional court or a State, under its protection laws or whistle blower statutes?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the argument that you have to face, I think, is that it will be very disruptive to have constitutional judges dive into this, when there are so many other remedies, and where the very act of their doing it, allowing discovery, allowing court cases, allowing juries, itself, will disrupt the Government.  Now, if you say they give you no protection at all, I want to hear what you have to say as to what the standard is to separate the sheep from the goats.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The only cases that would go into court are cases where the employer says,  ""I have no reason at all for firing him? ""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But that's because--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --they think they have a better claim on the other part.  I mean, if... even if you're right in this one, I promise you, the next one will come along, and they'll say,  ""Of course we had a good reason for firing him. ""  ""One, we didn't fire him for that reason. ""  ""Two, if we did, we would have been justified. ""  or whatever.  So--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --if your standard is, the only cases that go into court under the first amendment are cases where the employer says,  ""I had no basis for doing anything to him whatsoever. ""  then I think there will be few such cases, though you might convince me that that standard--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --wouldn't do any harm.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Say it's a--   Stephen G. Breyer  --borderline case--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But what he has--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --But the argument that I think people are worried about, against you, is, you have a case... it's actually a wonderful example.  Your client thinks that, in the affidavit that the sheriffs gave supporting the warrant, they didn't tell the truth, because they said that whoever was looking into it, you know, said there was a private driveway and that there were tire tracks, and there were no tire tracks, and it wasn't a private driveway.  The other side says,  ""Yes, it was a long road, but sort of like a driveway, and the edge of the... of the driveway was broken down, and that's what the sheriff's deputies were referring to. ""  I found it a dispute on both sides.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, if, in fact, he's being disciplined for that, the other side is telling you he has a lot of remedies, he has a variety of remedies.  Go to the bar associations.  Many States have laws, the statutes that protect people under these situations.  And why suddenly go to a constitutional court to get the same relief which will short circuit all the other remedies?  And if you do, there are going to be thousands of cases less good than yours, and they'll all run to... to the constitutional court.  All right.  So, now, what's your reply?   Stephen G. Breyer  I guess our law clerks would meet it every day.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, maybe, maybe not.  I don't--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --anything that goes on in my chamber that isn't a matter of public concern, and I would think everything at OSHA and everything at... look, I'll... let me put my question to you, because you're going to make an argument that I don't think is too widely shared; namely, that Pickering decides this case.  If that's your argument, I'd like to ask you a question based on the assumption Pickering does not decide this case.  And it seems to me that Pickering involves a case in which it's both a matter of public concern and outside the scope of employment.   Stephen G. Breyer  And here we have a case that is a matter of public concern, but inside.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, in those circumstances, I want to know how you believe the first amendment requires us to decide this case.  And as I read this case, in the record, we have one individual, your client, who looked at an affidavit.  The affidavit said that the deputy sheriffs were trying to locate where a vehicle that was chocked up came from.  They saw tire tracks.  The tire tracks went back to a fence at the end of a long driveway.  So, I looked in the record.  I couldn't find the affidavit.  So, I assume that's what it says.  And I wanted to know what the deputy sheriff said.  What they said is that your client agreed that there were tire tracks.  There were tire tracks that did not go the whole length of the driveway, but, rather, tire tracks near the house, where they got the search warrant for.  And, they added, that... the deputies... that there was rocks broken up.  All right.  So, we have two sides to this argument: the deputies, who might reasonably contend that they did nothing wrong; your client, who thinks they were lying.  And we also have a letter that your client wrote, where he said that these deputies are grossly inaccurate and clearly misleading.  Suppose his supervisor goes to him and says,  ""I think that that letter is not the right tone. ""  ""Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong; maybe they're in good faith, maybe they're not. ""  ""And so, if you don't change that tone, I'm going to discipline you. ""  All right?  Now, that's my hypothetical, which seemed to me, perhaps, very much like this case.  How, in your opinion, does the first amendment handle such a matter?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Which is what I'm looking--   Stephen G. Breyer  --for.  I'm looking for--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --a standard.   Stephen G. Breyer  Look--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm not making my question too clear.  I'm, imagine, the district judge.  I get just the facts I described to you.  Your client, who's very upset, says,  ""This is the most unreasonable thing that ever happened. ""  ""They were trying to prevent me from communicating with the judge. ""  ""I'm the one who saw the sheriffs. ""  ""They didn't. ""  The other side says,  ""We think it's reasonable what we did. ""  My question to you is, What standard does that judge apply under the first amendment?  What does he do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We live in a world where people are leaking things all the time.  And there are thousands of things that are in the public interest every day.  But what's bothering me is, while I see the Government's rule as protecting the interests of the employer, it's very hard for me to believe that never is there an instance where the first amendment offers protection.  But the only choice you've given me is a rule that says every dispute of the public interest is going to go right into constitutional litigation.  And I don't like that either.  So, am I hopelessly--   Stephen G. Breyer  --forced to choose which is the lesser of the evils, or is there some middle approach that gives discretion to the Government, but doesn't allow them to exceed that discretion in a certain category of cases?  If so, what?  And--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --how would you phrase it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that your answer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I've got... you've got me part of the way.  Now, I'm not saying I... I have to think this through, but you got part of the way.  You say here, there's an independent constitutional basis for the speech being permitted.  But, now, still within that, the Government agency has to have some authority to discipline a person, even there, because, after all, he might have been accusing these sheriffs of things that were really not justified by what they, in fact, did.  Or maybe he was right.  What about that part of the standard?  Do you want to say that the Government wins, as long as it behaved reasonably?  Do you want to say that the Government loses only if there was an abuse of ordinary employer discretion?  Do you want to say the Government... et cetera.  What do you want to say?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Suppose--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --we were to write this, hypothetically.  Indeed, the employer has broad discretion to discipline the employee for the manner... or whatever he does... even in such an area, but that discretion can be abused.  And, therefore, it is up to the judge to determine whether a jury could find such abuse of discretion here.   ",04-473X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What about... I mean, the person, if he reads the regulation, would see that it says that to classify him, the State has to show that through repetitive and seriously disruptive behavior, he has demonstrated a chronic inability to adjust as evidenced by repeated class 2 rule violations.   Stephen G. Breyer  So I guess he would like to know give me at least a vague idea of what behavior you're talking about and which class 2 rule violations you're talking about.  Now, does the notice tell him those two things?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So... so this... I mean, that's what I don't understand what this case is about because I... I'm amazed that... I think it is too detailed what they're requiring of you, by far.  But the elements are I have to know.  I'm an inmate.  I want to know what is this about.  Suppose I think they're wrong.  I need to know how to tell them they're wrong.  And the other thing I think I'd need to know is after the committee or the warden decides against me, what are his reasons.  I'm not asking for a book.  All I want to know are the basic reasons.  Now, those things I can't work out from the briefs, quite honestly, whether the new policy gives him those new things, those two things, or doesn't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, already you say that, but I would think the basic information includes some idea of what my disruptive behavior was and some idea of what the class 2 violations that I was convicted of was.  And now, I've heard you both say that he does get it and that he doesn't get it.  I'm sure that's my fault, but I want to know, does he get this information before the hearing, or does he not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now... you heard what I said.   Stephen G. Breyer  Does he get what I just said?   Stephen G. Breyer  He does.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I don't care that he doesn't have the evidence.   Stephen G. Breyer  I want to know that he thinks he's being sent to this prison because his roommate, Rat Fink, has made up a bunch of stories about him.  All right?  So he needs to know whether... what it is that... that this board is considering before he can come in and explain why it isn't true.  He doesn't have to have all the evidence.  He has to know what the point is, what the charge is, what the claim is.  And you're saying he gets it because he has the report.  Is there an example in the record of a report?   ",04-495X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Then can you just explain that?  Because the policy says that he shall get notice and attached to the notice will be a committee report.  Then they have a copy of the form that the report is supposed to fill out on page 58 to about page 78 and it's about the most detailed thing I've ever seen.  So--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Even though... you mean even though it says that the policy says you should be noticed and you're... it says, attached to the notice will be a copy of the... I'm sorry.  I'm looking... am I looking at the wrong place?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Here is the exact words I... I think.  It's... tell me.  This certainly seems to be right.  The inmate shall be served with notice at least 48 hours prior to the commencement of a hearing.  The notice shall include all of the reasons for the proposed placement--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and a summary of the evidence relied on.  Now, I'm just reading that.  What is it I'm reading?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Where is... where is--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm sorry.  You go ahead.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So I think I've got your point.  Tell me if I... I mean, I've now looked at... this is very confusing to me.  I'm sure it's my fault.  But I take it, if you look at page 22, that's the new policy.   Stephen G. Breyer  And what the new policy says is, committee, you must give the prisoner some information.  Then it refers to form 2598.  Form 2598 is the form on page 58.   Stephen G. Breyer  What that tells him is nothing about the facts.  That tells him he's been charged.  Period.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, the new policy goes on to say, the classification committee shall document information presented by staff and the inmate which is form 2627 and 2628.  And I don't know where 2698 fits in, but 2698 are all those pages with the information.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it just doesn't say anything about them at all.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So your point is in the past, they didn't give them the information.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then they promulgated a new policy and the new policy says nothing about it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what it says about--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But why can't you do that in an as-applied challenge?  I mean, it may be that there was all this... suppose we wrote an opinion hypothetically.  Suppose... and it said, look, I've read through this new policy.  I assume it will be administered in accordance with the elements of due process, the basic elements being some kind of notice basically what... what the factual part is, some kind of opportunity to present proofs in evidence that's a reasonable one, and some kind of decision by a neutral decision-maker.  Certainly the language of the new policy permits such an interpretation.  It doesn't... and... and suppose we were to say, well, we assume it will have the basic elements, and it's so complex, so detailed that... that if they don't, then the individual who suffers could bring a claim and say it was administered unfairly in my case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not disagreeing with you.   Stephen G. Breyer  But you see... yes.  I'm... I'm not disagreeing with you.  I'm saying I read their new policy, now having gotten to it the third time through all this detail, and it seems to me that they do give a notice, and Justice O'Connor just pointed out where there's a place for reasons.  And as I read what happens after the committee decides, it says, it shall make a decision... a recommendation accordingly... according to this very long, detailed form.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it doesn't say they won't tell the prisoner.  It doesn't say whether they'll tell the prisoner.   Stephen G. Breyer  So why can't I assume they will tell him so he'll know what's going on?  And then if they don't, you'd have an as-applied challenge.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That was before the new policy.   Stephen G. Breyer  What I'm now saying is I can understand exactly why you might feel the way you do.  But our job is to not necessarily take that feeling.  But shouldn't we presume that the State will administer words that comport with the basic elements, not every detail as you want, but they will administer this new policy in accord with those basic elements of fairness?  Isn't that giving a... sort of like a deference to the State, which maybe we should?   Stephen G. Breyer  Can you just give me 1 minute on the other issue?   ",04-495X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  If you're... if you're going to... if you're going to consider something that wasn't a recall of a mandate as if it was, why don't you consider it as a rule 41(b) action?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They didn't recall it, didn't... did they?  Did they recall it?  They issued it and then recalled it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.   Stephen G. Breyer  Correct.  So we did... they didn't recall it.  So, of course, 41(b) does not have to do with recalls.  41(b) has to do with issuances, and 41(b) says the court may shorten or extend the time for issuing.  Now, why wouldn't that be the obvious rule to apply to what occurred here?   Stephen G. Breyer  So... so your view--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Is that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But isn't that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Have you surveyed the circuits?  I know this... what... what you describe as the practice certainly wouldn't have been in the First Circuit.  Maybe in the D.C. it was, but I mean, we would have thought that we have the power over our own mandate.  And of course, if it hasn't issued and some extraordinary thing comes along requiring a revision, we would have revised it.  So when you read the rules and you say that's what we argue, you're not arguing it about any court that I'm familiar with as an appeals court.  So... so have you looked up the appeals courts and found that in fact there is at least one court or two or maybe more that follow the interpretation that you're arguing for?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if you have not, then my experience would be you're arguing for a rule that no appeals court follows, that... that all think they have power over the mandate, and that the question becomes one of whether or not there was a good reason for delaying the mandate.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If there was a good reason, they could, and if there wasn't, maybe they couldn't.  But Justice Ginsburg has set forth what sounds to me like an excellent reason, that the judge discovered he had made an error that could mean life or death or jail or innocence, and before that opinion issues, I want to be sure it's correct.  Now... now, that's how I'm thinking, that the general practice is contrary to what you say, that the question is a good reason, and that here there could hardly be a better one.  So what is your response?   Stephen G. Breyer  And all the circuits have just been wrong in their interpretation.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't either.   ",04-514X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But that's why I'm quite curious, but I only have experience in one circuit.  And... and I have an impression, but I need to know what is the general practice.  I would have thought... but this is highly impressionistic... that probably the mandates didn't always issue within 7 days, that it wasn't totally uncommon to have them 10 days or 12, and it was fairly informal.  Certainly there were no notice, but maybe other circuits do it differently.  It's an area that's obscure to me, and I'd like to know how do people actually handle it.  Is it something that is generally within the... up to the individual court of appeals to provide notice or not or whatever as it wishes?  Is it that some delays, 6 months, might be really much too late?  Is it... how does it work in the circuits?   Stephen G. Breyer  And they don't normally give notice or... or something like that?

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But then--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I mean, what's bothering me about this case is, I don't know that the Government needs to argue that there is a different rule.  As I read the lower-court decisions, what they've done is used the words ""core operative fact"".  Core operative facts in a tort case, where the engine of Train A runs into the caboose of Train B, is that collision.  And the decision that the front... the locomotive should have been lit, as well as the back of the caboose, seems, arguably at least, the same operative fact.  Core operative facts.  But to say that a witness, in the middle of the trial, was treated unconstitutionally seems, at least arguably, quite a different set of core operative facts from the fact that the Defendant was questioned before the trial.  Now, that seems to me related to the nature of habeas, but it still seems to me that those words, ""core operative fact"", the same words, work differently in the two situations.  And to adopt your approach also strikes me as running around the one-year statute of limitations.  Now, those are my concerns, and I would appreciate your addressing them.   Stephen G. Breyer  Could we go back?  Because I'm still concerned with the fact that Claim 1, which is a claim on January 2 that police arrested the Defendant and didn't read him Miranda warnings properly; Claim 2 is a claim that, two and a half years later, the prosecutor, during the trial, made some prejudicial arguments.  Now, I think, just common sense, Do those arise out of the same core operative facts?  Absolutely not.  The facts are totally different.  The only thing that brings them together is that there was a single legal proceeding.  And, at the same time, if I adopt this approach that doesn't seem to comport with the common sense, I'm running around Congress' effort with the one-year statute.  So what is your response?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, but every lower court that has... not every one; you know better than I... but it seems like a commonly found expression when lower courts have interpreted the Rule 15 and have looked to Tiller.  Is that true, or not true?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, of course not in the habeas context.  I'm saying that if we're trying to apply, in the habeas context, the same test that's used elsewhere in the civil law, wouldn't we use the word ""core operative fact""?  Or would we?  I'm not as familiar with this as you.  What is the answer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No?   Stephen G. Breyer  But, of course, we're trying to decide what is the transaction.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  So what about the injury?  What about that?  That the injury... the trial's over, say, six weeks... the injury takes place at the time of introduction?  Or is the injury the whole time the... the guilty verdict?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why doesn't the 1981... given... maybe I don't... haven't followed it correctly, but why doesn't the 1981 claim, then, relate back?  I think the injury that took place from both violations took place at the time of trial.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, I--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Forget it.   Stephen G. Breyer  What about the other part of what's been bothering me?  To be specific about it, it sounds like a very good system.  The system is,  ""Habeas Petitioner, you file, within a year, your petition with one claim, and we'll look it over. ""  says the judge,  ""and if it sounds like you need a lawyer, we'll give you a lawyer, and then he'll come in with a whole lot more. ""  And that's quite protective.  But suppose you said that to Congress.  They passed this thing.  And you say,  ""You know, your year here, it doesn't really mean a year. ""  ""It means a year for this initial filing, and then what's going to happen is, they'll give him a lawyer, and he'll come back and say the interest of justice, but, really, it always, almost always, favors the Petitioner, and the State isn't that fooled, and, really, it's not a problem for them, and. ""  --what would that Congress have said?  That's... that is very much disturbing me.   INTERRUPTING ",04-563X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  There are two separate arguments here, and I'm trying to separate them.  I guess that many States have a doctrine in two areas of law.  Third party beneficiaries can sometimes recover; sometimes they can't.  Victims of efforts to interfere with a contract sometimes recover; sometimes they can't.  And one question is whether this particular individual fits within those doctrines.  And you have to be an expert on contract law to know.  But in respect to the civil rights law, I guess your position is... and this is what I want to know... that whatever those doctrines are, they have to be the same for white people as for black people.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So... so they might apply.  One thing you couldn't do if you're a State is have a different rule for black people that treated them worse than white people.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And has there ever been a case in respect, whether it's affirmative action or some other thing, that interprets that... that... this particular civil rights statute to say that for whatever historical reasons, et cetera, black people are entitled to more protection under contract law than white?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So how do we deal with this?  That is to say, do I have to become an expert on contract law, or do I say to the Ninth Circuit or the circuit, look, the... the question here is not what the contract law is except insofar as it's relevant to whether there's a differential in treatment?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but that's exactly what I'm asking.  If... if you win, this case is reversed, sent back.  I mean, what do... would I tell them?  And why not tell them, instead of having to delve into this, is, look, it's plausible here that third party beneficiary doctrine might cover this person?  It's also plausible not.  We're not experts.  We don't know.  You figure out what the normal rule is and apply that normal rule.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what about the other part of it, which is the... the interference with the contract?  Could we say the same thing there?  We send it back, say, look, we're not experts on this, it's a matter of State law typically, and be absolutely sure, please, that whatever doctrine you normally apply is applied to this case too because it's plausible.  He's the sole shareholder.  He's the sole beneficiary.   INTERRUPTING ",04-593X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is targeted enough?  I mean, I'm thinking here not necessarily your case, but in general.  Is a claim of discrimination... I don't know the state of the law, but maybe if a minority shareholder... a minority person is the sole shareholder of a corporation, maybe that corporation could assert protection, or maybe it couldn't.  But here, I take it that the corporation JWM brought an action and won or settled for $45,000.  So they're out of it.  Now we're just thinking about the sole shareholder, and the sole shareholder says there's another action here.  And as to the two most plausible ones that I would like to assert an action as a third party beneficiary, we've heard the other side say that you've conceded you have no right there.  And as to the other one, which might be protected in many cases, that the... knowing that what was going to happen, they deliberately interfered with the contractual relation between me and the corporation.  That's what we're asking about now.  And you say, well, I didn't raise that.  Now, is there a reason you should be given an opportunity to raise it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You conceded that out.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That might--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Then the argument for sending it back, if I understand it, is this, that when you look at the question presented, no one could possibly file a lawsuit... and you didn't... on the theory, well, I'm hurt, so somebody should pay me.  That isn't the legal theory.   Stephen G. Breyer  Rather, the legal theory here was that this contract related section of the law is violated.  And you want to say the simple fact that the contract wasn't between McDonald and JWM, that's a separate matter.  That doesn't bar you from bringing your claim.  So, on the one hand, you argue that I can bring my claim as long as I'm a target and the motive as to why they breached some other contract, the one between the two corporations.  And we seem to have it conceded that even if that's too broad, there are at least some circumstances where you could bring your claim.  One is if you were a third party beneficiary.  That's not present here.  And the second is if you are a target such that their action violates and interferes with a contract between you and your own corporation.  At least you have that going for you.  So you say, well, if I was wrong about the broader theory, give me a chance to allege the narrower.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm trying to be helpful in this respect.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  You have to say the certain kind of target.  The kind of target is that they--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --were discriminatory, aiming at me, et cetera.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you have an action--   Stephen G. Breyer  --on that in California?  Wouldn't you have an action in the State if somebody goes and deliberately interferes with your credit and so forth?   ",04-593X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So far, you're halfway into your argument.  I thought the basic question here was, first, whether a Court of Appeals, or anybody, can grant a J... what used to be called the JNOV without your making its... whatever it's called now... and without somebody making a motion.  And from your not opposing that, I guess the answer to the question is, of course not.  Of course you have to make a motion.  You have to make a motion for everything.  The judge is not a genius.  He can't... is not a mindreader.  And if you don't make a motion, you lose.  Okay?  Now, is there any argument against that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I... I mean, I thought... there are two parts to this.  Question one is, Can you possibly get a judgment... what used to be called a JNOV or a JMOL or whatever... from the Court of Appeals, when you didn't make a motion for it, after the jury came in, in the District Court?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They say,  ""Of course you have to make a motion. ""  And, so far, I've heard no response whatsoever to what I'd think is a fairly basic question in this case.  And I'm assuming: of course you have to make a motion.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But even if there were, how could this kind of error ever be plain?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, ever.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If there's no evidence at all.  You have a patent, and a patent is a monopoly.  And so, what... obviously, it monopolizes a market, it monopolizes the market of a patent.  And you'd have to be a genius in antitrust law to know something's wrong with that argument.  And so, how could it all be plain?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That has nothing to do with my question.   Stephen G. Breyer  You were saying that the mistake was that there was not sufficient evidence that there was injury of an antitrust kind, and that there was a market.  So, I'm saying a person who knows a little, but not a lot, of antitrust law would think,  ""Obviously, there's a market here. ""  ""There's the market covered by the patent. ""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Obviously, there's injury, because a patent allows you to raise the price.  End of the matter.  Now, that's naive, but somebody who doesn't know antitrust law thoroughly couldn't possibly think that there is plain error here.  What's the response to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What I'm worried about, to put all my cards on the table... if we were to say there is even a possibility of plain error in this case, the plain error exception in the rules would become a monster, wherein complex cases, people who hadn't made the proper motions would all be arguing plain error just as if they had.   ",04-597X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, maybe this needs... I mean, if were to clarify--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Sorry.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I... I wanted to follow up on this because I think it's a confusion that's embedded in my mind in some of the cases, exactly what Justice Scalia was asking you.  And I'd like you to comment on whether the confusion, as I see it, that's involved here is the words... arises out of the words, private right of action.  Private right of action is where, A, one private person sues B, a non-Federal person, under a Federal statute.  And the reason that can lead to confusion is because where you have a statute that governs the relation between the Federal Government and a private person, the words private right of action are out of place normally, because an action between the two parties takes place usually under the APA.  Now, that's what it seems to me is at work here because the real question is not whether we have a private right of action or APA review.  The question is whether Congress wanted to allow a private person to use this particular Federal provision as the basis for judicial review in a lawsuit.  And if that's the right question, the answer here is obviously it did.  It happens that we would have titled that normally administrative procedural review under the APA.  But whether you call it private right of action or you call it APA review is beside the point.  In Merrell Dow, Congress did not want actions to come into a court under the statute there at issue.  In this case, Congress doesn't mind at all.  In fact, it expects actions to come into court under this statute.  I'd like you to comment on that thought.   ",04-603X

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I guess that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But you told the... you said, judge, if you in fact hold that this claim 13 satisfies Section 112 and is sufficiently precise and specific and concise, if you hold that, then the claim would violate Morse?   Stephen G. Breyer  And you argued that specifically?  And so your problem... I guess that you said that.  I mean, you quote it in your supplementary brief on page 6.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it's the language.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what it said.  It didn't say Morse.  It said Diehr.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Dier incorporates Morse.   Stephen G. Breyer  As I understand.   Stephen G. Breyer  So your complaint about the paragraph on 17a is that it did not deal with that argument.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I imagine they'll say that simply mentioning it in an oral argument is not enough to get us to think seriously about it.   Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't understand the definiteness doctrine.  I mean, all these things in 1854 I guess weren't so clear.  But I think the precise claim in Samuel Morse's case was the use of the motive power of the electric current for making or printing intelligible characters.  That sounds absolutely definite.  Anyone can understand it.  I thought the problem there was that although anyone can understand it, you can't claim something as broad as that.  You must intend to claim something narrower.  And insofar as it's narrower, it isn't precise.  So insofar as it's broad, it's too broad, but definite.  And insofar as it's narrow, it's not there, but indefinite.  Okay?  Precisely the claim that they raised before the Federal Circuit and precisely the claim... with appropriate citations, and precisely the claim in respect to which the Federal Circuit said nothing.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  And we here apply the correlation to any homocysteine test, anyone here, anyone in the future, anyone that any mind might impend.  What's the difference?   Stephen G. Breyer  I apply electricity to all methods of putting down letters with electricity.  I apply the correlation to all methods of creating a homocysteine test.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, no, I'm not talking about going beyond it.  I just thought that line between definiteness and 101, 112, 101 is not quite so clear as I would have thought, because it sounds to me relying on the 1854 case of Samuel F. B. Morse, they're making the same kind of argument and, indeed, you translated Morse as a definiteness 112 argument, and yet it seemed to me that's the kind of argument they're making.   ",04-607X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Now what do you say in response to my question to the Solicitor General?   Stephen G. Breyer  That they thought it was obvious, that they thought that obviously the problem here with this particular claim is that it doesn't say specifically which tests this principle is meant to apply to.  So it isn't definite enough.  It never occurred to anyone that if you tried to apply it to every test, it was somehow a valid patent, so they made it in the definitive context.  Because for 154 years, it's been clear that you can't take a principle of nature like electricity and simply make a claim for all uses of electricity to create letters.  That's their analogy.  And they thought by referring to the cases and by referring to the failure to point out definitely what the tests were this applied to, it violated 112 because otherwise, it wouldn't be a valid patent, which everyone in the patent field would know.  That's at least, I think, what they're saying.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're onto something, to me, that is absolutely fundamental.  You have millions of doctors and scientists and computer people who are working extremely hard to think of useful ideas and if you don't give them an incentive, they may think of less.   Stephen G. Breyer  And they're all useful.  At the same time, if you patent all of their ideas, including very useful mini micro principle ideas, you will establish monopolies throughout this country beyond belief and it will be difficult for people, without paying vast amounts of money, to use their useful ideas.  So what principle do we use to separate the scientific idea which can't be patented from the process which can be?  I thought that the claim was settled by Morse, Flook and Diehr.  Now would it make sense... you can answer any part of this question you want.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Would it make sense to send this back and say, look, at least address their argument?  You can answer any part of that.   Stephen G. Breyer  But does that fall within it?  I mean, I can't resist pointing, as one of these briefs did, the phrase that anything under the sun that is made by man comes from a committee report that said something different.  It said a person may have invented a machine or a manufacture, which may include anything under the sun that is made by man.  So referring to that doesn't help solve the problem where we're not talking about a machine or a manufacture.  Rather we are talking about what has to be done in order to make an abstract idea fall within the patent act.  Now, sometimes you can make that happen by connecting it with some physical things in the world and sometimes you can't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if you have a clear statement other than Diehr, Flook, Morse, which draws that line properly, let me know.   ",04-607X

Breyer  In your view, were it not for the statute, the Federal statute, your view of the Attorney General's authority is... leaving that statute aside, if it weren't there... the Attorney General, should we have an Attorney General who is opposed to the death penalty, could, in fact, regulate or stop Federal... State death penalties, through this same mechanism, by saying that no physician can be registered insofar as he engages in that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what we're getting... at least what I'm getting at was this is, I would probably have read the statute to say that the drug statute, which is trying to stop drug addiction and heroin and... has nothing to do with the death penalty.  And I would think that the argument on the other side is that the statute has nothing to do with assisted suicide.  Congress didn't think about the death penalty, and it didn't think about assisted suicide.  It's rather like the tobacco case, except a fortiori.  Now, what's your response to that?   Stephen G.

""  but the Attorney General says,  ""Do what you want about State law. ""  ""I think it violates the Federal law. ""  Suppose I think the Attorney General does have the right to do that for... assuming it... assuming it... then what do you say about this case?   Stephen G. Breyer  Would you spend a minute--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm sorry, on that, I didn't think that the reg was defining the word ""dispense"".  I thought the statute defines the word ""dispense"".  And it's... persons registered by the AG to dispense controlled substances are exempt.  And then you look at who is such a person.  A person who does that is a practitioner.  And who is a practitioner?  A registered practitioner is one who prescribes, a physician registered by the United States to distribute or dispense a controlled substance in the course of professional practice.  And I thought this reg is defining  ""in the course of professional practice. ""  Am I wrong about that?  I thought it was a reg that says,  ""In the course of professional practice, the prescription, to be effective, must be a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner. ""  Now, I might be wrong.  How does it work?   Stephen G. Breyer  On the matter of policy, I would... since... if you... if you've said basically what you want to say in your argument, I would appreciate your devoting a minute to an assumption which you don't want to agree with.  But suppose I were to assume that a State is not free, through the device of defining what's good medical practice, to gut the Act... that is, to really make marijuana or something else, like morphine, legal... because they disagree with Congress's basic judgment that it should be illegal.  That could happen.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, suppose I think that the AG does have the power to stop Congress from gutting the Act.  All right?

Nebraska is, in a sense, a foreign and independent State.  And I guess, at some level, the tribes are arguing,  ""Well, you sell to us, our local retailer. ""  ""We, too, are a foreign and independent State, even more so. ""  ""So, if you're going to treat them this way... give the people in Nebraska a credit so they don't have to pay... why don't you treat us that way? ""  ""We drive on Kansas roads sometimes.

Breyer  Now, what... now you have the whole argument that I'm thinking of.  What do you respond?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's strange about it?  I mean, every upstream tax, as Mr. Olson said, raises the price of goods and services.  And it's harder to retail them, because they cost more.  So, that's true of every single good sold on the reservation.  So I take it your claim must... and, of course, it may or may not be true that the tribe can put a tax on that.  It depends upon supply and demand--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --That is not a--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But suppose they can't?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --That is not a--   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, my question is, If we hold for you here, and we don't take an absolute principle, well, I guess States are forbidden to put any upstream taxes on.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Your Honor--   Stephen G. Breyer  Why isn't that so?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Because that does not describe the tax that's at issue here.  The tax at issue here is imposed on the sale or delivery of fuel to the tribe on the reservation, and that is plain--   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, we ought to know, because they've been... haven't they had this for a while?  So, there must be a dealer somewhere who's not on the reservation... he's a distributor... somebody delivered to him a thousand gallons, and it's sitting there in his tank.  Doe he have to pay the tax, or doesn't he?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Your Honor, I don't... I think that you're... that he would pay the tax in that instance--   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if he would--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --but I don't think--   Stephen G. Breyer  --pay the tax, then it is not--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --I don't think so--   Stephen G.

I'd like to ask the question.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  I'm sorry, Your Honor.   Stephen G. Breyer  If... and you can say why this is wrong... if he gets a thousand gallons from whoever... Exxon or somebody... and he puts it in the tank, and he hasn't sold it, and he has to pay the tax, then it would seem to me to be a sale on the distribution to him, not the sale on his distribution to somebody else.  Now, why is that wrong?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  Because... two reasons, Your Honor... in the real world, what happens is the distributor picks up the fuel at the rack and delivers it to the retailer.  If the... if the distributor takes the fuel and holds it, he's not a distributor under the statute.  A distributor is somebody who receives and uses, sells, or delivers.  That's in... on page 2(a) of the red brief, Your Honor.  So that--   Stephen G. Breyer  So, now you're telling me something different from what I understood.  I thought you said it probably has happened in the history of this tax--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --I--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that a distributor picked up a gallon of fuel, held it, and has not yet redistributed it.  So, you're saying that's never happened.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Your Honor, I'm not aware of that happening.  But what I would say... the point that I would like to--   Stephen G. Breyer  If I'm certain about what the tax is on, what should we do?  Dismiss the case or send it to the... ask a question, or what?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Your Honor, I think that this Court can decide this question based on what the face of the statute is... itself says.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, suppose you're right.  Can you answer my first question?  Can you even remember it?  I'll summarize.  On your assumption.  Look, the Indians, if there is a tax... they have a retail shop or they have things on the reservation, they go buy them... Kansas can't impose a tax on what goes on, on the reservation.  We go through the balance.  But they certainly could impose a tax on the department store in Kansas City, couldn't they?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --That's right.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so, the Indian then goes to the department store and buys it.  He has to pay the tax, doesn't he?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now what he does, he says, ""Call up and""... he says, ""Please deliver it"".  Now he doesn't have to pay the tax?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  Your Honor, the answer is--  that's correct, and that's exactly what happens in the commerce clause when a person from Virginia buys something from Illinois and has it delivered to himself in Virginia.  They don't pay the sales tax.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is the commerce constitutionally--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  No, Your Honor, under interstate sales tax.   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  Well--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  It's the same situation--   Stephen G. Breyer  --we're now talking Federal rules.  Go ahead.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --I'm sorry.  It was... it's the same situation there.  The question is, Where does the relevant sale take place?  And it takes place... in the Virginia/Illinois situation, the sale takes place in Virginia, which is why you don't pay Illinois sales tax, though you may pay Virginia use tax.  It would be the same thing in the tribal situation.  The sale in that place, just like the sale in Central Machinery, takes place on the reservation.  And what this Court said, in Central Machinery, is that a sale to a tribe of goods on the reservation is... cannot be taxed by the State.  And, indeed, because this tax is on the sale on the reservation, the broader balancing principles apply.  The tribe here has imposed the... its tax on a tribal station, on a tribal land, right where this Court has said its tribal taxing authority is strongest, and has dedicated those revenues to improving the miles of dirt and gravel road on the reservation.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So, if balancing--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --But if I--   Stephen G. Breyer  --then how do you come out?  Because what they're saying is,  ""Okay, balance. ""  ""Fine. ""  ""You want to balance? ""  ""Here's how you balance. ""   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Your Honor?   Stephen G. Breyer  On the one hand, the Indians have to pay the tax.  Okay, that's true.  And it's harder for them to impose their own tax.  That's true of every upstream tax.  And it goes for roads that they use all the time.  And they just have a one and a half mile... and why shouldn't they be treated every... like everybody else, when they're going to use the roads the tax pays for?  So, the balancing works in their favor.  Now, what's your response?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  That the... Your Honor, we disagree with that at every level.  This... the tribal tax is addressed to a specific road... road problem that the Federal Government has identified and addressed in the Reservation Road Program.  The reservation roads are in abysmal shape, as the Federal Government has recognized.  More than 70 percent are in poor shape, poor condition.  The fatality rate is four times the national average.  And the tribe is using those revenues to fix... advance that particular Federal interest, which is reflected in Federal statutes and in the Federal regulatory scheme.   ",04-631X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if that's a winning... of course it is different, in the sense you say, but if, in fact, it's an interference... look, every upstream tax raises the price of goods and services.  Every upstream tax... indeed, every tax in the world... makes it harder to sell the product.  So, every tax makes it harder for the tribe to tax that item which was taxed by somebody else.  Now, if that's the basis for saying it's an interference, then every tax is an interference.  And I don't see how that could be.   Stephen G. Breyer  But, so far, your theory is based on economics, as I've heard it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But if it isn't, I would like to know what it is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The incidence of the tax--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Oh.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's very surprising.  When I read the statute, it doesn't have one word about the retailer being obliged to pay--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --anything.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right, if that's--   Stephen G. Breyer  --the legal incidence of the tax, I would think their side would win, in my mind.  Now suppose, actually, the legal incidence of the tax is not on that retailer, but, rather, is on the distributor.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If that's so, and if we get into balancing, which I don't know, what is to be said in favor of the Indian side?  It sounded to me as if it's harder for them to tax.  So, I'm thinking, well, that's true of every tax.  And then, put it on something else.  Put it on the tires.  Put it on anything else, if you can.  It'll be harder for them to tax nonIndians.  But I didn't know they had a Federal right to tax the nonIndians.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is the one other... the interest other than the interest on being able to tax an item that an upstream tax prevents you from doing because of the economics?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that the only one, or are there other ones?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I've got the--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I want to hear you and know if there's an additional one.  I'm not disputing that one.  I just want to be sure I get them all.  One is... one is that one.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What else?   INTERRUPTING ",04-631X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  There's no doubt that they could have... the trier of fact could have reached the same conclusion.  But I guess the problem is that when you go back to reopen the evidence the second time and the judges are sitting there, someone might have thought, well, the husband didn't die, and we don't know if he actually pulled the trigger on the wife.  And we're trying to guess what those judges would have done if they thought that.  I don't know.  It could be that people don't want to impose capital punishment without thinking I know that this person has killed somebody, and if that's so, they wouldn't have reached the same conclusion.  Now, I guess that's the problem because at that time on reopening, the State told that panel of judges pretty clearly by implication that the State thought that the evidence did support Stumpf having pulled the trigger, even though at that point the State knew and indeed referred to the statement to... you know, the confession and all the things in the second trial.  Now, what do you think about that problem?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They denied it, but as I read what the Ohio court said after the denial, I thought it did probably rest upon their determination that Stumpf had pulled the trigger.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Did you think that?   Stephen G. Breyer  It's the Supreme Court of Ohio that then I think I got my impression from, and of course, they don't know either.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The fact is we don't know what that original panel thought.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Absolutely right.  Of course, that's right.  We can't be sure what they would have done, and because we can't be sure what they would have done, I guess it might well have made a difference that the State told that panel we think Stumpf pulled the trigger.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's what gives rise to the problem in the case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --the State say when it comes to the panel, the reopening panel, we'll tell you something.  We think, indeed, that's what we argued, that the State... in the last case we argued that Stumpf didn't pull the trigger, that the balance of evidence is against that, but nonetheless, he should be sentenced to death.  That would make your position absolutely consistent with what you argued in that second trial with Mr.--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Mr. Wesley.   ",04-637X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask you a procedural question here?  When I read the... the Ohio Supreme Court opinion, my impression of their due process part of it is that they found a violation because of the inconsistency between the Wesley trial and the Stumpf sentencing proceeding.  When you started to talk to Justice Scalia, you agreed that couldn't be right.  Rather, you said there is an inconsistency between what the prosecutor said at the Wesley trial and what the prosecutor said when Stumpf made his motion to vacate.  Now, if that's so, I'm not sure that the Ohio Supreme Court or the lower courts have addressed that question to determine whether they really were inconsistent, and if so, what or why or what difference it made.  But I haven't read the record thoroughly, and my impression might be wrong.  So I'd appreciate your telling me what are the facts there.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Who is they?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not interested in what defense counsel did or did not say.  I'm interested in what the Ohio courts did or did not say.   Stephen G. Breyer  And my point there is my... do I repeat it or do you have it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Let's go to the circuit court of appeals.  When I read the decision of the circuit court of appeals in the due... what... what am I reading, which is... this is in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.   Stephen G. Breyer  They went on both grounds, first the confession... sorry... the guilty plea, and second, the inconsistency.  Now, there I thought that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals was... now, I think I misspoke because I think that's where I see the problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  You understand what the problem is or shall I--   Stephen G. Breyer  --The Sixth Circuit seemed to be addressing the inconsistency between the sentencing proceeding of Stumpf and the Wesley trial.  Well, you say the inconsistency we should focus upon is between the Wesley trial and the motion to vacate.  And I think you're right about that because I can't imagine the other being a problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's relevant in terms of evidence, but I think you're asking us to say that there is a due process violation because of the inconsistency between what the prosecutor said at the Wesley trial and what the prosecutor said when Stumpf made his motion to vacate.  Am I right?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  I'm asking you if the Sixth Circuit or the Ohio courts has addressed that question.   Stephen G. Breyer  So I read this.  You can't point to anything in which they have addressed that question.  My quick reading of it... I couldn't find anything in which they addressed that question.  And if that's so, what should we do?   INTERRUPTING ",04-637X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's a well established principle of administrative law.  I've never seen a case in administrative law where a party... a private party coming in and challenging a Government's action doesn't bear the burden of proof.  And Alaska isn't contrary to that.  Alaska, they were citing hornbook law, whether... what happens with the... if EPA normally does have a burden of proof when it challenges a State action, and that doesn't change, whether they bring it in a State proceeding or whether it's in a Federal proceeding.  I didn't think it was quite on point.  But maybe you know that I'm wrong on this.  And so--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --is there a... can you think of any instance, in all of administrative law, where you didn't start out with the idea that a person challenging a... an agency action that's been taken, and so forth, doesn't have the burden of proof?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I do think that, yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  There isn't?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Does this every come up?  I mean, the other thing I wondered about this... it seems to me you have a hearing examiner and a district judge who have actually said what is only a law professor's dream.  They say,  ""Oh, the evidence is precisely and equally in balance. ""  I didn't know that happened in the real world.  I--  [Laughter]  --I thought that their... that judges normally did their job, which is, you look at complicated evidence, and you say,  ""This side is a little bit better, or that side is a little bit better. ""  Has this come up in... a lot, where they say, in this area, ""Oh, it's exactly""--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --""# in equipoise""?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, that's true.  That's... I understand.  I sympathize with that point.  I'm worried, however, about the fact that this statute doesn't just cover the initial IEP.  It covers a whole range of things, including, for example, you have a hyperactive child.  The hyperactive child behaves badly in class.  The hyperactive child receives discipline related, say, to how it's placed.  Well, the parents might... properly, perhaps... think that was very unfair and wrong, and they might challenge that disciplinary mark.  There can be thousands of different kinds of issues that come up.  And, in all of these issues, is it supposed to be the burden of the school board, for example, to show that the teacher who had the child sit in the back of the class or received a bad discipline mark or something?  Does the... does the school board have to prove that the teacher was right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Wouldn't it, if it were related to the placement?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, I say that there are a number of... what I'm thinking of is a lot of interim decisions that come up that are affecting how the child is placed... whether in class, whether in that class, whether with a special teacher, whether without a special teacher, whether with somebody during the recess periods, whether not.  I mean, they're... these are very complicated matters, and there can be important overall matters, and there can be what I'd call interstitial matters.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What I'm driving at is... and I think it was well expressed in one of these cases, a New Jersey case, perhaps... but is it the same burden of proof whether the matter is interstitial or whether it's an initial placement or a change of--   Stephen G. Breyer  --placement? Do we have the same burden of proof always on the school board, no matter what?   ",04-698X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if I take... if I accept your view of that, that would be a Federal rule written into the statute.  And that would mean that, even if the Department of Education came to a different conclusion, or even if we have a bunch of States that come to a different conclusion, or even if it's in Minnesota, they want to have a rule that  ""sometimes it's one way, sometimes the other way. ""  we couldn't do that.  But if I were a Member of Congress, and never thought about the issue, which I think this void in the statute suggests, I might think it would work out better if we left it up to each State to do it whatever way they wanted here, if we left it up to the Department of Education to promulgate whatever rules they wanted.  Now, couldn't we hold that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you haven't suggested leaving it up to each State, because you're suggesting a uniform rule.  So, what... how would you have it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, it's just--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --a default rule.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If it's just a default rule, that's a big improvement, because any State can do it any way it wants.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But then, why not, here, send it back and say that the ALJ tried to answer the wrong question?  He tried to answer the question of what was the Federal law, but what he really should have done was ask about what's the State law.  And if he has a hard time figuring it out, perhaps he should look at that evidence harder and see.  Maybe--   Stephen G. Breyer  --No, but I've never heard of a State without law.  There is no--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --black hole in the law--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Why?  Why should it be?  I mean, that's very interesting to me.  Why shouldn't the law be such that particularly... you have evidence on both sides and a neutral decision maker who sits there... that it encourages that decision maker to decide.  It's one thing if the record's blank.  But not where they have a lot of experts.  Decide.  Don't retreat to something like announcing, ""Oh, it's in equipoise"".   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Sure, but then to do that is not really to look to the interests of the child or the board.  I mean, it is to allow a sort of doctrine from left field, nothing to do with the merits, to decide the case.   INTERRUPTING ",04-698X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it's not... the weakness in your point, I think, as I... as I understand it, which is a very optimistic assumption, given the complexity here--   Stephen G. Breyer  --is... is that you want to read (a) as if it applies to arising-under jurisdiction and not to diversity jurisdiction.  Very simple.  Arising-under jurisdiction, you do maintain jurisdiction over the original action.  You can add a claim, but as long as there's one good claim arising under, there's original jurisdiction.  Diversity, there isn't.   Stephen G. Breyer  If you add that plaintiff, you don't get the original... that's not right?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  So... so, in... in other words, in that situation, it's a third party claim by the defendant against another person.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So that's then... that does fall within (a).   Stephen G. Breyer  And then (b) knocks it out insofar as the plaintiff wants to assert a claim.   Stephen G. Breyer  But that person can assert a claim against a plaintiff.   Stephen G. Breyer  So that, you say, is the answer to what I was going to ask--   Stephen G. Breyer  --which is why didn't they just use the word 1331.  And the reason they didn't just use the word 1331 is there is a subset of diversity claims that also have to fall within (a).   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So the other thing, of course, is if these three professors who wrote this had... had figured this out so well, why in heaven's name didn't they at least write an article about it so we'd know what we were doing?  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, they're saying what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  If it does in the amount, it does so in the... if it's... if... you're trying to drive a wedge between the geographical diversity and amount.   Stephen G. Breyer  And they say you can't do that under the statute.  If you're prepared to say that bringing in a new plaintiff from the same State as the defendant does destroy diversity over the original action, you must also be prepared to say that bringing in a new plaintiff who only has $3 at issue destroys the original jurisdiction because there's no way, in terms of the original jurisdiction and the wording of 1332, to make that distinction.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you respond to that what?   Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly, but that's the reason for saying that... look, as I understand it... and this is... the... the thing that got me thinking they may have a point here is A, B, and C are dealing with three separate problems.  The first problem is how to overrule Finley without affecting anything else like Zahn or any of the others.   Stephen G. Breyer  The second problem B is simply Kroger.  B is how to make statutory Kroger.  And C is United Mine Workers v. Pennington to make sure they have discretion to get rid of supplemental jurisdiction.  Now, once you see it as three separate problems... I know they wanted me to see it this way, but once you see it as three separate problems, the words fall into place as long as you do interpret that word, civil action, to mean, well, there is no jurisdiction over the civil action where what's happened is you've simply added as a defendant a nondiverse party or you've added as a plaintiff a nondiverse party or a party that doesn't meet the jurisdictional amount.  Now, I spell all that out because I hope in the next 15 minutes you will tell me why that's wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  See, that... that's what I thought was their view of... of (b).  To go to (b), you understand (b), you have to go back before Kroger.  And Kroger was worried about some clever plaintiff, as you say--   Stephen G. Breyer  --getting a defendant.  He knows this defendant is going to bring a third party complaint against Smith from the same State, and he says, ha, I'll sue this defendant.  And analogous things happen with rule 19 and 24, not really with 20 they said, but 19 and 24.  And then Kroger says, hey, you can't do that.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so (b) was Judge Weis' effort to make sure that was codified.  It wasn't really meant so much as some kind of exception from (a).   Stephen G. Breyer  It was meant to have an independent basis there.  So I didn't see, if you give it an independent basis, how anything odd happens--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --by giving it their reading.   ",04-70XX
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What... what is the... can you... this is something I should know, but I don't know.  All right.  It's very elementary.  If you have two parties from different States, diversity claim, they're in court perfectly properly.  Now, if somebody intervenes under, say... say, rule 24 or suppose it's rule 19, a necessary party, and that destroys the diversity, does the... does the Federal court still have jurisdiction?  It does, I gather, under rule 14 if the defendant impleads or brings his own lawsuit--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --against a third party.  What... what happens under... that doesn't destroy it, rule 14.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I understand that.  What about 19 and 24?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So you mean by allowed that plaintiff is... one... he's from the same State and destroys the diversity.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He can do it, though.   Stephen G. Breyer  And what about under rule 19?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You could not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And rule 20 you could not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And rule 24 you could.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The difficulty, I guess, is that I'm having is let's imagine rule 19 or 24.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you're saying that is an instance where, if you bring the party in and he destroys diversity, you're out.  That was true before this statute.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So there... before this statute, there never is going to be a circumstance in which you bring in a person under rule 19 and diversity is destroyed.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now... now, this is one of the things that mixes me up here.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then... then what's confuse... now, we look at 1367(b) and it says the district court shall not have supplemental jurisdiction over a claim by the plaintiff against a rule 19 person who is brought on the defense side.   Stephen G. Breyer  Where the inconsistent... i.e., it would be nondiverse, but you said there couldn't be such a situation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Michigan plaintiff against Iowa defendant, necessary party, Michigan defendant, rule 19.  Now we bring him in.  And you're saying before this statute, not going to come in because it will wreck jurisdiction.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Well, then I'm going to stop asking--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --because it's very easy to me to reach the outer limit of my understanding.   Stephen G. Breyer  You could have before this statute.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  They could at least come in if the defendant--   Stephen G. Breyer  --under rule 14 joined another person.   Stephen G. Breyer  And then person X wanted to join--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that part of the action--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that could be a 19, 20, or 24.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I imagine that if you filed a claim and the plaintiff was a class and the class contained a number of people who did not meet the jurisdictional minimum and they file a claim against a defendant in a diversity suit, I imagine the first thing the judge would say would be, I've read Zahn and we don't have jurisdiction over this action.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, that was prior to the statute.  So... so they say, well, that's what the judge would have said, and moreover, if you had not a class action and you had three plaintiffs and one of them was from a different State than the defendant and the other two were not, the first thing the judge would say is, I'm very sorry.  There is not complete diversity.  I do not have jurisdiction over this action.  And so I take it their point is by coincidence or not, that's what this statute says.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And since that's what the statute says, that's what it means.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It means that this kind of a situation does not fall within 1367(a) because there was not jurisdiction over that action.  So I agree with you that those words are what their claim depends upon, but what is the answer to that contention?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  Finley happened to be an arising-under case, and in an arising-under case, as long as there is one claim that arises under, there is jurisdiction over the action.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Well, if you agree... and I'm... when I'm saying these things in such a definite tone of voice, they reflect deep insecurity because I--  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But... but I... I want to know what is the answer to that point.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I don't see... where I'm starting from this... because at some point I'd like you to get to the... the virtue of their position in my mind at the moment is, one, it is consistent with the language, which says civil action, not claim.  Two, it is consistent with the only instruction I read that any legislator gave to the people who were writing this, staff, namely, write something that's noncontroversial.  And third, I can, on their interpretation at least, I believe at least late at night, make sense out of all the words in these three different sections.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So at some point, I would appreciate your addressing that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They... they didn't make a recommendation one way or another on it.   Stephen G. Breyer  When he did this thing... when he was trying to write this statute, he seemed fixated on one thing, Kroger, and... and (b) seems to reflect an effort to make... put in statutory form Kroger.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, but they do say in no event should the enclosed materials be construed as having been adopted by the committee.   Stephen G. Breyer  Wait.  On your last statement, I... you... something that I hadn't focused on.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can you just... you said it doesn't make any difference.  I thought it's the defendants who want to be in Federal court.   Stephen G. Breyer  But they can't remove the action unless it could have been there in the first place.   Stephen G. Breyer  And therefore, this interpretation, if you're overruling Zahn, would have made a big difference because it would have meant the defendants could have brought a lot of cases into Federal court by the removal, and you would have seen the plaintiffs bar up in arms if, in fact, this provision would have allowed for easier removal.

And it cited, in the opinion, several... five factors... and I guess there are no others, though you can bring them out if there were... that supported you.  And the only two that seemed to say that it had something to do... that seemed to have anything at all to do with suggesting that there was no diversity... was Mr. Fred Chaney, which said that it was a partnership and not a company.

And they asked Mr. LeBeau, and he says,  ""Lincoln operates through many different structures, and I don't know what they were using here. ""  Am I right--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --or did I misread it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --what is the evidence?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where is it in the appendix?  It said that he... you sue person X, and I take it the reason that you won this case in the fourth circuit... which was surprising to me... was that a person called Mr. Franzen, who is a resident of Virginia, was a partner of the defendant.  Now, I would like... and, indeed, it was a partnership of which he was a partner.  So, if a Virginia resident is a partner of the defendant, which is a partnership, then maybe you were right.  So, I'm interested in What is the evidence that Mr. Franzen was a partner of the defendant, which is a partnership?   Stephen G. Breyer  What page--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --is that?  Is that a--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, that's better than what is in the opinion.  What is it?  181.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But to get the real parties before the court, you have to sue them.   Stephen G. Breyer  And, apparently, you didn't sue the right people until you replied to me.  Then I took your argument, because it seemed like seven arguments, mixed up, and I took that argument to be the following.  I'm... I, the plaintiff, sued a defendant, who is called the Lincoln Property Company.  Now, I grant you, there is some evidence that that defendant, the one I sued, is a Texas corporation.  One, they showed us the certificate of incorporation, or they got a sworn statement.  Two, in my complaint, I said that's what he was.  However, there is some evidence the other way.  On page 179 and 181, we have a person named Mr. Franzen who says,  ""I am a senior president, vice president, partner for defendant Lincoln Property Company. ""  in which case, if that's your argument, you're telling us... is that your argument, that there is some evidence the real defendant, whom I sued, is not a corporation, despite the apparent evidence to the contrary?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Rather, it is a partner, and Mr. Franzen is a partner in it.  Is that your argument?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you want to make that argument here, or are you going to give up on that argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'd like the... these are very expensive, this litigation.  You're all the way to the Supreme Court.  It's costing people a lot of money.  And if there is a legal issue here, I'd like to find out what it is.  I have exactly the same question Justice Stevens had, which is where I started.  Do you agree that the company you sued, called Lincoln Property, is a Texas corporation, yes or no?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then that's out... fine, that's out of the case.  The next question is... of course you could sue a real company, called Lincoln Property or Jolly Fisherman, and it could turn out that that real company is a front, that it has no real existence, its... all its papers and everything to do with it is signed by a totally separate corporation.  Are you saying that's what happened here?  And if that's what happened here, which is the real corporation and people in interest?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not talking about burden of proof failure.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm asking you, Who is the real corporation or person in interest that Lincoln Property is a kind of sham or front for?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Then you think--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm getting there.  I'm not arguing with you.  I'm getting there.  Then you think that whoever it is that they are the front for has... is a Virginia resident.  Is that what you think?   Stephen G. Breyer  Might be a Virginia resident.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Might be.   Stephen G. Breyer  You think there is a real party there that might be a Virginia resident.  And do you have any idea whatsoever of what that real party is called?   Stephen G. Breyer  And what's the evidence that there is a Virginia resident, in there?   INTERRUPTING ",04-712X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know how this came about.  I mean... I mean, I'm asking both sides the same question.  It'll sound very favorable to you, but if you answer it just yes, because it's favorable to you, I might learn, later, I was wrong, and you won't have had a chance to answer.  So, I want your honest opinion on this.  I don't know how this happened.  And I don't know... did you ask for en banc?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I don't know how the California Court could have read the opinion... which, of course, I wrote for the Court, so maybe I am reading things into it that weren't there... but I don't know how any judge could read that opinion we wrote and come to this conclusion.  I thought that it said, you know, on... that there are three issues... what's the word ""pending""?  Does the word ""pending"" apply to the time period between when the lower court decides a case and you appeal?  That's typically 20 days or 30 days.   Stephen G. Breyer  Are those 20 days or 30 days counted in the tolling period?  I thought part one clearly said the answer is yes.  Then we looked at California, and they don't have the words 20 days> [""] or 30 days> [""].  They say ""reasonable time"".  And then we said,  ""Still applies, because 20 or 30 days. ""  They don't have a radically different rule; it's a similar rule.  Then we come to part three, and it says, 45 days> [""].  There's... oh, 4 and a half months, wasn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  This isn't just 20 or 30 days.   Stephen G. Breyer  So, is it timely?   Stephen G. Breyer  And, there, I thought the court said... I mean, I was reading it... say,  ""Well, it's hard to say, because there might have been excuses for the delay. ""  What about the words that were written there, ""on the merits""?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  On--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But that had nothing to--   Stephen G. Breyer  --do with the case.  The lack of diligence had nothing to do with this aspect of the case.  But, what about the words ""on the merits""?  And there, what I think the court wrote is that the fact that it says ""on the merits"" doesn't prove it... what... it doesn't prove that it was timely.  Why?  And then I listed a bunch of reasons.  There are reasons.  Sometimes courts say ""on the merits"", even though it's delayed.  All right?  They say ""on the merits"".  Or because they want to tell the prisoner or... there are a lot of reasons why, all of which are listed.  So, we send it back to see whether this 4-and-a-half-month delay, given the excuses, was still timely.  We... all right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --we now get a case where it's 3 years.   Stephen G. Breyer  And the court says,  ""It's timely, because they used the word'on the merits. ""  ""'. ""  But I thought... I said, in the opinion, I thought the court adopted that the words ""on the merits"" do not decide the matter.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what do you--   Stephen G. Breyer  --do in those circumstances?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, but did--   Stephen G. Breyer  --you ask for rehearing en banc?  Because any judge, including me, can make a mistake.  What did you do?   Stephen G. Breyer  And you didn't ask for a hearing en banc.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why, when you--   Stephen G. Breyer  --get a fair... because any judge can make a mistake--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --why don't you just go and ask the Ninth Circuit to say,  ""Look, this is not... read the opinion, read what they said. ""  ""Correct it. ""   Stephen G. Breyer  It's worse.   Stephen G. Breyer  You're representing the attorney general of California, and you have a lot of litigation in the Ninth Circuit.  It's... I mean, the other side's going to answer on the merits, if they can.  And they're in an awkward position here, I understand.  But I need to know what to... what do you think we should do?  I mean, here, we write an opinion, and they--   Stephen G. Breyer  --it seems to perhaps, inadvertently or not... and the reason I turn to you is, judges are busy, they have huge dockets--   Stephen G. Breyer  --And, often, unless it's very clearly pointed out by the lawyers, or the lawyers take action, you get... waste everybody's time and money.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, in other words, he delays, after he gets the library access, for an extra year.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, is there any excuse they're making for that?  Because if you don't tell me, they're--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --going to tell me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  It would?  I thought--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --that was--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --an open--   Stephen G. Breyer  --question, frankly.  I mean, I can't imagine California would do this, but I guess if California did say that,  ""The period of time between the time you lost in the District Court and the time you filed, in every other State, is 30 days, but, in California, it's a reasonable time. ""  ""And what we mean by a 3 years, without any excuses. ""  --I guess, then, maybe the dissent in Carey v. Saffold would have been right in respect to that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It would have said that that isn't pending under Federal law, whether California says it or not.  So, the role of the Federal law versus the State law, I thought we left open.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you can't--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --defer to something--   Stephen G. Breyer  --under this statute, where Congress wrote the word ""pending"".  And I wouldn't have thought they did have in mind a--   Stephen G. Breyer  --State that says,  ""It's pending, even though you have no excuse and didn't file anything for 3 years, your appeal. ""  Now, I haven't heard that fully briefed and so forth, so I hesitate to express a final conclusion on it.  But it--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --since it's never going to come up, I don't think, I don't know I have to have a final conclusion.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They are--   Stephen G. Breyer  --but that's a--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that's--   Stephen G. Breyer  --How many cases are there on habeas in California every year, about?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I mean about.  Just give me the rough ballpark.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So, the... in the Supreme Court.   Stephen G. Breyer  So, there are 25... so there are several thousand cases every year.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Thousands.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So, I don't know what I'm doing with California procedure when I pass a... pass a law, is what it would be.  Write a rule, write a presumption.  I have no idea what I'm doing there.  They've worked out a system.  But I don't... why doesn't it work just to say to the lower courts, ""Do your job""?  What we said... and maybe it wasn't expressed clearly... maybe...  ""Courts, look, it says ""reasonable time""? ""  ""Now, reasonable time, in every other State is 30 days, sometimes 20 days. ""   Stephen G. Breyer  ""Sometimes the most, 60 days. ""  ""So, look and see if it was filed within a reasonable time. ""  ""That's all. ""  ""And if California passes... some specific thing says something special about it, of course, pay attention to that. ""  What's wrong with that?  They just would do it like they do any other thing of deciding what happens in--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, that is the problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, 180 days from what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean, you file--   Stephen G. Breyer  --the reply brief in the lower court.  Maybe the judge will take 4 months to decide it.  What's the relation?  I don't understand that.  Or maybe it'll take--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --2 days--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --to decide.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  What would the theory be?  I don't understand that.   Stephen G. Breyer  So, a judge... you file it. On day... what... you file it on April 1st, and then the judge decides it in August.  Or September.  And now it's only 3 days before the 6 months... you have to file your appeal, like, in 3 days.  That wouldn't make sense.  And the Congress would not--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --You can't--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --file an--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --appeal before... oh, maybe you can in California.  You're going to file the appeal before the lower court decides it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Even... or even before they get a lower court decision.   Stephen G. Breyer  They don't, at all.   Stephen G. Breyer  In other--   Stephen G. Breyer  --they don't, at all.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh.   ",04-721X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But, now, maybe I'm--   Stephen G. Breyer  --So, the difficulty of looking to that, which may be a good difficulty... I mean, that is a serious problem, but I thought what we wrote in the case... see, there are two problems here.  First, which was bothering me, had to do with our Court's relation to the Ninth Circuit, which may be simple and... as far as legally is concerned... but I'm not sure about it.  The other, which is much more interesting, is what you're talking about.  All right, now, on the first one, I read the words.  It says the words ""on the merits"".  The Ninth Circuit thought those three words meant that the California Supreme Court could not have considered the petition too late, for, after all, it decided it on the merits, just as with the cite.  Now, whether these words are right or wrong that follow, that's what we wrote.  The next words were,  ""There are many plausible answers to this question. ""  Sometimes, a court addresses the merits of a claim that it thought was presented in an untimely way.  Why?  Because they don't present any difficulty, and the timeliness issue does, or because it wants to give the reviewing court alternative grounds for decision, or maybe it just wants to show the prisoner we thought about the claim on the merits.  He, after all, doesn't have a lawyer.  He gets a postcard.  That helps him.  So, there are a lot of reasons.  And it says, ""Conclusion"".  Given the variety of reasons why they might have put the words ""on the merits"", the fact that they are there, those words cannot, by themselves, show that the petition was timely.  So, then I read what they wrote.  What they wrote is,  ""When the California Court denies a habeas petition without comment or citation, we have long treated the denial as a decision on the merits. ""  Okay?  And then it cites a pre Carey case.  ""Therefore, the summary denial was on the merits, and the petition was not dismissed as untimely. ""  citing two pre Carey cases.  Now, I don't see how, since I just said the words  ""on the merits do not end the issue. ""  --here, the words weren't even there, but they say,  ""We're treating it as if they were, and that ends the issue. ""  So, what do we do about that?  Then the next question, once I figure that one out, is, What do we do about the issue you're raising, which is quite important and interesting and so forth?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, we could work with that.  Now, that's, sort of, helpful, because if they say ""most are timely filed"", then the next question would be,  ""All right, what period of time is it? ""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You'd have to get some professor to go through these cases, and they could... they could figure out how long it is.  What do you think it is, from your experience?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But, I mean, is it more like a month, or is it more like 3 years?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   Stephen G. Breyer  So, there's a special reason.  In your case, is there really a year that isn't explained at all?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, forget that.  The library, I'll give you.  What's the rest?   Stephen G. Breyer  But... well, did your... did your client file an affidavit or something saying he didn't have access to the library during the whole period of 3 years?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --is there anything in the record that says, during the year after they said,  ""We'll change your job so you can get access to the library. ""  that he didn't have access to the library?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, all right, so what's his reason for saying that,  ""Last year, I was not able to file a petition in California Supreme Court? ""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, what does it say?  What does he say?  Go ahead.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --the next thing, what he actually says here, is that the C facility where he was confined was put into lockdown clearly into February 1997.  And this is all after he got access.  Then it remained quiet and lockdown free until August 11th, 1997.  So, that seems six months, on the most generous interpretation--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --where he's not in lockdown, and he has access to the library.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  About six months.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, here we have 180 days... 180 days, twice 90... with no excuse at all presented.   Stephen G. Breyer  What about this?  You might lose under this, but it... see, so you say... look, in every other State, the time for appealing from an appeals court to the State Supreme Court, asking them, is 20 days, normally, or sometimes 30.  So, if the Ninth Circuit gets a case in which it was longer than 30 days, then, irrespective of whether they say ""on the merits"", whether they cite a case, whether they don't say anything and just have a postcard, what the Ninth Circuit should assume that they've done is consider it untimely, in the absence of the kind of excuse that the California Courts might accept as an excuse.  So, then they'll look into that.  And if California, in the future, wants something different... which I'd be surprised... they will say that their system means that a 3 year delay, or whatever it is, is actually timely.  But, in the absence of some reason to think that, why not use the words, which would give you a chance to go back, and you could say,  ""This is not a case of total lack of excuse. ""  ""There is excuse of the kind that California would accept. ""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right, but we decided... I'd like you to suggest something to... from putting yourself in the... in an imaginary position.  Carey versus Saffold did have a dissent.  And four Justices joined it.  And let's imagine that, when I read the dissent, I see the... and then I look at this case... I see imaginary words on the top of the dissent, which are, ""We told you so"".  [Laughter]  And... now, therefore, think not of if you were arguing Carey v. Saffold afresh, but think of the words that are actually written there.  And now think of what happened here.  And now propose something, please, that will, in fact, deal with the problem that this case seems to present.   ",04-721X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean, that might have... you might have won if they had said,  ""We're going to look to see what the law is in Arizona governing a private person who performs a similar kind of inspection. ""  ""And we decide that it's the same. ""  You would have won that, I guess.  But you didn't, because they didn't.  That isn't what they said.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That is, we're not looking to the law governing private persons, we are just looking at law governing municipalities, and they're... it seems to me they are pretty clearly wrong about that, unless you give me a reason why they're right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's a good question.  Suppose you really had a person who... there's just no comparable private person in like circumstances.  I can't even imagine what that could be.  Maybe you could imagine.  But I was trying to think of some secret research on turning people invisible or something for military purposes.  I mean, I... it's just hard... I mean, hard here, obviously.  There is such a person.  There are private mine inspectors.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe there are not--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yeah, but Louie, according to the SG, says,  ""We say here that this person is not liable... the Government is not liable, because, in Washington, Washington would not make a municipality liable. ""  while adding that the law of Washington is that a municipality is liable only if a private person in Washington is liable.  So, I wouldn't think Louie is very good authority that the ninth circuit thought it was for the proposition that you look not to the private person, but you look to only the municipality.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I'm just--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --reading from their brief. What they say is, the court stressed that the equivalence is important.  The equivalence of what?  Under Washington law, State and municipal government entities are liable only to the same extent as a private person.  And they cite page 825.  And they stress this equivalence, because a finding of immunity for State employees under State law does not determine the scope of the U.S. liabilities.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, anyway, if Louie helps something other than that, it's wrong, too, isn't it?  Because what the statute says is, it's a question of looking to the--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --private person.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's actually a rather interesting question I don't really know the answer to.  The idea is that you can't find an analogous private person.  We might have to write something about that.  You could say... you... there always is an analogous private person.  It's impossible to think of an example.  The other extreme, you have the ninth circuit, which could... which says as long as the Government was involved in regulation, there is no analogous private person, because private people don't regulate.  I would think that was almost certainly wrong.  But what is the right way to go about it?  Are there such people, or aren't there?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  See, that's exactly what's concerning me, and I don't quite see my way to an answer.  Suppose we do send it back because we think just what you said wasn't so is so, they have to now into this.  They'll have to go into it.  Should we suggest,  ""Look, you try harder to find a private analogy, because there's almost always a private analogy. ""  Every Government official has some similarities to private people, and some differences.  So, we could emphasize that, or we could suggest,  ""No, actually, there are quite a few differences. ""  I don't have much of a feeling for which way to go on that.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, that's not... that's not what I've been asking.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And to expose everything I was... perhaps the better thing is to say, ""There's always a private analogy"", or try very hard, because if you really found an instance there was no private analogy to, maybe there would be no recovery, because the statute simply speaks about private party.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And this is a statute designed to give people recovery--   Stephen G. Breyer  --when people commit torts.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, it does, but that... would we end up there, because of the way the statute's written?  You avoid the whole matter if you say,  ""Look for the closest private person, no matter what. ""  And maybe that's--   ",04-759X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it would depend.  That's why... really it's a question for Mr. Alioto, but I want to know chapter and verse citations.  Pan Am and Grace meet before they set up Panagra.  Of course, they talk about price.  But what do they say?  Suppose what they say is you, Panagra, have the power to set price.  Normal.  You, Panagra, have the power to set price but never below $14 a ticket.  That wouldn't be normal.  What are they trying to do there?  They're trying to protect Grace.  So I think a lot would depend on what they said in the preliminary meeting, and of course, what I want to know is this is a summary judgment motion where, as the other side pointed to particular conversations that they made which would say it's more like the second than the first.   Stephen G. Breyer  It may be, but still at some point they discussed it and I would like to know what they said.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, that's a surprising concession to me. We... we found a... a joint marketing company.  All right?  And the whole point of this is to set single prices.  And you're saying when they... and the venture, let's say, is approved by the FTC, the joint selling agency.  The purpose of it is to set a single price to sell in France or something.   Stephen G. Breyer  And you're saying now we're going to go look at their prices that they set and decide if they're reasonable?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe there is.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's exactly right.  I would have thought there's no competition because there are not two independent decision makers.   Stephen G. Breyer  It has nothing to do with the prices that end up.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe you could explain to me how this did work.  The... the... my understanding, which might be not correct, is we have some facilities that refine gasoline and there are some people who take the gasoline that is refined and they sell it to gas stations.  Now, those facilities and those people now work for one hierarchy of officials called Equilon.  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So somebody has to say what price it's being sold at.  Equilon's gas.  Who decides it?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  What is it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No. I imagine there are some human beings in Equilon called marketers, and those human beings in Equilon who work for Equilon would say Equilon will sell the refined gasoline to gas stations at such and such prices.  That's normally how a company works.  Is there something different about this?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is their view of it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The Texaco product being a product that comes out of refineries that previously belonged to Texaco or the Texaco product being gasoline that comes out of either refinery but is sold to stations labeled Texaco, or both?  Which?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right. I could see how that could be a violation because it's possible that Equilon, if left on its own, would decide that its best marketing strategy was sometimes to set a differential.  But now they can't do that because the two parents have agreed that they can't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that what happened?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That would be rather like Pan American and Grace saying that, Panagra, charge whatever price you want, but above all, don't go below $50 because remember, we, Grace, have some ships out there and we want people to take the ships.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, that's right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Let me go back for a second.  I'm just trying to get it clear.  My... my belief... I've always thought that Citizens Publishing was a case where the district court said that the formation of the joint operating venture... the basic formation, which involved a stock acquisition... violated section 7.  And then they created a decree.  And the question was... for the Supreme Court was whether the district court was right in holding there was a section 7 violation.  Now... now, maybe I'm wrong on that.  I'll go back and look at it.   Stephen G. Breyer  If so, if I'm right on it, then what we're lacking from your point of view here is a claim that this whole joint venture is unlawful.  And I agree with you.  If you make that claim, I don't think the FTC can insulate it, I guess, unless there's something I don't know about, but you're not making the claim anyway.  So here, unlike Citizens Publishing, we're... we have to deal with this on the assumption that the joint venture is lawful.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't see how to get out of that, but maybe you can tell me I can.  But wait.  Now, what I'm trying to get at is what precisely is your claim, given the lawfulness of the joint venture?  One part I see.  One part I see is that the people who are setting the prices are the board of directors of a venture company who represent Shell and Texaco.  Now, that might run up against Justice Scalia's objection.  But I want to sure... sure I have all of them.  That is, I want to know if there's some other claim you're making here in respect to an agreement between Shell and Texaco as to Equilon's prices.  And if so, what is it and where is the reference in the record?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  7.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That... that might be.  But I don't want you to forget the last part of my question, which for me was the most important, because I can read Citizens Publishing, but it's going to be tough for me to find in the record any claims that you make that the two companies have agreed as to price, like the Panagra example.  That's why I gave it, to put it in your mind.  So if there's anything like this that you're claiming, I'd like to know, or is your total claim that the activity of Shell and Texaco in setting the price of Equilon is to have their representatives on the Equilon board of directors tell Equilon what price to sell?  Or is there something else?  I just need to know.  Is it just that, or is there something else in this case?   Stephen G. Breyer  Was it the board of directors that did that, or was it something else?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but that... that sounds like the complaint that you're making.  We have a problem, say, with... with the newspapers or whatever it is.  It's awfully dicey as to whether they should form this joint venture.  It's going to eliminate a lot of competition.  But now what you're saying is, look, at the very least, they should structure it in a way that the independent pricing decision is made by Equilon.  Don't structure the pricing decision so that bit by bit, day by day it's made out by six people, half of whom represent Shell, half of whom represent Texaco.  I can see that as an argument.  This is more restrictive than necessary.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you get me that far, and now I... I... but I say why isn't that a rule of reason because you're really fighting the structure of the venture they come up with.   Stephen G. Breyer  Really?  Suppose we walk into a department store.  In the department store, we see three perfume counters, and there are three salesmen, one behind each.  Do they compete in price?  The answer is obvious.  Of course, not.  Of course--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.  Three counters.  They sell perfume.   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course, they don't compete.  But do we know the department store has to be run that way?  I mean, maybe some places it isn't.  We can't prove it has to be run that way.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Think of a... think of a mall.  Think of a bunch of shops.  Maybe it doesn't.  Maybe they could compete.  The reason that... the law says they don't have to compete is because the law thinks in general it's a reasonable way to run a department store without forcing your sales people to compete.  And similarly, a joint venture.  You can't prove they have to have the price set at a central place, but the reason they set it at a central place, because it's a joint venture.  And that's seems to me what the cases are consistent with.  You tell me which one is it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, the answer is no.  You're right.   Stephen G. Breyer  If that were a real rule of reason argument, did you waive the rule of reason here?   ",04-805X

Stephen G. Breyer  All right. Well, suppose what they do is... this is... it seems to me this case is like a first year law school hypothetical.  But, I mean, the... suppose that the... what they do is, he puts the mail on the porch, my package, and he rips it open, negligently; and there for everyone to see is the toupee that I ordered.  [Laughter]  And I sue... I sue for public humiliation.  See?  I mean, what about that one?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, what I... to sort of my cards on the...

Breyer  --on the other--   Stephen G. Breyer  --On the other... no, they... see, it... he put it on the porch, which is transmitting it, in such a way that it fell open.  But I'm just trying to think... and then the... on the other side of it, you have the automobile accident.  And I guess he comes along the street, the postman, swinging my package around, and bops someone on the head with it.  I guess that's covered.  And then, this case is somewhere in the middle.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what's the principle according to which we're drawing it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, ordinary tort doesn't quite work, because I guess my public humiliation case is... could be an ordinary tort.  Somebody could go up to the porch and rip it open, nothing to do with the mail.  And, moreover, somebody could, in fact, delay the transmission of my inheritance.  See?  They could.  So, all those things could be ordinary torts.   Stephen G. Breyer  Doesn't it have a... in good condition.  Therefore, when they put it... therefore, I guess, ripping it open is, in fact, not in good condition, so maybe that is immune.  And leaving it on the porch in a position where somebody would trip over it, you might say they didn't deliver it in good condition, because what they're supposed to do is place it somewhere where you don't trip over it.

If the Court says... well, anything that's special in respect to transmission of live alligators, because it's the mail, et cetera, delayed... or I... I don't know how else you'd get a tort out of it.  But if it's simply the kind of thing that anyone could do, like driving a postal truck or leaving something on a porch that somebody trips over or walking along the street swinging the live alligator over your head, or whatever you do--  [Laughter]  --that kind of thing that anybody does just coincidence its the postman whose doing it... that kind of thing doesn't mean to fall within the ""transmission"".  Now, suppose that that was the holding.  How would the Government be hurt?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What we'd look to is, you'd look to the purpose of this.  The purpose of it was, basically, I gather from the history, as recounted in Kosak... in what the Court said in Kosak... the purpose of this is to try to bring back into sovereign immunity, so you're not sued all the time, the very kind of common suit that a person could protect himself for the loss by registering the package, by taking out this ordinary transmission insurance, which is not that hard to do.  So, they said, if we start opening it up to misdelivery claims, all that pack... family of things, everybody'll say,  ""Hey, you hurt my pet, you didn't give me the check. ""  I mean, all kinds of things will be opened up.  But the Government's already liable for what I'd call the ""swinging the package around"", leaving it... slip and fall, trucks.  So that falls on the other side.  Now, how does that hurt you, the Government, if that's how we'd come out?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you can't get too far--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --with the text.  I think you have a great claim, and so does the other side; but if it's just the text, that's not my question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The question is, If I think the text is perfectly ambiguous on this, I look to the purpose, suppose I came out the way I just said.  How would the Government be hurt?  is what I want to know.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, if--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --in fact, you have a driver of the truck, the postal truck, and what he does is, he puts the mail in the truck, so my skis, which I have shipped by mail, happen to stick out the side, and, as he walk... drives along, he just mows down the pedestrians.  [Laughter]  I take it, on your theory, that that... there is no lawsuit.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But are... you got the... well, that's exactly the point I'd like you to hone in on, because I don't see what's... you say, ""Well, we're defenseless"".  Why are you more defenseless than any other business that leaves things on porches?  That might be, you know, 482 million apple deliverers or Domino Pizza people.  I don't know.  Or they... they ring the bell, probably, but some... McDonald's hamburgers, lots of... department stores.  I mean, a lot of people leave things on porches.  So, why are you more defenseless than they?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Well, that's--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --that's what people are likely to trip over.  I mean, they're not likely to trip over a letter.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Breyer  I thought the Higher Education Act said... as of what year did the Higher Education Act say,  ""No statute of limitations applies to us? ""   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  In--   Stephen G.

Stephen G. Breyer  So, in other words, you're saying that that provision of the later statute that says,  ""Go get 'em on Social Security. ""  implicitly reads into it the 10 year bar that's in a different part of the statute.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, it's as if it said,  ""Go get 'em on Social Security, under 407, which is gone now, but only for 10 years. ""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that what your... I'm trying to understand this.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The only problem is, it doesn't say that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --You can call it any purpose you want, but there is an earlier word in 9... 1091(a), just what Justice Kennedy said.  The earlier word says limitations don't apply to the higher education debt.  And so, if this later statute, the words you're talking about, the words of 10 years> [""], the words that limit when you can do it, if those words, which are in subsection (e), are a ""limitation"", then I guess the earlier statute says they don't apply to the higher education debt.  And so, I don't see how you get out of that.  I mean... I mean, this is a rather harsh result.  I understand why you'd like to get out of it.  But I don't understand how we do get out of it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, it... I mean, you... it's... it probably comes up a lot.  You have... you have the earlier act that imposes... suppose you have some... Endangered Species Act and... at an earlier time... and it says all provisions of a certain kind will have this effect in respect to endangered species.  And then you have some laters act... later acts.  And, in those later acts, there are certain things about how to treat certain animals and so forth.  And the question would be,  ""Well, does that earlier thing, telling you how to treat an endangered species, apply now to the animals in this later act insofar as they're endangered? ""  And the answer would be, ""Of course it does""--   Stephen G. Breyer  --unless there's some special reason--   Stephen G. Breyer  --for thinking that it doesn't.

I saw something here, that a person who's going to get this offset, and he has Social Security, you exempt $9,000 of the Social Security, and then you limit it to 15 percent of the remainder or whatever is reasonable, whichever is less.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But... yeah, I think he's... one argument that they're emphasizing, anyway, is that... you look at the Debt Collection Act, and suppose it had said the following,  ""Section 207 is amended, or changed, as follows. ""  ""We refer specially now... we can collect, through offset, but only for 10 years. ""  ""I mean, only to claims that are more than 10 years old.

The statute says,  ""We bestow upon the Social Security agency a very limited power. ""  And it says,  ""This is the limited power.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Tell me, if you're... if you're right... let's suppose you're right.  I'm over here.  That's--  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  That's all right.  So, it's hard to figure out, because the direction... you can't tell by the sound.  I don't know if there's a modern system that would help with that, but... you're right.  Suppose that the State... suppose you're right.  What I'd worry about... and I'd like your response to this... is that in bankruptcies, or weak firms... a lot of firms are weak, and they owe a lot of money to the States.  So, the States figure this out after a while.  It takes a few years to seep through, but once they see what they can do, they say,  ""Here's what we'll do. ""  ""Settle your claims against the State, which happen to be pretty good, for 50 cents on the dollar. ""  ""Give us the money. ""  ""And you're... we're out of it. ""  So, they settle it.  A month later, phhht, bankrupt.  Now, two things have happened.  The States got 50 cents on the dollar, every other creditor gets 5 cents on the dollar, because they were a month ahead of it.  The second thing that happened is, the creditor... the firm lost the chance to come in and be rehabilitated.  So, the result of this is two bad things, bankruptcy's law's basic purpose, to treat creditors fairly, bankruptcy law's basic purpose, to give firms a chance to rehabilitate, are both seriously undermined.  So, given the Bankruptcy Clause in the Constitution, how is it possible to say that Congress does not have the power to prevent those two very, very seriously harmful results... harmful in terms of the basic purpose of the Bankruptcy Clause?   Stephen G. Breyer  But there is not a Tort Clause of the United States Constitution.  There is not a Contract Clause.  And there is a Bankruptcy Clause.   ",04-885X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I thought (b) and (c)... tell if I'm right about this... but suppose an individual bankruptcy, and sometime prior to the bankruptcy the individual got into an automobile accident and ran into a State building and wrecked it.  All right?  Now, I take it that, in a State that hasn't waived sovereign immunity, that individual, were he not bankrupt, might not be able to bring a lawsuit for his damages caused by a claim that the wall was too high or something.  Each is claiming the other is negligent.  I guess the person wouldn't be able to file.  And the fact that he's bankrupt, he couldn't, either.  Okay.  Now, in (b), I guess it's saying that if the State happens to come in, after he's gone bankrupt, and brought his negligent suit against him, he can respond.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, if, in fact, you were to lose on (a), I guess the whole section would fall, because it wouldn't make any sense anymore, and we'd just wipe out the whole thing, (a), (b), and (c).   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So, then the case really turns on the extent to which the Government can... sorry, the extent to which Congress can waive sovereign immunity, as they seem to have waived it in (a), whether the Constitution permits them to do what they did in (a).   Stephen G. Breyer  And if you win on that, you win.  And if you lose on that, the whole section 106 would probably fall.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not sure, because if you lose on the whole thing... suppose you were to say Congress doesn't have the power to do anything there.  I just wonder if (b) and (c) would survive, because they may have had something else in mind.  But maybe that's too complicated to go into now.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no, he's... so, I'm wrong.  What I said is wrong.  The answer has to be that... we're only talking about (a) at the moment.  And what Congress tried to do in (a) is abrogate sovereign immunity insofar as it is constitutional to do so.  So, then, you say, if you lose on it, it's unconstitutional for it to do so here, but it could... it is constitutional for it to do so insofar as there is this situation that the State brings a case against the estate, and you can do an offset, et cetera.  But it would have nothing to do with (b) and (c).  It would have to do with reading that into (a), I guess.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  A light bulb went out.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So, you go back to the language... are you finished with that answer?  Go ahead and finish, if you want.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  In respect to the language, how do you read it?  I think it's ambiguous.  ""To discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities. ""  Do you read it... ""different purchaser""...  ""to discriminate in price in respect to that commodity that is purchased? ""  Do you read it  ""to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities... i.e., the commodity, the particular item... the commodity there refers to the particular item in respect to which there is the discrimination?

I agree with you, policy reasons, very strongly on your side.  I agree with you, at least hypothetically, but for the particular language.  So, look at the phrase and read the language as you want me to read it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're giving--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --me a policy argument.  I don't want a policy argument, for the moment.  I want to know... what you're saying is that the word ""purchaser"" means  ""purchaser in respect to the particular commodity... this one that is purchased, there has to be a discrimination in price. ""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And what you're hearing, I think, is, well, this person, the dealer, bought other items in respect to which there was no discrimination in price.  So, he is a purchaser of that commodity.  You see, ""commodity"" could refer to the kind of thing... Volvo trucks... or it could refer to the particular thing... this truck.  And I want to know how you read the literal language.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's all I want--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --the textual answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, no, no.  I'm very--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --sorry.  The effect of such competition--   Stephen G. Breyer  --was conceded in this case, that there's the effect on the competition.  There are two separate things.  There is the truck that was purchased by the disfavored dealer.  In respect to that, he wasn't hurt, in the sense of the statute, because, even though he got a lower profit margin, that doesn't count.  I'm not focusing on that.  I am focusing upon the truck that he did not purchase.  The reason that the disfavored dealer did not purchase that truck is that he had a rival... maybe there's only one case of it, but there's at least one... he had a rival, the favored dealer, who got the purchase.  He got the order from the customer, and then ordered the truck.  Now, in that one, I take it, the problem is that there was no purchase by the disfavored dealer.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But what you're hearing is,  ""So what? ""  ""He was a dealer whose line of business was to purchase Volvo trucks, and, therefore, he is a purchaser of a commodity... namely, Volvo trucks. ""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And there was a discrimination... namely, the offer was discriminatory.  And there was a harm to competition, in the... in the Robinson Patman sense... his rival got the sale.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, I want the textual answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The effect of such discrimination is that his next door rival, in effect, ""got the sale"".  Do you want to say that isn't enough?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let's assume I don't agree with you about that.  Now--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --what?   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  That's--   Stephen G. Breyer  --You've put your finger right on it.  My question is so obvious that you're not giving me an answer.  Every case for 60 years has been on your side of it.  Those judges, though, were... must have been reading some language.  And how did they interpret that language?  That's all I'm asking you.  A very literal question.  It has nothing to do with policy or anything.  And all I want you to do is take the statute and read the language so that it is possible for you to win this case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?  The... Hiland... is that the one?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Hiland Dairy?   Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, a... I mean, you could go in... I see that.  But what... is there any authority for that, that just one... a head to head competition, he bought the truck.  Let's... keep that out of it, so imagine they bought the truck, they resold it, and the market structure is such there probably is quite a lot of competition, in fact, with other dealers, and they lost at least one sale.  That's not enough to prove an injury to competition?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's the authority for that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's a different matter.  That's a... what... I'm saying, What authority is there... have there been cases in which that was not viewed?  After all, let's suppose the dealers are located geographically in about the same place, and it's logical to think they'd go for the same customers.  They overlap.  Their territories are close.  Logical to think people shop around for trucks.  And we have in the record one item where they... one instance in which they found the customer, and he said,  ""Yeah, I did... I did go and shop in both. ""  ""I lost. ""  --the disfavored dealer lost the sale.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Any authority?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  This is the Robinson--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --If it's not, the... the reason... I thought, for about 60 years, the words ""different purchasers of commodities"", it forbids any person to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities.  Now, you have to refer... as soon as I ask the question, or start getting into the language, I forget the statute, and it's so complicated that I'm giving you time to think about it--  [Laughter]  --and to think of those words in your mind.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's a... it's forbidden to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I had always thought... and I think the courts' decisions bear that out, or the absence of decisions... that the words  ""discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities. ""  meant you can't discriminate in price between different purchasers of the item, or items, in respect to which the discrimination of price exists.  That's what I thought it meant.  And it seems to me that was the general understanding in the antitrust bar, that was the general understanding of the courts.  And either it's not permissible to give such an interpretation... I don't know why it wouldn't be; it's literal... or there's a good policy reason for not doing it in respect to the policy.  And in respect to the policy, what worries me about the broader interpretation is suddenly doing what Volvo... forbidding Volvo from doing what it probably wants to do here.  If it wants to get rid of its dealers, it's because it wants to compete better with other brands.  And that means lower prices for consumers, though individual dealers might be hurt.  So, if I'm trying to read that law consistent with 60 years of history, and the basic purposes of the antitrust law, I guess I would... might favor your opponents in this.  I'm exposing my entire line of thought.  I'm trying to protect interbrand competition, why... while, at the same time, not being... not being unfair to the purposes of Robinson Patman; and, therefore, I'm reading this fairly literally, as it's been read.  So, what's your response?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I said... I said they... in... the problem for you is that, in respect to discrimination between the item, or items, the... in respect to... the purchase of the item, or items, in respect to which the discrimination existed.  Insofar as there were items, or items, purchased, there is no discrimination.  At least there is no discrimination that... in terms of the injury of the statute, creates that kind of injury.  In respect to instances where you have a strong case of the right kind of injury, there was no purchase, defined as I just defined it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, let me deal--   Stephen G. Breyer  --with the latter.  I will say--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --there are some items where your client bought the truck.   Stephen G. Breyer  When he bought the truck, he got the sale, although he earned less profit.  Put those to the side.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let's focus--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --But you are.   Stephen G. Breyer  Let's focus--  [Laughter]  --on the items... let's focus on the items where he didn't get the sale.   Stephen G. Breyer  When he didn't get the sale, there was no purchase of the item, or items, from the manufacturer in respect to which the discrimination existed.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay?  Now, it's that second class--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Of course it's distinct.  Of course--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Oh, well, you have a--   Stephen G. Breyer  --You suggest something very... to me, quite interesting, but it would be quite a departure, I think, from prior law that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --If you want to go look at this, you know, you say, all right, here's... we should be realistic about it.  We're going to be realistic.  Realistic, they... we're only now looking at the cases where they undoubtedly bought the item, but the profit was lower.  There's no purchaser problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  But they got a lower profit.  And I think, there, the mine run of cases is against you that that counts as an injury.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Yes, but it's... you know, it shows that they're going to be hurt, that they may be driven out of business.   Stephen G. Breyer  Indeed, the market in... the dealership market, whatever... if that's a separate market, which it might be... becomes more concentrated, and the result of... you know, I could make a... tell a little story there that would be quite consistent with the purposes of the antitrust law.  So we follow that approach in this case and say goodbye to Morton Salt, because Morton Salt, after all, was a case that was quite formalistic.  It didn't really look to the injury to competition in a market.  It had a formalistic slogan that would, in fact, be a proxy for that.   Stephen G. Breyer  So, what do you think of that?  We follow your... we follow your advice, we say,  ""Okay, we're going to be very realistic in the future. ""  ""Forget the presumptions. ""  ""And, Court, look to see whether competition, in the sense of increased concentration through people going out of business, will lead to higher prices with the ordinary antitrust proxies there.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can you--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Can you--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, can't you under... look, first imagine that they don't want to introduce one word from the mother's mouth that isn't already in that transcript.  Imagine that's the circumstance.  If that's the circumstance, then I should think there is no doubt, under Oregon law, that those words in the transcript are admissible.  And I believe that under Oregon law... and I'm not certain... that, an ordinary case, a death eligible person does have the right to argue in the sentencing proceeding.  Think back over that trial jury and you will see that there are doubts as to whether this man is guilty or not.  Am I right... am I right on the first part?  Am I right on the second part?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  In other words, prior to this case, in the State of Oregon, where there was a death case... maybe there weren't very many, but where there was one, under Oregon law... we have the trial; immediately thereafter, the sentencing, and the lawyer had no right to argue, under Oregon law.  Think back about your certainty as to whether this individual is guilty.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, all right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And did the court say, here... the Oregon court, in this case... one, ""You can introduce evidence"", which it seems to have been mistaken about, about not being there, but that, second, the Federal Constitution gives you the right to argue the residual doubt?   Stephen G. Breyer  Ah.  ""Consider the evidence"" is different from  ""making an argument about the evidence. ""  And what I didn't see in the argument, majority opinion, is a statement that not only can this evidence be introduced... because, after all, in a normal case, the jury's heard it--   Stephen G. Breyer  --It's the same jury.  But I didn't see, anywhere, where they addressed the question about what kind of argument the defense had the right to make at the sentencing trial in respect to the residual doubt that they might have from what they just heard.  Can you point, in that opinion, to where they made that statement that you just said they made about the argument?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that isn't the thrust of my question, of course.  The thrust of my question is that if, in fact, this evidence from the mother comes in under State law, it comes in under State law, because... I have the cite; you know the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --section I'm referring to.  If it comes in under State law, and they're not trying to prove anything else, and the holding of the Oregon Supreme Court is about what evidence is admissible, and not about what arguments to be made, I don't see what reason we would have to reach an issue that isn't in the case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why is--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --What about Oregon revised stat 163.150?  It says,  ""In a capital sentencing proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that all evidence previously offered and received may be considered for purposes of the sentencing hearing. ""  Now, that's Oregon law.  It's long been there.  What possible reason could Oregon have for having that provision, which is,  ""Jury, you shall consider all the evidence you've just heard at the guilt phase of the trial? ""  What reason could that be?  How is it supposed to be relevant, ""all evidence"", unless it's relevant to the question of whether there is doubt?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But that's a different provision.  I'm now thinking of the ""normal case"", where you hear the guilt phase, and now we're in the sentencing phase, and it says here, under Oregon law,  ""Judge, tell the jury that everything they previously heard at the guilt phase they may consider for purposes of what sentence they should impose. ""  I just wonder what that sentence is doing there in Oregon law, unless the jury is supposed to think about whether this guy's really... ""I'm completely certain he's guilty"".

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But under--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Oregon law, what is not clear is... you want to put the mother on the stand.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, do you want to go into anything at all that wasn't raised at the trial?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That's right.  So--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --that's why I want to know that.  That's what's ambiguous.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Look, you only get to go into something if it was not otherwise... if it is otherwise relevant; and, therefore, if you want to.  The reason they think it is relevant is because of a constitutional holding of the Oregon Supreme Court.  So, if you want to go into something, we have to decide whether it is, or is not, otherwise relevant.  If you want to ask the same thing, that's just a question of whether you have to have a transcript or a live witness.  And I don't know that that's a question that depends on their constitutional holding.  So, I want to know, Do you want to go into things that are not there in the original trial, yes or no?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  No, I'm not saying that.  I... look, until this minute, you might have been equivocal.  You're quite right, I was leading you.  [Laughter]  Now, that doesn't mean you can't say yes or no.  You can decide right now.  So, decide.  And I'm... I will be bound by the answer, as I think we all are.  And if your answer is,  ""Yes, I want to go into otherwise relevant things. ""  I'd like to know that.  And if the answer is no, I want to know that, too.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, if you pass... if you pass, I will think you do.  And as long as you do, I think we have to decide whether it is, or is not, otherwise relevant.  I'm being totally open and honest with you.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I'm not being tricky about it.  I want to know if we have to go to the words ""otherwise relevant"" in the Oregon statute... ""otherwise relevant"", particularly in respect to this question of residual doubt.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I really would like an answer, if possible.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  And they said that relevance is... of residual doubt is relevant.  And the reason that it's relevant is because the Constitution of the United States requires the jury to hear it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That is what I am focusing on, and I want to know if you want to go into ""otherwise relevant"", for that reason.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So, let's go to the constitutional--   Stephen G. Breyer  --issue.  Now, let's imagine we have a trial.  And at the trial, we have a lot of evidence about the alibi.   Stephen G. Breyer  And what the State Court says,  ""This is our law. ""  ""When a person is. ""  --now go to the sentencing phase, the jury has heard it--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Okay?  So, they take it into account.  And, moreover, we tell them they have to consider it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay?  That's a State law.  Now, what happens when there's an appeal in the middle, and now we go back to the sentencing?  Here's what we do.  We introduce the transcripts.  And, moreover, we introduce some live witnesses to say what they said before, but nothing else.  Now, you're saying there is a constitutional right to present an additional witness on the matter that has already been litigated to go into things that were not there in the trial before.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, my goodness, if you had real evidence of an alibi, why didn't you put it in the first time?  And if, in fact, you... it's not such good evidence, and so forth, why does the State have to have waste its time to hear some more about the alibi that you didn't put in the first time?  I mean, you know, that's what you're saying the Constitution protects.  I'm being a little skeptical.  I want to know what your answer is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm agreeing with you--   Stephen G. Breyer  --insofar as you have a right to put in what you've put in the first time.   Stephen G. Breyer  I agree with you on that one.  But you said you wanted to do something else.  You wouldn't say,  ""We don't want to do something else. ""  You--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --want to do more.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And, in the ""more"" part, where does the Constitution protect you?  I'm willing to, at least hypothetically, go with you on the protection for what they already heard.   Stephen G. Breyer  What about... what about... for example, the single most important feature leading juries to recommend against death, apparently, from the studies, is their residual doubt.  Every juror who hears sentencing matters directly after a trial automatically takes that into account.  Therefore, those who are resentenced and have a new jury should have the same kind of right.  Otherwise, it's cruel and unusual.  Now, I have made that argument.  You didn't make it.  But it seems to me that there are several arguments that you might make in favor of the Oregon Supreme Court's approach if, at least, you concede that it is up to Oregon to control, through its evidentiary rules, whether a matter is relevant, what form it comes in, et cetera.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  See, I'm not... this is a fairly complex area.   Stephen G. Breyer  And, as I understand, at this moment... and I hope you'll correct me if I'm wrong... in a ""weighing"" State, we look at the aggravating side, and there seem, let's say, to be three factors that you could take into account and weigh them against all the mitigation.  I'm imagining that.  And you might have thought, if factor one turns out to be invalid, the reason that that's a big mistake, because the jury would have weighed something against all that mitigating evidence that it shouldn't have.  And what's something?  There would be a lot of evidence on it, so it took it... evidence into account it shouldn't have.  So, I might have thought that was so.  But when I read the cases, that isn't so, because I think it's... in Clemons the evidence would have come in anyway.  So, if that isn't so, what could be wrong with this problem in the ""weighing"" State?  And the answer, I guess, has to be that the prosecutor or the State said,  ""Jury, you look to these three things. ""  with a tone of voice that really made them important.  And the jury then weighed one and two and three.  It didn't have anything to do with the evidence.  Well, if that's the problem, California seems to have that problem, because one of the things it says to weigh is, ""Weigh circumstances of the crime"".  And that means that's not everything.  That's not the history of this defendant.  And so, the problem that existed in Clemons and in Stringer and in Zant that led to constitutional error seems to be there in California's case, too.  Now, I probably have made five mistakes in my little recitation here, and I'd ask you to point them out.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING ",04-980X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The word ""special circumstances"" is ambiguous, because it might refer to something in the world, in which case it's about evidence, or it might refer to something in the law, in which case it's a statement by a prosecutor to look at some of this evidence and give it some special weight.  Now, that what's confusing me throughout.  As I understood this area, to go back to what Justice Scalia was saying... no, wait, just... I'll back up to try to get you to correct my misunderstanding... Zant is the key, because Zant says,  ""Judge, if you have a ""nonweighing"" State. ""  --that is, everything's relevant but the kitchen sink...  ""the fact that the prosecutor made a mistake at the eligibility stage by including something he shouldn't is beside the point. ""  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  Then we look at Stringer and Clemons, and they're making exceptions to Zant.  And they're making exceptions for ""weighing"" States.  So, even if the evidence in all three cases is identical and it made no difference to the evidence... that is, to what really happened in the world... still, says Clemons and Stringer... still, you're not home free yet, State.  Rather, you have to back up and do harmless error analysis.  So, the answer, I think, to Justice Scalia, if I understand it, is, Justice Scalia, you may be right, maybe all this is harmless, but we don't have before us the product of harmless error analysis, because you didn't grant cert on it, among other reasons.  Now, if I'm right so far, and if we want to straighten all this out, why not go back and say all three cases are wrong?  What you really ought to do is say,  ""Court, always conduct harmless error analysis. ""  ""Conduct it whether you're in ""nonweighing"", conduct it whether you're in ""weighing"", we'll simplify. ""  Now, what would be so terrible about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then we would not have this crossword puzzle, which probably only five people in the United States understand, and the worst thing that would happen would be, you'd always conduct harmless error analysis, and thus, if Justice Scalia is right about it, you would lose, and if... because it would be harmless... and if he's wrong about it, you'd win.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, and I can imagine, in ""nonweighing"" State, a prosecutor banging on and on, at the eligibility stage, on factor X, and really fixing that in the mind of the jury, and it turns out that factor X is not an aggravator.  Now, the jury might have been prejudiced.  And I can imagine, in a ""weighing"" State that, because the evidence is the same, and because there were so many factors just like it, the fact that they used the wrong factor didn't really make any difference.  So, it seems to me the lineup between harm... real harm in a case, and weighing/nonweighing, it doesn't line up terribly well.  But you have the experience.  And that's why I'd like your reaction.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  I mean, a serious effort to go back and say, ""Look, harmless error throughout"".  I mean, I'm pushing the same thing I said before.   Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Justice Brennan's opinion sounds to me, part one, as if he is saying what the mistake was that the company made here is that they didn't really eradicate the effects of the past bad act, and they were trying to eradicate it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's another part of the case that's part two and part three about the evidence that came in.  In fact, there are about six other parts.  I'm just talking about part one.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  All right.  So I read that.  Now, this is my this is my cost/benefit analysis here.  If we follow the other side's rule, it's very simple, we just said Bazemore applies, whether there's a practice or whether it was a discrete thing, or whatever, so it's simple.  But we do have to distinguish pay from the other kinds of things.  And we have heard them explain why there is a distinction.  I'd rather get to your side and then you can attack both, or whatever.  Your side of it, it seems to me, if I agree to you, I now have to create in the law some kind of thing that sounds very complicated about whether that old bad thing was somehow a pattern or a practice that, as a pattern or a practice, didn't get eradicated within the last few years, or was a totally discrete act, and therefore, had no implication as a pattern or practice that didn't get eradicated.  That sounds hard.  And the second thing I guess I'd have to do is to create a lot of tolling law because there will be probably a significant number of circumstances where a woman is being paid less, and all she does is for the last six months get her paychecks and she doesn't really know it because pay is a complicated thing, and through no fault of her own, it takes about eight or nine months or even a year for her to find out.  And we are going to have to toll, aren't we?  So I have, legally speaking, a complicated tolling system that I have to graft on to this, your case.  I also have to start distinguishing Bazemore which is pretty hard to do.  But on the other side, they are just saying, go with the flow.  Nobody is really hurt, because the employer has to worry about all this stuff anyway under the Equal Pay Act.  I'm giving you that summary so you can just shoot it down.   ",05-1074
1,Stephen G. Breyer  What is your answer to Justice Scalia?  Because I thought you said before that you thought it was appropriate for us to send this case back so that they could redetermine in light of proper considerations whether they wanted to exercise their authority.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  On this particular issue, the opinion as I read it, of the EPA, consists of 32 pages.  Twenty of those pages, 22 in fact, deal with whether they have statutory authority.  And of the 10 that deal with the issue we're talking about now, five of them give as their reason that they think that the President has a different policy.  Of the remaining five, two more consider international aspects of the problem and how you have to get other countries to cooperate; and then the conclusion of that part says in light of these considerations, we decide not to exercise our power.  Now their claim with respect to that, is that at least three of the four considerations are not proper things for the agency to take into account: namely whether the President wants to do something different, whether we're running foreign policy properly, whether cooperation with other countries are relevant to this particular issue.  So what they've asked us to do is send it back so they can get the right reasons.  Now... if they want not to do it.  What's your response to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The reason it depended on that is whether or not these other, improper considerations might have influenced the ultimate decision not to go ahead.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  When I write an opinion... when I write an opinion, sometimes I write the words:  ""We decide this matter in light of the following three factors taken together. ""  And I guess a lawyer who said,  ""one of those factors alone the Court has held justified the result all by itself. ""  --in saying the Court has held that, I guess that wouldn't be so.  That would be a bad lawyer, wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If they write that all of these considerations justify our result, again, one of them by themselves, it sounds, they think would not have been sufficient.   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose it is not greenhouse gas.  Suppose it was Agent Orange.  Suppose there a car is coming down the street and it sprays out Agent Orange.  And I come into the Court and I say, you know, I think that Agent Orange is going to kill me with cancer.  And the reply is, well, we have some scientists here who say your chance of dying of cancer from Agent Orange is only 1 in 30.  Maybe 1 in 50.  Maybe 1 in a thousand.  Maybe 1 in 10,000.  And therefore, you have no standing to require the EPA to regulate this pollutant, Agent Orange, which is in a green cloud all over the city.  Now, would you say that the person who's made that claim has no standing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I was only addressing, using that to... to address your problem that the chances are too small that, in fact, any one individual will be affected by the 7 percent or 6 percent of the material that comes out of the truck... the CO2.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose others cooperate?  Suppose, for example, they regulate this and before you know it, they start to sequester carbon with the power plants, and before you know it, they decide ethanol might be a good idea, and before you know it, they decide any one of 15 things, each of which has an impact, and lo and behold, Cape Cod is saved.  Now why is it unreasonable?  Why is it unreasonable to go to an agency and say now you do your part, which is 6 percent, and now we're going to go to a different agency like NHTSA and we're going to ask them too, and we're going to go to your electricity regulation program, and coal.  And there are like not a million things that have to be done, maybe there are only seven.  But by the time we get those seven things done, we'll make a big difference.  Now what is it in the law that says that somehow a person cannot go to an agency and say we want you to do your part?  Would you be up here saying the same thing if we're trying to regulate child pornography, and it turns out that anyone with a computer can get pornography elsewhere?  I don't think so.   Stephen G. Breyer  So they couldn't have gone in and asked for ozone regulations, because that requires other countries?  Or what about dumping heavy metals in the sea, and as the sea gets polluted because of what other countries do, but EPA tried to regulate that.  Acid rain they tried to regulate.  You're saying there is no standing to ask for any of that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you are saying if Congress passes a statute and they put the words CO2 right in this statute under ambient air, and they say anybody can go and sue if the EPA doesn't do it, you're saying Congress lacks the constitutional authority to do that, because it's Article III we're talking about?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'd like you to address that.  You said there was a lot of legislation in Congress that would have been pretty inconsistent with serious regulation by the FDA.  And in this case, I don't think Congress is opposing the notion.  I don't know anybody there who's in favor of global warming.

Breyer  What articles would be--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you think they have a good reason, yes or no?  Because I'm not an expert in foreign affairs.  The EPA probably is more than I am.

There must be some law on it in torts or someplace?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why couldn't you do the same?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, but they're... they're using the fact that there was parallel behavior as a basis for thinking there was more than parallel behavior.  They are using it as a basis for thinking that once, on some occasion that's relevant, there were people meeting in a room and saying things to each other.  So they are not just saying that it's sufficient.  They are saying it's evidence that something else occurred.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can they say on the 14th of January, 2004, we believe that in the city of New York, they agreed upon this course of action?  That would surely be sufficient?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Just as you might say on October the 24th, 2004 at the corner of 14th and Third Avenue, defendant drove negligently and injured me.  That's certainly a complaint, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, look, the one I just alleged in the tort law is a complaint.  I've just copied it out of the model complaints.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Am I right or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I understand the standard.   Stephen G. Breyer  I want to know how to apply the standard and now I take my tort case--   Stephen G. Breyer  --which is okay, and now I say sometime during the last 10 years he drove negligently and injured me.  Is that no good?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And so you're saying that this case is like that, when because they don't say when they met, they don't say what happened, they don't give a time or place.  If that's, leaving your side parallelism out of it, I'm past you on that, all right?  I'll accept for argument's sake all your point about that.  Now if you're saying this is too vague, leaving that out of it, because it doesn't say time and place of the meetings or give any other clue for meetings etcetera, what's your best authority?  This is an area of law I'm not familiar with.  I'm looking for cases that will tell me how specific a complaint has to be to tie the events down to specific ones.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Dura is still the best.  I think I, did I write that case?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not drawing total comfort from it.  [Laughter]  In fact I'd like something in tort law or something that, you know, that I get a general idea of what the law is because I don't know that antitrust is--   ",05-1126
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  If my case, the gasoline, oil prices fell, but I happen to know there were four gasoline shops near each other, gasoline stations, and they didn't cut their prices.  Complaint?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then that's the economy, and you can go sue half the firms in this economy.  Every firm in a concentrated industry engages in... I mean, normally conscious parallelism, and I know there are economists who think that that should be the case, but I thought the law to date was that the Department of Justice is not given by the Sherman Act the authority to remake the entire American economy.  But if we accept your view I guess it is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Ordinarily, if you take that sentence and read it for how you're reading, a consciously parallel action is a violation of Sherman Act section 2, then we have that radical change that many have advocated for the last 40 or 50 years, that half the economy is in violation, because in any concentrated industry, after all, it is in the interest of a firm to cut prices and to make a large market unless he knows his three competitors will also keep prices up.  Now, you have to know that or you'd cut them.  And that's called conscious parallelism.  And I had always thought that this Court had not said that that in and of itself is a violation of the Sherman Act.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know that, but if in fact all you have to do in order to bring a price-fixing case and get into discovery is to allege conscious parallelism and then add without further foundation, and we think there was a real agreement too, but there's nothing other than the conscious parallelism to back it up, now we've got just what I said, with the exception you might not win at the end of the day.  What have you is a ticket to conduct discovery.  Now, that's what's bothering the Department of Justice and so I'd like to know the answer to that problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'd also like a clear answer, and I would like to go back to Justice Stevens' question because I'm not sure what you're thinking there.  We have three steel sheet companies in the United States, no more.  They sell at $10 a sheet.  One day we have action in the case, a memo to the president of the company.  He says Mr. President, if you cut your prices to $7 you will make even more money unless the others go along.  And if they get there first, you will lose money.  So whether they cut or not, you'd better cut your prices.  Reply from the president: But if I don't cut my prices, they won't cut theirs, and we are all better off.  That's your evidence.  Do you win?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There is no depend.  That's the evidence.  Do you win?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And you cite Matsushita for that?   Stephen G. Breyer  If you're right, then I guess we could engage in this major restructuring of the economy, and if that's the law, I'm surprised they haven't done it, but maybe they have just been recalcitrant.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, because we have concentrated industries throughout the economy, I guess, or at least we used to, and I suppose that that's a perfectly valid way of reasoning for an executive in such a company, at least they teach that at the schools of government, and people who aren't really experienced in these things, but--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Okay, fine.  Now, let's forget my immediate disagreement or not.  Let's say I agree with you on this.  Now we have our example right in mind.  What other than the parallel to my example could one reading this complaint think you intend to prove?   INTERRUPTING ",05-1126
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What happened in respect to the SEC?  What about primary jurisdiction?  That's what I wondered as I read this.  Nobody mentions it.  But there's certainly a lot of precedent in the area in this kind of thing.  You ask the agency, have to go to the agency, see what they say.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's why I wonder about primary jurisdiction.  You put a burden on the, on the plaintiffs to go to the agency and the agency could take a range of positions.  It might say this is absolutely unlawful, BUT it's close enough we think an antitrust court has no business mucking around in this.  Or it's unlawful and we don't care.  Or, it's not... in which case they could bring their suit.  Or it's... it's not unlawful but we don't care, or it's not unlawful and we do care.  I mean, there is a range of positions they could take which was the purpose of the primary jurisdiction doctrine, to see in the context of the particular conduct, not general but in the context of the particular conduct, what the agency thought about this in terms of its regulatory mission.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's in respect to the particular conduct at issue here.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Of course the Petitioners have not had an opportunity, I would think... they filed a complaint.  But they've not had an opportunity to argue this out in front of the SEC with particular evidence, with particular witnesses, et cetera.   Stephen G. Breyer  And even then, why do you take the other position?  It is pretty easy to imagine the SEC, under some circumstances, deciding that's a proper way to market securities, to have some kinds of agreements between IPOs or something like that.  I don't see why not.   Paul D. Clement  Well, I suppose it's possible, Justice Breyer.   Stephen G. Breyer  It is possible.  I'm back to Justice Alito's question.  I mean, if you're worried about taking authority from the Department to prosecute territorial restrictions as some kind of blatant price fix, that's not in front of us.  So this doesn't have to be precedent for that.  You're talking about this case.  And there, I think the Respondent... the Petitioners here say that my goodness, we don't see any way that a district court is going to be able to start talking about whether this evidence is protected.  What does that mean, protected?  Maybe protected here, because they have thought about it, but there will be a lot of cases where the SEC hasn't thought about the particular conduct.  We don't know what they're going to prove.  I'm back to Justice Alito.  How is anybody going to administer the standard that you are asking the Court to enunciate?   Paul D. Clement  Well, I think if you draw a distinction between intraIPO allegations and interIPO allegations, you go a long way towards doing it.  And I should note, that's basically the line this Court drew in NASD.  If you look particularly at the part of the decision that deals with count 1 of the Government's complaint, that was a horizontal allegation.  And it was all in the context of vertical agreements that were specific to a particular mutual fund.  And in that context, this Court said that with respect to the horizontal agreement, there's nothing in the SEC regulations that specifically addresses that, but the SEC specifically blesses the vertical agreements, so we're going to give additional immunity to that horizontal agreement.  That same page, page 733 of the opinion, they say, what we don't have before us is an allegation by the government that there is a scheme here to reduce competition between mutual funds.  There is no allegation that they were trying to cut down, there was an agreement that would cut down competition between Fidelity and Wellington, for example.  It was all in the context of individual funds and retarding the secondary market for individual funds.  The language the Court used on page 733 of that opinion seems to us a perfectly reasonable test.  The Court said, quote: SEC had prohibited in the vertical context and what was sought to be gone after in the context of the horizontal restraints, those are too closely related.  I don't think that test has caused the undue confusion.  And I think what it does it makes a reasonable balance between a ruling that on the one hand preserves a great deal of immunity, but on the other hand doesn't give a kind of blanket immunity that would basically completely oust the antitrust laws.  And I think that's the balance we hope to--   Stephen G. Breyer  --We all agree, say a group of underwriters, that for the next we will insist that every customer, whatever price we charge, will pay 30 percent more for 50 percent more shares next month.  Absolutely illegal, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They write it down, just what I said.   ",05-1157
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it might well be, because the reasoning would be, which I find very strong, is that as soon as you make an, bring an antitrust court in, you're talking about juries and treble damages.  And as soon as that happens, the people who are subject to it stay miles away from the conduct that, in fact, would subject them to liability.  And yet staying miles away, they will not engage in conduct that, A, the SEC might believe is permissible, or, B, actually favor.  Where you get a complex complaint like yours, that begins to ring true, that argument.  And that's what's concerning me.   Stephen G. Breyer  What they say in respect to that is the other side says it's common to try to what's called make a book or something.  I don't know these terms.   Stephen G. Breyer  And when they do, what happens is that the marketer goes out and he asks people: What's your plan?  What are you thinking of doing next month?  What's your plan for this stock?  Hold it?  Not?  It doesn't require much imagination to see how certain answers to that kind of question could be brought by a plaintiff in perfectly good faith as evidence that there's an agreement that next month they will pay more for the stock and next month they'll pay a lot more.   Stephen G. Breyer  The problem... I'd be repeating it.  we're not talking about, say, your case.  I don't know what your evidence is.  But let's imagine a case where the evidence of just what you said consists of some rather ambiguous discussions which might be characterized in a variety of ways, including the way the way the plaintiff wants to characterize it, who would repeat the very words you just said.  Now, the issue, it seems to me here, is in light of that possibility, do we want an antitrust judge to say whether that's so?  I know you do.  Or do you want the SEC to say whether that's so in the particular case?  Or that's why I thought of primary jurisdiction: Maybe first send it to the SEC.  What's your view?   Stephen G. Breyer  What about an agreement among underwriters, among underwriters, which says the following: We agree that we go... when we go on our tour, we will be certain to ask the potential purchasers whether they plan to hold this stock for at least a month.   Stephen G. Breyer  No problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  How do you know that isn't a disguise when they say--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Ah, ah.  What they've said was... you see, they have the same allegations.  I don't know how to... you see what I'm driving at?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's the answer?   Stephen G. Breyer  Can you get damages for that from the SEC?  I mean, it sounds like bad conduct.   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose you lose, your client... suppose all these bad things happen and you don't have an antitrust claim.  Is there somewhere in the law that you can get damages?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what's at issue here is not whether you get a remedy.  It's whether you get treble damages.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So what are the words you use in the opinion, that would separate your case, where it is like price fixing and so forth, to charge them, from the case that they're worried about, which is where the evidence is, to prove the allegation is, really involves activity that could be quite legitimate?  Now, now... what words would I write in the opinion that in your opinion would separate the sheep from the goats?   Stephen G. Breyer  What about... what about... listen to what I'm about to say.  I'm thinking of the standard.  The standard would be where the allegations are such, where the case is such that... to go further... that, one, it is an allegation of a claim of illegality; is price fixing, in price fixing; and it is of longstandingly prohibited under the securities law; and there is evidence to support that, of... strong evidence to support it, or the evidence in support thereof is not primarily evidence simply of asking the jury to draw inferences from conduct that is protected.  Under those circumstances there is no immunity.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know if it's... I mean, you know--  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I would always... I think the standard I was more or less talking about is pretty close to what the SG says.  And I think he says that... that... that Justice Alito's point, which is certainly a good point, is that you would have to allege facts such that it was clear from the face of the complaint that you weren't resting your case on the conduct that was... that's what he means by protected... and there's an ongoing obligation, it says, on the part of the district judge to be sure that the case isn't really growing out of this conduct that is arguably okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You, you could live with the SG--   INTERRUPTING ",05-1157
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What happens... I'm trying to think of what the problem is for you.  On January 1, your client's arrested unlawfully.  Now suppose the rule was you have two years to file it, starting now.  What is the problem for you?  The problem is maybe in a year, or maybe less, the police start to prosecute him.  In the meantime, your trial is going forward because you filed it on time.  So when they start to prosecute him, you don't yet know what's going to happen.  And it could happen that he's convicted and you think it's illegal because of the arrest and necessarily so.  And therefore you have to stop the trial, I guess, because of Heck.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That would work, I guess.  They'd stop it and then they'd have to bring it... you'd have to stop it and then you'd have to go through these other remedies and they you'd have to go back to it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But that would work.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  A mess.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose I modify it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose it is complicated.  I want to suggest a modification with this suit here.  You say you have to file within two years.  But wait, you have... we tolled the statute.  If the person is arrested and charged, and convicted, for all the time that is going on, it is just tolled, equitably.  And after the conviction, if he's acquitted, by the way, or he isn't arrested, the statute starts to run again.  Now if he's convicted, as long as you have filed, proceeding to challenge the conviction, it is tolled.  Now, would that... that it seems to me would help every problem you have, and it would be called equitable tolling.  And that's been suggested by judges in different forums and many states have it.  And what's the problem?  That just solves the problem, doesn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, well, we could do it in this case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What cases require overruling?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it seems to me identical to the rule you are advocating but with one difference.  The difference with the rule you are advocating is a judge who is going to be judge at time A with your first case, is going to have to guess whether it is in this case or not in this case necessarily related to some kind of challenge to conviction you're going to bring later if you happen to get convicted.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There is no way to guess that.   Stephen G. Breyer  And is there anything that you are aware of that it would be contrary to?  I know there are cases that say you look to states but you only look to states where the state law is, in fact, consistent with the Federal right.   Stephen G. Breyer  That problem is solved too if you simply say bring it, day one, you are arrested, and if in fact before the statute of limitations expires, your client is brought to the court and is going to be prosecuted.  Tolled.  They don't need two actions.   Stephen G. Breyer  I want to be sure I understood your position with regard to Justice Kennedy's hypothetical where the defendant is arrested and excessive force is used by the police, they beat him up or something like that.  When does that cause of action accrue?   ",05-1240
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But that's the problem.  I don't know if it is easy.  It seems to me if you take your point of view, now, on January 1, some, let's call it an unconstitutional action allegedly.  So, I don't want to distinguish for the moment between Fourth and Fifth.  On January 1 the event occurs.  Then you say you have two years to file your claim in the Federal court of a violation of 1983, for example.  Then that happens.  Let's say two months later they file it.  The defendant files it.  A month after that, there is a state criminal proceeding.  Now, you're the Federal judge.  What's supposed to happen?  It sounds to me as if the judge sitting there, under your theory, is going to have to make a decision.  He's going to have to say now, is the kind of claim that's being argued in my court that the policemen did something unconstitutional, if I say that's correct, that the plaintiff wins, I have to go on to say does the correctness of that, there was a violation, mean that the conviction if there is a conviction in the state court later, will necessarily be vitiated.  If the answer to that question is yes, he shouldn't go ahead; is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If that's correct, we're getting to exactly the same problem, whether we do it through a set of abstention rules, which we have to have Federal abstention rules or it won't be worked out properly, or we have to have Federal tolling rules.  I don't see any way to get to a sensible result here without either having clear abstention rules, just as you say, having clear tolling rules, as I suggested before.  Am I right?  If I'm wrong, let me know why; and if I'm right, which do you prefer?   Stephen G. Breyer  If you do it with a stay, I mean, I see that disadvantage.  If you do it with a stay, the Federal judge is going to have to sit there with the papers in front of him, look at that evidence, think what's going to happen in the trial at the criminal case which I'm not quite certain yet, and then make a determination.  It sounds like a very difficult decision and it sounds like sometimes they'll get it wrong, sometimes they'll get it right.  The defendant might be arguing two different things, you know, one in the state court to try to get them to go ahead, and the other to try to get them to go ahead in the Federal court.  What do you--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --If you delay accrual by tolling, you do have the disadvantage that in some instances the policemen won't know for quite a while whether the case is being brought.  That's true; and in the other instance, he won't know for quite a while how the case is going to come out, which may be worse.  But you don't have any uncertainty.  You have no uncertainty.  You would know once the man is released.  It's no tolling.  Once he's convicted, it's tolled.  Then the conviction comes in.  Not tolled until they bring a proceeding.   INTERRUPTING ",05-1240
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask you... are you finished?   Stephen G. Breyer  I wanted to know what you think about a suggestion that I got from something that Justice Scalia said.  I don't know whether he was making it or not, but I'll make the suggestion and see what you think.  Suppose that this case... suppose we were to say, there are many issues in this case, some of them very difficult, but one thing we're certain about: You cannot in a trial consistent with the due process clause in a trial of plaintiff versus defendant take money from the defendant and give it to the plaintiff for the purpose of punishing the Defendant for something he did to a different person who wasn't there.  Now... so he couldn't defend against him.  That person didn't present a claim.  So we are certain of that.  Now, we're not certain whether that's what happened here.  It may have done.  There is certainly a lot of language to suggest it, and there is some language the other way.  So we remand it to the court with that instruction that they cannot permit this to have happened if it happened.  Whether it happened and what happened is a matter of Oregon law in large part and things about instructions, etc.  Now, what's your view of that kind of disposition?   Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe, but it's possible the Oregon court would say: Well, no instructions are perfect, but... and no set of jury instructions is perfect.  But if we look at the jury instructions without the suggested one that was rejected and then we look at the suggested one, we find the suggested one had many things wrong with it, not just, you know, problems, confusion, et cetera.  We find the instructions weren't perfect but, given Oregon evidentiary law, we think the trial judge made reasonable decisions, therefore okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know.  That's what worrying me, what's worrying me about this is I see as we try to determine what this instruction said, whether it was good enough, whether the instructions without it are good enough, that we're going to be in a kind of bog of mixtures of constitutional law, unclear Oregon State law, not certain exactly what was meant by whom in the context of the trial, et cetera.   INTERRUPTING ",05-1256
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why, why... why though?  I'm having the same problem.  As I read the sentence that we have just been quoted it seems to me at first blush that it's completely right.  You may consider the harm, the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what the reasonable relationship is.  Now you have to be sophisticated in this.  Don't ask me how the jury is, but assuming that they are, that means that the more severely awful the conduct, the higher the ratio between the damage award and the injury suffered by this victim in court.  And if it's really bad, you're going to maybe have a hundred times this compensation instead of only ten times or five times.  So... we take it into account, the extent of the harm that could be suffered, in deciding what that ratio should be.  That means it goes to the evilness of the conduct.  But you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons who aren't here in court.  In other words, what you aren't to do is to look at good old Mrs. Smith who has really suffered terribly, she happens not to be in court, think about her suffering, which is real and serious, and then say I'm going to punish this defendant because of what he did to her.  Which would be a natural human reaction, and perhaps admirable, but regardless, the law is that that's what you're not supposed to do.  So reading it as I just read it naturally, it seems to describe what our cases have said is the law.  Why isn't that right?  I'm looking for a real answer to the question.  I'm posing it in a hostile way and hope I'll get an answer.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because you read it's about harm.  You say look here is the person doing something absolutely awful, I mean really awful.  And look at how awful it is.  It's the kind of thing that would have hurt X number of people badly, maybe kill them.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now I think we all agree that that's an appropriate thing to say.  And as long as you can say that why can't you create serious damages for that type of conduct?   Stephen G. Breyer  The trouble with the more basic question, I don't know if you can answer it, but it is a problem, that when I... most States have factors like that, or many do.  Alabama did.  You know, not quite as good as that, and we saw the patent fraud, you know.  And there are other cases that would bring up products liability.  And it's pretty hard to think of a products liability case where the jury found negligence, where they might not also find these factors.  Because in a typical case, you'll get competing memos within the company.  Somebody will have been hurt and likely seriously, and when you start thinking about the victim in front of you, it all looks pretty bad, and it often is, at least in this instance.  And now you read these five factors, and the difficulty for me has always been, well, you read the jury factors like that and they can do almost anything.  And it's that, it's that fact that anything goes that I found disturbing.   ",05-1256

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is this right?  If I have it... I'm using sort of a silly example to explain it to myself.  But I'm thinking the FDA... or no, the Agriculture Department decides they're really interested in red apples not being red.  So they say we hire thousands of apple lookers, and the apple lookers look at all the apples and they devise a redness test which is really fabulous, you know, very precise.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  The FDA.  The FDA has the apple looking redness test, and the apple lookers apply the test.  And if you pass the test, you can say red apple, and if you don't pass the test you don't.  Now I'll give you two different things that happen.  One day because of budget cuts the FDA hires a lipstick company to look, because they're experts on redness; they know how to perform a test.  [Laughter]  The other possibility is they say to the apple companies, you do your own looking.  Now I think there'd be the difference that you're trying to argue, and I don't think it cuts or you.  Because in the first case, what they've done is hire somebody to perform a governmental function.  In the second case, what they've done is to the people who are regulated and have the interest, in announcing they have red apples, they've said, you do it yourself.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That wouldn't be relevant, because the... the problem with the, with the approach that you're taking, as I see it, would be that, that there are probably a lot of instances where a regulated firm, the regulation meaning yes/no, market/not market; yes/no, advertise/not advertise, performs all kinds of tests to see if it is yes or no.  And if you're going to start taking that kind of firm and breaking it apart to say whether it's doing the testing part or some other part, you're really opening the gates.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So what you are saying is that this function is so separable and it is so much a FTC function and it is so much like delegating it to the third party that did nothing of the testing, that even if you delegate it to the second party which does testing and then benefits from the testing, that's still not enough to take it out.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that... have I got that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  But I... so, so to use my silly example, I mean, it is like the lipstick company.  You're saying, well if they did it to the lipstick company it would be clearly that they're the Government agent.  And it is so technical, so governmental, so heavily involved with the Government for testing, that even though you give it to the apple growers themselves, they are still Government agents when they perform it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I, I see the argument now.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then is there any, any authority ever, that you found for that?  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  I have a quick question.  Is there anything in the complaint that alleges you didn't perform the tests properly?   ",05-1284

Stephen G.

In your view, that's not covered.   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course.  It's not meant to be.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I want to know how you are going to answer my hypothetical.

If... if that's right, then what you're saying, as I understand it, is in those cases where an employer goes to an insurance company, they give a contractual promise to pay the employee when he gets sick in return for a premium by the employer... and it's a health benefit or a vacation benefit, the most typical thing... you're saying all those... all those... there's no fifth priority.  They don't... can't take advantage of that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, they're doing that to get a standard.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I'd like to know what your... they're trying to use that as a basis for separating the bottled water from the workmen's comp from the health benefit.  And they're saying here's an example of where Congress put the workers' comp on the same side as the health benefit.  Now, that's their approach.  What's your approach to the standard?  What rule or system would you use from deciding which insured for or paid for benefits count as the plan and which ones don't?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So if, in fact... if, in fact, the State legislature mandates certain health benefits, then the plan that provides those benefits would no longer qualify.   ",05-128X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  There... there are two parts in my mind to this.  The question is what is the difference between a workmen's... worker compensation and health benefits.  I agree with you, so far tentatively, that that difference can't lie in the nature of the contract providing the benefit.  Now, I know they'll want to argue the contrary, but put that to the side.  If it doesn't depend on that, it depends on the difference between workers' compensation and health benefits.  And you want to say there isn't enough of a difference there, though they argued the mandate makes a difference.  Of course, you could mandate health benefits too, and I don't think that would matter.  But if you're right, what about a... a long term contract for bottled water for the workers?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, actually... this is... to me anyway, this is an important point because at some point you have to draw the line between the things of a kind that workers might bargain for and things not.  Now, if that's where we're getting there, the history of workers' compensation may cut the other way.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because?  What's... what's the principle I'm going to use?   INTERRUPTING ",05-128X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose that it was a national bank.  Forget the subsidiary.  And your State says: Well, we want to have a law here that says we want to send our own bank examiners in.  And moreover, we don't want them to make any loans in excess of 12 percent interest.  Fine.  Would that be constitutional?  I mean, wouldn't be preempted?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, of course, because it conflicts and they don't want it.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Do they have the authority to say a subsidiary is a national bank?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, they can't?  Where is it in the law that says they don't have the authority to say that a subsidiary of a national bank owned by a national bank is a national bank?  Is there something specifically that stops them from saying that?   Stephen G. Breyer  What?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is it?  What is it... I mean, what statute or what is it that prevents them from saying it?  I don't know the Gold Foods case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Doesn't it have exactly the same power that any other agency or Congress has?  That it has the power, if its regulation is authorized, it has the power to what they say, preempt a state law that obstructs, impairs, or conditions a bank's ability fully to exercise its federally authorized real estate lending powers?  That's what they say, and then they list some examples.  Suppose they said nothing.  Wouldn't we be in the same boat?  After all, a state cannot under the Federal Constitution normally enact a law that interferes or stands as an obstacle to the achievement of the objective of the Federal law.  So if that's right, or if it's wrong, explain why it's wrong, but if it's right, why don't you tell me whether the two laws that you are worried about do or do not stand as an obstacle to the full achievement of the purposes of the statute as implemented by their regulation?   Stephen G. Breyer  Let's assume I don't agree with you about that, that I think conflict preemption does not require clear language.  Assume that, even though you disagree with it.  Now on my assumption that you can have the law if it doesn't conflict, but you can't have the law if it does conflict, so now you explain to me why the two laws at issue here don't conflict.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We're not looking for that.  We're looking for the opposite.  As I read this, the banking agency has not said, we wipe out all of your laws.  They've said, we wipe out a subset of laws, which are defined as those laws that obstruct, impair, or limit the ability of this bank to fulfill its federally mandated powers.  Okay?  So they're just saying, we only get the ones that are in conflict.  Now, they then have a list of which ones they preempt and which ones they don't.  So my question to you is, give me a list here of which ones they think conflict that you think don't.   ",05-1342
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's the question I had.  I got somewhat thrown by the Chief Justice's question, because I thought first, when I read the reg, 34.4.ab, that those things that are preempted are those things that obstruct, impair or condition, or in other words limit, the Federal powers of a national bank.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I thought we were basically dealing with conflict--   Stephen G. Breyer  --not fielding.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But... but the last part of the reg says that what applies, no State law applies to a national bank operating subsidiary if it doesn't apply to the parent bank.  And I began to think it fields preemption.  Am I right in thinking that it is conflict preemption, not field, because it is conflict in the case of a national bank?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Conflict preemption basically strikes down a State law that stands as an obstacle to the full enforcement of the Federal law.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, with that in mind, suppose that you didn't have either 7.4006 or 34.4(a)(B).  Neither existed.  But we listened to what the agency said as a Court and they explained how the regulation worked.  Would you expect to come to precisely the same result?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Would you or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know, but would you... would you expect to come to the same result or not?   INTERRUPTING ",05-1342
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I guess in many thousands of municipalities throughout the United States it's fairly common to have a locally owned electricity distribution company, or an electrically... or a gas distribution company.  And I thought it was fairly common for a municipally owned pipeline, gas pipeline, or electricity distribution to say, if you live in our town you've got to buy from us; you've got to buy from the local community.  And I guess that's been going on for about 110 years.  And yet I've never seen anybody think or write or anything that that violated the Commerce Clause.  But of course, there could be somebody in another State who'd like to sell electricity to the people in our town.  They can't do it because the town says, we own the company and you got to buy from us.  Now, if we agree with you are we saying that all those gas companies, distribution companies, et cetera, are behaving unconstitutionally?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not interested in tests.  I'm interested in just the outcome.  I just raise the question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I used to teach the subject and I can't say you're wrong.  But I knew that it was a fairly common thing to have a certification that gave you a... as a company, it would give them a local area in which they had an exclusive monopoly.  And that was common and it was called a service area, and in the local town, the service area, I never even heard of a company trying to come in and sell from abroad, because I thought that this certificate gave them an exclusive right to provide the local electricity service or the natural gas service.  I mean, it's a fairly obvious thing.  And I might be wrong and I mention that my memory... I've never focused directly on it.  Just everybody I read and everything I read, I assumed the constitutionality of this.  But of course, memory is fallible, including mine.  Therefore, I raise the question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I'm not talking about that because I guess that would be trying to attack Carbone.  Far be it from me.  But I know at least there are these things called municipal gas utilities and municipal electricity companies; and during the New Deal that was thought to be quite a good thing, and that's years ago.  In all that time when people were attacking New Deal agencies, I've never seen an attack based on this ground.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, I think it would.  The same logic would apply.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the fact is there is a difference between public ownership and giving an exclusive franchise to a public company.  And the public ownership means that the people of the State have decided to have their own little nationalized industry, which again people don't like, many.  But I never knew there was anything in the Constitution that forbid it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Nationalized industries?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, there is still at least the obvious distinction, that one of the main purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause is to prevent protectionism.  Protectionism is when a state favors its own producers.  And you could see, indeed a big argument in Carbone was, you aren't favoring your own producer; well, we are at least favoring one.  But now where the municipality is running it itself, no one is favored.  So I don't think it was an object of the Commerce Clause to prevent a State from favoring its own government.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it's about--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, is there something here that is not protection?  Because Carbone was still perhaps viewing it most favorably, an extreme case of protection, only one individual was protected.   Stephen G. Breyer  Here, I take it the reason they want to do this is because they wanted their municipal facility to charge a higher price for the non-recyclable rubbish and that will encourage people to segregate the rubbish and thereby have more cyclable... recyclable rubbish, and therefore overall pay less.  And that's why they want to do it, and of course that's not going to work.  If somebody comes in from out of State and charges a lower price for all of the non-recyclable rubbish or you know, for all rubbish, it just won't work.  It is rather like electricity, interestingly enough, where municipalities would do the same thing.  They want discriminatory rates in order to push out the possibility of poorer people getting electricity.  This they want to do the same thing but they want to do it for rubbish, for, to encourage recycling.   Stephen G. Breyer  Like it--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I actually point out that California, I think, wants to own the grid and privatize the rest of it.  And there are... I mean, it... Justice Kennedy is totally right.  There are all kinds of combinations and permutations.  There, there could be distributors who are in fact regulated private companies and local distributors who are owned by the city, and I guess there, there is one generator, at least, company that's owned by the... that's a... TV... with TVA.  They, they make their own.  So there are all kinds of permutations and combinations.  And I think we're getting at, when we take that aspect of the permutation and combination and say that aspect of it which is owned by a Government says: ""Our way or the highway"".  You know, that's what they say.  ""Buy from us"".  Period.  And if you're in a certain region, I've always thought they could do that.  And I have to admit I never really looked it up; I've just never came across a case that says to the contrary.   INTERRUPTING ",05-1345
1,NO QUESTIONS,05-1345
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Question--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm sort of back where Justice Kennedy started on this.  Forget... I'd like to forget your case, because your case seems to me to be a case where parties argue reasonably about whether the contract itself covers this kind of fee.  And maybe it doesn't, if it's very unreasonable, et cetera.  But let's take a very straightforward case.  It's an obvious contract to collect a debt, or maybe a mortgage, and in the debt or the mortgage agreement, it says, attorneys' fees will be paid for collection.  It clearly covers bankruptcy, too, by its language.  And now there must be many instances or some, anyway, where the security is inadequate.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And there must be other instances in which there wasn't any security.  And if I read Collier as you pointed to, that seems to say, in such cases, very simple, the creditor has the status of an unsecured creditor in respect to those attorneys' fees.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Overage in the secured case, and the whole claim in the unsecured case.  So get in the queue and you can collect your pro-rata share.   Stephen G. Breyer  My question is, I have 19 professors on the other side coming to tell me that that's never happened.  They can't even find an instance.  So it isn't as if, it isn't as if you haven't found an instance, it is that they are prepared to say it never happened.  And then there may be one exception or two or something like that.  And I can't, that... I'm now totally puzzled.  Because if it's so clear as you say, and I follow your logic, and I followed Collier, why?  After all, there are bankrupt people who do have some assets.  Explain it.   Stephen G. Breyer  You would have thought that the one group of people who ought to know this thoroughly, or at least have a view are the bankruptcy bar.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And, and yet there are no briefs from them; there are not... there is no article that I could find in Bankruptcy Journal.   ",05-1429
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, how do you avoid... what about their statement from Collier?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  It said... a pre-petition claim, if a creditor incurs the attorneys' fees post-petition, they incur it post-petition, afterwards they file, after the petition they file a claim with the bankruptcy court, in exercising or protecting a pre-petition claim that included a right to recover attorneys' fees.  And they say that's what we have, we had a contract that gave us this right to attorneys' fees.  The fees will be pre-petitioned in nature, constituting a contingent pre-petition obligation that became fixed post-petition when the fees were incurred.  All right.  Now, what is your response to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   Stephen G. Breyer  Then you explain that to me?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's because 506 had to do that in order to tell the bankruptcy courts--  how to deal with secured claims.   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course, that is exactly what's puzzling me.  But why haven't they gone out and got?  So why... what you're pointing to so far is that Congress has said a particular class of people get the attorneys' fees out of the security insofar as the security will support it.  It doesn't say a word about what happens to the attorneys' fees after the security is exhausted, nor about anybody else's attorneys' fees, where so provided by contract.  Colliers says they can get it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Same puzzlement.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose I sell you a house and I make a promise that I'll fix any leaks in the bathroom.  And lo and behold, before there's a leak the... I'm bankrupt.  And while I'm bankrupt it floods, the bathroom.  No claim?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It is a contingent claim.  And you're saying this is the same.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, are those 15 places... do they involve attorneys' fees as administrative expenses?  Do any of them involve attorneys' fees simply as an unsecured claim for attorneys' fees?   Stephen G. Breyer  What's the answer to my question?  Is the answer that 11 of them say you can collect attorneys' fees, but only as an unsecured claim against creditors.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, so six.   Stephen G. Breyer  So six are administrative, and then the remaining two say that the creditor can collect it as an unsecured debt?   Stephen G. Breyer  Which are those two?   Stephen G. Breyer  Which is that?   Stephen G. Breyer  That seems to cut the other way because it says it's disallowed insofar as it's unreasonable of course, and therefore it would be allowed insofar as it's reasonable.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but I mean you don't have exactly what I was driving to.  I was quite interested that you said there are 11 other provisions that we could look at for support, and I wouldn't think it was support if those consider... concern administrative expenses, which nobody's asking for here, they just want an unsecured claim, or if they concern some other--   Stephen G. Breyer  --irrelevant thing.   Stephen G. Breyer  How... can we decide?  But I'm wondering about, maybe you don't want to answer this, but I mean, if we were to say Fobian is wrong, everybody will agree with us.  But we should have to say why it's wrong.  And if we say the reason that it's wrong is because you can't collect attorneys' fees at all, you'll be delighted.  And if we say the reason it's wrong is because you can collect attorneys' fees regardless, they'll be delighted.  And our only other alternative is to not say why it's wrong or... I mean, that's the problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're saying this particular set of pre-petition obligations.  Collier, I think in context must be saying, you get paid the money.  I mean, he goes on in the next sentence and says by the way, despite my last sentence, you don't get the money?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, in other words what he implies, if I ready the whole page I'll see, although he just said what we quoted, the whole page means, by the way, I'm not telling you if you get the money or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Sorry, I'll--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I think your 506(b) argument, I see your point, I see your point, is there... I mean, and you'd have to say well, 506(b) simply repeats 506(a), as sometimes provisions do, and then it becomes somewhat superfluous, somewhat not.  I got that point.  I also have your point about, well, there are other references.  Now, is there any other point in the code?   Stephen G. Breyer  How do they do it with my leaky bathroom?   ",05-1429
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I'm just listening to this.  It sounds to me as if you're saying, one, the employer decides to terminate, okay?  Now that's done.  Then we go to the next question.  How would we terminate?  And in respect to that, I think Justice Kennedy was asking, as I heard him, don't you have a fiduciary duty when you decide how.  And your answer, as I heard it, was yes, you do.  And now there is a third question.  Does what happened in terminating mean that although you have a fiduciary duty, you couldn't consider a merger, because that's just not consistent with the basic plan of terminating.  Is that right?  If it's wrong, don't even bother to answer it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why did you answer yes to his question, Justice Kennedy's, about the insurance company?   ",05-1448
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What's the... I'm trying to work this out now.  Suppose I buy the annuity for these employees from the X insurance company, all right, and so the insurance company promises when they retire we'll pay them a thousand dollars a month.  Suppose the company goes bankrupt.  Does the, what is it, the PGPB, what do you call it, the Pension Guarantee--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.  Do they pick up any of that?   Stephen G. Breyer  They do not, okay.  So I'm trying to understand this, then, the reg under this, and it says: Administrator, you buy the, the annuity from an insurance company, for example, or do the same thing, get an irrevocable commitment in another permitted form.  So one question is when they do that the administrator doesn't have to have any fiduciary thought in his mind.  The second position is... that's their position.  The second position is, even if that's so, this is not another permitted form because a merger isn't a determination.  And the third position is, that's what we were just getting to, is that we don't see any way in which this could help the employee.  Now you say, oh yes, there is a way.  Now suppose we're choosing between two insurance companies.  Insurance company A says: We will pay precisely what is owed, precisely; we're as solid as a rock.  Insurance company B is hungry for business, so it says: We'll give those employees exactly what's owed and we'll write each of them a check for $500.  Now, is that something that means then... remember, this statute says you have to get what they promised them and not a penny more.  Is that something that the insurance, the administrator then has to do?  He has to take B because--  the insurance company is promising him a bonus?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well then, if not that why this?   Stephen G. Breyer  Could you go back for just one second to Justice Alito's question, because that's what I'm having trouble with, because I think the question is what, assuming you're right on all the other points for argument's sake, but what is the advantage to the worker here?  And the answer I heard you give was the advantage is, well, maybe the worker if he goes and works in the right place will get some more money.  Well, and I wonder is that relevant.  And you told me in respect to the two insurance companies it wasn't relevant.  So if it isn't relevant in respect to the two insurance companies, how can that be relevant here, and if that isn't relevant here what is the possible advantage to the worker?   Stephen G. Breyer  So then you're saying that the answer... we have annuity company A and B, they're identical, the worker has a pension that promises them $1,000 a month, not a penny more, and company A says, we'll give you $500 extra.  Then in your opinion under the current regs and so forth, the administrator must choose that company; is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  I said they are equivalent in terms of... of the security and so forth; they are each good companies and one will write out a check for $500, which is what I thought my example was.  And now you're saying under the law the fiduciary must choose the first but you're hesitating on that which means I think I don't understand it fully.   ",05-1448
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but what do you distribute?   Stephen G. Breyer  What do you distribute?  I mean, I agree you have a, some kind of, let's put something on cards, so you have thousands of cards and each one has a number on it.  What are you distributing... the cards?  Are you, are you... what's distribute... a 5th percentile refers to some kind of distribution.  What's it a distribution of?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is it a thing?   Stephen G. Breyer  Like a... like a set of things that you're distributing, what are they?   Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, you take all the... there is a set of numbers, each number is a different number and the characteristic of each number is there some school district that spends per, or takes in per pupil, revenue equal to that number.  So we write each one on a card.  Is that what we're, is that our distribution?  We have like, let's say we have a, a thousand cards.  Is that what it is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I'm not, I'm saying what do you think it has to be?  What do you think it should be?  What are, what is it we are distributing?  A simple question, I guess, for a statistician.  I unfortunately am not one and can't find one, so I have no idea what this statute means.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not a value.  I want to know what I'm distributing.  And if you don't know I would say that this is, I have never seen a case so much better fitted for relying on the views of an agency.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm sorry, I don't know how--   Stephen G. Breyer  --So, so in other words we are distributing those cards, it's a set of numbers?  If you're certain, isn't it fair to say that this statute is not clear as to what it is you're distributing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I... I thought not.  Is there a--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yeah... that... right.  But I unfortunately don't know enough about this subject, so I thought, not being an expert on it, that when you referred to a percentile, you have some group of things, a set of things that's being distributed in a certain order and there is a top of that and a bottom of that.   Stephen G. Breyer  And if that's what percentile refers to, I just want to know what those things are that are being distributed.  And... and that's where I find the ambiguity.  And if there is an ambiguity, I guess we are going to take the view of the agency at least as I understand it.  So... so that's why I asked the question.   Stephen G. Breyer  And does the statute say you have to do it that way?  It has to be the group that's distributed?   Stephen G. Breyer  Clearly.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, you could do it that way and the reason the Government, I think, says that you shouldn't do it that way is that it would produce an absurd result.   Stephen G. Breyer  That the object of the statute is to catch the outliers.  And if you, for example, had one giant school district like New York City which was at the top of the list and another giant school district that was at the bottom of the list you would cut those two out, and you might have cut out half the pupils in the whole State, and those wouldn't be outliers would they?  I mean, that's the problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It, it eliminates 26 school districts but those 26 school districts account for 5 percent or 10 percent of the pupils.  And I guess what we are interested in here is not school districts; they are not a thing... they are a thing of a kind, but we are interested in students, real people who get money.  And so that it, that it... it eliminates 26 percent of the school districts would see, to be a good thing, not a bad thing, because what we are really interested in are the pupils and it keeps in 90 percent of the pupils.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's all right.  I wouldn't think that was a problem.  But what about Justice Stevens' question.  There are 20 districts in our State... it's exaggerated, let me exaggerate it... and the rich district has 20, has a quarter of the students, and the poor district has another quarter.  So our outliers in that situation which we're eliminating from our calculation are the rich district and the poor district.  One's at the top, one's at the bottom.  And now we're left with 18 districts to figure out whether they're equalized.  But those 18 districts account for less than half or about half of all the students.  That's the problem.  It seems that isn't very representative and we're trying to get representativeness.   Stephen G. Breyer  I understand that.  If the language doesn't permit it you can't do it, they can't, and you win.  But if the language does permit it, the reason... you have to stretch the language, I suspect, in my view to get to the Government's result.  It might just barely permit it.  But one of the things on their side is that if we take your view it produces an absurd result, because of what Justice Ginsburg said, because there is such variation in the number of pupils among school districts in different states.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why isn't the obvious difference... I may have missed this... but you say, in the case, a taxpayer owed some money and the Government via a lien took property from a different person who then had to pay the tax who then had to get rid of the lien and wanted it back.  And in this case they did exactly the same thing but they did it via a levy.  So you say if the first could sue so could the second.  But the difference, the obvious difference, which maybe you have explained and I missed, is that in the second case, namely this case, there is a specific statute that says you have to do it with a levy in nine months, and in the other case there wasn't such a statute.  Why isn't that the obvious difference?   Stephen G. Breyer  Encompasses a lien for a refund action in the case where you took the property via a lien.  And you'd say... they say, I guess, but it doesn't encompass it when you take it via a levy.  Why not?  Because of the specific, the same thing I just said.  Now I want to be sure I have your whole answer to that.   Stephen G. Breyer  If your interpretation is correct then are there many such cases where the Government takes property via a levy and the person who wants to sue would get worried about nine months, because obviously he would think I can sue under a... kind of thing.  It's two years.  So are there still some where he would have to worry about nine months?   Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, are... in your interpretation, does the nine-month statute become meaningless?   Stephen G. Breyer  The... the, the statute that you point to talks about taking a civil action against the United States.  When there has been a wrongful levy, is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't say an injunctive action.  So I would reading it think it encompasses both actions for injunctions, which are rare, probably, and what I think is not rare at all, an action for damages or money back.  Now your reading of the statute takes that whole ordinary case, where people are just suing to get back some money, and it says our nine-month statute of limitations here is meaningless.  All it applies to are injunctive actions which I bet are far and few between.  You can tell me I'm wrong on that.   Stephen G. Breyer  I won't say you've made it meaningless but you have eviscerated it.  Is that fair?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, is my characterization fair?  [Laughter]  You want to say no to that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why would it have?  Because there I think we are talking about liens and it doesn't cover liens, the specifics statute.   INTERRUPTING ",05-1541
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  It looks like it's the same in the Kreider case.  I can't tell, I don't know.  But this case was a specific statute of limitations acted after the general refund statute, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  And in the prior case it seems to be a specific statute that was enacted in 1926.  I just got it out of the library.  They give it to us, you know, if you ask them.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it was the 1926 code and it concerned 1926 income, so it must have been brought, the suit, fairly close to when that was enacted.  And the general provision was a general judicial code provision having to do with general statute of limitations and, no, it doesn't say.  It looks... I mean, it sounds as if that had been long in existence.   ",05-1541
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Even if it is incorrect, if we... we don't know precisely what he meant by the words he said, why doesn't that argue even more strongly for a hearing?  At the hearing he wants to introduce, doesn't he, his stepparents, or foster parents, a school teacher, the various others?  And he'll say anyone who listens to those people will see that I have the most horrendous upbringing anyone could have.  The worst you've ever heard.  And my argument is that if only my lawyer had looked into this at that moment in the trial, he would have said in the sentencing proceeding, look what I can present for you.  And if he had done it and told me that, anyone would have said, ""of course, present it"".  And I want a chance to show that that's true of my case.  Now, why shouldn't he have a hearing on that?  No hearing was given him in the State court.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In State court he didn't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean, is the requirement such that when you ask for a hearing in a State court on a general matter,  ""I would like to show through a hearing. ""  then he gives a whole lot of affidavits of the kind of thing he's going to produce, that then the State says ""no"", you go into Federal court and say  ""I'm roughly going to do the same thing, I have a few extra witnesses, some of the people say some extra things. ""  no, you can't do that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Didn't he say my claim is ineffective assistance?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.

INTERRUPTING ",05-1575
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is the standard?  I ask that because I'm not certain from what I heard previously... I think the State was saying that the only issue that was raised before the State proceeding, collateral, the State collateral post-sentencing proceeding, was that you wanted to present evidence that he had a biological gene, it's a faulty gene, something like that.  When I've looked at this, it's on page 88, the motion filed says we have two claims.  One claim is the claim that was just mentioned, it says that... about it's from the biological mother, and use of drugs and alcohol.   Stephen G. Breyer  Joint appendix A.  And then there's a second one on page 88 that says in addition to failing to investigate these alternative sources, we also want to say that counsel failed to explore additional grounds, and that was the sister.  And the sister was going to testify that the mother... the foster mother, Mrs. Landrigan, abused alcohol, and she has a whole list of things in her affidavit.  So is that still before us?  I mean, isn't that something you want to argue?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  And then the claim would be this: You want a hearing in which you're going to present the sister, the Landrigans, what they did, what the school says, what happened to him at school, all things that are there in Affidavit 5 which was in the State court, and that the biological gene.  And you want to say, am I right, I don't want to put words in your mouth, and you want to say that given all this, had this been looked into and presented to the defendant, the defendant would not have said don't present any of that, it would have been presented, and it would have made a difference.  What... is that what you want to do?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, with that too.   Stephen G.

I... a lot of things in the law aren't always written down exactly, and I was under the impression that trial judges often give hearings on what you might call seat of the pants.  I'd like to hear more about it.  I've been on appellate courts where rightly or wrongly we've said, I just think I'd like to know more about this.  I can't quite understand it.  Let's have a hearing.  And we're going to tell the trial judge to do it.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not actually talking about waiver.  My question was just generally what I asked.  What is the standard there on whether you get a hearing?   ",05-1575

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So then the Ninth Circuit was wrong in your opinion when it defined generic theft as the taking or exercising control over property without consent, with the intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits, even if it is less than permanent or total?  They're wrong in your opinion?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well then, I don't see how you make--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Isn't that inconsistent with what you just said?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't understand how that could be right, though.  I mean, when you joyride it's less than personal.  In other words, their definition is if you take somebody else's property for an hour that that isn't theft, but if you take it for a day it is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They're trying to... is there a common law, because they're trying to report... is under the common law there a rule or any generic rule that says if you take somebody else's property for a couple of hours it is not theft, but if you take it for several hours or several days it is theft?   Stephen G. Breyer  You're saying that the rule is something is theft only if you take it long enough to deprive an owner of a significant portion of its value?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no.  Wait.  I want to know where that comes from, because I would think I have a Volvo.  It lasts for about 30 years, apparently.  So I guess if you took my car for a year, that that then would not be a theft, or maybe it would be.  Where is the source of the rule you just cited?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I want a book.  I want a book that will tell me that if they take my car for a month it isn't theft, but if they take it for a year it is.  What book, or where do I look to verify that this is common law?  I'm not denying what you're saying.  I just want to know where to look.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what do we do about that?  No, you have no interest in answering my question, but the question, it seems to me under the law, here is what I do... and I'm a good deference lawyer, as you are.  I simply look at the statute.  And I imagine some very weird case that the statute could cover where the person wouldn't have the right intent or it wouldn't be theft or it would be some odd thing.  There's no possibility in the world that applied to my client.  But most charges are simply stated in the wording of the statute.  And most judgments simply say guilty.  So I say  ""see, you see, it is theoretically possible. ""  And now when you decide what really happened, Court, you're supposed to look only to the charging documents in the judgment; and you can't say it didn't.  So the whole congressional scheme is basically put to the side.  Now what's the answer to that problem, insofar as you want to answer it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Have you been able to think of any examples where a person could have been, convicted of this statute, under the statute would he actually have been some kind of accessory to another person committing another crime, and the natural and probable consequence was that that other person would violate this statute?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Have you been able to think of one?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, I am.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well then, what's an example of where you're held guilty on the ground that you aided and abetted natural and probable... somebody did X and the natural and probable consequence was--  Y.  Because after all, you are properly held guilty when you do an act and a known consequence is Y.  So what's an example of that?   Stephen G. Breyer  One would be good enough.  The best one.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's a known and probable consequence?  That's a probable consequence?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well then, maybe the problem is that they don't define natural and probable consequence properly.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're asking us to say--  that not only do the states have to have the same rule, but they have to interpret the rule the same way.  This would make the application of the categorical approach impossible.  You'd have to look not only to the expression of the rule of law by the state courts, but to its application by the state courts in every jurisdiction.  I mean, that just makes the whole enterprise infeasible, it seems to me.   ",05-1629
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any significant variation among the different carriers as to the terms of the contracts they use in different places for Federal employees?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Under this program.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there a lot or a little?   Stephen G. Breyer  What I'm thinking of is a statute.  The statute has fairly close detail as to what the contracts must contain.  It gives authority to OMB or... to write regs.  And they have written regs that have very detailed provisions as to what the contracts must contain, and then there is the contract with the individual carried... when the... when the carrier is implementing these rules, regulations, and statutes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I'm trying to figure out is--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --It gives some.   Stephen G. Breyer  It gives some.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, I know, but I'm trying--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Insofar as the individual carriers write contracts with their covered employees, i.e., me and you and other people, and there's a lot of variation, I would say there's a lot of private going on.  But insofar as those contracts are dictated by what OPM says, then it looks more to me like a regular Federal program.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I'm trying to get a handle on that.   Stephen G. Breyer  So in other words, when I sign a contract, or anyone who's a Federal employee, it's OPM who effectively sets those terms?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I understand.   Stephen G. Breyer  You mean everybody in the entire United States gets the same piece of paper.   Stephen G. Breyer  So it's identical.  There is no difference between every individual's contract, every Federal employee's... I guess it's a contract with the Federal employee.  Isn't it? I mean, he's bound by it you say.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So I am... in Alaska, Virginia, everywhere, they get the same piece of paper.  They enroll and then they're bound by it.   Stephen G. Breyer  And the question here is whether that should get different interpretations possibly in different places.   ",05-200X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  It's quite possible no one in Congress thought about this--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --which is common.  So if it is common, why is it that we would not use the same approach that the Court used in Clearfield Trust, in Kimbell Foods, and really look to the nature of the contract?  Whereas here, the rights at stake are really those of the United States in that they are going to get the money.  We have a statute.  We have all those things I just listed.  It covers only Federal employees.  Should... there are strong interests in uniformity throughout the Nation, et cetera, et cetera.  So what is the difference between this case, other than a technical difference?  I concede that one.  The title is not United States.  It's Blue Cross Blue Shield or whatever.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Empire, et cetera.  But aside from that, why is it different?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why... why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The obvious reason for uniformity would be you are a Federal employee, whether you're in Alaska or whether you're in Virginia.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it's unreasonable to think Congress would want the rights of those different Federal employees to differ just because of where they live.  And so what's the answer to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  But I'm curious--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I... I wasn't thinking of that kind of uniformity.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  I was thinking of the contract... the contracts that the carriers enter into with the individual Federal employees in different places.  And I'm trying to get an idea of whether those contracts all read the same or they don't.  And so far, you have found one example of where they read differently.  Some contracts apparently say when you reimburse us, you can subtract attorney's fees, and others say when you reimburse us maybe you can subtract attorney's fees, depending on how we feel about it.  And I grant you that is a difference.  And I am curious, as was Justice Souter, as to whether you have to get OPM approval for that difference or whether OPM can tell you, knock it off, we want the same.  And also I'd like other examples.  What I'm trying to do, to be clear about it, is I'm trying to see how similar this is to the instance of the Federal employee checks, which this Court many, many years ago said, when you pay your Federal employees and you write a check, it's Federal law that's going to govern the interpretation of the endorsement.  I want to see how similar it is and how different.  I have two differences.  One is the name on this case is Empire, not United States, and the second difference is the one you just mentioned about may rather than must.  Now, are there others?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I would have thought the issue is whether Federal law governs this--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and they come to Federal court.  So what is clearly... maybe I... maybe you've... I don't think you've said this.  We know this.  If the United States issues checks to all of its employees throughout the country and then it seeks to recover from one of the drawees or one of the people who endorsed the check on the ground it was fraudulent, we know that it is Federal law that must govern those checks.  Right?  From Clearfield.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, what is the difference in this case?  In this case, we have a private administrator of this Federal... of this... of this Federal program.  There are Federal employees throughout the country.  They are supposed to receive uniform... reasonably uniform health insurance, and the private administrator wants to obtain money that it thinks it's entitled to to put into the Federal Treasury.  Now, aside from the name, what's the difference?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's exactly what I'm trying to find out.  That's... that's what I'm... I'm trying to figure out in my mind how close this is to the Federal Government running a uniform program.  I mean, everybody agrees Federal law governs questions involving the rights of the United States--   Stephen G. Breyer  --arising under nationwide Federal programs.  And here, we have not the United States.  We have Empire.  And so how close is Empire to being simply an instrument of the United States in this respect, and how close is it to being really an independent company that sets up its own insurance contracts?  That's what I'm trying--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That's quite good.  What are you reading from?   Stephen G. Breyer  What are you reading from there?   ",05-200X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  May I just clarify one thing on that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I take it your reason was that in Bush v. Vera, the Court said, of course, they can use race to prevent retrogression.  Of course, they can, but if they do, they have to create a compact majority minority district, not an elongated majority--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That's the... that's the argument.  I have to go back and look at Bush v. Vera.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, well, that's... but now, in fairness, I think to the red brief argument... you've read the red briefs.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  They are filled with factual information that in their opinion shows that previously the Democrats had gerrymandered this much worse, and that what... this was an effort to create a balance.  That's what their view is.  Now, I want to know really precisely what is your response to that argument.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what do I look to in the record to verify what you just said?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is the answer?  I mean, you've read the briefs.  The obvious reply to that is there are many, many districts in the United States where African American voters have a big influence on the Democratic primary.   Stephen G. Breyer  A lot.  And there are a lot where the Democrat wins.  So if your principle is accepted, says the other side, that means that any district that's drawn here to favor the Democrats can't be changed, but all the ones that favor the Republicans can be changed.  Now, if that argument is right, it's hard for me to accept, but that's a neutral principle of constitutional law.  So I want to see what... what your response is to that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Obviously you're not.  That's why I would like--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --you to say what specifically the answer to that argument is.   ",05-204X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So I... I wrote an opinion, as you know, where I was agreeing with you on that, and I wonder if... if then the thing to do would be to say, yes, indeed, a legislature can redraw a map to prevent a minority of the voters electing a majority of the congressional delegation.  But when they do that, there has to be some reasonable assurance that it works the same way for both parties.  I mean as a standard.  I thought my standard worked before.  I guess there wasn't that much agreement, but... but--  [Laughter]  --from the point of view of... of taking that standard, which you agree with, I'm glad to say, apparently, and modifying it to be sure it works out the same way for both.   Stephen G. Breyer  Would a... I'd like you to elaborate a little because, as I understood your claim, particularly in response to Justice Stevens, you agree that if 23 violated section 2, they can't make up for it somewhere else.  You agree they can't make up for it particularly when their only way is for political reasons.  But your argument is they never violated... that 23 as redrawn didn't violate section 2.   Stephen G. Breyer  And the reason that it didn't violate section 2, I want to know, is what?  Because you have the three preconditions which seem to be met, and then you have some kind of... it doesn't violate section 2 from De Grandy if, despite the preconditions, there is some kind of overall proportionality.  But all that is rather unclear in my mind, and I want to know what your view of it is.   Stephen G. Breyer  What... district 24.  I take it... it's a long walking stick is what it looks like.  And the... I take it you're saying when I go back to the record here, I'll discover a finding that the district court made.  They said this was not an effort to use race to district.  Is that right?  And one of the reasons that you think that is because, although it's not a circle, it's not absolutely terrible.  That... that is a supporter of the ultimate conclusion they did not use race.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then... then if I... if I... so I have to go back, look at the record, and see what it says.  Now, suppose I came to a different conclusion.  Then you might still win on this point if the rationale for using race to district was because we want to avoid a section 2 violation.  And there, you would lose, however, because you can't use that rationale unless, according to Bush v. Vera, the district that you draw is, in their words, reasonably compact.  So, again, you'd have to say that this district that looks like a walking stick is reasonably compact for that other purpose.  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, so I understand that.  But... but if... if I... you have two bites at this apple with your reasonably compactness.  One, you want to say it wasn't... you think this proves it wasn't to use race in the first place, but if I'm wrong on that, it's still a legitimate use of race because it's a reasonably compact effort to conform with section 2.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And is there anything I can look to to decide what reasonably compact means in that second--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, 25.   Stephen G. Breyer  On the... either it is reasonably compact or it isn't.  If it is reasonably compact, we never get into Bush v. Vera, whatever, the Vera case in the first place.  And if it isn't, you can't get out of it by saying it's an effort to cure a section 2 violation.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is it possible it violates section 2, the following?  We look at the map as it's drawn.  We ask the question, is there a way to redraw this map so that, say, the minority group has a more significant influence for their bloc voting, et cetera, et cetera?  Gingles.  Answer: Of course, there is.  It's the old way.  And you say, well, why didn't you do it the old way?  Well, the only reason you didn't do it the old way was pure politics and that that isn't a sufficient justification.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I was thinking of district 23.   INTERRUPTING ",05-204X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the answer would be because Congress is worried that people won't complain.  That's why.  And there are millions of ways of harassing people.  They start issuing a complaint.  You do all kinds of things.  You freeze them out.  You... you insult them.  You... I mean, it's easy to think of things that don't rise to the level of the... Ellerth.  So, I mean, if I... maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong, but if I'm right, why not just take, say, the D.C. Circuit standard?  They... they say that you have to show that the employer's action would have been material, which means the action might well have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.  Now, how about that?  That has the virtue of allowing a person not to be harassed, et cetera, who wants to make a complaint, and it also allows the judge to focus on the particular case and see if what the person is doing is reasonable.  It holds the complainant to a standard of reasonableness, which is common in law.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, in fact, if it turns out to be the power lunch of all time and, in fact, the person can't be at the power lunch because she's a woman, for example, and therefore, her future career is likely to take a real nose dive, why shouldn't that count as a violation?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  You see, I can think of a million things.  I can't think literally of a million, but it does seem--   Stephen G. Breyer  --to me there are many, many possible ways of really discouraging a worker from complaining that are not quite as tangible as the list under 703.  So the D.C. Circuit... and I think even the SG here, which seems like a variation of the D.C. Circuit... much... the standards seem much... not as different as you might... as it seems to me you're saying.  But... but they're... they're trying to be a little vaguer and a bit broader than the specific Ellerth language because they recognize there are many possible ways of seriously injuring a person with the intent or... to stop them from complaining.  That gives effect to the language differences.   Stephen G. Breyer  It leaves it up to case by case.  It leaves it up to the administrative agency, all in areas where I frankly don't know one lunch from another.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know one lunch from another often, but the... the EEOC might and... and so might a judge who hears evidence.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's the virtue of their standard.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well--   Stephen G. Breyer  --It's not... it's not... the... the words of the statute that I think are relevant is it... is it... you can't discriminate with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.  Now, the words I just cited are present in 703.  So that's the substantive offense.  Those words, as Justice Scalia pointed out and others, are missing in 704, and that suggests that you could have a broader definition than those words I just cited as to what counts as harm flowing from a discrimination.  That's the statutory argument.  And then you add, there could be good reason for that.  These people typically are at work and there are lots of subtle forms of harm and some not so subtle.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I'd be curious.  In the... in the Seventh Circuit, they have a test, I gather, like the D.C. Circuit, which you've characterized as broader.  Have there suddenly be a flow of these claims towards the Seventh Circuit?  Is there any empirical data that this concern that has been brought up is empirically present in the Seventh Circuit?

If I really knew about the 18th century cases, I would realize that, and it's only my ignorance that and my dissent that prevents me from understanding this.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, fine.  Then where do I look?   Stephen G. Breyer  What do you think--   Stephen G. Breyer  --If... if you understand as I... that four people on the Court took a broader view that Congress didn't want to get into this matter, and restitution is restitution, whatever it means now; that five took the historical view.  Now, if we're in the historical view, which we are, that was the majority.  At that point, I want to know how you think this case should come out.  What words should be written there if I'm thinking of the next case?  And after you win this case, if you do, the next case will simply be precisely the same as yours, but the lawyers, having acted 5 minutes quickly... more quickly, will mix up all the funds.  Now it's commingled and all we have is exactly the same with every future case that you have, and now the pension fund can't get a penny back of the money that it loaned that it should get back in good conscience.  No doubt about it.  A promise, good conscience, and they can't get a penny.  Now, you have the interest in telling me what words this Court should write, other than overrule GreatWestern, that will prevent that result from coming about.  I would like to know your--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --In other words, you don't care about these other--   Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Just from my going through this record, I compare it with Stenberg, with what's in Congress.  We have two cases here.  And it's a fair conclusion that there are, in each case, before Congress and in here, there are some doctors who think this is safe and some doctors who think it isn't safe.  And if you look at the... sort of by counting, by numbers, I guess if you look by lines of testimony or by different doctors, interestingly enough, it seems to me there are more doctors in these two cases and in front of Congress who said it is not safe than there were when we considered the other case.  And there are fewer doctors who say it is safe even with the other case.  So I don't know if you're supposed to count doctors or what.  My question would be, if this... do we owe more deference to a congressional finding or to Congress than we owe to a state legislature?  What is... I mean, I take it a state legislature is democratically elected, and don't we owe similar deference to both?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if we owe deference to both, and I would have thought that we did, then I think in the Nebraska case, despite the deference that was owed, the Court came to the conclusion that the statute of Nebraska was unconstitutional because it lacked an exception for the health of the mother, something that came from preceding cases.  So if giving deference to Nebraska, we reach that conclusion there, and if the deference that is owed is the same, and if the evidence is about the same on both sides, how can we reach a different conclusion here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If... I see what you're driving at in terms of the procedure.  We are focusing on a universe where the fetus is not going to survive no matter what, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So we are not talking about anyone being born and living.  They are not going to.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's the area of focus.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, Congress has said the doctor, you can achieve that result through method A, but not through method B, and you're saying Congress had good reason for doing that.  I take it Congress also agrees that if method B, which they don't want, were to be necessary for the safety or health of the mother, the Constitution would require it being done.  I didn't see anything here about Congress disagreeing with that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If that's right--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Right.  Fine.  Okay.  They make a finding that although we don't disagree with that, we don't think it's ever necessary for the health or safety of the mother.  That's where we are.  Now as I look at the record, I see many, many, many doctors telling Congress and everybody else that it is necessary, and safe.  And I see other doctors telling--  Congress primarily, but in court, too, that it isn't necessary, ever for safety.  And so if medical opinion is divided, and I'm not advocating what I'm about to say, I just want to know your reaction.  If medical opinion is divided, why wouldn't it be up to this Court or could this Court say this use of this procedure, we enjoin the statute to permit its use but only where appropriate medical opinion finds it necessary for the safety or health of the mother?  Now, if Congress is right, there will be no such case so it's no problem.  But if Congress is wrong, then the doctor will be able to perform the procedure and Congress couldn't object to that because the Congress isn't worried about, I mean Congress, then Congress was wrong.  They agreed that we had a health or safety exception.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  It just wouldn't be a question of the doctor's preference.  You would have to refer back to prior cases, and what the prior cases talk about including Stenberg is not that that the doctor simply has a preference, but rather that there has to be a significant body of medical opinion that says that this a safer procedure and necessary for the safety of the mother.  Now, where that's true, the Court has previously said that the Constitution protects the right.  And I don't see anything in what Congress says that wants to change that law.  They simply have a different view of the facts.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So if they have a different view of the facts, why can't we leave it up to whatever facts develop?  If there is an appropriate body of medical opinion that does in fact believe this is necessary for the health of the mother, so be it, and the abortion could be performed and the injunction would say that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And otherwise not.   ",05-380X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So in terms of--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I didn't like your characterization and the government's of the state of the record.  I asked my law clerk basically to go look up every statement that was made in four forums.  The first was the first Stenberg case.  Second was Congress.  Third is this, one of the cases here; and the fourth is the other case here.  Now, my own impression of that is if you're talking about the medical need for such a case, that is for intact D&E, that there is a risk attached if you don't use it in some instances.  The fewest number of statements for that proposition was in the first Stenberg.   Stephen G. Breyer  More statements in Congress, more statements that you... doctors who say, I need this procedure for safety.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There are many more in this case than there were... in these two cases there are many more than there were in Congress and in Congress there are many more than they were in first Stenberg.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, if we look to the other side of the coin, the doctors who say, no, it isn't safe, there I'd have to say there are probably many more in Congress than there are... who say it isn't safe, there are probably many more in Congress; and then there are some in these cases, too; and there are hardly any in Stenberg, not too many.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It was against you, in other words.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, so I'm left with a record where I guess you have a subjective characterization that there is at least as much evidence in these cases supporting you and as much in Congress supporting you as there was in the first Stenberg case.  But Congress made this finding, so what am I to do with the finding?   Stephen G. Breyer  My question basically I think you might have been going after is, I was saying that I agreed with you in that there is more evidence supporting your side in these cases than there was before Congress, than there was in first Stenberg.   Stephen G. Breyer  But still there was a finding in Congress and there wasn't a finding in the Nebraska legislature, and so does that fact of the finding being in Congress and not in the Nebraska legislature... what kind of legal difference does that make?

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But even it does hurt the suppliers and the antitrust laws are just as, I don't know just as, but they are just as concerned about a group of small farmers or a group of small growers or a group of small fishermen faced with a monopsony buyer as they are with a group of consumers having to fight off a monopoly seller.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean that's pretty well established, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, Congress has actually passed special legislation that the Mandeville Farms is consistent with the Farmers Cooperative and so... you want me to write the proposition that the antitrust laws are not concerned--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --with the monopoly buyer who would in fact exploit a group of small suppliers, farmers?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That can't possibly be right, can it?  I mean if in fact the object here is to strike, is... suppose their object is what you say.  Their object is in fact to try to get a monopoly on the buying side over a group of small woodsmen.  And they might do that if they drove out all the buying competitors, and now what are they going to try to do?  What they will try to do if they get that terrible monopoly, which would be bad--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Right.  Drive prices way down, below what the woodsmen could get for them.  And if that's going to have any effect aside from an income effect, it will leave some of them to go to the bread line or go to other places where they have other jobs at lesser revenue than they would get by staying in the woods business and selling at a reasonable price.  That would be an antitrust concern.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So where we are is at the problem.  The problem is the same as at the buying side.  What we have is possibly a very bad motive and very bad effects.  On the other hand, low prices are good for the consumer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Here we have bad effects, bad possibilities.  On the other hand, higher prices are good for the woodsmen.  So we need rules to separate the sheep from the goats.  And the other side is proposing a rule, and the rule simply is don't count this as bad conduct, unless the person who pays the money for the goods is in fact buying so many goods that later on when he tries to sell them he will incur a loss.  Now I would have thought for 40 years that was a traditional idea.  If you're trying to decide whether people are hogging goods unnecessarily for bad purposes, or rather storing up nuts for winter for good purposes, then a very good key to that is do these people expect in the long run to make money out of this without driving those victims out?  If the answer is yes; they can make money on the market, they are storing up nuts for winter.  It's good.  And if the answer is no it's bad.  That's called the recoupment test.  I don't think that's new.  I think it's old.  And I'm not sure what your view of it is.   Stephen G. Breyer  --I agree with you.  But I don't still think you can defend this retail versus maximum price restraint.  That's a whole another kettle of fish.  And what I'm interested... I guess my question particularly is, I propose one test not two, but it might be that my test encompasses the dollar test and incremental costs and so forth.  What do you think of my one test?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  One test is if they are not going to make money legitimately out of this in the long run, it's bad, unless they can explain it away.  But if they are, it's okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why did they say they needed it?  I mean, why do you need all this Ph.D. guy up there?  Why don't you just prove what you just said?   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  Then why do you need all these other instructions about pricing?  I suppose the only reason you'd need them is if there's a dispute as to whether it was in their economic interest in the absence of any intent to monopolize these people to buy all these logs or not.  And so it would be very interesting if you have a way of proving that they did not need these for any legitimate purpose, a matter which is likely to be disputed.  So, I think the hard thing in these cases is to prove that.  And if you can tell me how you prove that without giving the jury an instruction something like, look to see whether they can sell them reasonably at a profit.  Or, look to see even if they can't sell them at a profit, whether they could recoup whatever they are losing later.  Or, or, and you fill in some blanks, and now I'll have some candidates for testing.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh.  But of course, I want to injure competition always when I in fact sell at a lower price that I very much hope my competitor can't possibly meet, indeed would go out of business.  I cheer.  I would love to get a monopoly.  I would love to make a better product, lower prices, et cetera.  Do you see the problem?  And so what you've told the jury there on that instruction--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --is that they can find this person guilty even if all he wants to do is so second-guess that market that he gets the logs and will sell them at a huge profit later on in a competitive selling market.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What if it were the highest cost producer?  Suppose still, they think that by buying these logs we later can make a profit when we resell them on the competitive market.  You see, the reason they're coming up with this test is they don't think you can give, the reasoning of it is that they don't think that you can produce a better one.  So I'm listening.   INTERRUPTING ",05-381X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it doesn't... what Thermtron says is that we read (d) in conjunction with (c).  Now, the reason that (c) is relevant here is because it says, if at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded.  Presumably what (c) is thinking of are cases where subject matter jurisdiction is not the whole issue before the... the Federal court.  It's thinking that subject matter jurisdiction in certain instances, like a defect in a removal proceeding, is something that the... that the Federal court could get to prior to a final judgment.  But here, the final judgment in the Federal court is the very question of whether this is preempted or not.  And therefore, I guess what Easterbrook is thinking is that that isn't the kind of subject matter jurisdiction dismissal to which (c) refers.  Consequently, it is not within the scope of (d)'s no appellate review rule.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  It's no doubt that all the lower courts then would be wrong.  But the reason he says that they are wrong is because they looked at the word, subject matter jurisdiction, in (c) without realizing that the reference in (c) is a reference to instances where subject matter jurisdiction is not the whole issue; i.e., it's something other than the final Federal court decision.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That would be the argument he's making.  I would like your response.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I agree with you.  You would also have to say that the same rule applies, one, to the complete preemption cases and, two, to sovereign immunity determinations under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act.  But he would say that may be so, but nonetheless, Judge Easterbrook would say, well, so be it.  That's what Congress intended.  That is wrong to deprive someone of a right to appeal when it turns on a misreading of (c) and an incorporation of the misreading into (d).   Stephen G. Breyer  Would it make sense--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Does it make... what's worrying me in the back of my mind is we have decided Dabit since this case was brought.  Then I thought, well, could we remand this case in light of Dabit.  Now, if we did that, we wouldn't decide the issue that you all want decided, and we'd let this, unfortunately, slightly confused situation continue to exist.  What would be the consequence of that?  Are there... are there a lot of cases, or is this something that comes up often?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm trying to think.  It seems if you... it ought to work out similarly to what happens in a case where there's a Federal issue that you remove under.  Now you've removed.  And there also is a State issue pendent.  Now, what the judge does is he says, defendant, you win on the Federal issue, and I'm going to send this thing back now, remand it, because I don't think I want to maintain here the State issue.  And so it's a remand order.  The case is remanded.  Now, I think you get an appeal on your Federal issue there.  And then... then why shouldn't... if that's so, shouldn't this work out the same way?   Stephen G. Breyer  Shouldn't--   INTERRUPTING ",05-409X

What I don't understand is the question about something remaining to be done.  What... what 77p(b) says is the covered class action, I take it, is any private party alleging.  And when I see the word alleging, I think you're supposed to look at the complaint to see what they allege, not some other thing about what's going to happen later.  But you're telling me that's wrong.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if you're right that that's wrong, I don't see how you could possibly get out of (c) in 1447(c) which talks about a decision before final judgment, that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction.  Because if you're right, then this is before final judgment, it lacks subject matter jurisdiction.  That's the end of your case.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  You have to disagree with... I guess... go ahead.  Disagree.  I'd like to hear the answer.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, which would have to be a colorable defense that there is an allegation by the plaintiff that falls within (b).   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, if... I mean, it's awfully surprising... I think that's why you're getting this resistance... that there's an issue in a case, does... is the... the State action preempted or not.  They've never had an appeal.  So they get it tried.  The whole case is tried out, and then the... some State court says, in our opinion it is preempted.  But they can't decide that.  They can't decide it because there was a Federal judge who said the opposite in the same case before the case was final.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And they don't... and if they refuse to decide it, why wouldn't this Court say, this is the same case?  There is only one case.  It isn't over yet, and we're reviewing that, and we think that district judge was wrong.  We think that Federal district judge never read Dabit, which isn't surprising since it was decided after he wrote the opinion.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  But it's so odd.   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose... suppose the... it came up under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  The district court judge remands the case.  In his opinion Romania is not a country.  That's what he thinks.  Never heard of it.  [Laughter]  So... so it goes back to the State court and the State court says, yes, that's right.  We've not heard of Romania either.  It's not a country.  All right.

I'm interested in the law of it.  Why can't I... what's... what... the... the Constitution says reasonable or unreasonable, forbids an unreasonable entry, search.  So this doesn't seem unreasonable.

It would take about half an hour, at which time all the neighbors are awake, and they have to lose an hour of sleep.  And in addition to that, the underage drinking will continue for another half an hour or an hour.  And in addition to that, somebody else might get poked in the nose.  So those are the reasons why... or worse.  So those are the reasons why he thought it was reasonable to go in.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Those are the reasons why it was reasonable to go in.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what's wrong with that opinion?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, suppose I were to say at the end of that it doesn't require a warrant because it was not unreasonable objectively to go in under those circumstances.  What I'm looking for you to do is to tell me why.   Stephen G. Breyer  Does it say that in a case somewhere, or is that just your opinion?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, what I would like to know is what does it say in a case because I... I agree, at 3:00 in the morning, it might not appear to many people to be unreasonable when the party is so loud that no one can sleep, that they have to take an extra hour or half an hour or 40 minutes to just tell the people inside the house, knock it off.

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Do you concede that--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You--   Stephen G. Breyer  --you say your answer is, you don't make the concession?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you work in--   Stephen G. Breyer  --this area?   Stephen G. Breyer  In the Southern--   Stephen G. Breyer  --In the... have you ever heard of, or had, a client... or heard of a person from Mexico who had been deported because he has been involved in drugs, and the Government wants to bring him back because he may be a witness... maybe something develops, some other members of the gang are there, they'd like his information?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, if--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --they pick up some friends of his who are engaged in drugs, the Government might decide to try to get him back.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I'm prepared to accept perfect ambiguity here, linguistically.  And I thought of an empirical question, that you may know the answer to, that might shed some light.  Now, going along the way... maybe I'm making a mistake to point it out, if I am... but I go to the key thing here, which is the words in 924(c), What is a ""drug-trafficking crime""?  A ""drug-trafficking crime"" is a crime...  ""any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. ""  That could mean an act, physically, that is a felony under some law, and is also punishable under the Controlled Substances Act as a misdemeanor.  Okay?  Felony under... it could pick that up.  And it also could mean any conduct which is punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act.  And I could look at those words a thousand times and not have a clue which it means.  So, I thought of an empirical test.  This statute, 924(c), happens to be a statute that, if you engage in a drug-trafficking crime, as defined, and you have a gun with you, you get mandatory 5 years.  That's the point of it.  And the Government does all the prosecuting.  So, in how many cases where a person committed a misdemeanor offense, simple possession, and had a gun, did the Government insist that they get the 5 years minimum?  Now, if you're prepared to tell me ""a lot of 'em"", I'm prepared to tell you, the Government has consistently interpreted the statute the way you are now.  But if you're prepared to tell me ""zero"", I would say I would be suspicious of an interpretation that comes along now for the first time.  And my mind is open on it.  I'm quite interested in the answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But if--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --No, no.  We both agree.  All... everybody agrees here.  It doesn't have to be a Federal crime.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Correct, it doesn't have--   Stephen G. Breyer  --to be.  It could be conduct that violates the State law, but... and punish it under the State law... but the conduct involved would have to constitute what is a felony under the Controlled Substances--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Act.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  A felony or a misdemeanor.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So, I say it's suspicious.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But why not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But 924(c)(1) says that if you have a gun, and you have a drug-trafficking crime, book, 5 years.  Okay, now we go to two, what's a ""drugtrafficking crime""?  It means any felony punishable under the... under the Controlled Substances Act.  Now, in your definition, we first look to see whether simple possession is punishable under the... in Controlled Substances Act.  It sure is.  It's punishable as a misdemeanor.  So, it meets that.  Under your definition, is it a felony?  Yup, it's a felony in South Dakota.  Okay.  So, now we've got a prosecution, in Federal Court in South Dakota.  And, on your reading of the statute, that guy should get a bump-up of 5 years.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Now, is... if... I guess there are three possible positions on the question of whether a licensee can attack a contract, a patent where he has a license and wants to keep the contract.  One, he can never do it.  Two, he can always do it.  Three, it depends on what the contract says.  Now, do any of those questions have anything to do with the question before us, which is whether it is a case or controversy?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If we were to reach the question, which is very interesting,  ""What is the Government's position as to which of those three positions is the right position? ""  --were we to reach it... I agree with you, I don't see it in front of us; but maybe it is... if it were, what would be your view?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So, basically, though, you're not certain.  The Government's view would be, it is a matter as to whether you can sue claiming the patent is invalid, whether the licensee can do it, that probably... but you're not certain, and you haven't made up your mind definitely, because it is not in this case... but you think it's going to be something they could regulate themselves by contract.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Shouldn't we send that back?  I mean, I thought we were here to decide one question, that the Federal Circuit has said that,  ""Unless there is a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit, you can't bring a declaratory judgment action, because of the Constitution of the United States. ""  Now, I have to admit, I've looked up, or I've had my law clerk look up, probably now hundreds of cases, and we can't find, in any case, such a requirement.  Indeed, the very purpose... as I... we've just heard the SG say, of this act, the Declaratory Judgment Act, seems to be to allow people who... a contract... who are in a real concrete disagreement, to get a declaratory judgment without getting rid of the contract.  But I might be wrong about that.  But you've now argued a different point.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, isn't the right thing for us to do, to decide the issue in front of us and then send it back?  If you're right that they have to pay, whether they win or lose; if they're right that they promise not to sue; if you're right on 14 other grounds, you might win.  But should we decide those grounds today?  Why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let's suppose--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Well--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Will you assume Justice Stevens' hypothetical?  Assume it, take it as given.  They did put that in.  I know you think they didn't, but I want to assume it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I'd like to also assume--   Stephen G. Breyer  --The hypothetical is--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that they write into the contract... the party who's the licensee says,  ""And we stipulate that the licensee thinks that the patent is invalid. ""  Nonetheless, the licensee wants a license, for business reasons.  Therefore, the licensee and the licensor agrees that, after they sign the contract and he's paying a thousand dollars a month in royalties, he can go into court and challenge the patent.  ""So, we assume that's written into the contract. ""   Stephen G. Breyer  And now, let us also assume a state of the law.  The state of the law is that there is no public policy or any other policy that forbids such a condition in a contract.  All right?  Now, on those two assumptions, the next thing that happens is that the licensee asks for a declaratory judgment that the patent is invalid.  On those assumptions, is there a case or controversy under the Federal Constitution?  If not, why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  But he says, by the way,  ""If I win, I will, in fact, save $42 billion a year in licenses. ""   Stephen G. Breyer  ""# I would other have to pay. ""  And the other side will... or... I was a thousand dollars, I meant 42 billion, okay?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Now, that's--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm not asking--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --your hypothetical.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm asking--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --my hypothetical.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It is--   Stephen G. Breyer  --it is, under other fields of the law, isn't it?  I mean, I imagine that the very... we see, all the time, declaratory judgments where a State passes a law and the individual says,  ""Well, I think this is unconstitutional, but my preferences are not to go to jail; my preferences are not to be penalized. ""  ""So, my first choice is unconstitutional and my second is to obey it. ""  There's no possibility in the world that he will violate that law.  And yet, we've often held that, with regulations, you have to have the other requirements.  You have to have the requirements that it's concrete, it's not just ideological, there's real harm.  But, if those other requirements that are fulfilled, I've never seen any where it said that there also has to be a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit in the absence of the declaratory judgment.  I've just never found that phrase, and I can't imagine why it would be part of the law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, there are many dismissed, for the reasons that they aren't concrete, definite... there are a lot of reasons why to dismiss it.  I'm just wondering if there is an additional reason that there has to be a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit in the absence of the declaratory judgment action.  It's that phrase that I've never found anywhere--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and can't think of any reason why that would be an additional constitutional requirement.  And I'm putting that directly to you, because I want to hear you give me the counterexamples.   Stephen G. Breyer  And you say there has never been a declaratory judgment action, except in the instance where, in the absence of the action, the person would have violated the law, if it's a Government law.  In other words, if they're... so, it's really not--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  As I think as we--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You haven't.  Maybe... if this doesn't clarify it.  I think everyone has about the same question.  You have a bunch of pay phone operators.  And if the AT&T were charging them too much, I think everybody would say that the FCC can say, hey, that's too much.  You owe them 2 cents a call refund, and everybody would agree that the people who are hurt could go into court and bring a lawsuit and get the 2 cents.  Right under 47 U.S.C. 201(b).  Now, the only difference here seems to be that it wasn't AT&T that was charging, in my example, too much.  They weren't paying what they owed.  They should have paid what they owed.  And that, says the FCC, is, under 201(b), an unreasonable practice.  And, therefore, go in and collect it in court.  Now, what is the answer to that?  So far I have heard nothing that suggests that this couldn't be an unreasonable practice under 201(b), which is just what the FCC said it was.  Now, what's wrong with what I said?  I'm simply trying to focus you upon what I think is the question that's bothering some of us.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, my answer... not answer, but my characterization of what you have just said is that the FCC did say it was an unreasonable practice.  But in your view, it was not an unreasonable practice not to pay.  And you want us to go back and second-guess, which we could, if their view of unreasonable practice is unreasonable itself.  And I guess you would have to overturn it.  I didn't know that was what the case was about, but are you saying now that that's the issue?  They said it was an unreasonable practice not to pay this money, you think it is a reasonable practice not to pay the money.  There is a dispute.  That's what we should do.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Then what should we do?   Stephen G. Breyer  Just like AT&T when, in fact... or any other utility that, in fact, runs into situations every day of the week, where but for an FCC regulation, they would not be overcharging, because they have a way of doing it that isn't on its face unjust.  But the FCC writes some regulations and now it is unjust.  So I guess to take that argument would overturn, I guess, about a hundred years of rate making law.  Wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So in other words, you are saying... I think it is common that the FCC might write some accounting rules, for example.  And they might say, before these accounting rules, Mr. Bell's system in San Francisco, you could charge people 8 cents a call.  But given the way we set up the accounting rules, we think this month you have to do 7 cents in the first six months, 7 cents, in the next six months, 9 cents.  And any deviation from that is unreasonable.  And the company does deviate.  I would have always thought when they do deviate, they are behaving unreasonably, and someone who pays too much could go into court and get money back.  Am I wrong about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's actually... that's, I think, your strong... to me that was the strongest argument.  When I finished reading it, I thought, well, so what.  You know, I mean, can you see why I thought that?  I mean, today's world is different.  It is true that you don't have simply a single telephone company providing service ultimately directly to the customer.  You have everything mixed up.  And there are a lot of inter-carrier things.  Language covers it.  Purpose covers it.  Facts and circumstances change.   ",05-705X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is it possible... I was worried somewhat about, I think, the problem Justice Scalia raised, that old regulations become unjust and unreasonable.  And then I thought, no, but tell me if this is right.  That they're going to fall within 201(b) only if a violation is unjust and unreasonable.  Now, we could say, and moreover, the FCC has to find that a violation of these regs is unjust and unreasonable, that is, it has to focus on it, make that determination.  And then, of course, that determination has to be a reasonable interpretation.  In other words, it can't just call anything unjust and unreasonable--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --And it has to focus on the fact that their doing so will create this private remedy in the courts.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That that... if you have that tough... which I haven't seen anywhere, but I mean, if you had that tough a requirement, so they actually have to focus on it, it would tend to minimize the problem of a thousand different actions in ten thousand different courts and a big mess.  But I mean, how much is written into those words unjust and unreasonable?  I'm certain you can't squeeze any rate... it is not the case that any and every regulation can be... fall within.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  As we're supposed to decide the case, in your view, there was instruction 13.  Instruction 13 used the word direct.   Stephen G. Breyer  You object to 13.  You said it should use the word in whole or in part.   Stephen G. Breyer  You then argued to the lower courts, 13 should use the word in whole or in part.  And then you say you've argued that here.  So what you're saying is now we're supposed to decide, should instruction 13 use the word in whole or in part.  That's what it is.  I have to admit, I didn't quite get that out of the blue brief.  I thought you were arguing something else about railroad negligence.  But you're not now, you say, arguing about railroad negligence.  You're arguing about plaintiff negligence.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So if I reread the blue brief, what I'll discover on closer examination, that your real objection, not responding to the other side, has simply been about the standard to use in respect to plaintiff's contributory negligence.  And what you want this Court to say is, you're right about that, we want the more relaxed standard used for contributory negligence.  End of case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes?   Stephen G. Breyer  It says that in the blue brief?   Stephen G. Breyer  I would say it sure is before the Court, because what we are considering before the Court is your objection to instruction 13.  And you said it should use the words in whole or in part.  And I have to admit, I don't know why it shouldn't.  But I'll have to ask them that.   Stephen G. Breyer  You're going to say yes.  So all this other stuff is quite extraneous about whether... the railroad standard of negligence, the railroad should be in a relaxed standard of negligence, in whole or in part.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Causation.   Stephen G. Breyer  I think I'm seeing now, I think the structure of your brief is... perhaps a gloss put on it, but saying this: Look, we objected to the contributory negligence instruction on the ground that it couldn't be different from the direct instruction... from the railroad instruction.  And we said they should be the same and they should both be in whole or in part.   Stephen G. Breyer  And we now want you to say that the refusal of the court to do that was wrong, because it violated the equivalence.  But as soon as you do that, you're going to have to think about what the right standard should be for a new trial.   Stephen G. Breyer  And if you stop there, probably, they will put the in whole or in part, but that's not the right standard.   Stephen G. Breyer  And if you really think about it, you will see that the one we didn't ask for, but the one that the court gave, is the right standard and should have been given in the other case, too.  Now, we wouldn't have to say that.   Stephen G. Breyer  But you're saying unless you say that, you're not going to give proper instruction to what happens in the future.  Now--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Now let's think back for a minute on the merits.   Stephen G. Breyer  How could it be wrong?  How could it be wrong to have instructed the jury with the in whole or in part language for the railroad, since that's the language of the statute itself?   Stephen G. Breyer  What possible... you have two sides.  One, you write a proximate cause instruction in whatever language you like.   Stephen G. Breyer  The other side submits a proposed instruction with in whole or in part.  I'm a trial judge.  I've never heard of this case, kind of case before.  I just was appointed.  I read the statute.  And I say, well, here, theirs says what the statute says, and yours doesn't.  I'll play it safe.  I'll go with the statute.  All right?  Now, how could that be an error?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, what the statute said it is not a correct statement of the law?   INTERRUPTING ",05-746X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I guess they want to make the argument now, whether they did or not, that if we look at Section 53, which I think is the part dealing with contributory negligence.  I don't see anything else.  It doesn't speak of causation at all.   Stephen G. Breyer  It just says if there's some contributory negligence, the damages will be diminished according to the negligence attributable to the employee.  So I take it their argument was, maybe with hindsight, Judge, don't give this direct language, because nothing requires it.  And since, other things being equal, nothing requires it, you ought to give the same language you gave for the other side.  And they said the judge rejected that argument, so now they tell us, well, that was wrong, he should have accepted it.  And all the rest of what he's saying is just in case the Court wants to reach it, or something like that.  But what about that one?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean, should we answer the question he now... perhaps in his minimalist position... might want to raise, or maybe did, that Section 53 doesn't speak of causation, the judge gave a causation instruction.  The judge's causation instruction in their view was wrong, and the law requires the judge's causation instruction on contributory negligence, if there is one, to be the same as it was on direct, the defendant's negligence.  And he says that isn't what happened, we objected to it, we produced arguments, one of them was this equivalence thing.  So he's saying to us: Decide it, say that they were wrong.  What's your view of that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not surprised.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  That's just an argument.   Stephen G. Breyer  It was not, but they say, nonetheless, we did object that this instruction was wrong.  One reason it was wrong is because it speaks of causation differently than when they spoke of causation in respect to the railroad.  We thought that was a reason why it was wrong then.  We think that's a reason why it is wrong now, and we would like the Missouri court, but they wouldn't do it, so we want you to say it was wrong for that reason.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, we say, well, we'll abandon all that, that's just a series of different arguments that we'd like the Court to say.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you read it carefully, you'll see it, basically.  [Laughter]   ",05-746X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why couldn't there be here?  I mean, at some point, at some point, seeing every judge in this case say this is a thoroughly... no, let me not exaggerate.  But they say wearing buttons is a bad idea.  For obvious reasons.  Now, at some point, if enough judges say that, each time they say, well, it is a bad idea, but we can't say in this case that it was so prejudicial, there's that inherent risk that it's unconstitutional.  But if some point, if people begin enough is enough to say, this is quite a bad idea to have buttons being worn in a courtroom, which is not a place for demonstration, does it not become pretty clear, irrespective of exactly what opinions say what, that this is just very unfair and unconstitutional?   Stephen G. Breyer  Absolutely right.  Suppose you think in this Federal court, which we are, that banners, posters, and buttons are a thoroughly bad idea.  Now, why?  Not just because of decorum.  But because they introduce an extraneous factor into the judgment of the jury.  And suppose I also think... I'm not saying I do, I'm trying this out... but it is pretty hard to draw lines among buttons.  It is pretty hard to draw lines among banners.  And the only way to guarantee fair trials in whole... is to have a wholesale rule on this.  No buttons, no banners, no petitions, no posters.  How would you explain... you just say the law just doesn't permit that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What do you want to say about that?  Because that is a concern I have.   ",05-785X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I thought the key sentence in this is he says the simple photograph of Tom Studer on a button which... I don't know what the size is.  Nobody has told them what the button is about.  Nobody has put for the judge a picture of it.  Nobody showed him what the button is.  So he says a simple photograph of Tom Studer was unlikely to have been taken as anything other than the normal grief occasioned by the loss of a family member.  Period.  Now, what else is there to say?  That's the court's conclusion.  And it is pretty hard for me... I looked for the button.  I couldn't even find the button in the record.  I didn't even know what this looks like.  It is a button, somebody later must have said two inches to four inches.  I don't know who said that.  I don't know how the judge could have known that.  The button isn't in the record.  So why isn't it just a normal sign of grief unlikely to influence anybody?  That's what they say.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In this case.   Stephen G. Breyer  It goes on frequently in an opinion.  I have been known to do that myself.  And I say this court over here says it's a da-da-da, and I say ""sure isn't that"".  Well, what is it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what was the... what in your opinion... this is why... as you can see, I'm concerned about buttons.  I think they're probably a problem.  I think all judges are concerned about them.  But then I think about this particular case.  And I look at that single sentence:  ""It was unlikely to be taken as a sign of anything other than normal grief. ""  I mean, suppose this had been a different case.  Suppose the defense in this case was the defendant Smith didn't pull the trigger.  It was an unknown person called Jones.  Then if I were on the jury, I would look out, see the buttons, and I'd say, hmmm, the family thinks it was Smith.  Otherwise they wouldn't be here with those buttons.  I could think that.  But this isn't that case.  This is a case where everyone thinks your client pulled the trigger.  The only question is whether the family's son came at him with a machete.  So when I look at the buttons, I'd think sure, they don't think the son came at him with... I mean, they don't think that.  He's their son.  What would you expect them to think?  So that's why I thought that they are saying that sentence, in this case.  In this case, it would be taken as sign of grief and nothing more.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  This reason... suppose, hypothetically, I would think... well, the rule should be no buttons.  No buttons, no signs, no banners.  A courtroom is a place of fair trial, not a place for a demonstration of any kind.  Now, if I were to think that, and I also were to think it's just too difficult to figure out case by case whether there is or is not an improper influence, suppose I thought both of those things.  Now, you've heard, quite rightly, the other side says: One, you're supposed to decide whether this was clear in the law.  Two, if you're worried about the future, you can't lay down a rule that's clear in the law either because of A, AEDPA, and B, the case that was cited, which said it's holdings that count, not dicta.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask you about an argument I think they did make?  I think they made this argument.  On page 26 of your brief, I think it's explained well.  You set out the regs and the reg says that a major modification is  ""any physical change in the method of operation that would lead to a significant net emissions increase. ""  Then you have little (iii), which is an exception, and it excepts a physical change which leads to... is just an increase in the hours of operation or the production rate.  So that's out of it.  Now, the question is what's in it?  If that's out of it, what's in it?  I think what they've said is, if you think about that, we'll tell you what must be out of it is a physical change that does nothing to increase the capacity, but just means you can run it more hours.  And they say their proof of that is that that was the EPA's interpretation for years and years and years.  Indeed, we did what we did thinking that was it.  And then after we did what we did, they pulled the rug out from under us and said no, that isn't it; now it means any physical change, like you change a nut, or a bolt, or a tube, even though there's no increased capacity to emit more.  It's just you run it more hours.  Now, that they say is basically unfair, it's not what this reg has been about.  And they made that argument, according to them, very strongly and the Fourth Circuit took the argument and changed it all around and made some propositions of law that it's hard for even them to defend.  All right.  Now, that's what I think, that's what I think is lying... maybe that's lying at the heart of it.  And if it is, what do you say?   Stephen G. Breyer  It looks like... I went back and read the Puerto Rico cement case.  And it certainly looks as if... though the issue was somewhat different.  It looks as if the interpretation that the EPA is taking there is not consistent with what you are reading now and is consistent with what they're saying today.  And that was in 1988-89, I guess.  They must have been starting on that in '87.  So it seemed to me we have a mixed bag.  Some people were saying the one thing.  Some people were saying the other thing.  And the later in time seems to be the Puerto Rico cement.  And that was at least 17 years ago.  And--   Stephen G. Breyer  --The analysis which was probably pretty much based on what they said, I think was that the reason there was increased potential here to pollute, was really because this change would permit the plant to be run more intensively or more hours, something like that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, we didn't address it.  I'm not taking it as evidence of that.  I'm taking it as evidence that the EPA then had a basic position similar to what they have now.  That's what I'm using it as a basis for thinking that they were not saying to have a change, the word ""change"" includes only a change in physical facilities that increases the amount of emission per hour.  Am I right?  Or--   Stephen G. Breyer  --So then they'll say your argument here, even if you are right, I think they think you're wrong... but even if you're right, they'll say well, that's an argument that it is arbitrary, capricious abuse of discretion for them to change horses in the middle of the stream, i.e., for them to take an interpretation of a reg that was longstanding and without adequate notice and comment and so forth radically reverse that interpretation.  Now that's not the issue in front of us now.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They say because the Fourth Circuit didn't go really on that, it went on some statutory thing, and--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --The obvious reason to do it is, I guess you have an area of the country, let's say, which is quite clean in the air.  And there is a power plant.  And what somebody works out, which is normal, is demand for electricity is increasing.  And so what we will do is we're going to take these turbines and system, and we're going to change it really radically.  It doesn't produce one more particle per hour, but now we can run it 24 hours a day and previously we'd run it 12 hours a day.  So there's going to be twice as much pollution in the air.  Now the whole idea of the PSD system is you don't have twice as much pollution in the air, and I guess that's why they wanted to do it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because you can use the same word, you can apply the same word in different places differently, depending on what your basic object is in the different place.  It's very hard to say what kind of modification might exist over here, there, the other place.  And you put your finger on a very difficult question for power companies, because those turbines do go at different amounts of rates and so forth during a day, during a month, during a year, so it's hard for them.  Therefore, you have a complex definition.  What's wrong with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  Because the language, I don't see anywhere in the statute where... the words of modification are, it's a physical changing or change in a method of operation which increases the amount of any air pollutant.  Now those words,  ""physical change which increases the amount of any air pollutant. ""  could mean different things in different places.   Stephen G. Breyer  Where does it say in the statute that they can't?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you do have a brief here.  You have a brief filed in the D.C. Circuit, which is Brief For Industry Petitioners on Actual Emissions Definition.   Stephen G. Breyer  And throughout that brief it refers again and again to the problem, their proposed reg is not taking, i.e., the potential capacity, which is change the machine so it puts out more per minute or whatever, but rather, it's using actual emissions even though you don't change the capacity of the machine.  There's a whole brief on that.  So you already argued that whole brief, that what they were doing was inconsistent with the statute, et cetera.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  As being outside the statute at that time, and you did.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I was just thinking, then you're left with what you called the weak argument, arbitrary, capricious, et cetera, because I don't see how you make the stronger one, what you think is stronger, since you made it before, or a version of it before the D.C. Circuit.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, not collateral estoppel, but you know, I'd be repeating myself.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what it is.   INTERRUPTING ",05-848X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  If in fact it goes back to the State court and you litigate it, you lost, can you raise as a point of appeal that you did not receive two things the statute guaranteed you?  One was a determination in the Federal court that you're an organ of a Federal State, and second, a bench trial?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, but could you?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm just asking could you, yes or no.  I--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, okay.  Now if you lost in the State court, could you then use that as a basis for asking this Court to accept jurisdiction?  And if they... if we did, we took it and we heard the case, reverse, and send it back for the proper tribal under the statute?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  See, what I'm getting at is whenever there's an erroneous remand, the practical problems that you raise are present.  And they're awful.  I don't deny them.  I mean, they're right there in the statute, it foresees them.  So I wonder, is there any difference in this case from every case where the remand is erroneous?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In terms of the legal right to get the trial to which the law entitles you on your view of the law, there is no difference.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And you would get those eventually, it would just have to happen.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  One technical question.  The same one.  I would to be... imagine it is a diversity case.  Imagine that a Federal court erroneously remands it.  A trial gets up to this Court.  And we say it was diverse.  It shouldn't have been remanded.  Now what's... is that like... can that happen?  I guess.  And is the remedy then wipe out the State proceedings, go back to Federal court?  What happens?  Has that have ever been a case like that?     Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  What happened?     The Missouri Pacific Railway case holds that even this Court, on review of a State court judgment following remand cannot review the remand order itself.  It can review issues of Federal law that were decided by the State courts on remand but--   Stephen G. Breyer  And it is called, the case, Missouri--     --Missouri Pacific Railway case.   ",05-85XX
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what, what reason would Congress have for wanting a system that says... and there are many, many, many people in the United States who would like to sue Pakistan.  They would like to sue China.  They would like to sue Russia.  There are all kinds of places they would like to sue.  And why would Congress want to have a system that says to those countries, you can come into Federal court and get your claim adjudicated, whether it is really you, China a; but by the way, if the Federal judge makes a mistake, there you are in Mississippi, Alabama, Illinois, any one of 50 different states?  In front of juries, the very thing that we gave you this statute so you wouldn't have to do.  Now what would their theory be?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They were saying they were an organ of--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yeah, and therefore they are immune unless... unless they fall within an exception.  And it may be they do.  Is that not right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I'm saying, that's how the statute works.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I take it if you win this, it's precisely the same, in respect to a person who has total immunity.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And a Judge makes a big mistake--   Stephen G. Breyer  --China comes in--   Stephen G. Breyer  --And says of course you're China.  And then it signs a remand order.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Well, after all... if you're going to say, you say that one is reviewable on appeal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is it or not, in your view?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  And now all they want here is the organ issue reviewed on appeal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And what's the difference between the one and the other?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, and you agree with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  Then why is it in your opinion that the immunity thing is so important that they get this collateral appeal, but the organ thing is not so important since all, what turns on that is whether they're going to have their non-jury trial.   Stephen G. Breyer  We have this very old judge like me.  China is there.  And he says: This isn't China; Formosa is China.  So he says remand.  So there we are, China is now in the Western District State Court for Illinois and they're suing them for a lot of money.  Now, you said, I thought, before that where that happened, and they wrongly denied immunity, they could, China, appeal in the Federal system.  I thought you said that.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  What?   Stephen G. Breyer  All they want is a definitive appeal that this is really China, all right.  Now, can they do that, yes or no?  You said yes.  So I thought Justice Kennedy's question was, if they can do that, why can't Powerex appeal in exactly the same way on the question of whether they're an organ.  What's the difference?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't care.  I don't call this an appeal of a remand.  What this is, it is an Appeal of the determination precedent to remand that Powerex is not an organ.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That would make them just as happy, I believe.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not say, depending on the clever lawyers, or non-clever as the case may be, why not just say Congress intended that you do get an underlying appeal in the Federal system, for what is at stake is not simply where the case will be tried, but rather significant and important rights attach in the Federal court that do not attach in the State court.  And therefore, it is like, the appeal you get when they... when what is at stake is immune or not, and by doing that we avoid four more years of litigation and the necessity to hire clever lawyers.   INTERRUPTING ",05-85XX
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But I think that the point that Justice Souter is trying to make, as I understand it, is of course there is a similarity with Gratz, people choose, but there's a big difference.  The similarity in Grutter, or the difference in Grutter and Gratz is that you had a prize, a school that was supposed to be better than others, that the members of that school, the faculty and the administration tried to make it better than others.  It was an elite merit selection academy.  And if you put the black person in, the white person can't get the benefit of that.  Here we have no merit selection system.  Merit is not an issue.  The object of the people who run this place is not to create a school better than others, it is to equalize the schools.  That's in principle and in practice, if you look at the numbers, you see that the six schools that were at the top, their position would shift radically from year to year, preferences was about equal among them.  They have the same curriculum, they have similar faculties, and I don't think anyone can say either in theory or in practice, that one of these schools happened to be like that prize of University of Michigan, a merit selection system.  That, I think, was a major difference that he was getting at, why is this not the same kind of thing?  That was at issue in Grutter and Gratz.  Now what is your response to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't say that they were.  What I said was that the object of the school board and the administering authority was to make them roughly equal.  I said that in terms of curriculum and faculty, they're about roughly equal.  And in terms of choice, what you see is a wide variation in choice by those who want to go as to which is their preference among six schools over a period of five years.  And that suggests a rough effort to create the equality, not an effort as in Michigan, to run a merit selection system.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  Now the question is, why doesn't that fact that this is not a merit selection system but a different kind of thing, a sorting system or a system designed to maintain a degree of integration, why doesn't that difference make a difference?   Stephen G. Breyer  While you're talking about the way, let me ask a practical question.  35 years ago in Swann, this Court said that a school board, particularly an elected one... it didn't say that...  ""could well conclude that to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting the proportion of the district as a whole. ""  Far more radical than anything that's at issue here.  Then it adds  ""To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities. ""  That's what this Court said 35 years ago.  Thousands of school districts across the country, we're told, have relied on that statement in an opinion to try to bring about a degree of integration.  You can answer this in the next case if you want.  So think about it.   Stephen G. Breyer  My question, of course, is simply this.  When you have thousands of school districts relying on this to get a degree of integration in the United States of America, what are you telling this Court is going to happen when we start suddenly making... departing from the case?  Do you want us to overrule it?  Why?  Why practically?   Stephen G. Breyer  This is the... as I gather, the plan where race is used, has to do only with the ninth grade.  And therefore, what you would like to note is when you look at the ninth grade after they stopped using any racial criteria at all, what happened to those ninth grade classes.  Did they become more heavily separated or did they retain their diversity?  Are the numbers that you are about to read us, which I have in front of me, going to do that?  Tell us that?  I think they're about the whole school.   Stephen G. Breyer  The numbers I have here, Franklin went from 25 percent white to 12.7 percent.  Roosevelt, which was basically a white school, jumped up from about 51 to 59.  Ballard jumped up from about 56 to--  62.  Then Garfield went down some, more mixed.  But those were the worst ones; am I right on that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   ",05-908X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Justice Kennedy's question, I think, was is this basically a kind of last resort?  Or how close to a last resort is it?  What's the history of this?  I thought the history involved a lawsuit to desegregate the schools, a much more rigid system of racial... abuse of race.  Ultimately you come to this.  Now you stop this.  And what happened after you stopped it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what is the history basically?  Am I right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But that's not what I'm thinking.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean I'm thinking that, I thought as I read this, and you have to correct me because you have a better knowledge, originally the schools were highly segregated in fact.  People brought a lawsuit.  Then to stop that Seattle engaged in a plan that really bused people around on the basis of race.  That led to white flight.  That was bad for the schools.  They then tried a voluntary choice plan.  This is part of that plan.  Then when they abandon this plan, they discover more segregation.  Is that basically right or not?   INTERRUPTING ",05-908X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is this to do... I mean, I'm... I'm puzzled about why we're talking about this complicated thing.  I mean why... the statute as I read it has a section and it's called procedural, procedural rights.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it says that the procedural rights, right at the beginning, are for both the children and the parents.  And it sets up some procedures in the agency which is for the children and the parents and school board, and everybody is supposed to be there.  And then another part of the same section says any person aggrieved by the first has a court hearing.  Why isn't that the end of it?  It's clearly aimed, as the statute is aimed, at both students and parents.  And then we give them all procedural rights, and what in the statute says that the procedures that they're following before the school board happen to be for both parents and students.  But without saying a word, a different procedure, a Federal court procedure in the same section, without saying anything, would be just for the students and not for the parents?  I mean, I find that hard to read the statute that way.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not.  I'm talking about the whole Act.  Throughout the whole Act, they talk about parents and students.   Stephen G. Breyer  And who writes the check?  The student?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Of course.  The parent writes the check.  And has the interest?  I have an interest in educating my children as you do in yours.  And this statute talks about that throughout.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So I'm looking at the particular words in the procedural section, and the particular words explicitly say that every subsection is both for parent, through child; and then we get to the Court one and it talks about person aggrieved.  And you, I guess, have to convince me... which as I'm putting it, sounds like an uphill battle--  [Laughter]  But you have--   Stephen G. Breyer  --You have to convince me that person aggrieved at the at the end of this section is meant to apply to only some of the people whom every other section talks about, namely just children, not parents.  Now why should I read that it way?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Your argument, I guess, is this argument.  Now you're conceding the parent does have a right to go to court, but he can only complain about something that hurts him.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He can't complain in court or... well, it sounds as if you were saying that.  You're saying that the hearing officer has to decide against the parent and if he doesn't decide against the parent, obviously the parent can't go into court because he doesn't have anything to complain about, the parent.  Isn't that your point?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, well... right.  I'm sorry.  Then you go ahead.  I thought I heard you say that the problem is that the parent didn't have a right taken away by the hearing officer, and that's why the parent can't go to court.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, I would agree, we can be on the same grounds there.   Stephen G. Breyer  I agree that if the parent isn't hurt, if the parent wasn't deprived of anything, the parents can go to court but doesn't have anything to complain about, you know, whereas another section of the statute says that reimbursement is something supposed to be reimbursement for the parent, so it would seem as if the panther has something to complain about.  Isn't that so?  It says the... I think so... it says a parent is to be reimbursed.  I thought that was one of the things that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --So, now it looks as if the parent has something to complain about.  The parent hasn't got the money that he was supposed to get.  Now we have something to complain about, so therefore, we're aggrieved, and then the last section says an aggrieved person can go to court.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So I take it your argument is, your red brief argument is that Congress said, states, if you get some judgments against you and they award attorneys' fees, you pay for it, we won't?  Is that what it said?   Stephen G. Breyer  You don't pay for it, you can't pay for it out of the grant?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So we're not paying for this, you pay for it.  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  States--   Stephen G. Breyer  --if some people bring claims against you under this because you didn't have a good plan for the child and your attorneys' fees are awarded against you, don't pay for it out of this grant.  Isn't that what you're saying it says?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I thought what your argument was... and if it's not, forget it, it's just that I don't understand it.  That here the Government says pay for this out of your own pocket, and then its defines what you're supposed to pay out of our own pocket is, as a parent representing a child, not his own action.  And then later on they say, they define it differently.  They talk about prevailing party.  The parents of the prevailing party.  But you say that second phrase must mean the first phrase.  Because it wouldn't make sense for the Government to say pay for that out of the grant but not this out of the grant.  That's your argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  It is an argument.   ",05-983X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  If we just could go to the merits for a second here.  You're saying this word, where it says, the word is you ""may convert"", and that means you can convert no matter what?   Stephen G. Breyer  No matter what?  Okay, suppose they repeal Chapter 13 before you convert.  Then can you convert?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm just producing examples where it's clear you can't convert.  Now, suppose Congress... there is no Chapter 13.  Could you convert then?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, okay.  Suppose he dies.  Could you convert then?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  No inheritance, no nothing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Even though there's no such person existing any more.  He's gone and his whole family is gone, and there's no inheritors, nothing.  Then can he convert?  No.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm trying to produce ridiculous examples.  Maybe... all right, so you say even if he's dead and there's no family he still could convert.  That's an extreme test of my hypothetical, but okay.  What about if, in fact, he goes insane?  No.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about if, in fact, the conversion is part of a scheme to defraud millions of people in a foreign country because it will be viewed as a signal that they should mail their life savings into a particular account in Switzerland?  Can he convert then?   Stephen G. Breyer  You say yes on that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Even though it's going to bilk people out of millions of dollars?   Stephen G. Breyer  No matter what?  Even if he's dead, even if he's insane?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well alright, then I can't get anywhere with my hypotheticals.  [Laughter]  I would have thought the answer was no, but there we are.   Stephen G. Breyer  But there is a difference, and this is... assume with me, which apparently you don't agree, that everywhere in law there are implied exceptions for unusual circumstances.  I have never found an instance where you couldn't think of some exception that they didn't see.  You could not bring a thing if you were insane or dead or if a death would ensue or a murder.  Assume that, all right.  Then the question would be, well, what about this instance?  And I think the strongest instance... the strongest argument for saying there's is no exception here is the argument that the trustee discovers that this individual is behaving dishonestly, that he's hidden assets.  Maybe he has a safe deposit box and he has a key and the key... the key will allow him to get diamonds out of the safe deposit box and hide them.  Under 7, the trustee has the key.  As soon as you convert it to 13 the key is given back to the debtor, who has been shown dishonest.  Now, assuming you're going to have some exceptions, why isn't that a very, very powerful one?

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  As to the element, I thought that what the Ninth Circuit talked about was overt act.  They didn't use the words ""overt act"".   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, all right.  I thought that comes out of conspiracy law; it doesn't even out of attempt law.  Then I thought it's unlikely... but here you can correct me.  The U.S. Code is filled with the word ""attempt"".  Just opening it at random, there are attempts to assault and steal mail matter, there are attempts to steal the mail matter, there are attempts to rob a bank, attempts here, attempts there.  Is it the Government's practice whenever they charge a violation of any of these provisions to not just use the word ""attempt"", but to use the words ""substantial step""?   Stephen G. Breyer  I would have thought the answer was no.  And therefore, this isn't just a small error of a technical sort.  The Ninth Circuit is completely wrong and not even close.  And therefore, if they're not even close, can the Government come up here where there's an obvious error and they decide, the Government, that it would like to have a declaration by this Court on a matter that they think is quite interesting and important to them in a lot of other cases where they can't win the cases easily?  That's, I'm putting it a little pejoratively because I'm trying to get you to see what I'm driving at.  It's like a hoked-up case.  Why not?  I'm using it pejoratively only so that you can see what I'm worried about.   Stephen G. Breyer  Does this come up very often?  I think the case... the issue you want to raise, because I would think normally there's a motion before the trial, well before the jury is empanelled.  The defendant says: I want you to dismiss this; the indictment's inadequate.  And if that's even close, I would think normally the prosecutor would go back and say: Fine, I'll get a superseding indictment, and that would end the problem.  And it seems to me so likely to happen that the chances of the judge wrongly ruling against the defendant and then it goes through a whole trial almost never happens.   Stephen G. Breyer  Doesn't an indictment have as its purpose in part to tell the defendant what crime he's being accused of committing?  Isn't that... so that's why I thought it would be quite clear, wouldn't it, or helpful to say that to the Ninth Circuit?  And so an error is when it doesn't do that?  And an error is when it leaves out an element, and he doesn't know what crime is being committed, he's accused of.  So suppose you had an indictment that really did that.  Now he doesn't know what crime he's accused of.  And then you go to the trial and so forth and now we have to go into at what point did he work out what crime he was being accused of, rather hard to say.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, yes, of course the chances are.  But there's a possibility he didn't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So if he didn't and therefore the indictment was faulty in that respect, then what?  Are you going to say we have to track down... I mean what it's reminding me of is like trying to say whether he got an adequate lawyer, didn't get an adequate lawyer, who knows, that kind of problem.   Stephen G.

There's complete absence of any evidence whatsoever on a major element of the offense.  And now, suppose we get finished with the trial.  Plenty of evidence.  Conviction.  Can you go back and raise that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I mean can you win.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, you see, I'm saying is that error?  Is that correctible error?  I'm saying there is an absolute error.  It is far worse than here.  We know for a certainty there was no evidence whatsoever presented to the grand jury on a major element of the crime.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, I assume we know that.  Take that as a given.  We know.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, we know.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Zero.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but what is the answer to my question, yes or no?  I'm saying after the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That's right.  So the answer is no?   Stephen G. Breyer  And if you can't raise that, which is a major area because there's a harmless error is what it really amounts to, why isn't the same true here where the error is far more likely to be simply technical and make no difference given the adequacy of the evidence?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It does as well in my case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can't you ask for a bill of particulars?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then you would have had no problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's a separate requirement.  I don't know if it's constitutional or not constitutional, but I didn't think that requirement was at issue here.  The requirement of stating the facts is not the requirement of setting out the elements of the law.  At least that's my understanding.  Now, you can correct me if I'm wrong.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not denying that.  I just didn't think that had anything to do with this case.  I mean, I thought that the object of the indictment initially was to set forth what crime the person was accused of and inform him of that.  You are saying, and then there is another requirement, which seems a little vague.  It's been hard for me to find out, to pin this down, and it's the one you state, which is that it says in addition in the rule you have to have facts.  I don't know if those are the same.  I thought they were two separate things.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's exactly what I... I tried to read some treatises on this, and the more I read, the more confused I got.  I started out thinking, well, it's sufficient if you have bank robbery you say on October 14, 2004, in the city of such and such, at the corner of such and such, where there is a bank, the defendant walked into the bank and he, he attempted or he did by force or threat of force, take property belonging to someone else, or whatever it is, and that that would be sufficient.  And that you don't have to say, and in addition he, you know, what the force consisted of, did it consist of a knife, or a gun, or a fist.  Can you give me some enlightenment, at least if you think that's relevant here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If it's excessive detail, the central fact, then why isn't on such and such a date at such and such a time he attempted to?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Then why, if that's so, why wouldn't that apply as well if they said he attempted to and committed an overt act in... that is a substantial step.  And then you're saying in addition, they have to list the particular facts.   Stephen G. Breyer  I couldn't find any case in this Court that said that.  I mean, I found in Hamling a case that went the other way, a general statement.  They said all you have to do is say obscenity, you don't have to say how obscene or in what way it's obscene, et cetera.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  And then Russell seems lost from sight for quite a while, or isn't followed a lot.   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose that it's an assault and the indictment says on such and such a day, at such and such a time, he assaulted the postman, right?  You also have to say what, that he waved his fist or that he had a knife?  You have to say that in the indictment?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  All right.  So I thought normally essential facts means simply the facts... you can state the essential facts by writing the statute and normally that tells you.  Now, is that true?  One case that seems to go the other way is Russell.   Stephen G. Breyer  Normally, yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why more than any other word in the statute?  ""Attempt"", people know what that means.   Stephen G. Breyer  And they also know what ""assault"" means.  And if you tried, you could spell out ""assault"".  They know what ""robbery"" means, but you could spell it out.  So why does the Ninth Circuit think this one you have to spell out, but all the other words you don't have to?   ",05-998X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I've got that point, but what is your suggestion as to how to deal with what is underlying disturbing me and it seems like a lot of others, if prima facie Congress did not intend that you launder money where the activity is an essential part of the underlying crime itself?  And there are three ways of dealing with that: One is this gross receipts method, which has the defects you mentioned.  The second is a definition of ""promotion"" which says when you promote a crime that's different from engaging in the crime.  And the third is sentencing; because it's a real offense sentencing method and where what you've done is nothing more than the underlying crime, the sentence should be nothing more than the underlying crime.  I see three ways to get to the same problem, and you're asking us to decide them piecemeal, yet they're related.  What do I do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But still your answer leaves me... and I have no answer to this; I want yours.  I want you to see that I'm in... at risk here as a judge of getting whipsawed, that I first decide this case for you; and the next case, all kinds of arguments appear that I hadn't thought of; and then the third case, again.  But if I could have them somehow together, I could look at the least evil way or the most efficient way of achieving the congressional objective.   Stephen G. Breyer  I have it in front of me actually.  I was looking at it.  And it seems to me what it assumes is that the underlying offense is different from the money laundering.  And do you have any rationale at all as to why this individual, if it's true that he did nothing more than engage in the underlying offense, why should he receive one day more than 60 months?   INTERRUPTING ",06-1005
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The question is can you violate the statute by financial transactions which... have you promoted the crime, when those transactions are no more than part of the crime itself?  That's basically the question.  And I think Justice Kennedy is asking if, in fact, we wanted to reach that question, is this a case in which we could do it, through reargument or in some other way?

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I guess the part that they are saying is arbitrary as I understand it, and I appreciate your correcting me if I don't understand it correctly, is that you get double your pension at 55 if you've worked 20 years as opposed to 10.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  A worker who has been there, he's qualified, he has only worked for 10 years and now he's 55 years old.  There is a chart in the SG's brief, and as I read that chart, he got amount ""X"".  He started at 45, he ended up at 55, he gets ""X"".  If he started at 35 and worked for 20 years, he would get much more than ""X"".   Stephen G. Breyer  You would get 20 years rather than 10; is that right?  I'm not talking about a disabled person.  I'm talking about anybody.   Stephen G. Breyer  So if a person works for 20 years, he gets more than if he worked for 10 years; is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now he is disabled.  And when he's disabled, if he's disabled after working only 10 and he is 45 years old, they pretend he had worked the full 20?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now I understand it.  Now, this individual says, I was working there after the age of 55, I only worked for 14 years, now I become disabled.  If I become disabled before I was 55, let's say I had six years to go, they would give me six years extra.  But because I was disabled after I'm 55, I get nothing extra.  Nothing is imputed.  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't ask you for the reasons.  I want to know if I'm factually right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where am I factually wrong?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're giving me reasons.  I'll ask you in a second for the reasons.  I want to know if what I said is factually true?   Stephen G. Breyer  And not after?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now I'll say that I think is the discrimination of which he is complaining.  And now what he would like to know is what possible reason is there for that difference?  Now I'd like to hear what the reason is that justifies that difference.  You give him six extra years when he retired after 14 years and though he was only 49 years old, and you don't give him even one extra year when everything else was the same but he retired after he was 55.  Now, explain to me what the reason is for that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  He says now, what he says to that, I take it, is fine.  He is 49 years old.  He has six years to go to qualify for retirement, so let him retire.  If you let him retire, and you gave him 14 years of credit, you would be treating him just like you're treating me.  But in addition to letting him retire, you give him six extra years of credit, which at two and-a-half percent per year.  Good, I'm glad you do that.  Give me the six extra years at two and-a-half percent as well.  Treat us alike.  What's your response?   Stephen G. Breyer  But that's the point, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  There... that's what the complaint is, I think, that you say it's the second part that you just said.  What you do when the person is disabled and he is not yet 55... he hasn't qualified yet... is you both qualify him, and when you qualify him you give him credit for years he hasn't worked.  Now, the older person who is still working and is also disabled says: Fine, you let me retire, but you don't give me any extra years.  Now that's the complaint, I think.  So that if you had a person who had started at 45, eligible to retire at 55, works for 4 years and becomes disabled, he is credited with 14 years; while the person who started at 35 and at 45 becomes disabled, he is given 20 years.  He is given the 10 extra years.  So the first person, older person, says: You gave him some extra years; you didn't have to give him those extra years in order to qualify him to retire.  You could have just said you can retire, but you gave him 10 extra years and you give me no extra years.  Why not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You don't need anything to bring you to normal retirement.  You could rewrite the plan and say when a person becomes disabled you get retirement, right at that moment.  You could say that.  And what the plaintiff is saying is, why don't you say that?  Though it's a bit mean.  But I think what he would probably like is you would extend the extra years to him.   Stephen G. Breyer  See, that's why I think the result in this case is just terrible.  I think it takes disabled people and cuts their benefits with no benefit.  I cannot believe for two minutes that Congress would have intended that result.  But the reason I asked you the question was I want you to tell me how to get to that result under this statute.   ",06-1037
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Let me ask you this sort of basic question: Does it use age any differently than it uses years of service?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is wrong with using that as a benchmark?  If you can fire a person when he is 55, why can't you use it as a benchmark as to how much you're going to give a disability person on pension?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The lesser or greater... this would be an instance where greater includes lesser for the reason that this lesser business has no stereotypes.  All they're trying to do is to help people who are disabled at a time when they are younger and probably have fairly good expenses, and everybody gets this kind of insurance.  And this man who is the Plaintiff here had it, too, while he was there.  So it's true you are really using in a minimal sense age, but you are doing it in a statute that permits you to do it because it's a lesser version of that.   Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't say it's inapplicable.  I wasn't saying it's inapplicable.  What I am worried about... and this is a perfect example of people using absolutely mechanical rules, and particularly when you talk about pension systems, which, of course, age is relevant to a pension system, and what they do is find comparisons; and, before you know it, you are in the kind of a... of a hamburger situation where it's so chopped up that perfectly worthwhile things are forbidden.  And this would seem to be a number 1 exhibit.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, because what you are looking at is to see whether the purpose of Congress is somehow implicated, a purpose designed to prevent stereotypical thinking from being used to put older people at a disadvantage.  And there is no indication that this is so in this case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what's the response?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about this idea, which is... would this wreck the statute?  You say we're talking about age, which is not an immutable characteristic.  Everybody goes through it.  Everybody is younger, everybody is older.  And therefore we take the word ""discriminate"" and the word ""discriminate"" in this context, when considered in terms of pension requirements, which inevitably are age mixed to a considerable degree, means that if there are plausible justifications and no significant reason for thinking that it reflects stereotypical thinking, that it does not fall within the scope of the word ""discriminate"".   Stephen G. Breyer  I started out by saying, that's why I said that this is not an immutable characteristic, and it is... that's why I put all the qualifications in there.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Would it be the same as... I mean it seems to me now... I'm thinking the problem is we are going into the package; we are starting opening up the package that the 55-year-old retiree normally gets.  Suppose they said this: here's what we'll do to the disabled person.  We'll treat him just as if he retired at 55.  He is only 35; and, moreover, at 55 when you retire in our police force, we give you a big party and a gold watch.  Well, we don't do that if you retire later on.  Same kind of claim.  Why not?  Over 65 years old, he retired.  Hey, you didn't give him the gold watch.  Why did you give the other person the gold watch?  You said the reason is we treat them all like we treat them when you retire at 55.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's fair, that you don't understand.  [Laughter]   ",06-1037

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The particular illegal arrest here, to bring this down to earth a little bit, is I take it they arrested him because he had a suspended... he was driving without a good license?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So that Virginia law says if you stop somebody, arrest him... if you stop somebody, you know he doesn't have a license to drive, you can arrest him if you think he's going to continue driving?  Can't you?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So the policemen here, according to you and I guess the Virginia court, made a misjudgment.  He thought this guy might still drive somewhere or he might have thought it or a policeman in similar circumstances might have thought it.  So Virginia says if, in fact, policemen, you stop somebody for suspended... for driving without a license, and you make a mistake, you arrest him, we don't think that's a big deal, because who knows if he's going to continue to drive.  We don't even suspend.  We don't even suppress the evidence.  That's Virginia.  So if Virginia isn't going to suppress the evidence because they think it's not a big deal to make, for the policeman to make a mistake as to whether a person who's driving without a license will keep driving once the policeman goes away, why do you think Thomas Jefferson and everybody else thought that that was such a big deal that the evidence had to be suppressed?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is the difference between this and Whren?  That is, in Whren the arrest violated a D.C. regulation that says a plainclothes officer cannot approach a car except in immediate cases of immediate danger.  And in Whren we said that isn't such a big deal and we don't think the Fourth Amendment turns on that kind of triviality.  All right.  If it doesn't turn on that kind of arrest procedure triviality, is how we characterized it there, how is this any any different?   Stephen G. Breyer  Can we go back for a second?  Because, the reason I asked my question is I was thinking about this very differently, and I just want to have an answer, and I want your best thinking on this.  My thought is that the answer to the question of whether it violates the Fourth Amendment when a State... when a person is arrested in violation of State law, the answer is: it depends.  Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  Obviously, if there is no probable cause or if there wasn't a crime at all, as just defined, the answer is yes; but then I look at Whren and it says if all that was at stake was a kind of arrest procedure State law, herein... there embodied in a rule, the answer is no.  So I look at this one.  And this one it seems to me there is probable cause; it is a crime; moreover, it is a crime for which the State permits arrest where the officer subjectively thinks he's likely to keep driving.  So it seems to me that's maybe much more close to what we had in Whren.  Now I want you to say... I want your comments on what I... it's hypothetical, my statement, because I want to get your reaction to that point of view.  I'm not saying I hold it.  But I'm putting it forward so that I can get your reaction and argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Putting cases aside for the moment--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I mean if we reach this question, you must have lost on the first question.  I mean you win... if you win on the first question, you win.  If you... all right.  If you have lost on the first question, this is not an unreasonable search... arrest, rather, under the Fourth Amendment.  And, moreover, it's not enough of a big deal, so the State makes it suppressible.  Otherwise, a... and so now we're talking about minor things under State law that is secondary at the least.  And there, when the policeman make a mistake about that, the reason we let him search is he might be hurt, the policeman.  There's danger involved.  And so I don't see why at the moment that rationale wouldn't apply just as strongly with a reason for it being unlawful under State but not Federal law is a violation of one of these subsidiary rules whether he, you know, thought the guy was going to keep driving under the suspended license or, you know, might be risky or might not show up.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  How do you suggest we write the opinion? If you were writing it and then a dissent, say, or someone or we read in the briefs that here is an absolute holding of the Supreme Court right on point, totally clear, says just exactly what the government says here, and it was codified in 1948, and now we say the reason, despite that, you win is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if somebody says, well, the Court couldn't have been clearer as to what the statute meant, and Congress reenacted it in codifying it. So what do you want?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, what could be clearer? Are they supposed to actually -- in the recodification in 19 -- or is it that the recodification changed things or what?   Stephen G. Breyer  But even all those cases which you're going back to, what you're talking about, I think, in those cases is general statements in the case.  The cases themselves, except possibly for that Franconia, which has a different problem because it was about accrual, the cases themselves don't involve this statute. It's simply general statements. I thought, and I'd like your response, that in this Court's opinion as in statutes, as in life. When people make general statements, they don't mean every possible situation in the universe; rather, there are always circumstances to which the statement doesn't apply. And so why don't we just read those statements as incorporating a prior explicit holding of the Court as inapplicable to that prior explicit holding?

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  No, that isn't -- I don't think it's quite -- putting the argument as I understand it, you would say let's look at Irwin, and we read it, so it's in your mind. Now think of that set of statute of limitations, the Federal ones, the Government ones, that are either just as ambiguous as Irwin or even more ambiguous. Think of that set.  Now, in Irwin the Court says in the absence of special circumstances that whole set is going to be interpreted as nonjurisdictional. That's what it says.  So you say, well, what Irwin didn't talk about is suppose there's a member of that set where previously the Court had held it was jurisdictional. It doesn't tell us what to do. Shall we read it as an exception or shall we not? And so what they are saying is, don't read it as an exception. There's no need to do so. Congress probably never really thought about any of this stuff.  Read it, Irwin, as including that one, too.  So what do you think of that point, whether it's theirs or not, leaving aside the argument about whether this particular statute does or does not fall within that set? Assume it does.   Stephen G. Breyer  Absolutely right, and then the question is does the simple fact that we previously held to the contrary count as a rebuttal?

I have a question about the merits.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know, but I have a question I'd like you to go into.   Stephen G. Breyer  I looked up, my law clerk has, and found eight States that seem roughly comparable.  Those that go to assessed value, every single one of them... and most of them do... they have the word like ""assessment"".  The only comparable places we found are Puerto Rico, Philippines in 1916, and Guam here which don't use the word ""assessment"", but use the words ""aggregate taxable value"".  All right.  Now, what's happened in those places?  We know what's happening in Guam.  I can't... with the Philippines in 1916 and Puerto Rico, there ought to be some experience there even if we couldn't find a case how they treated it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Try Utah, try Iowa.  Try--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --My question is the following.  In Puerto Rico and in the Philippines after 1916, and in Alaska, were there any instances in which they issued bonds that exceeded the 10 percent of the assessed value as opposed to the aggregate market value?  They either did or didn't and that shouldn't be hard to find out.   Stephen G. Breyer  There are big lenders in the United States and those people don't fool around.  They get opinions.  And they lend money to Puerto Rico or they lend money to some of these places.  They're going to have opinion letters.  And those opinion letters are going to say whether they think in their opinion this is over reaching to many bonds or not.  And Of course, I would think those opinion letters would say for Puerto Rico, what the words aggregate tax valuation mean.  They might or might not.

So I thought, well, one thing is clear.  What they're trying to do here is they take out of the box, if you look at it, take all of the list of property that they don't tax.  I guess a school, maybe some tax exempt business or something.  Now their reason for doing that must be that those people who they've exempted entirely by statute are not going to be much help in paying Guam.  Well, if that's true, isn't precisely the same thing true of the two-thirds of the property that--  they don't take into account when they set their taxes?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  It doesn't secure it one bit if, in fact, the tax statute says you can't take it into account when you set your taxes.  Just as is true of, let's say, a tax free business of some kind.  Now Guam doesn't have to do that, it could change its statute, but so could it change its statute in respect to a school, a university, or whatever the other things are that are off those tax rolls.  You know that, you know, your answer was circular.  That assumes that the whole property is, but it isn't.   Stephen G. Breyer  Which one?  You say they've all used market values?   Stephen G.

Breyer  Well, if they don't provide for it, and they don't say you can't do it, why isn't it arbitrary not to let him do it?  I mean... what... if it's... if it's arbitrary--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --It sounds almost arbitrary to say to a person, look, if you think you have some new evidence and want to reopen, do it.  But Congress wanted you to get out of here in respect to this 60 days, so you have to give up that.  You're not getting those benefits.  Now, it's a tough bargain, but it seems reasonable.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What I don't see is to say once you ask for this you can never get status adjustment.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So why not apply them to this person?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what about this?  I'm just trying this out.  You don't have to respond if you don't want to.  But you say, look, the AG in his rules here, really tried to reconcile the two interests that we talked about in our prior conversation.  Now hypothetically, I suppose you say that was a reasonable way of going about this, and we remand for consideration about whether this prior situation that you couldn't do that was arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion, or your failure to apply it retroactively to a certain class of people was arbitrary, capricious, abusive discretion?

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I thought the issue in the Philippines is the question of whether the money that went into the stock certificates eventually belonged to the people of the Philippines from the beginning or belonged to Marcos personally?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And you're saying that there's no possibility whatsoever that a Philippine court could say that this money initially belonged to the people of the Philippines?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm saying whether they... I don't care what the name of the proceeding is.  I'm saying could they decide that?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, if they decide that, why should your clients, terribly treated as they were, get the money ahead of the victims in the Philippines, who also were terribly treated?   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought Justice Souter just answered that.  He said that the stock certificates might be held to belong to the people of the Philippines, in which case the stock certificates represent stock in a company that has a claim against Merrill Lynch, and so they will say, this certificate belongs to the people of the Philippines; the people of the Philippines would like you, Merrill Lynch, to pay back the money that the company gave them initially.  And Merrill Lynch I imagine would pay it.  Now that I think is as I understand it.  Is there something wrong with my understanding?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't see that finding in the court of appeals decision.  I thought the court of appeals thought that they belonged... they couldn't possibly belong to the Philippine Government or the people there, because there is no way that the Philippine Government could win in a suit in New York in trying to recover them.  But the Solicitor General has provided about two or three ways, in which and so... and so have the Petitioners... and that seems to me the heart of the issue.  They have said: No, no, there are two or three ways in which the Philippine Government might well... it might well ask a court for the money and the court would say, yes, you're entitled to it.  So that it seems to me, that's the heart of it.  What is your response to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, well, that isn't what they say.  I think, if I understand it, that they say that were the share certificates in the hands of the Philippine Government on the ground, that the money used to create those had been taken from the Philippine people unlawfully, if that's what they decide, at that point the owner of the certificates, the government, would say to Merrill Lynch: We own the company, the company has the assets; please send us the money.  And Merrill Lynch would do it.  But if Merrill Lynch didn't do it, then they would file the judgment saying, these are our share certificates, in the New York court and say, will you please enforce the judgment.  Now, there is something there that I'm not quite getting and that's why I want you to respond to the line of happenings that I just suggested.   Stephen G. Breyer  There is a huge change.  The change would be that they'd a judgment of that special court over there that this company and the assets understandably belong to us, not to the Marcoses.  And so this time, they go with that judgment to Merrill Lynch and say: Give us the money.  And if they... if they don't... if Merrill Lynch says no... Merrill Lynch might say yes, but you'll say, no, it belongs to us, so they might not.  And if they don't, then the Philippines are never going to get the money, unless they bring the lawsuit.  And once they bring the lawsuit, then you have them, because then you go right into the court in that lawsuit and intervene and they have waived all their sovereign immunity, et cetera, they can't get the money.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  With a difference.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you have... I mean I don't see you have a claim there as opposed to the... the worst that would happen, not necessarily good for your clients, but the worst that would happen would be that the assets would be devoted to victims and their families in the Philippines.  I mean, namely to the Philippine people.  So I don't see some kind of fundamental unfairness here, unless you can point one out.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean they'll treat you like another creditor and you have... but is there some terrible unfairness going on?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there... is there something special going on, specially unfair, in respect to the delays where you are treated differently than other litigants in the Philippines?   ",06-1204
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  If that's the way to do it, you didn't do it that way, did you?  I mean, as I read it... they put in here, on 163a, the motion that you made to the district court said that you have to be ""similarly situated""...  ""Plaintiff has to have been ""similarly situated"" with other employees. ""  --and you put that in quotes... ""similarly situated"".  And then you say  ""employees may be ""similarly situated"" only if they have the same supervisor. ""  Period.  Not... it wasn't a period actually, but the rest of the sentence isn't important.  And then you cite Aramburu, which is where the Tenth Circuit said that.  So I don't see how you can say this wasn't a 401 case.  You were saying that weren't similarly situated, period.  And then the district judge virtually quoted those words.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that may be, but the... I don't see... I mean, that may be, but this is the argument you made, and this was the argument the district judge adopted.  Is that not so or is it so?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's why I don't understand your answer.  I'm confused here.  What I said, and you seemed to agree, is different from what was just said, which you also seemed to agree.  [Laughter]  I thought that you said in your brief that you have to have been... quote... ""similarly situated"".  All right?  ""Employees must be similarly situated to Plaintiff. ""  That's true, isn't it?  I'm quoting the brief, from page 163.  And then you say,  ""Employees may be similarly situated only if they have the same supervisor. ""  Then the district court says that plaintiff may offer evidence who are ""similarly situated"" to her and then... quote... ""similarly situated employees""... quote...  ""for the purpose of this ruling requires proof that Paul Reddick, his supervisor, was the decisionmaker. ""  That's why I thought it was fairly clear, since he used the same words and substituted the word ""Paul Reddick"" for the same supervisor, that he was taking that right from your brief where you made that general argument and said nothing about the particular case in those sentences.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How could ut have been?  What about the date problem he just mentioned?  You said... your opponent said that when you filed this motion in limine on December 15, 2004, by that time, there hadn't been any fact-specific things at all brought up in the trial that were relevant to this, and there's certainly none in the notion that I could see.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But where does it say?  I can't find in the motion, although there is something on disparate impact, anything that says well, you see, I don't know about the general mine run of cases, but in this particular case, it's not sufficiently material, it is a waste... it's not... it is a waste of time.  Now, I just can't find that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Did anyone argue that before December 15, 2004, that we don't know about the mine run of cases, but this case, in fact it's a waste of time?  Did anyone argue that before December 15, 2004?

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So what should we do then?  Sorry.  Go ahead and conclude.  But I want to ask this after you finish answering Justice Souter.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And finish your answer to Justice Souter.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's exactly what's sort of bothering me.  You are the trial lawyer.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I'm not.  And what's worrying me most about this is I will say something that will muck up quite a lot of trials.  So, therefore, the sentence that jumps out the page here was where the court of appeals says that Rule 403's exclusion is an extraordinary remedy that should be sparingly... used sparingly.  Is that a general rule?  Because my impression was... and this is why I asked you as a trial lawyer... is that if you take 401 and 402 and read them literally, we'll have trials that last a thousand years.  And, really, the way a trial judge keeps the trial under control is to say: Well, maybe there is some slight tendency here to make a fact more likely than not; but, even if that's so, this is a waste of time.  And I thought that kind of decision is what trial judges are there to make.   Stephen G. Breyer  And, therefore, I thought this court of appeals is trying to second-guess that trial court judge unless that trial court judge is making an absolute rule, which he may have been.  But as soon as we get into this case, I thought we might do quite a lot of harm by trying to let the court of appeals second-guess trial courts on this kind of thing.  Now, I would appreciate your response to that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then, how are we going to... I'm not arguing about what it says so much as I'm arguing about who has the right between the court of appeals and the trial court to decide?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And all I'm worried about... and you tell me if that's the law in the Tenth Circuit or elsewhere.  I was an appeals court judge for a quite a while.  And I think we have never... not ""never"", but hardly ever second-guessed a trial judge on that kind of question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you tell me if the rules are different in the Tenth Circuit?  Do they out there second-guess trial judges on this kind of question all the time?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If they don't normally, why should they here?  If this kind of rule is... as you say, this kind of evidence is like any other evidence, any other evidence at all.  It may be relevant, or it may not be.  It depends on the case.  A waste of time or not depends on the case.   Stephen G. Breyer  I got your blanket part.  I got that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, no, not... I'm saying... well, you got my point, but you're just not answering my question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I don't want to repeat it.  And I'm not talking about whether it is hearsay or not.  I'm not talking... I'm talking about whether it comes in 401, 402, 403.  That's the issue.   ",06-1221
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I've read the legislative history, which shows to me, anyway, precisely no light whatsoever.  It's... the only relevant sentence, which is the third sentence, simply repeats the statute.  And, therefore, I thought that what Congress is trying to do is say, treat trusts like individuals, except in respect to special expenses.  What are special expenses?  Those that are related to the trust and that an individual wouldn't have occurred... incurred.  I can't say it much clearly than that.  But I have an absolutely clear idea what it means.  To me it means that if this is an expense that the trust is saying is special, I would say, would a reasonable person who did not hold these assets in trust, would such a person be likely to make that kind of expenditure?  And if the answer to that question is yes, well, then I would say it's not a special expense.  And if the answer is no, I would say it was.  And then the IRS and you will come and say that isn't precise enough.  And I'd say the IRS has plenty of authority in its regs to give lists of examples which they do in such instances.  Now, I'm posing that, not because I bought into it, though I'm tempted to, but I'd like to know what your response is.   Stephen G. Breyer  There's nothing that I could find anywhere that talked about pass-throughs in respect to the special situation of trusts and estates.  In the first sentence it speaks to it in respect to individuals.  It all makes sense.  And what they seem to be saying is just what I said initially.  We do agree trusts do have a special claim, but only in respect to special trust expenses.  And which are they?  They're the ones an individual wouldn't have incurred.  And I'll put a gloss on it, like we do in law.  I say a reasonable individual.  I say wouldn't reasonably have incurred.  And then I leave it up to the IRS to say which are the expenses that an individual would likely incur and which ones he wouldn't likely incur.  Now, that runs throughout tax law, doesn't it, that kind of list, what's a necessary expenditure, what isn't.  I mean, they do that all the time, don't they?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not buying into they're thing with ""could"".  I mean, that isn't my problem.   ",06-1286
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  A glass--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Before... I mean, we have lots of good examples.  I mean, I could have colored my room at home, painted it with light green plastic, but I wouldn't have done it.  I mean, endless examples.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what would... that's why I made the suggestion I had earlier.  I was doubtful about the wisdom of trying to turn this matter into a purely factual one.  And so suppose you said, which would come to about the same thing, that expenditure would be incurred in this instance by someone who didn't hold these assets in trust.  What that means is would a... an investor not in the trust, not holding it in trust, reasonably have been, or a reasonable investor have been likely to make this expenditure?  That turns it into a more quasi-legal question where people... and then it's a matter of judgment, which these things do come down to.  That's what judges are there for, to judge.  And thereby we avoid the burden-of-proof problem.  It comes to about the same thing.  Is there any objection to it?  What's the reason not to do it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But are you--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --You would be, of course, exactly right, that there could be trusts, very big trusts.  Children get into fights trying to split up the assets.  Millions is paid on lawyers and investment advisors to see if each share, figured 14 different ways, is going to earn this money or that money.  And that kind of thing exists.  And there the investment advisors are likely to be special.  So you can't say investment advice is always special or never special.  Now, again, this seems to me not unknown, this kind of problem, to the Internal Revenue law, and therefore there tend to be methods of allowing exceptions, of putting burdens.  I mean, is this case somehow... am I wrong about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm looking really for a form of words to write that does not use the word ""could"" but which gets at what I think the statute was after, which is: Let them have this no floor for their special stuff but not for ordinary stuff that others would have incurred regardless.  I want to know what form of words.  I find it difficult to go beyond the statute, frankly.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's right.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If I reject this word ""could"" and ""uniqueness"", now what form of word should I write?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If had you to choose between that and getting the idea of the reasonable taxpayer who didn't hold this in trust, which would you choose?   INTERRUPTING ",06-1286
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The answer is that it doesn't exclude them, that they have all these collective bargaining rights; they have the civil service rights; they can go and bring their same claim with other remedies.  You could make the opposite claim: Why should they have two rights?  Everybody else has one.  I mean, that seems to me what they're argument is underlying this.  Then when you go to Title VII... and this I don't understand fully.  Look at Title VII and Title VII in 16(e) has a basic ban.  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  And then, in 16(d) it says certain of those things govern Federal suits, suits against the Federal Government.  Then it incorporates some provisions.  And it says that you get that certain relief against the Federal Government where there is discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  Then it says 3(a)> [""].  And then 3(a) refers to retaliation.  So it looks like Title VII does give you a remedy, in 3(a), for retaliation.  And it's rather specific, and that suggests that those other words don't pick up retaliation.  It's rather that specific thing.  Now, what have I missed?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you could say that, but you could also say, well, look here in Title VII Congress has some words, and these words give you a specific... if you're a Federal employee and somebody's retaliating against you because you went and complained about race or something, just read those words; you can bring a lawsuit, right?  Am I right about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You go to the EEOC?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I'm not totally certain what I'm talking about either.  So we could go on.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Or in violation of--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, could you proceed with that?  That is, a very simple way of thinking of this as one possible way of reading it is that Congress says: When private employers discriminate, there can be whistleblower's, and they need protection; so let's put some in.  When State officials discriminate, say, on the basis of race, there can be some whistleblower's.  Maybe they protect them in some States; maybe they don't protect them in others.  We better put some in.  When Federal Government officials discriminate against on the basis of race, whistleblower's should be protected.  But we have a whole system here to protect them.  And so let's just use that system and treat all whistleblower's alike, and that's the end of the matter.  We don't need any special protection for whistleblower's here.  Now, the answer to that is what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Who... who is such a person?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why can't they... why can't they go to like the Merit System Protection Board?   Stephen G. Breyer  So they are outside the Civil Service, and they don't have unions?   Stephen G. Breyer  They don't have a union?   Stephen G. Breyer  So they could be fired for anything.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1321
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Am I right now in thinking, just as a matter of practice, where there is retaliation, a claim of retaliation in respect to race discrimination, Federal Government, that the person making that claim can go to the EEOC and then to court?  That's right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The same thing in respect to age, they can't, and what they have to do is they go through the civil service system or the collective bargaining agreement; is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, not what they do if their claim is a retaliation claim.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  And now, do you have... two things: A, do you have any evidence one way or the other that one of these two systems... the civil service plus collective bargaining, on the other hand; or EEOC plus the court, on the other... works better, works the same, works worse?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  So we don't know.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Now what reason... okay.  So we don't know.   Stephen G. Breyer  But that's drawing something from where you don't know.  Okay.  So that's fair enough.  But is there any... what is the best reason, in your opinion, that Congress would have wanted to make this distinction?  What are the best two or three reasons?  If you were just starting with a blank slate, why would Congress have wanted to send the one to the one route and the other to the other route.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  For the people who complained about race.   Stephen G.

You just the same words, but instead of using the words as against the word ""charge"", you use those same words you've all said in your excellent arguments, except you attack the fact you didn't get the notice, and there you're really hurt.  Or if you're not, it doesn't matter.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, all right.  So what's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING ",06-1322
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose they made a mistake here.   Stephen G. Breyer  What I think Miss Lensing, one of her more basic points is this: There is a statute.  And the statute says the EEOC shall send prompt notice in part to the conciliation.  And she adds, if we get the notice, we also start getting evidence and preserving it and talking to people.  There are a lot of things they would like to do with that notice.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I replied to that, well, okay, they complain about the lack of notice.  But her response is, sure, they sometimes don't give notice when they file a charge.  That's just a mistake.  But if you start calling these documents charges, well, they never give notice, so they will never do it.  It will be a big problem, so, therefore, don't call them charges.  Now, I want to know what your answer is to the first part of what I said.  My... I was assuming that if the employer is really hurt, there is a statute and a rule and the statute and the rules say you have to give notice and if they are hurt by that, they can complain about it.   Stephen G. Breyer  But they must make mistakes in their history when they file charges and didn't give notice.  So what does the law tell us?  If you found it any case ever where the EEOC didn't give the notice, now the complainant files a lawsuit and it's not the complainant's fault, her response is work out some kind of equitable tolling.  But there must be law on this, because this couldn't... this is a big agency and they must have sometimes in the past forgotten to give notice.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What does the law say happens when they don't give notice?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it wouldn't be a defense.  I mean, it's not this complainant's fault.  It's the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --You'd have to work out some kind of equitable tolling or something.  I think she's right about that.  There is no law to your knowledge or what is there?   Stephen G. Breyer  And the practical problem: I want to know where do I read what the definition of a EEOC rules.  The three criteria that it has certain information in it can't be the rule.  It can't be the rule because we already know that it isn't a charge if the person says I don't want it to become public.  So, where do I read the rule that you just said?  That it... an intake questionnaire that satisfies these three conditions becomes a charge if it reflects the manifest intent of the person who files it that it be a charge.  You said that.  That's a pretty modestly clear rule, except it isn't totally.  And they qualify... where do I read that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We use the word there ""manifest intent""?   Stephen G. Breyer  Ah.  Well, I read those regs, and those regs had a definition that can't possibly be right as applied to ""intake questionnaire"", because they make it a charge when the person says I don't want notice.  So we know that isn't the thing.  I also know what you just said does sound like a rule.  I just want to know where to read it, because I don't think you'd refer to a rule of an agency, though normally we do... but you don't refer to a rule that doesn't exist; you don't refer to a rule that nowhere can be found; you don't refer to a rule that is internally inconsistent.  So, before I defer, I would just like to know where the clear rule that you stated can be found.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I just want to read it somewhere.   Stephen G. Breyer  So that if I were not here having you in front of me, as many people don't have you in front of them, where I would go to read just what you said.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you said there were going to be four places.  I want to write them down.   Stephen G. Breyer  One is 48 Fed. Reg. 148?   Stephen G. Breyer  138.  Now, the other three.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's on the notice point.  Going back to the other, more important point, your words that I found quite useful are the ""manifest intent"", that shows a manifest... are those words going to be in these four sources that I look up?

I mean, it's easy to imagine that kind of thing.   Stephen G. Breyer  And in a range of subject matters.  So I'm looking to what the stopping place is once I start down your road.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I still have my question because I'm not world about malevolence, is that I don't carry around in my head all of the possible things that might be liens against property.  And so maybe my imagination is wrong, but I want to know are you are arguing that every lien against the property is in fact a right in property which allows a lawsuit, or are you arguing that there is some distinction between some and the other.  And I noticed that the Restatements and others are trying to distinguish between whether the lien in question grows out of the property or it doesn't grow out of the property, which I find possibly hard to work with and so I want to know how you see it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can I... can I can ask you to go back for a second to where I'm getting myself into a muddle here.  I'm still now being very, very literal.  I think you're very literal and you say it says, a case in which is involved rights to property.  And you say, but this is a right to property in this case; if I win this case then I have a right to sell that house.  Therefore, I have a right in property.  Now, if that's the reasoning why doesn't that apply to every case where a State might say if you win this case you can sell his house?  I mean, I can easily imagine a tort case, a contract case where a State would say, you win, you can sell their house to collect the judgment.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So I'm still back in a different route at where I'm having the problem, which is a problem of distinguishing in principle between either your absolute principle, ""do it"", his absolute principle, ""don't do it"", or something in the middle.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The hypothetical was doing away with the prejudgment lien.  I would say the exact same words apply with just as much force if there is no prejudgment lien because a suit without a lien the State were to say, you win this tort claim, you can go sell this property to collect the judgment, is a suit in which there is at issue your right to sell his property, just as there is here.   Stephen G. Breyer  Do you?   ",06-134X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Am I thinking about that part correctly?  I... I found this difficult.  I go back to the railroad; that seems the easiest case.  You have a railroad in 50 States, and Illinois finds it very hard to evaluate its... evaluate its value, its railroad property in Illinois, because the value of that depends on service everywhere.  So the court says that's the unitary principle; and really what you're supposed to look at is whether when you look at the supposedly separate part of the business, does that separate part of the business contribute to the whole thing?  So that if you were in fact trying to say what is Illinois doing without considering that separate part, it would be tough to do.  I mean, that's the underlying theme.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if that's so, there is no second test.  I mean, I grant you there is language, but really what people have done is they've said, we are here in a special situation because we have an interest in another company, and that's a special part of our business, and has nothing to do with the rest of the business.  And then the argument is no, it does have something to do with the rest of the business.  And if it does, like it provides you with working capital, it's just like the railroad track in California vis a vis Illinois.   Stephen G. Breyer  And if it doesn't, it doesn't.  So now, if that's right, then it's the form of analysis rather than the result that's wrong in the court below.  Because they start talking about two separate tests and then people argue whether the second should swallow up the first, and at that point I get totally lost.  It's fairly long, but I'd appreciate your evaluating what I've just said.   ",06-1413
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's not the question.  I thought that the... I agree with the same question Justice Kennedy had.  Suppose that I'm a Massachusetts company that sells tables, and I sell some tables in Illinois.  And one day I take some of the money, and I buy an iron mine in New Mexico.  And then I sell the iron mine.  And Illinois, not Massachusetts, wants to impose a tax.  And suppose there is no connection whatsoever between the iron mine and anything else but for four, which are the four listed on page 13a: One, that I have contributed capital support to the iron mine.  Two, I approve the major capital expenditures of the iron mine, sitting in my office in Massachusetts.  Three, sometimes... and this is a tougher one... I call the iron mine a division of my table company.  And, four, I sometimes retain tax benefits and control over the extra cash of the iron mine, but I'm not using it in my day to day work.  Now, are those four things alone sufficient for Illinois to tax the sale of my iron mine?  That, it seems to me, is the way they presented it.  Maybe it is a unitary business really, but I guess we have to send it back for that.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Then why isn't that the end of this case?  That's what they said it was.  That's what they said, perhaps wrongly, that this isn't a unitary business.  And, therefore, we are left with those four facts, and why not send it back and say you haven't reached the unitary business question; go reach it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What?  What could it be?  That is... as I read this, I thought, well, there is no separate test.  It's just there's a certain situation that comes up fairly commonly where someone claims that an asset of a company was really quite separate, and therefore when they get income from it or they sell it it has nothing to do with my business.  And the answer is: It did have something to do with your business, you used the working capital and so forth, in which case it's part of the business.  So how... how is it... how is it different from that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if you agree with that, do you really agree, because if you agree with that there's no such separate test, this court was wrong to consider it separately, the lower court, and they should have reached the question they didn't reach, which was is this whole thing one single business, which is normally called the unitary business test?   Stephen G. Breyer  Good.  All right.   ",06-1413
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What happens in just a basic employment case?  I'm trying to remember from law school.  Somebody's contract with another man, he's the employee, and he says... the employer says: I'm firing you because you won't help me rob the bank.  Or the employee goes and he finds some money in a wallet or something on the street, and he says, I'm going to return it to the rightful owner, and the employer says, I hate rightful owners, so I'm firing you.  Now, when the employee goes to court, I take it... my vague recollection is the employer can't do that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The State law, is there some kind of policy against that from the State law, he couldn't do it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, here we have a Federal statute that says that a black person shall have the same right to make a contract as a white person.  But if nobody ever can report on that, that they're not, it's not going to be the same right; it's going to be zero right.  So, why by parity of reasoning wouldn't this provide for the same kind of thing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, no.  It would make no difference whether you're a thief in my example, whether you're good hearted.  It doesn't matter who you are.  You could even be somebody from another country.  You don't have to be American.  You could be anything.  But the State law tries to follow out that... that policy of not having bank robberies and of returning money to rightful owners.  Well, here we have a Federal policy, and the Federal policy is that black people shall be treated the same as white in respect to making a contract.  But were the law to allow you to fire anybody who complained about it, then black people wouldn't have that right.  And therefore the policy is that you can't do it under this statute because otherwise the written policy is ineffective.  I'm just remembering that from my written... from my policy arguments that were in contract law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Does it say anywhere, by the way, in that statute that a black person who is discriminated against can go to court and file a lawsuit?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Does it say that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Does it say is in that statute, 1981?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, correct.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  And have we developed a policy here in creating a right of action under this 1981?   Stephen G. Breyer  Which is the statute that does... is there a statute that specifically gives you a right to sue under 1981?  Is there a statute?   Stephen G. Breyer  It has established it.  Yes, that's my point: That the Federal court implied from the statute a right of action.  Now, if they're implying a right of action from the statute, why wouldn't courts also imply those rights of action necessary to make the statute effective?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That isn't the word I was looking for.  The word I was looking for in 1981(a) is the word  ""and can bring a lawsuit in Federal court. ""  I don't see that written there.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, correct.  So we've implied that.  And therefore, if I can imply that, why can't we imply a lawsuit on behalf of those who need the lawsuit to make the right effective?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That was my basic question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?  Because the legislative history does say, when they passed this, that the new law will involve a claim, allow them to make a claim of harassment, discharge, promotion, transfer, retaliation, and hiring.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So when they write that in the House report, isn't that some evidence that they did look back and see Sullivan, and they did think that in 1982 there's a retaliation action, and therefore in 1981 there is one?  Isn't there at least evidence that there were people in Congress thinking that?   Stephen G. Breyer  And that someone--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, I think we're familiar with that debate.  But if we can look... look at the statute, if I ask you why isn't this an enjoyment of a benefit, a privilege or term or a condition of the contract, is your answer that this was an at will contract?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, because I don't think that's is a good argument.  Why isn't this a benefit or a privilege that's been denied?   ",06-1431
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But is the rationale of those cases... and it's important to get the right rationale.  If I say this and I'm wrong tell me I'm wrong.  And I thought that the heart of it is not that the retaliated... the act of retaliation is discrimination.  It isn't.  What they say is when the white man helps the black man from being discriminated against, it falls within the statute, not because you've discriminated against the black man, but because if it didn't fall within the statute it would seriously erode or destroy the black man's right.  That's what it seemed to me Douglas said in Sullivan.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so then we're looking very hard in a place for a word that couldn't be there.   ",06-1431
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe I should ask you this now because you've probably thought about it and I can't work it out.  I don't see any problem with the word ""location"".  I thought what you would say is it isn't the transportation in this instance that concealed the location, it's the method of transportation that sealed the location.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if you read it that literally, then there is no problem in getting to your interpretation of the statute, or is there?  Because since you didn't advance that argument, I thought maybe there's something I've not seen here.   Stephen G. Breyer  I still don't see why isn't what the Chief Justice said absolutely right?  If you are transporting this money to get it out of town so the police can't find it, you're transporting it to conceal it.  That falls right within the statute.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you're transporting it simply to pay some courier somewhere else, you're not transporting it to conceal it.  And if in fact the transportation is done in a way that conceals it, that's beside the point because the statute is interested in transporting it in order to conceal it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is wrong with that?   ",06-1456
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You go back to Justice Alito's question.  I agree with you that you could read this as including a prohibition against a method of transportation which method is to hide the money.  You could.  But you could also read it the way that the question suggests, to refer only to the transportation.  So you transport it physically in order later to hide it.  Now, the difference between the two is if we accept yours, which is the broader, this statute includes everything that has nothing to do with the common word ""money laundering"".  Any time you hide something, for whatever reason you hide it, to take it to pay the couriers, you're money laundering.  Any time you run a gambling operation and the people stick the money in the wad of their shoe, they're money laundering.  I mean, why would you think Congress would want that narrow reading when it can be read to focus much more closely on money laundering just by reading it literally for what it says?   Stephen G. Breyer  He purposely puts it in his shoe, okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's a design.  He knows he's going to do it.  So... and you're saying, I take it, 100 percent of the time that's illegal.  If you're not saying that, I don't understand what you're saying.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you are saying that, I don't know why they call this statute ""Laundering of Monetary Instruments"".  Why didn't they call it ""shoe hiding""?  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  How does that show what you want it to show?  I mean, what I just heard you say is that Senator Biden said if we make it very tough to launder money in the United States, then criminals will send their money abroad to be laundered.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They'll transport it abroad in order to launder it.  How does that help you?   Stephen G. Breyer  In order to launder it.  Were they not talking about money laundering?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or were they not talking about it?  I'm just going back... I didn't read Senator Biden's statement, so I'm just curious.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1456
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is it... I should know this, but I don't.  Imagine that Jones and Smith, civil engineers, builders, enter into a contract.  They have an arbitration provision suspiciously like this one.  It says we promise to arbitrate everything, any dispute, including a dispute about whether this agreement is legal or not itself.  They have that.  They go to the arbitrator.  Jones says: You know, Mr. Arbitrator, you don't know that much about civil engineering, but there's a judge here who does.  So I think what I'm going to do tomorrow is file a lawsuit in the superior court in California making the same claims I'm making here and maybe that judge will decide it first and then you'll be really helped.  Now what stops him from doing that in the law?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The Federal... the Federal Arbitration Act says what that makes it clear he can't do that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, I grant you if he can do it you might as well tear up the Federal Arbitration Act and throw it out the window.  But I just want to know what is it in the law specifically that stops him from doing that.   Stephen G. Breyer  So even though it's not--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, but that... that's what I'm driving at, and I think that's interesting, that there's an implicit... because it doesn't say it explicitly... there's an implicit promise not to undermine this contract by running off to court.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And so you can't... no case comes to your mind where anybody has tried that little end run?  And--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I agree, I don't see how they could, but I just want to get to the bottom of it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  Regardless of the... I now understand better than I did what I take as a pretty strong argument.  I'm not saying convincing, but strong.  And that would be this: If you go look at Volt, and in Volt the Court said that the California Code meant that the individual who'd entered into the arbitration contract could go and can ask a superior court to stay an arbitration while some unrelated... some unrelated... I mean directly related but not the same parties... litigation took place.  The Court didn't in Volt say that that question of interpreting this contract is for the arbitrator.  I don't know why it didn't.  But it didn't.  Now here he's making a parallel argument.  He's saying that the California Code says that people should first go to that Labor Commissioner and that you can stay arbitration while that goes on.  Now... and I say well, why don't you go to the arbitrator?  He says I don't want to go to the arbitrator on that one, but he points to Volt.  And so the puzzle is this: if the Court in Volt didn't say this is a matter for the arbitrator, whether the contract really means that you promise not to go into court and make a motion to stay, why here is it a matter for the arbitrator whether you implicitly promised not to go into court and asked him to stay pending the outcome of this administrative proceeding?  What do you think about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I... I accept that.  I see a lot of common sense on your side of it.  But imagine I'm writing an opinion in your favor and now I come to the following paragraph which I have to write:  ""Your opponent says that Volt controls here; but that is wrong because. ""  --and now fill in the blank for me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I'm just saying I have to write.  I see all the common sense of your position.  I... absolutely.  But to get... you only need one really good argument.  And he's saying whatever the other ones are, here Breyer or somebody is going to have to write the words, and Volt is different because... so I would like some help on that one.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1463
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the question is obvious.  The question just follows from what I said.  You were there nodding your head when everybody seems seemed to agree that the Jones versus Smith, they can't go run off to court.  So you're just about to address this, and I hope you'll include the answer to the question, which is if they can't run off to the Federal... to the State court judge, the superior court judge, to get his opinion on the matter, why can they run off to this man, namely the talent agency expert--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --who happens to be an administrative agency?  Why does it matter?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It sounds as if you made the argument... well, you say we cited a case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  The answer to Justice Souter's question is no, we didn't raise it below.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Could California law do this?  I mean could they say, you know, we have a problem.  By the way, this is just a hypothetical.  We think that our judges in the Superior Court don't know very much about building disputes.  Now, I say it is a hypothetical because, in fact, Superior Court judges in California are excellent judges.  But California thinks, no, they don't know enough about it.  So here's what we do.  We say when Jones and Smith enter into an arbitration agreement, if it happens to concern a building dispute, they have to go to Federal... they can go to the Superior Court.  In fact, if they want to, if one of them wants to, the other one doesn't.  And everything is delayed while the Superior Court judge decides all the issues in the case.  And then after they can go back to arbitration, if of course they still want to.  Could California do that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I've read the agreement, and I don't quite find their... here--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --In my mind is what they do is they have the same standard arbitration clause.  So I'm asking not about the parties; I'm asking about California.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  The answer is no.  I thought so.  And so now you explain to me how this is any different than what I just said, other than substituting the words ""Labor Commissioner"" for ""California Superior Court"" and substituting the words ""talent dispute"" for the words ""building dispute"".   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I guess that would be a question for the arbitrator.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right, this is... this is... actually now we are getting to the bottom of something here, I think.  Now, I am beginning to understand where you are coming from; and Volt does offer you considerable support, as I... as I agreed.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, Volt, however, is a case, I take it, in which the stay that was entered was a stay staying the arbitration pending the resolution of a judicial dispute that was not subject to arbitrability.   Stephen G. Breyer  Therefore, it seems to me that the question here concerns the meaning of this contract, and that's where we started.   Stephen G. Breyer  Does this contract mean that the parties who entered have promised, one, not themselves to go to court?  Answer: Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Two, not themselves to bring a proceeding before this administrative agency?  And that's where he says yes, and you say no.   Stephen G. Breyer  And then is the proper resolution of that to say: Well, you can raise that, too, before the arbitrator?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   ",06-1463
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But those are different.  Those are whether that's a corporate purpose.  I think the question here is, as I started, I thought that this expert was going to testify that there were no earnings and profits in the relevant year.  Having read it more closely, it seems to me that that is not what the expert is going to testify.  Rather, he's going to say if there were no earnings and profits, then it is a return of capital if the basis is high enough.  He's going to testify to that legal proposition.  So, my question is, is there any proffer of evidence here where the taxpayer says I want a chance to show there were no earnings or profits?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where is it?   Stephen G. Breyer  So what did happen there?  I've been looking at page 62 through 66.  They are dancing around the issue.  It's fair to say that they wouldn't be having these four pages unless they are thinking of return of capital as a defense, but they don't actually say it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They would have raised it.   ",06-1509
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it depends on what you mean by that.  The Ninth Circuit said, quote, about what he has to show, that he has to show not merely that the funds could have been a return of capital, but that the funds were, in fact, the return of capital ""at the time of transfer"".  Then, they go on to say, since there was no evidence that they were considered, intended or recorded on the corporate records as a return of capital at the time they were made, then it isn't a return of capital.  Now, I thought everybody thinks that's wrong, because you might have an absolute distribution that absolutely counts as a distribution to every shareholder in the corporation.  And at the time they all think the company's going to make a billion dollars, but it just turns out that they have a loss of a billion dollars, in which case at the end of the tax year that would count as a return of capital if the basis were high enough, and it would not count as a dividend.  Am I wrong?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right, fine.  So if we do not know, that's the end of the Ninth Circuit test, isn't it?  Because the Ninth Circuit test says: What we want to do is to look at the books at the time of the distribution and see if it is entered on those books as a return of capital.  That's how I read it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  It was not.  What they thought at the time they distributed it was fabulous dividends because we are going to be rich.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  My example was they just made a little mistake.  Instead, the corporation is close to bankrupt, so there are no earnings or profits.  Is it then a return of capital or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  The basis?  He has more than enough basis.  He has a $14 trillion basis, okay?  So there is no problem about that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And so it is a return of capital.  So, therefore, the test is wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can I try a third example?  Because I think an example might help.  Let us imagine that the company distributes $10,000 on June 1 to every shareholder.  Let us imagine that every shareholder has a basis of a trillion dollars in his stock.  There is no problem about basis.  There is no problem about the nature of the distribution.  Let us imagine they put in the corporate records on June 1: This is a very valuable corporation; we are going to make a fortune; and this is a dividend.  They write it down.  Now, unfortunately, four weeks later the bottom falls out of the market, and it is not a dividend for the reason that they have no profits that year.  Now, is it not under ordinary tax law a return of capital?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If that... once you say yes, then the Ninth Circuit must be wrong because the Ninth Circuit said we do not look to see what happens.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  A month later, we look just to see how it's characterized by the corporation at the moment of the transfer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's what they said.   Stephen G. Breyer  But we don't... we are not certain on that one, I think, because of the cases he said before would this be a possible holding.  If it was a distribution in respect to the stock, and if he had sufficient basis, then if there were no earnings and profits in the corporation during the year, it would be treated as a tax deficiency... no tax deficiency or it would be a return of capital.  Insofar as as the Ninth Circuit says something to the contrary, it is wrong.  Now, if we remand to decide whether the... whether he intended to prove and produced enough to show they didn't have the earnings and profits and also to consider the question of whether this was a distribution in respect to stock.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Does the Government have any objection to what I just said?   INTERRUPTING ",06-1509
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't understand.  I'm back... I really... I'm surprised.  And it's probably my fault.  But that I thought... I started where Justice Scalia was with his first question.  I thought this had something to do with whether Congress passed a statute or the President acted on his own.  But listening to you now I think, I can't decide... I think you have a different argument.  Suppose... I'm just trying to understand.  Suppose that Congress passes a law and it says it's a very nice thing to commemorate the Pilgrims by building a Government church at Plymouth Rock, where we will have the regular worship in the Puritan religion.  Now can a taxpayer from California in your view challenge that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Why not?  Because I thought Flast made clear that they could.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then you go to a private group?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you're saying that if the Government has the most amazing, let's... I'm trying to think of something more amazing that what I just thought of.  [Laughter]  All over America, they build churches dedicated to one religion; and Congress passes a statute and says in every city, town, and hamlet, we are going to have a minister, a Government minister, a Government church, and dedicated to the proposition that this particular sect is the true sect; and they pass a statute like that, nobody could challenge it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that what you're saying, then?   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know, I mean--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --everybody else who doesn't want to go just avoids it.  So that they don't have to do anything.  They just have to--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Who?  Who?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe they don't walk into it because it is not ""our church"".  So they don't walk into it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And moreover, they don't... they don't feel it's discriminatory.  It's just we're doing this to commemorate the Pilgrims, and we'll give the money to any group that's a Pilgrim.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what's wrong with just saying that Flast stands for the proposition that when the Government spends money in violation of the establishment clause, a taxpayer... after all, the money comes from the taxpayer... can bring a lawsuit?  And the reason that they do that is because the establishment clause is an important joint part of the religion clauses; and there'd be no other way to bring such a challenge.  And sometimes it's that simple principle, and when we depart from that principle, say by giving property away instead of giving money away, you don't have the standing.  So we have a pretty clear, simple rule.  That rule applies whether it's Congress or the President acting under congressional authority, et cetera, which I think is close to what the other side--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Because there is a real case or controversy, because people become terribly upset when they see some other religion getting the money from the State for the... for building a church, for example, and that's why: There's a real controversy.   Stephen G. Breyer  It is the kind of upset that is a genuine injury if you look to the objectives of the establishment clause and possibly that kind of genuine injury is not the case when you look to objectives of various other clauses of the Constitution.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I was saying.  I said that Flast then encapsulates that principle drawn out of the objectives of the establishment clause in a rule; and the rule is what I suggested.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So in fact, you have... just help me with one point here.  I mean, I see that deciding what's incidental and what isn't incidental will be difficult.  I guess many of these cases would end up being decided on the merits, there is no violation on the merits, or maybe sometimes there is.  But I'd started thinking of the question of standing by thinking that there are strong feelings when the Government spends money in favor of one religion and not another.  After all, they led to the 30 Years War.  We see that in other places in the world today.  People feel strongly.  And if, in fact, they have that terribly strong feeling and can't make any challenge because the feelings are shared by many, then there are no cases in the courts at all, and the Government can do what it wants without challenge.  So in Flast, they carved out an exception, and the exception was where the taxing and spending clauses were involved, because Madison and others said this is aimed at  ""Government shall not tax and spend. ""  So that was my theory.  And all we're saying is where there's a big taxing and spending and it isn't incidental, there's standing.  Now we're worried about the merits.  Simple and clear.  To which the response was, which has me a little worried frankly, was that, well, that was Justice Stewart's position, or roughly speaking.  But the Court rejected that quite clearly, and if you look at later cases, they reject it too.  And therefore, whatever you might think of it, it isn't the law.  And I'm not free to think whatever, I have to think exactly in accordance with what the cases say.  So what is your response?  I'd like you to focus on that.   Stephen G. Breyer  So you're saying that what Justice Stewart's view, insofar as it was rejected, that Flast suggested even broader standing, but it suggested at least what Justice Stewart said?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that right or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  But not neatly, I mean, in terms of the purposes of the thing.  Are your clients claiming that it would violate the establishment clause for the President to go to lots and lots of prayer breakfasts?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I never met anyone who did, but I guess there is a legitimate concern, somebody might think that, I guess.  And I guess that if people... there is some tendency of the people that are worried, you know, there are pro ses, there are all kinds of people, somebody could claim that.  So you want a way to keep them out.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's Justice Kennedy's concern.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But what they're worried--  about is will this word ""incidental"" and... be sufficient to keep out the people who might somehow decide they want to claim, which sounds like a frivolous claim, that the President can't go to a prayer breakfast.  Now does the word ""incidental"" do that?  That's what I think--   INTERRUPTING ",06-157X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why don't you follow what the EEOC says?  I mean, the EEOC, as I understand it, has said the very fact the employer has initiated an investigation of an alleged discrimination is sufficient to demonstrate the reasonableness of the employee's belief that by providing information relevant to the inquiry she is opposing an employment practice made unlawful by Title VII.  And then they go on.  To be absolutely clear about it, they say an employee who assists her or her employer in the endeavor, i.e., you go and testify; so the sun was shining on that day; you are assisting your employee by telling the truth -- is by definition -- is opposing practices made unlawful by Title VII.  So here we have a difficult question, quite an interstitial question, defining precisely EEOC doing it.  So why don't we just follow what they say?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is this a real problem?  I mean, let's suppose the opposition clause protects everybody in the internal investigation who could be at all interpreted as favorable to the complainant.  It also protects everybody who could possibly be viewed as neutral.  Then you have a problem about what about a person who loves sexual harassment?  This is the hypothetical: he comes in, testifies: I love sexual harassment; it's wonderful, and they fire him.  Now is this a real problem?   Stephen G. Breyer  The problem with that is that I -- while I have the EEOC with me, say, on -- assuming your thing -- on, from what I read, on the opposition clause, when I looked into what the EEOC actually said here on the participation clause, I don't think I can characterize it, except for their litigation position.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I can't characterize what they've said in their compliance manual as being with you on that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And they could easily change it.  They could easily change it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  It's not in their manual.   ",06-1595
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that isn't even -- look, the best way to oppose a crime is to cooperate with the police when they investigate individual instances.  The best way to oppose sexual discrimination in the workplace is to cooperate with the employer when, in fact, he investigates individual instances.  Is what I've just said English?  Does it make sense?  And indeed, I'm just quoting the EEOC's own definition.   Stephen G. Breyer  It is your opinion.  The EEOC's opinion is, as they state, the best way to oppose is to cooperate.  Now, what are we to do with, at least ambiguity, giving you that, I'll give you ambiguity.  But we have the agency charged with the enforcement of this taking the side of it that is the opposite side that you are taking.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It is a mix.  I mean, you know, a lot of plaintiffs might be afraid to bring these cases because they'll be accused of doing all kinds of bad things.  They don't want their reputations ruined.  They have lawyers who take contingent fees because they have to pay for it.  Oh the other hand, you have problems with your costs and you have problems dismissing people who should be dismissed.  Everybody has problems in this area.  That's why we have law and lawyers.  They try to minimize it.  This doesn't seem fruitful to me.   ",06-1595

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, going back to what you first said, suppose with your own children: I told you half an hour ago not to interrupt your sister when she is doing her homework.  This is the second time you've done it.  Wouldn't you, with your own child... I would with mine... think that the second time he did it was worse behavior than the first time?  I just told him not to.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if it's absolutely right I don't see why we hold Congress to some kind of weird... not weird, but more picky standard than we do with our own children.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because their behavior is worse.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That isn't what I tell my child.  I say you behaved worse.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, does the word ""offense""... I haven't come across it, but does the word ""offense"" have some kind of special technical meaning that doesn't just mean the behavior which calls into play all kinds of circumstances?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's the part I'm not getting.  I mean, that's why it doesn't help your client.  In general, if you did read the word 10 years or more is prescribed, you'd say, well what is the maximum term prescribed for the offense of selling drugs?  And the answer would be 10 years.  Now, how do you get out of that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're saying because... because fewer people are likely to get the 10-year sentence than get the five-year sentence?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is... what is the distinguishing... how do you get out of it?  I know you're trying to say this and I'm just not getting it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So it's bank robbery... bank robbery, force or threat of force guidelines.  If you have a gun, eight years.  If you brandish it, four more years.  If you take, you know, $10 as opposed to $50, two years, eight years, six years.  The statute, by the way, says a max of 20 years.  Now, what's the... what's... does this fall within it?  Doesn't it?  Does it depend on whether he brandished it?  What does it depend on, in your view?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or what he actually faced... that, I agree with you, that won't work because of the guidelines, if they were mandatory.  But what they're saying here is it's right in the statute.  You just look at the statute that has the definition of what the offense is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm back to the same question then.  I mean which one do we pick?   Stephen G. Breyer  You see that my question is going in the exact opposite way.  What I am finding hard is once you distinguish offender and offense characteristics in the way you do, why not jump to the max for the offense?  And so I'm asking you, how is it you get out of that?  Which is the same question I had before.  I'm not so worried about your case as I am other cases.   ",06-1646
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I would not say no one else, but not everyone else places the importance on legislative history that I do, but I do.  And I saw here that the Senate Judiciary Committee considered all these arguments, they wrote a report; and they sided with the government.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I know it was there, but it doesn't matter to me it was on a bill that was later not passed, and then unless there is something different--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --for that reason, because in my own mind I'm thinking there were a group of people on the committee, they went through the issue, they reflected views of their principles, they work it out, and unless something changed that makes me think that isn't the working out of it, I would put a lot of weight on it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And now you're going to tell me what there is, I hope.   ",06-1717
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't think it is a problem with legislative history.  [Laughter]  I think that the people in Congress who hired their staffs pay attention to what the staffs say in precisely the same way that any other executive--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I mean that wouldn't be surprising would it, that wouldn't be surprising because you have, in fact, very complex bills that have 14 sections and section of the B bill could have been vetoed... been vetoed because of problem with Section 14 and repassed without Section 14, in which case the legislative history for the other 13 sections would be highly illuminating as to what they mean.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The question that I had in respect to this statute is... is that my impression and here... I'd like to know how they bill secretary's times.  I'd like to know how they bill rent.  And my thought is... and I want to be either verified or told I'm wrong and explain it, that when you have no cap, the lawyer and the client want to shove everything possible into the rubric attorney's fees, including the kitchen sink, if the plumber is there in the kitchen of the law firm.  [Laughter]  That's fine.  No problem.  There is no other way to get paid for them.  But where you have a cap, you should shove everything the other side, if expenses are going to be paid for it, because that cap means that the lawyer will not get his full pay back and therefore, the lower the cap, the more you want to be sure it's covering only that lawyer's time.  And everything else goes into expense so that you can pay the lawyer adequately and he will recover his expenses elsewhere.  Was that the theory of this bill?  Is there any evidence that that was the theory?  If you did it that way, would anything get mixed up?   ",06-1717
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I thought that was something a little different than that.  The question that I have which might be helpful to me, if you can answer it, is... that's being serious about it... I'd be helped by knowing what the specific design defect is that you claim?  That is, in what respect was this catheter... and I'd like you to refer to the details of the catheter... in what respect, what material or what shape or what... what it is about this catheter that you as the plaintiff think was designed defectively, if you can tell me?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know.  But you must have a theory.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is it about the design that you are saying is not safe?  That is, you can't go into the court without having in your mind, as the counsel, that some kind of specific thing that was wrong with this catheter, other than just using the words ""design"".  I mean, how was it designed badly?  What part of the design is not right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You are saying the material of the balloon should have been of a different material or a different thickness; is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  What does that mean?  How do you design something to burst?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you don't know how to design the balloon, what are you basing the design claim on?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let me tell you why I asked my question, because I don't want to leave... you to leave with an unfavorable impression in my mind on your issue without your having a chance to see.  What's worrying me is that, of course, it's a terrible thing when somebody is hurt in these kinds of accidents.  And the lawyers are trying to help.  So the lawyers will think, look, there's a problem here.  There must be.  My client was seriously hurt.  And he's not supposed to be.  And then they'll work backward from that and say well if he was hurt, there must be something wrong with the design.  So every time there is an accident or something bad happens, the lawyers assert a design claim and they gear up discovery.  And in my mind, could Congress have intended that kind of thing when what they're trying to do is have a group of experts really look into this and decide whether it should marketed or not.  That's what's bothering me.  And that's why I would like you to respond to that.   ",06-179X

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I'm surprised you say piecemeal.  I would have thought most agencies in the government have like an inspector general or someone that you can complain.   Stephen G. Breyer  You can write them a letter and you say, look at what's been going on, they've been trespassing, they've indicted me on a false charge; I want you to see the whole list here and I'd like you to do something about it.  And if they don't do anything about it, you go to your senator.  Maybe you can go to the newspapers.  I mean, has any of that happened here?   Stephen G. Breyer  And what's been the result of that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why is it a State law matter?  Why didn't he know about this possibility?  Why didn't he know that his predecessor in title had granted?  Why wasn't there an actual notice, given the fact that everybody in this area of the country seems as a matter of course to give mutually beneficial rights-of-way?  I agree it wasn't recorded.

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not even thinking of it.  I just wonder if 1983 would apply and it would be clear that there is an action.  If you win, there would be no problem.   ",06-219X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Who would have thought... wait.  When you say that, I mean, there's a lot of these acts, it seems, they are plainly illegal.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if they are plainly illegal, then there are remedies in the courts.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But what is actually worrying you, which probably you can address at some point, is this: There are remedies one by one.  That's true.  And each has one.  And maybe you can even get injunctions against harassing.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, maybe he didn't do it.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so it may be, they thought he did do it and--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Did you bring a suit for malicious prosecution?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Maybe he should have won.  What's worrying me throughout, if you want to know--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  [Laughter]  What is worrying me throughout is, put this case to the side.  If the Court recognizes what I take it has not happened in the past, that there is an action for private people to bring against the government, Bivens, under the Fifth Amendment, all of a sudden vast numbers of regulations, the coal pillars in Holmes case, everything south of that will be suddenly in Federal court as people claim that what's going on with this regulation is there are individuals in the government who have gone too far, and they are just trying to get my property and the use of it, without paying a fair price.  Now by the way, sometimes people in government do go too far, so many of those claims might have some justification.  But suddenly I see the possibility of this kind of action becoming a major roadblock, an obstacle sometimes used unjustifiably, and not necessarily, not necessary, this kind of thing, to impose a roadblock to totally legitimate government regulatory action.   Stephen G. Breyer  You see, part of what's worrying me is that once you get into the Fifth Amendment, which is... prevents the government from taking property for a public use without just compensation, the possibility of the legal imagination becomes endless.  Because every time a person walks across the doorstep, every time a person wants to install a pipe in the basement, read the meter... I mean, I can see possibilities of actions of this kind arising, and particularly when the government wants to buy it and is pointing out all the reasons why it should be sold.  Is there a threat lurking in that conversation?  You see what I'm worried about here, which wasn't present in the other case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  The reason would be probably that the, if you can make a comparison.  The number of Government actions that affect criminal charges and so forth are tiny compared to the number of governmental actions that affect people's property.  Virtually, I mean the number of Government actions affecting how people use their property, it's the whole series of law books.  It fills the room.  And suddenly to open up a new remedy in that kind of thing is what's frightening me, which is what I said already.  So you don't have to answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Retaliation, what is retaliation?  Isn't retaliation statutory?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the two cases you cite, the first one is the person who was charged with extortion is a judge--   Stephen G. Breyer  --And he was extorted on the ground that he told the plaintiff to pay the defendant, so the money wasn't given to the government.  So I don't see that that's a difference.  And then the second case--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --it may have been, but you say ""See Also"", which is a sign to me there's something wrong with that case.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm surprised that you didn't put it first if there wasn't.  Page 49.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why did you say ""See Also""?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  You can go to an agency and say, agency I want to do such and such, dah dah dah, here are my reasons.  Agency says no.  I want review.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know.  You might have written to the Secretary of the Interior: Secretary, I want to you do such and such, please.  No.  Okay, review.   Stephen G. Breyer  And what happened?   ",06-219X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  It is... I agree with you, I agree with you that we should look at the whole picture.  When I look at the whole picture... I've actually got a little chart that my law clerk prepared.  And what he did, he went through this and looked at a case called Newlon and it was the same prosecutor.  And the prosecutor was told in that case just what he shouldn't do.  And now if we look what he did in this case and look what he did in that case and look at the law, the whole thing, not just little bits, it looks like he did an awful lot of what he wasn't supposed to do.  You're not supposed to give an argument that vouches as the U.S. attorney that I think that this is what you should do.  So in Newlon he says: I'm talking to you as prosecuting attorney of the county, the top law enforcement officer.  And here he says: I'm the top law enforcement officer and I decide in which cases we have the death penalty and not.  Worse than Newlon, I would say.  Then what you're not supposed to do is you're not supposed to tell them they're like soldiers.  I mean, there's Supreme Court cases that say, don't tell them you're like a soldier doing duty.  At least that's what all these prosecutors... a case called Byron versus the United States.  So in Newlon what he says is: I want to impress on you, this is a war and it's justifiable to kill in war.  Here he says: As in the movie ""Patton"" and in the movie George Patton is talking to his troops because they're going out in battle like the soldiers.  And then he says: And when you're a soldier, you know what to do when you put your hand in a pile of goo that a moment before was your best friend's face; you'll know what to do; and last July this defendant's face was a pile of goo.  Okay, there we are.  I mean, that sounds pretty emotional.  It sounds like a soldier does his duty and you're doing it.  And then another thing you're not supposed to do is you're not supposed to tell them it's their duty to the community.  And this is just filled with instances where you hardly even know that there's a person called Weaver because he says: What you have to do here is send a message to the drug lords, send a message--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, there's a brief--   Stephen G. Breyer  --It's not?  Why did they file... is this brief wrong, then, the brief of the former prosecutors giving the propositions that I just stated and have the Supreme Court case next to each one?  Are they wrong, those prosecutors?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Was there with the Patton and the goo?   Stephen G. Breyer  Was there a curative instruction?   Stephen G. Breyer  In Viereck the words were:  ""This is war, harsh, cruel, murderous war. ""  And the prosecutor went on to analogize the jury's duties to the duties of soldiers and he said: Do your duty.  Do you think that's a lot different than this case?   Stephen G. Breyer  So those things that are improper for a prosecutor to make in summing up in the guilt phase, are they then proper to say, exactly those things, in a sentencing phase with capital... with... you know, capital sentencing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There are a number of cases--  in this Court that say what a prosecutor can't say, guilt phase.  All of them happen to be guilt phase, I guess.  You can't, you know, vouch.  You can't use too much emotion.  You have to focus on what the defendant did, not on what somebody else did.  I mean, there are a number of things.  Now, do those... is it fair or not fair to say that those precedents apply in the capital sentencing phase, too?   ",06-313X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask you, where... one of the passages that I thought went a little far where is he says to the jury, the one thing you've have got to into your head; this is far more important than William Weaver.  This case goes far beyond William Weaver.  This touches all the dope peddlers and the murderers in the world.  That's the message you have to send.  It just doesn't pertain to William Weaver.  It pertains to all of us, the community.  The message... there are street, et cetera.  Okay.  Now.  That struck me, as you argue this is rather extreme.  Its seems to be removing the attention of the jury from William Weaver and saying you have a duty to send this man for other reasons.  Now... to execute him.  But where do I find in the U.S. reports the case or statement that then says this is the kind of argument the prosecutor cannot make?   Stephen G. Breyer  You were talking--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Suppose that you said explicitly, the prosecutor... which he didn't say... but you're arguing basically, it is a fair, sort of an implication, suppose he said there are a lot of drug dealers around, and he's one of them.  And this sentencing phase isn't about just... just isn't about William Weaver.  It is about sending a message to the others.  And if you execute him, even if you think he shouldn't be executed, you don't think he ever should be, but, you see, others will think that this is a message.  So do it just to give a message.  Even if you think he never did it.  No matter what you think of him, you think he's the best person in the world.  Still execute him just to send a message.  Now would that violate the Constitution?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Of course.  What case in the Supreme Court would you look to to show it did?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You don't find any one where anybody ever had an argument like that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Ah.  So you are saying we should look not just to... if we try to look for exact, identical arguments maybe we'll get into that problem?  Of having to uphold things we all know... or is that right?  Or what?   INTERRUPTING ",06-313X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I understand very well your argument that if the EPA is going to transfer this, they transfer it to Arizona and the first thing they say is, we look at Arizona's laws and they protect everything.  And now we look at our own authority and if they get... start mucking around with this, we can refuse the permit.  And besides that, we have a memorandum of understanding and the memorandum of understanding or whatever it is, agreement or something, is going to be they're going to pay as much attention as we are.  So they'll pay attention to this, too, and if they don't we have an enforcement mechanism.  So no problem; we are not putting any species in jeopardy.  We satisfy the standard.  I've got that part of the argument.  I think I paraphrased it pretty well.  The part I don't get is then you say, anyway, we don't have to do any of this because it says ""shall transfer"", therefore, it's not discretionary, it's mandatory.  That part I don't get because there are nine standards there and it seems to me to say that is rather like saying, well, the ICC used to say you shall let the railroad build a spur, provided it's in the public interest, convenience, and necessity.  I mean, are you suddenly saying every statute that uses the word ESA?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, fine.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, my problem with saying it's clear is that they have nine criteria.  One of the criteria is you look to five other statutes, which they have their own criteria and one of those criteria is you have to be certain that the State will assure the protection and propagation of a balanced population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife.  And by the time you get through those nine criteria, I don't think you'd have to be too imaginative a lawyer to figure out ways that they involve everything the ESA involves.  So if there ever was an act prefaced by the word ESA would apply, you would think it would this be this one, which has to do with water, environmental protection, nine criteria, many vague, and they use words like ""wildlife"", ""shellfish"", et cetera.   ",06-340X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That isn't the... what I'm trying to figure out with Justice Kennedy's questions and your answers is, is there really an issue here?  And I'm beginning to see maybe there is an issue when you said what are they talking about.  Can you... it's a cactus.  They're kidnapping cactus, as apparently happens.  And if in fact this cactus, if the thing is transferred to the State, that cactus is going to disappear.  Now that isn't fish.  It isn't wildlife.  It isn't water.  It's a cactus.  So can you take that into account?  Is that theoretical?  I think they're trying to raise this question of, suppose you know the IRS, that if you mail a refund check at the time, the person who gets it is going to use the $500 to destroy the last salamander in the world.  Okay?  Now there we are, endangered species.  Does the Act apply to the IRS?  I would have thought the answer's no.   Stephen G. Breyer  And then I would have thought the same reasoning is true here, but what the Act tells you to do is read your existing authority, but read it in light of informed by the endangered species objectives language, et cetera.  And now I wonder if with that approach, is it possible that even the cactus could fall within the nine criteria?  You're not going to depart from them but you're going to read them generously in light of the objective of the Endangered Species Act, which is itself an environmental objective.  Now how does that work?  Can you do that?  You're an imaginative lawyer.  Can you do it?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  The answer is you can.  Then are you satisfied with this result in this Court?  One, it can be read that way.  They're not going to agree with that.  It can be read that way, and therefore, it applies.  The ESA, the Endangered--  Two, that means they consult.  But three, the result of the consultation here which has been done means there's no real objection to the transfer, because it's virtually inconceivable given the weapon that the EPA has, withdrawing permits, given a memorandum of agreement, given the possibility of supervision, given the fact that the wildlife service will object, writing them a letter or a phone call immediately, given all that stuff, there's simply no reason to believe that Arizona will fail to protect endangered species.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what's your view of an opinion that roughly wrote what I just said?   Stephen G. Breyer  Before you say why you didn't argue it, it's exactly that point I sort of expected you might agree when I though maybe you have hooks to hang the NSA, the Endangered Species Act on.  But it was the other half, which I think is what Justice Stevens is saying now.  I read through this record, not completely but pretty well, and I couldn't find a single thing that would suggest that Arizona presents any risk to you.  And so, what is the risk to an endangered species that you're actually worried about there?  And you rather... I didn't think you'd like to agree with that, but I want to press you to find out what actually is the problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And how would that happen?  How would it happen that they would get rid of the flycatcher in Arizona, considering the fact that they have laws themselves that protect endangered species, and that's a bird, and a bird is wildlife; and so if they decide they want to kill all their flycatchers, which I would doubt, you could intervene at EPA and stop them.  So how is that actually a problem?   INTERRUPTING ",06-340X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  It seems to apply just to abuse of discretion.   Stephen G. Breyer  : Doesn't the new statute just apply to abuse of discretion?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It says you have jurisdiction to determine whether it's an abusive discretion.  Maybe I'm reading the wrong place.  6404--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Right.  Well that standard doesn't apply to the (e)(2).  It has nothing to do with it; (e)(2) says if it's a refund, abate, if not, not.  It's not a question of abuse of discretion or not.   ",06-376X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but is there any other instance in the law?  I suppose there probably is, but what surprised me about that is this: Imagine we have two citizens and they are identical in every respect in terms of their claim, they each believe the government owes them $50,000.  They each have identically strong claims.  And Congress passes a law and says one of you can come into court and the other can't.  Now suppose it said the poor person can't come into court.  Do you think there wouldn't be a constitutional problem there?  Remember, they have the same claim for the same amount, with the same precise strength of their argument.  But we say rich people can go in, and we'd say why did you do that?  We say poor people don't have as much stake in society.  They don't have... now suppose you heard such an argument.  How long would it take you to feel there's a constitutional problem?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  The rational basis is that the poor person doesn't have the stake in society that a rich one does.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  But at the end of the day, the claim happens to be interest worth $5,000.  The IRS abused its discretion under the statute in failing to write a check for $5,000 to both.  What we do is we allow one of them to bring a lawsuit to get the 5,000, and we say to the other one, you can't bring the lawsuit to get the 5,000.  Now my question is, what's the basis for that distinction?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why would there be no hardship?   Stephen G. Breyer  And so can a poor person.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  By the way, this has nothing to do with the progressive income tax.  What I have not seen anywhere is the use of wealth, totally different from the dollar value of a claim, to shut the courthouse door.  I'm just saying, is there such a case anywhere, and if there is no such case, then I'd say I wonder about this assumption.  The assumption that the reason that you cannot keep the courthouse door open to everyone is because what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We know, attorneys' fees you give to poor people more than to rich people.  That makes sense.  That has nothing to do with having a formal rule saying you cannot enter the courthouse.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't understand.   Stephen G. Breyer  Wait.  That might be the answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  Wait.  There are two separate things.  I want to understand this.  In other words, the Secretary does not have the power to abate the interest in respect to the rich person?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh.   Stephen G. Breyer  He can do it... in the first case with the rich person, he can abuse his discretion.   Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, in the one case Congress has passed a law saying with a poor person you cannot abuse your discretion, but with a rich person you can abuse your discretion.  That's what the--  underlying substantive statute says.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I now think maybe I don't agree on this point that there are different standards, because it does say in this abuse of discretion.  And indeed that's a normal administrative standard, and so as you read this you would think that the IRS does not have any legal power substantively to abuse its discretion in refusing to bring an abasement in refusing to bring an abatement... excuse me, to abate the interest.  So far do you agree?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Once they make clear that the standard is abuse of discretion, it only makes clear what's there in the law anyway, that administrative authorities do not have the authority to abuse their discretion.  Now, sometimes we don't review that in the courts.  That doesn't make it legal.  It just means you can't catch them out in court.   Stephen G. Breyer  So there's a standard that applies to everybody.  Then all that this does, to go back to it is it closes the courthouse door.  Now I want to know what your rationale was for doing that?  It had nothing to do with the standards that applied.  It has to have something to do with why one class of people by wealth are kept out of court.  I think if it were the other way around it wouldn't last for three seconds, and the only reason maybe I don't think about it as hard this way because I think, well, privilege is involved, etcetera.  But when you force me to think about it, I want to know what the reason so.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'll accept that characterization.  Now you give me the reason why we've opened the courthouse door to individuals who are alike in every respect but for their net worth?  Now give me that, the same reason?  I always want to know what the specific reason is, the specific rationale and.  I'm not saying there isn't one.  I just want to know what it is.   ",06-376X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What has this to do with the... aside from the explanation, when I read through the transcript, as I have, it seemed to me in the transcript he didn't say a word that suggested he's against giving the death penalty.  He kept saying yeah, in special circumstances, not always.  Then they get into this thing where he's been thinking of a person who will in fact commit a crime again.  And then it's put to him directly: Have you thought about that he won't be committing a crime again if he's in jail the rest of his life.  He says: You're right; I hadn't really thought it through.  I want to know, thinking it through, could you consider the death penalty?  Do you think under the conditions where the man would never get out again you could impose it?  Yes, sir.  So you don't think that if parole was an option, etcetera, repeating it.  Death penalty?  I could consider it.  Then could you impose it?  I could if I was convinced that was the appropriate measure.  And it's absolutely clear he's not thinking of the repetition.  It is clear he is thinking that it's some kind of a mean.  And I compare that with Witt, where the person just says no, I can't, and I compared it with this other case, Gray, and they say it's illegal to push him off a jury, a woman who is confused, and finally she says: I think I could.   Michael R. Dreeben  --Justice Breyer, I think your question goes to the heart of the case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's probably right.   Michael R. Dreeben  But the reason it goes to the heart of the case, Justice Breyer, is that you and I and every other appellate lawyer and judge who have looked at this is dealing with a cold record, but the only person who actually saw and heard this juror give the responses was the trial judge.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what is it that he could have done?  Was he shaking, making faces?  Was he shaking his head to indicate he believed the opposite?   Michael R. Dreeben  Well, Justice Breyer--   Stephen G. Breyer  If something like that happened, isn't a prosecutor of any sense going to say, I want it noted for the record that the witness while he said these words was chortling inwardly or something like that?   Michael R. Dreeben  --Well, Justice Breyer, there were five separate occasions during Juror Deal's voir dire in which he expressed either uncertainty or a misconception about what the death penalty should be exposed for when measured against Washington law.  And the overarching point that I make before I talk about those five instances is that this is a record in which there is confusion and uncertainty about whether Juror Deal really can adhere to the law.  And in those circumstances, the only judge who can truly resolve that and determine whether he should be credited is the trial judge.  And this Court has made that point over and over again in describing its voir dire.   ",06-413X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The law on this, and you've read the cases more recent probably... I've skimmed through some but not read them all, as I'm sure you have.  And the statement of the law that I want to know, is it still valid law, is in Witherspoon on 522, Justice Stewart in the footnote.  And what he says in that footnote is,  ""the most that can be demanded of a venire man in this regard is that he be willing to consider. ""  and those are his italics,  ""to consider all of the penalties provided by State law, and that he not be irrevocably committed before the trial has begun to vote against the penalty of death, regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge. ""  ""If the voir dire testimony in a given case indicates that venire men were excluded on any broader basis than this, the defendant's sentence cannot be carried out. ""  Is that still a valid statement of the law or has it changed?   Stephen G. Breyer  Of Washington law.  No, this is Justice Stewart of the Supreme Court.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  This doesn't say... that's one of the things it says.  But the other is,  ""the most that can be demanded of a venire man is that he be willing to consider. ""  --that's the word that's italicized... now, is there any...  ""and if you exclude him on a broader ground than that, the death sentence cannot be carried out. ""  Now, is there anything in any later case that suggests a change in that respect?   ",06-413X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The answer to that is it may be a very good idea, so convince Congress to pass a law.  It's just that if every State does it differently it's going to be a nightmare.  And I don't know what the answer to that point is.  And I don't know what the answer to the point is about banning things.  I'm amazed if that's what you mean.  I'm not sure what you mean.  I mean, North Carolina could pass a statute that says the following: Everybody in North Carolina over the age 16, say, or maybe everybody including small children... I don't know what they want to pass... can smoke to their heart's delight, can buy as many cigarettes as they like, but you can't ship in a single cigarette from out of State.  You think that wouldn't cause... raise a Commerce Clause problem?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's why I'm just not certain about bans that forbid people to ship things inside from outside the State, while allowing people to buy those things produced by people inside the State.  That's why I'm uncertain about the concession you're talking about.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, what is this New York law that does this?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But the thing I'm concerned about is... is assume it's perfectly legal to do what you said.  I guess it still wouldn't be legal for Maine or New York to say the following: We really want to discourage people from smoking, a noble goal.  And, therefore, whenever an interstate shipper ships tobacco into the State, he has to charge double the price, just double the shipment price or ten times the shipment price.  Could they say that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But could they say you have to carry it in special packages which the sticker... which maybe you should do, but which the sticker puts skull and crossbones on each of the packages?  Could they say that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  If they cannot say either of those things because of the statute, why can they say: What you have to do is you have to ship it in a way that makes certain that the person who receives it, the addressee, is the person who bought it?   INTERRUPTING ",06-457X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  May I ask you this question, which is where I'm having a little trouble on your side.  I think I would agree and you would agree that if the State were to say, to protect the consumers in our State, anyone who ships in goods must do so in special padded cars... use whatever shipper you want, but you have to have special... that would be illegal.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can California say, anybody who ships lettuces into our State has to use refrigerated equipment?  One product, not all products, and a good public health reason?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you'd say that would also be preempted?   ",06-457X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You say very.  Which economists?  I know the Chicago school tends to want rule of reason and so forth.  Professor Sherer is an economist, isn't he?  Worked at the FTC for a long time.  A good expert in the field.  He points out the drug industry after you got rid of... after you got rid of resale price maintenance, the margins fell 40 percent.  The drug stores it went down 20 percent.  He says with blue jeans, alone, it saved American consumers $200 million to get rid of it.  And his conclusion is, as in the uniform enforcement of resale price maintenance, the restraints can impose massive anti-consumer benefits.  Massive.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What that sounds like is that if at least he, who is an economist, thinks if you get rid of Dr. Miles, every American will pay far more for the goods that they buy at retail.  Now that's one economist, of course.  There are other whose think differently.  So how should we decide this?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Should we overturn Dr. Miles and run that risk?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We're supposed to count economists?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that how we decide it?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I haven't seen a consensus.  A consensus?  Isn't, doesn't Sherer and all these people, doesn't that point of view count, too?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I don't know.  We have... you talked about... just for fun I got out of the library a book by Professor B. S. Yamey, called resale price maintenance where he has five economists... now maybe you're not going to count them as economists.  Now I didn't find in that book a single argument that isn't also in your briefs, nor did I find in your brief as single argument that isn't in the book.  There's one interesting thing about the book.  It was written in 1966.  So I guess my question is what's changed?  Now I know two things have changed.  One is there's evidence in Canada, Britain, and in the states that were under Miller-Tydings, that when you got rid of resale price maintenance, prices went down.  That's changed.  And the second thing that's changed is there's far more concentration, I gather, today in the retail side of the market than there are used to be, a factor which makes resale price maintenance dangerous because it's more likely to take place at the request of the dealers.  Now, I see those two changes.  My question to you is looking at Yamey's book which is called Resale Price Maintenance, so you might have found even it even on Google, and... what's changed?  What's new?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe I'll put my question, which is really just one for this.  I understand perfectly that the per se rule is a result of balancing differ things.  Of course, resale price maintenance does raise prices, and it is very often anticompetitive.  Of course, sometimes, there are good reasons for it that might help consumers.  Now, in addition, you need clear rules.  Now those three sets of things require a balance.  And we have a hundred years of history where this Court and Congress and others have balanced those three sets of considerations, and they've come out one way.  Now, the Department of Justice wants to rebalance them and come out the other way.  There are good arguments on both sides.  Why should we overrule a case that's 96 years old, in the absence of any... any... congressional indication that that's a good idea, when it's simply a question in a difficult area of people reaching a slightly different weight on some these three sets of things?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I would think it is quite a close question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right, even so.  Go ahead.   Stephen G. Breyer  Price fixing, horizontal, I guess, or territorial divisions, we should overturn those too.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What you say is right.  What you say there is right.  I feel I'm back in 1966.  The argument against that is, we don't know which way the push comes.  The large retailers, Home Depot, whatever they are, huge retailers, they want... or maybe it isn't the discounters, it's some other ones.  We don't know which way.  You're throwing it into court.  You're throwing it before 12 people who may or may not work this thing out.  So the argument against what you're saying is not logic.  It's empirical and administrative.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what it was.  That's what it is now, I guess.   INTERRUPTING ",06-480X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The Internet... is it... you would have said fourty years ago, or I think we are in this argument, you would have said that it's the large discounters, the growing discounters, the Walgreen's of the world who want to get rid of retail price maintenance, it's there to help the mom and pops.  Okay.  They're in now, they're big, and they may want to maintain resale prices because they may want to extract the extra profit, while the Internet little company comes in and says I can get it to you cheaper.  Now I can imagine circumstances like you say.  I can imagine they're not like you say.  I don't know.  And so what should I do if I really don't know?   ",06-480X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But suppose it says, which I think it did say, that Mr. Notebaert typically stayed on top of the company's financial health by having weekly conversations with other executives.  He had his hands on the pulse of the company.  He saw weekly sales reports and product... projection... production projections.  Now it seems like an allegation that's very specific.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I thought they alleged at least that for about a year previously in respect to the 506500 that it was wrong known throughout the company that the 6500 had been delayed.  Don't they make an allegation like that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The 6500 has long been delayed.  Everyone knows that in the company.  So he knows it's long been delayed.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then what he says is it is being shipped and delivered.  Something like that.   Stephen G. Breyer  April '01, he says everything we can build we are building, and shipping.  The demand is very strong.  And then what they say is of course nobody wanted any of it, it was long delayed, and they've known that since 1998 and he has his finger on the pulse of the company.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh.  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  What do you think in writing this opinion?  There are a couple of ways.  One, you can find strong inference in terms of some other words.  Two, you could look to history.  Or three, you could just try an example.  Say strong inference means strong inference.  Here's an example.  This is a complaint.  It meets it, or it doesn't meet it.  Which way, in your opinion, will work best in this case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You had something else to say in answer to my question, which I would like to hear.   ",06-484X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The most suspicious thing in the complaint that I could find was where you say there's an internal market report, and it revealed demand for the 5500 was drying up, and revenue would decline by 400,000,000.  Then you date that with in or about early '01.  Now, I think if you knew or had reason to believe that it was prior to March or April of '01, you would have said so.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, and therefore, there's quite a good chance here that this report was written after he made the statements.  What am I supposed to do with that?  I mean, I know what you said.  And you said your best.  And that's your best.   Stephen G. Breyer  What's the difference between what Justice Scalia was just saying?  You can't come into Federal court unless you have at least $200,000 damages.  Now, you might have been just as much hurt if you had less, but that would be constitutional.  So here you can't get into Federal court unless you have a really strong claim, an overwhelming claim that you have to demonstrate at the beginning.  Now, you might have a good claim, but we're not going to let you come into Federal court.  We only want those people who are really strong, just as we only want those people who are really suffering.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  No, not the burden of... it's the entry.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's true, but imagine a case where the plaintiff with tremendous candor sets forth every bit of testimony that's going to be heard on both sides.  And then you read that document and you conclude this is the weakest case I've ever heard, but I do think a reasonable juror could find for the plaintiff.  And that would be the weak evidence standard.  And lo and behold, that could be... you know, what do we do about that?  Because using your do you send it to a jury test, we could easily imagine cases where that meets the weak evidence standard, the weak inference and not the strong inference.  And what I'm driving at is, I don't see a way of avoiding this Seventh Amendment problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because they certainly didn't intend the weak inference standard.   Stephen G. Breyer  What do you think about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  What do you think about the approach... because I have had some of these cases.  And I see... I think words, words, words.  And what Congress said was strong inference, and we're not going to get any further by looking for some other words.  So therefore, take strong inference.  The most helpful thing is take it, look at the complaint, read it, and then say okay, this is a strong inference.  Or maybe we'd say it isn't.  We read it, and avoid all the other issues.  What do you think about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, and so I think we have to reach it, because it can't possibly be you would instruct the jury you need a strong inference, and it couldn't possibly be that a predominance standard if imported into the pleading would always mean a strong inference.  You see, that's... that's the dilemma.  And I don't see how to remain true to the words of the statute which are strong inference, without actually producing a dichotomy.  And so either Congress can do it or it can't, and... and... and that's... and we could fudge it by just, you know, avoiding it at this moment.  But I don't--   ",06-484X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Who... who... where does it say you have to have done that?  My statute here says in any action to enforce a provision of 1983... the TRO or whatever was such an action.  It says the court in its discretion may allow the prevailing party an attorneys' fee.  Well, did they prevail or not?  They got what they wanted.  And it was such an action.  Doesn't say anything about whether you have been declared horrible or wonderful or violator or not a violator.  It says did they get what they want in the action?  Answer, yes.  End of matter.  Now what's wrong with reading it that way?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, they got the legal claim.  The legal claim is we want to have our demonstration on February 14; we have a right to do it and therefore issue an order.  You said no, don't issue the order, because they don't.  And therefore, they won.   Stephen G. Breyer  It is not?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  But what about the legal claim we are under the law entitled to a preliminary injunction.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well I thought, where it say that in the statute that you have to have that particular kind of a claim?   Stephen G. Breyer  So what do you think, when this was enacted, to make up an example that it is as horrifying as I can think, where the Ku Klux Klan was riding in the South, and a group of civil rights demonstrators wanted to make certain they could have their demonstration outside the jail and they go to the judge and says the sheriff is involved in this, the whole town is; we want an injunction tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Right now.  So... and we don't really care that much about the end of it, but we'll... we'll go ahead and litigate it if you want.  Now they get their injunction.  They have the demonstration; it's over.  I would have thought if there was a situation for which 1983 was written, it's that one.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, there is.  The other side has a lot of arguments.  And they each have arguments.  There are plenty of issues of law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is the law in respect to this, which is right on the point you're arguing, that two parties have this kind of suit and the government party... they settle it, and giving everything that the plaintiff conceivably wants, but at the end they say: We don't admit we violated the law.  Can you get attorney's fees there or not.   Patricia A. Millett  --If it's a consent decree.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's a consent decree, but no admission of a violation of law.   Patricia A. Millett  No, that's right.  This Court, while repeatedly stating, including unanimously just two years ago, that the central justification for attorney's fees is that the defendant is a violator of Federal law, has found that it will also permit attorney's fees in the consent decree situation, but that's because there you have a defendant who is not fighting and continuing to resist any form of final relief, has instead agreed to provide final relief that runs to a plaintiff, in favor of a plaintiff, and that advances the purpose of Federal law.   Stephen G. Breyer  That may be, but that's not the way the statute is written.   ",06-531X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I thought that it... am I wrong about that?  I thought that if, A, he goes in, he gets a preliminary injunction, he says the law is da, da, da, the judge says you're right, that's what it is, preliminary injunction.  And now it's continued up on appeal, the appellate court says you're wrong about the law.  You got it, you had the event, but you're absolutely wrong, the law did not support you.  I thought under those circumstances you were not prevailing and you couldn't get it.  Is that the law or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any authority for that?  Because it does seem to me wrong, that where a person has got a preliminary injunction and it's legally unsupportable, and then he gets the fee but then they appeal that and the court of appeals determines it's legally unsupportable, he never should have gotten it, I'd be surprised if there is a case that awards the fee in those circumstances, but maybe there is.  What is it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any case you can think of that under those circumstances let's him have the attorney's fees?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I would be surprised.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The other thing that I wonder about this case is, are you the prevailing party?  And the reason I ask that is because when I look through the record it seems to me your clients are very interesting.  They have their point of view.  And their point of view, one of their points of view was that the state said you can have this demonstration, just wear a skimpy swimming suit.  No.  Well, you can have the demonstration maybe, I'm not sure of this, but we're going to put up a cloth so other people who don't want to see you don't have to see you.  And there your client said, we won't pay any attention to the cloth.  At least we didn't in the past.  And then looking at that I thought, well, maybe what they got was, they got a preliminary injunction or a TRO, whatever you want to call it, but it didn't stop the State from putting up the cloth.  It was pretty clear the State would, and it should have been pretty clear that they were going to ignore it, which they did.  And why is this any different than having won an injunction to say okay, you can demonstrate, but in your swimming suit?  In other words, they didn't want this.  They didn't want what they got.  Now, what's the response to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, before you leave that, I wonder if... there's one other thing floating around in my mind.  I might as well bring it up.  The word is prevailing, and if I go with you on the ground that it's flexible and can apply to all kinds of things, at least you have to really be prevailing, is there a good faith element in that?  That is to say, if your clients when they went in to get this order and they got it, and at that time they had no intention of following what they had to do.  Rather, they had every intention of going out and tearing down the curtain.  Does that enter into the determination of whether they are really a prevailing party who ought to get their attorney's fees, if you're bringing the ethical element into it?   ",06-531X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What are... what are they?  I mean as I read this, I can't get anything out of the language.  I mean the two ""others"" might just make it more clear.  So we have another Section 113 that talks about contribution and it says you can get contribution if there has been a lawsuit, and so forth, or if there has been a settlement.  Fine.  Now the question comes up, well, suppose there hasn't been a lawsuit or a settlement.  Now if we look at the language here, at least my initial reading of it, it does not say.  It says that they are liable.  These PRPs are liable to this other PRP or person there.  But it doesn't just say explicitly bring a suit, and it doesn't say explicitly you can't bring a suit.  So I think well, why can't he bring a suit?  If he brings a suit how is the sky to fall?  On the other hand, if you don't let him bring a suit, they say well, maybe the Government just... will just stay out of this.  The Government won't enter into settlements because the Government is a big polluter.  And it would not like to get sued often, so they will stay away from the settlement and be home free.  So that's what they say on your... on their side, I think, primarily.  What do you say on your side?  How will the sky fall if in fact they win and they can bring suits under 107?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can I... can I go back?  Because I'm trying to, since I do find it so open with the language, what I'm doing is making what I call the list of acorns.  You say the sky is falling and I want a comparative list.   Stephen G. Breyer  On their side I have an acorn, which is if they don't win, EPA and DOD just are not going to settle these things because they want to escape us suing them.  And you say, are you kidding?  EPA loves to sue.  [Laughter]  And they like to settle.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  On your side, you're saying well, you know, if we don't... if we don't... accept your interpretation, they won't enter into settlements.  To which I guess they will make the same response.  Are you kidding?  The EPA loves to sue us and we are frightened of them and we'll settle.  Okay.  So I've got one acorn each side, now are there other acorns on the Government side; namely the sky is falling--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What are they?  I'd just like to make the whole list of acorns.   ",06-562X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  How?  I'm not so sure because... unless you want to stipulate that that restitution... if you want us to write in the opinion that in fact in a 107 action if one of the parties sued has entered into a settlement he shall have precisely the same protection from suit as if it were a 113 action.  Do you want to say that or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I would worry about the equity.  I just want to know if you want to stipulate that that's the proper interpretation, because I could easily imagine a case where your client bought a beautiful golf course and he wants to turn it into a golf course.  Unfortunately, there's a little mess under there and he spends $10 million on that.  And he says the real fault is the Union Oil Company and I'm going to sue them because they're the ones who dumped this and they've cost me $9 million.  And it turns out that Union through precisely good luck and a brilliant attorney has settled this very matter for one dollar with EPA.  Barred?   Stephen G. Breyer  Ah, that's what I thought, and that's what he's saying.  That's what he's saying, that's why he has brought his second acorn, because he said there's a huge difference here.  What you will do is if you get this 107 action you'll argue to the court as to what's fair, but what 113 says is once you settle with the Federal Government you're home free.   Stephen G. Breyer  How are you going to choose this?  Because he is, I think you're... maybe you're in a slightly awkward position because the Government is saying that one of the reasons that you're stuck with 113 is because Congress didn't really want through 107 to give parties like your clients an opportunity to review for fairness or equitable principles, whatever you like, the settlements that had taken place with the defendant in EPA.  And that's so we can get people to settle, among other things.  They feel they're home free.  Now, you have two choices here.  I think you could say, one, well, that's the way it is, we should have a 107 action and we should review these settlements for fairness; or two, you could say one of the principles of fairness is the principle that's written into 113 about no review, and we're happy with reading that into 107.  So which is it that you would like to say?   Stephen G. Breyer  When you say that's absolutely true, you mean absolutely true that you have that choice, or is it--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right, so then he's wrong in thinking that the motivating force behind this action is to permit people to get equitable review of prior settlements?  What you simply want... and you're not interested in that; you'll go with no equitable review of private settlements.  Read 113 into it.  You want the right to bring the case where there has been no settlement and Government has done nothing.   ",06-562X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What do you have besides the linguistic argument?  I mean, when I start out, I can't think of a reason why Congress wouldn't want to penalize the buyer, not the seller.  We are dealing with a statute that does catch your client, if they had only charged him with the right part.  But no one in his right mind would ever rely on a ruling in your favor to actually engage in such a transaction, since it would violate the statute in 15 different ways.  I exaggerate, but you see the point.  So you have a linguistic argument which people are... you're right, I think, in saying it's awkward but not impossible.  And, therefore, awkward but not impossible; we create an anomaly in the law.  I can't think of a reason why to do it.  So what else do you have?   Stephen G. Breyer  And sometimes we try to--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I don't want to put you in a whipsaw here.  [Laughter]  Sometimes policy seems relevant, too, to figure out what Congress wanted.  But let me go back to the question I had, which is do you want to us overturn Smith?  Are you asking that, because I could understand it more easily if you said, look, both sides of the transaction should be treated alike, but they should be both outside the word ""use"".   Stephen G. Breyer  But he receives the gun and it could have been loaded.  And if it was loaded, you receive a loaded gun, and you're there and you give the money for the gun and you have the gun and somebody comes up, maybe you'll shoot him.  I mean, that seems like a risk.   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought Bailey involved a guy, he had the gun in a locked thing in the trunk of his car, which is a little different from holding it in your hand.   ",06-571X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  This is what... this is what is bothering me about your side of this case.  I start thinking this is a total fluke.  Normally, you would charge him under ""possession in furtherance of"", which you didn't for reasons I don't know.  Or he would be an accessory, which he isn't here because the other side was a government agent.  So we've got a fluke.  Now, if I accept your linguistic approach, I don't know what I'm getting into.  Imagine an artillery team.  One loads the ammunition; the other pulls the trigger.  We say the team used the ammunition, but the guy who pulled the trigger by himself didn't.  Think of a baseball team.  The pitcher doesn't use the bat, but the team does.  Now, if I take your linguistic approach, where am I in respect to other statutes?  But if I deny your linguistic approach on the ground that it's unnatural to say ""use"" of the... the individual used it, all I've done is create a fluke case because it will never come up again.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But those are all examples that I used the gun to pay for the item.  You don't use the word ""use"" when you're the seller.  It doesn't fit.   ",06-571X

I thought that the provision that was... what is the number... where they say 552.109; that didn't appear anywhere until many years later.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, you read--   Stephen G. Breyer  --You read 3 and 3 says what you said it says.  All right.  How much later did they promulgate 109?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I thought.  So the same day they say, 3, you have to have these domestic workers employed by the old lady who's sick, and then in 109 they say you don't.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, why is that a conflict?  Let's imagine... it sounds like a conflict.  But it's easy for me to imagine a regulation that says birds for purposes of this are animals that fly, and then 15 pages later it says, but by the way, penguins don't and they're still covered.  I mean, why is that a conflict?  There are lots of specific situations.  If I read that, I would have thought, well, okay, they have an exception.   Stephen G. Breyer  Did Congress intend to cover, which I guess is a growing situation, that there is an old woman or man and they're very sick and they live in their house, there's only one way to keep them from having to go to an institution.  Their children hire a companion to look after them.  Now, that's a third party.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't say that.  It says  ""about, in or about a private home of the person by whom he is employed. ""  I live in San Francisco.  My mother lives in Massachusetts.  Now, if I hire a companion to live in Massachusetts, that companion does not work about a private home of the person, me, by whom she is employed.  So if we're being literal and if you win this case, I don't see how... and I'm worried about this, obviously... however... and I think it's probably very common, that all over the country it's the family, the children, the grandchildren, an aunt, an uncle, maybe a good friend, maybe they're not even related, who is paying for a companion for an old, sick person so they don't have to be brought to an institution.  And if you win this case, it seems to me suddenly there will be millions of people who will be unable to do it and, hence, millions of sick people who will move to institutions.  Now, if I were to say that that isn't totally a legal point, it is of course a legal point because it's a question of what people intended, but a worrisome point, I would be telling the truth.  It is a very worrisome point.   Stephen G. Breyer  And perhaps there are people, lawyers in the Government, who try to see through that kind of thing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And there are many... maybe Justice Scalia has the answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  Since we're into that, we're into this fascinating subject, I thought that possibly they had... they promulgated the whole thing pursuant to the rulemaking power under that particular statute, because that's what it says in 552.2.  It says 552.  And both regs we are talking about are in the part.  And B says interpretations, but they don't mean interpretive rules, because when you look at those interpretations, they have a whole lot of numbers in them, and divide by 32.  Nobody thinks that Congress meant in this statute divide by 32, as opposed by divide by 33.  So as I read that, I thought the whole thing is promulgated pursuant to their rulemaking authority; Part A has more general things.  Part B has more specific things.  Where am I wrong?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All of them.  All of them is what it says unless I missed something.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  I got the point.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   ",06-593X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Don't you agree with Justice Scalia... Justice Alito?  Don't you agree with Justice Alito?  I thought he's saying it's a ruling on constitutionality.   Stephen G. Breyer  I see.   Stephen G. Breyer  What does he do?  I mean I looked at what he does in 74, 75, 76a.  He seems to spend a lot of time moving furniture.  He lists that twice.  He runs the office.  And he represents, he is out in the local office somewhere and he talks to constituents.  I mean, he doesn't even appear in the Senate office except very rarely in which case he is doing casework.  So I guess if he is included in that, I mean so is a full-time furniture mover.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I have the whole list here.  What here suggests, he ever... he doesn't even write a statement for the floor.  There is nothing here that suggests one word of anything he did ever went to a committee meeting, to a floor of the Senate, anything.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What are the words?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I agree with that one.  I just said he doesn't do anything that gets to the floor of the Senate, that gets to a committee report, that gets to a committee hearing.  Now what in there... and you said it was not contested, so I guess the best source if it's not contested is his affidavit.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh.  Where does it say that?  He drafted legislation that was then introduced?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where does it say that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's wrong with this?  I found what you're talking about here.  It says in paragraph 13, contrary to what he says in his own evaluation, that Senator Dayton's staff, including Mr. Hanson... that's a little uncertain, what they mean by that... introduced a bill and drafted it.  Okay?  And then on paragraph 14 they say on November 15th, 2001, Mr. Hanson... just as you said... planned a Senate Government Affairs Committee meeting, selected hearing witnesses and prepared questions.  Now suppose that we did as the court, lower court wanted to do, say let's just see if that becomes relevant.  Because it's possible, given his other tasks that those two incidents, one on November 15th and the other, whenever help he gave to the drafting, had nothing to do with his being fired and nobody claims that.  So what they said is let's wait and see if that becomes relevant.  Now what's wrong with that solution?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Let's make an absurd case out of it which I'm trying to do a little bit to get you to focus on it.  Let's suppose he got fired because he didn't move the furniture properly.   ",06-618X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it could or couldn't be.  I mean, I mean if the legislator, the Senator, says, I think relevant to my dismissal of this individual is the individual's performance that revealed itself in a speech or debate that I gave in the House, and if that's relevant, then why isn't that the end of the case, they can't bring it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, all he'd have to say is it's relevant to my decision to fire the person.  Now, surely a jury or whoever... it's probably a jury matter, I guess, on this... is entitled to take that into account.  If it's something the jury is entitled to take into account, you are questioning what that Senator did in the speech or debate and you are questioning it in another place, namely, a court.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can we go back a step.  I just... you said this is appealable and your reason for it being appealable was because the statute itself... you said it was not appealable and the reason not is because the statute itself said that this has to be applied consistent with the Speech or Debate Clause?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's your reason.  So I take it, what about the reason that's been given, that this is an as-applied challenge instead of on its face?  What about that as a reason for it not being appealable?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no, I'm not asking about the argument you are making.  I want to ask about an argument you aren't making, that the reason... I'll ask about the one you are making in a second.  The reason I want to know about... I want to know about the other possible reason for not being appealed, namely that this is as applied and not on its face.  They don't strike down any provision.  What's your view about that one?   Stephen G. Breyer  That is correct.  And what you do about this case, what is it, Eichman?   Stephen G. Breyer  So then a holding of a district court in your opinion, the holdings say, imaginary, is that no one who actually works in an office of a Senator and who ever worked on any matter having to do with legislation falls within this Act because that would violate the speech and debate clause.  That would be quite major in its implication.  But you're saying there is no appeal on that because it's as applied.   Stephen G. Breyer  Does that mean if I go to your argument... I mean, the problem with your argument it seems to me is that that leaves no room for this appellate provision at law, because the only reason that anything is likely to be unconstitutional in this area, at least 99 percent of it, would be Speech or Debate Clause violation.  So in that interpretation of the statute there is no direct appeal, or hardly ever.   ",06-618X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose that you... and I have the same hypothetical for both you and your brothers on the other side with some adjustment here, because I'm finding the case quite difficult.  And the, the... for you, imagine we have some milk producers in Kentucky.  They are farmers.  And they go to the legislature and they say, you know, we can sell a lot more milk in Kentucky if you will pass a law imposing a tax on Missouri farmers who want to ship milk into Kentucky.  That's the classic unlawful... all right.  It's unlawful, unconstitutional, right.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, what is the difference if a city in Kentucky that wants to finance its schools says now to the legislature, we're going to find it easier to sell bonds in Kentucky or elsewhere, in Kentucky, for our school system if you'll only put a tax on similar bonds that Missouri is offering to finance their city schools?  That will help, just like the milk.  Now, what's the difference?   Stephen G. Breyer  We have consumers in the dairy products that are suffering loss.  They're all the voters in the States.  Everyone drinks milk.   Stephen G. Breyer  So they are suffering a dollar-for-dollar loss, because their milk becomes more expensive.  I don't know if that's analogous.  I think it's a pretty strong analogy.  As to the first, that's of course the point that's worrying me.  It is true that this is a public matter.   Stephen G. Breyer  Would it make a difference in the first case if it happened to be some dairy farmers who... there are so few in Massachusetts now, unfortunately, that they all work on State-owned dairy farms that are put up for, you know... does it make a difference?   Stephen G. Breyer  It would make a difference?   ",06-666X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Then of course you win as soon as we say the commodity is the same as milk.  Obviously to me you would, but that's the issue.  And in United Haulers what the question was, I thought, is if it is a traditional governmental function, anyway... say, like producing electricity, or cleaning the streets... there they discriminate and say you have to buy in State... well, it's different, and indeed it may be okay.  So what you've just heard your brother... brother argue is if this is a fortiori, because here it's not even making electricity; it's not even collecting trash; it is financing the most basically governmental of all governmental institutions... libraries, schools, streets.  Now, why isn't it a fortiori from United Haulers, given the nature of the task that they are raising the money to finance?   Stephen G. Breyer  You're arguing... but can a State do this?  It produces a service or product; it sells the service or product to in-State people at a price 50 percent less than it sells to out-of-State people.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, you're saying if the State owns cement, it can sell 50 percent less to its in-State citizens than out-of-State?   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  Then could it do this?  Could it say that if you buy cement from out of State, the answer is no, right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Suppose what they are selling is education?  Can the University of California say that when you send your child to the University of California, you will get a thousand dollars back on your income tax.  But if you send the child to an out-of-State school, you don't?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well if that's fine, then what they say is we sell you participation in the financing of the project.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if you buy... we sell you the participation.  It's called a bond, and if in fact you give the money to us, and you are in-State, you get a thousand dollars back.  But if in fact, when you do the identical thing, and you buy a similar thing from out-of-State, you do not get the money back?  How is that different from what you just said was okay in respect to the University of California?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm sorry, then I wasn't clear in the hypothetical.  The hypothetical was that you get a thousand-dollar rebate on your income tax.  So I was trying to make it exactly like this case.  You pay a lower State tax.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you have a perfectly good remedy in respect to that.  If the States don't like this race to the bottom, they need only create a compact or go to Congress.   Stephen G. Breyer  You know, I was only... I was only addressing your point that there was a practical problem.  Insofar as there is a practical problem, it seems to me the States have a perfectly good remedy even if they lose this case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or win the case, whatever.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  However.   Stephen G. Breyer  That argument cuts against you in context, I think.  You're saying in every case of any kind of discrimination one could go to Congress.  Absolutely right.  And since that's true of every case, now we are back to the more basic question, leaving the practicalities that you were talking about out of it, of whether this case is more like the cows.  Is it more like the garbage collection?   Stephen G. Breyer  Or is it on the far side of the garbage collection, even a stronger case for permission under the Commerce Clause?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's where I wanted you to begin.   ",06-666X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Would you say it's all right to use the model penal code definition of reckless, which is basically what you... taking it here, you would have to consciously disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the action is unlawful?   Stephen G. Breyer  If you come across anything that would use that, I mean ""reckless"" itself is unclear.  The model penal code tried to clarify it based on this Court's opinions primarily.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's the difference?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you said there is no way they couldn't have been conscious of the risk here.  I mean, after all, that's why they went to lawyers.  They know there's risk that this is unlawful.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But consciousness, I mean, maybe it should come in in the standard, but I don't know that that would help you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That isn't how the statute defines it.   Patricia A. Millett  --Excuse me?   Stephen G. Breyer  The statute says an adverse action is an increase in a charge for... in connection with underwriting.   Patricia A. Millett  But it also--   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what it says.  And then it says an increase is... and if you take an adverse action, i.e., if you increase it, and your increase is based in whole or in part on information contained in a consumer report, you have to send the thing.  How did you get... in your example, there was no increase.  I mean, in a charge.  In your salary, it's a decrease in the salary.  Same thing.   Patricia A. Millett  --The definition again on 3A includes not just increase, but includes an unfavorable change in the terms.  And so it's not settled whether--   Stephen G. Breyer  You mean unfavorable change in terms, unfavorable change in terms.   Patricia A. Millett  --Exactly.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, suppose you don't have, you don't have any terms because you never did it before.  There's no change in terms.   Patricia A. Millett  If you're a new customer... and again, I want to reiterate that, how this applies to existing accounts is complicated--   Stephen G. Breyer  You mean those words ""change in terms"" refer to rates, in other words?  That's a rather odd way to refer to it.  In one place, you refer to an ""increase""; in the other place, you'd refer to it as a ""change in terms"".  That's sort of an odd way to write a statute.   Patricia A. Millett  --Well, you can have a change in terms that is not necessarily an increase.  It could be you will no longer be entitled to a free rental car when your car is in for repair for some reason.  That's not an increase.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, I understand that.  But what we're after is this.  Everybody has a credit report, just about.  You put it in and you give people the best possible rate conceivable, and now, how do you know that maybe there could have still been a better rate?  And it can't be that the statute intends you to send out notices in such circumstances or you'd have to send notices whenever you read a credit report.  Now, I think that's, I've overstated slightly, but that's basically the argument.  So what's your response?   Patricia A. Millett  And Justice Breyer, my response is that if the content of the information in your credit report would have made you... had it been better information you'd have gotten a better rate, a better result, your pocketbook wouldn't have been hit as hard, you have a dollars and cents injury because of the content of the information, then you had an adverse action.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, so your response is just to repeat my question and say that's right?   Patricia A. Millett  No.  If I could continue on that, if I could add on, if I could add on, the way insurance companies work is they don't have 3 million customers and 3 million rates.  They have ranges and most of them will have a top tier.  They may have specialized things for employees, but putting aside a specialized category, there's a top range and they will tell you, as they say in the briefs, that 10 to 15 percent of people fit in there.  So they know what the best rate is.  They know what the next, above average rate, the standard rate.   ",06-84XX
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, how could that be?  I mean I agree that the statute is clear, but I think it's clear the other way.  That is, if you look at the language, as you've just heard, if you look at the purpose it's very hard to reconcile with the purpose an instance where a person has continuous accidents.  He's a reckless driver.  His insurance company puts him in just a category below the bottom and they read his credit report and they discover, despite his faults, he always pays his bills on time.  So they increase it, not to the top category, but they give him a much better deal.  And you're saying this statute means that what I just described is an adverse action based on a credit report?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Okay.  And then if you're going to say yes, I want to hear why yes, and then in light of the following: The little boy who says wolf.  You're probably puzzled what I mean by that.  I mean that if you're right in that interpretation, there will be tens of millions of notices going out and they'll have the same effect on the public that these privacy notices have today.  We get them every day, dozens of them, and they go right in the wastebasket, because they will become meaningless because to an average person that notice will not mean that he better look at his credit report.  It will mean throw it in the wastebasket.  All right, now I've got the purpose, I've got the language, and I have what I think of as common sense.  Now, you explain why it's obvious the opposite.   Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't explain it because if you have an increase in the charge based on race, of course that's an increase based on race.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if you refuse to give a person the best rate, and lower his rate but not the best rate, based on race, that is not an increase based on race.  That is discrimination based on race.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true, and it's a discrimination, but you didn't increase the rate.  You decreased it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's still a discrimination, it's still unlawful.   Stephen G. Breyer  Let me look at the language.  Go back to give me... because in ordinary English, which I hope I speak, it is not an increase, but maybe there is a technical term in the technical language of commercial law or in FTC law where the word increase means decrease.  And if you... is there anything you want... no.  It's a serious question, at least if you want to cite me to some authority that uses this word increase in the way you just suggested.   Stephen G. Breyer  Which dictionary shall I look at?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  By that you're talking linguistically, but I am interested in the purpose.  So I looked up on the Internet approximately what percent of the people have the best credit score and that's about 1 percent.  So 99 percent of the public doesn't have the best possible credit score.  Now I take it that means that you could in fact, if it's even roughly right, have 99 percent or a little less or even perhaps a little more when they look at that report that, since it's not perfect in 99 percent of the cases, it's quite possible that they won't get the best conceivable rate which might be reserved for just perfect people.  And if that's so, in 99 percent of the cases they'll send out notices.  And that's why I asked my question about the boy who calls wolf.  What will happen if 99 percent of the people who apply for insurance or any other thing get notices?  I suspect that this is only intuitive, that the notices are more likely to go into the wastebasket than they are if there was really a decrease.  Now, do you have any light you can shed on that?

He puts it in a bank deposit vault.  One day he takes all 500 diamonds and runs off to Martinique.  We catch him enjoying the sun.  We can sue him under (2), right?  That's what (2) is there for, right?  Right.  Okay.  Now, everything is the same except each of the thousand diamonds was put in individual safe deposit box with the participant's name on it.  Everything else is the same.  Why should it matter?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I'm sorry.  I'm not interested in that question.  I'm interested in my question.  Why isn't it available under (a)(2)?  In both cases, the trustee took 500 diamonds that belonged to the plan and went to Martinique.  Now, if you can sue him when the plans are all put in one big safe deposit box with the diamonds, why can't you sue him when they're put in 500 small safe deposit boxes?   Stephen G. Breyer  I want to go back to amend my example.  He only took one diamond.  It was a big vault he took it from... one diamond.  You still have the claim, right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's a big vault.  He took it from one big safe deposit box... one diamond.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, this is just there in the big vault.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, of course.  Well... no, no.  I'm going to, of course, ask you, since you seem to be turning this thing on how individualized this loss was, well, it was just one diamond, out of thousand.  Now obviously I'm going to ask you, because I haven't yet heard the answer... at least I didn't seem to hear it... what the difference is whether that one diamond came from a big vault or from one little safe deposit box with the participant's label on it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly, the same kind of loss.  And what we have here is the footnote that was alleged in... written in the opinion... we assume the defendant's conduct amounted to a breach of fiduciary duties.  So therefore all of the discussion you have, that maybe it didn't... well, maybe you're right.  But we better send it back so that they can decide that question.  And I just don't see what the other difference is.  It can't be a difference in the size of the diamond.  And people are saying, well, why... well, you see the question.   ",06-856X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's exactly my question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm going to let you answer this question--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --But I want you to work mine in if you can.  The problem that I'm having is what to say in the opinion.  Now, could I say this?  Firestone, yes, that's the way to put it as a standard.  You can also teach through example.  So I look at this case, I say: You want to know what that means, read the court of appeals opinion; it's perfect.  Okay?  So I've got Firestone... my opinion so far is two words: ""Firestone, perfect"".  Now, what do you want me to say other than that?   INTERRUPTING ",06-923X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But I don't know what to look to in trust law.  I mean, all that's happened here, every life insurance... every company, every life insurance company has the kind of conflict that you're talking about.  Every company has the kind of conflict you're talking about.  And an automobile company might make shoddy merchandise so it can make more money in the short run.  How does trust law keep that kind of conflict?  Now, it can't be and it isn't, because I've looked it up, I think, that trust law says that every distribution by a trustee whose own fee depends on the size of the trust is conflicted.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I doubt, since banks are trustees, I doubt but I'm not sure here... 3--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --that banks are trustees... suppose you were to say, look, the bank has an interest in maximizing the amount of money in its account and therefore every decision of a distribution of such trustee is subject to some special thing.  Now, the problem for me in this case is what in trust law do I analogize it to, not... I don't doubt for a second the 26 law professors, et cetera... though I do really sometimes, but not in this case.  [Laughter]  The... the... so what do I look to?  And where I ended up was I'd like an answer to what I asked the other side.  I ended up, I can't do better than Firestone, I ought to write two words in this opinion, and the standard, perfect; from the opinion below, perfect.  You want to know what I mean, read the opinion below.  Okay?  Now, what's your view on all of that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I overstated.   Stephen G. Breyer  Take the examples that I gave.  It's an ordinary insurance policy.   Stephen G. Breyer  But that's, you see, their point.  Their point is this is just an ordinary insurance company, an ordinary policy, and it's really like a bank that's a trustee that in fact takes money that hasn't been distributed and puts it on its own account.  They make money for that, from that.  So there is a conflict.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You have that kind of conflict.  What do you say about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  The bank makes its money by putting money in an account, paying interest and lending it at more money.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, and Chase Manhattan bank has $14 trillion in trust accounts, and if they just put in for three days money into an interest-bearing account and lend it out for 5 minutes, they will make $1 billion.  Okay.  You see, they are finding these kinds of conflicts everywhere.  And that's what I'm asking you.  What I think if I were to add something I'd say, look at this carefully, judge, look at it carefully; but if all you find is an ordinary insurance company doing ordinary work and there is no ground for suspicion, proceed to step two.  What about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, is there an example in trust law where, say, a bank's a trustee and they self-insure in some area?  Is there ever a case in trust law that found that to be a conflict.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean, you can easily transpose this to other... trusts are run by banks often that are trustees.  They're huge, and they might self-insure in simple... in certain circumstances, in which case you reproduce something like the conflict that's at issue here.  And so--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --And I think that... my guess, but I don't know.  That's why I'm so nervous.  Is there any example where that kind of thing has ever been held to be a conflict of interest?   Stephen G. Breyer  Then what analogy?  I agree with your basic point.  If I encapsulate it, you may or may not agree with my encapsulation.  This reminds me a lot of the argument between Learned Hand and Felix Frankfurter under what ""substantial evidence"" meant.  And like Learned Hand, your side, I think, or the first argument, wants to find an absolute standard, a perfect analogy, which Frankfurter said you can't do.  Very well.  What's worrying me is what is the analogy?  Because you're not saying it's just conflict-of-interest law.  You are analogizing it to a trustee who himself is a remainderman.  And it's at that point that I begin to get off this boat because I'm not sure that's the right analogy.  Now, you've looked through lots of cases.  Your colleague knows it better than you, and he hasn't come up with something that's a better analogy.  But do you see what's bothering me?  So, therefore I'm back where I started: Two-sentence, two-word opinion.  We did our best in Firestone and this decision below is a good illustration of how to do it.  What can you add to what I just said?   INTERRUPTING ",06-923X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But you couldn't put in... you are authorized to sell the bicycle pedals that I have patented only if you impose a restriction that will tell the bicycle user that he must send me a check for $15 in addition to whatever he pays you.  That sounds unlawful under contract law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or you are going to have... I mean, there's a doctrine that you cannot impose equitable servitude's upon chattel.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's a contract law doctrine.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  My thought is that the reason that these things are important and you can't just draft your way around them is because there are antitrust doctrines, there are contract-law doctrines, that also limit in significant ways what you can and cannot write into a contract.   ",06-937X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, there's a reason, I guess, that would be so.  Imagine that I want to buy some bicycle pedals, so I go to the bicycle shop.  These are fabulous pedals.  The inventor has licensed somebody to make them, and he sold them to the shop, make and sell them.  He sold them to the shop.  I go buy the pedals.  I put it in my bicycle.  I start pedaling down the road.  Now, we don't want 19 patent inspectors chasing me or all of the other companies and there are many doctrines in the law designed to stop that.  One is the equitable servitudes on chattel.  Another is the exhaustion of a patent.  And now you talk about implied license.  I would say, why does it make that much difference?  What we're talking about here is whether after those pedals are sold to me under an agreement that the patent... you know, you have a right to sell them to me... why can't I look at this as saying that patent is exhausted, the patent on the pedals and the patent for those bicycles insofar as that patent for the bicycles says I have a patent on inserting the pedal into a bicycle.  Call it exhaustion, call it implied license.  Who cares?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Ah, but I thought--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.  Of course, I think the answer to that is no, probably no, but, but, but, but.  Now you can clarify this because I may be off on a wrong track.  I thought we're talking about using the sold item in those mechanisms which account for virtually almost the only logical use of the sold item.  Thus, if you took the bicycle blanks... not the bicycle blanks; they are eyeglass blanks.  I'm mixed up between bicycles and eyeglasses, there we are.  But if you took the eyeglass blanks and you use them for the purpose of growing plants instead of inserting them into eyeglasses, I guess we'd have had a different case.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I take it here they are using those chips in those mechanisms that the chips are almost exclusively designed for and there isn't much else to use them for.  Am I right or wrong?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, now if it should be protected... and here I'm not sure I'm understanding it, so correct me.  Let's suppose we have this contract.  So everything is identical except we've got my bicycle example in here because I'm more comfortable with that.  I know how to ride a bicycle and I don't know how to work the chips.  So what I do--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But you see the analogy I'm making.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what I do I go to the shop and I buy this, this mechanism with the pedals on it, and then I insert it in my bicycle.  Now, actually I need help in doing that, but I do it.  Okay.  Now I start pedaling off, and now what is it for all these things here that would stop that original inventor from catching me and hauling me into court, and say, what you've done, Breyer, is you've put my... my mechanism here in this bicycle and I happen to have a patent on the system.  And now you start talking to me about, well, the patent was exhausted on the bicycle--   Stephen G. Breyer  --pedals, but not on the system.   Stephen G. Breyer  And you agree that shouldn't happen.   Stephen G. Breyer  But if I follow you and I write an opinion just for you, what stops it from happening?   Stephen G. Breyer  Then why isn't it in your case?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why doesn't it mean that?  Why isn't it in your case equally?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You mean that they just got it all wrong?  You mean it should be that they got it wrong?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, so if I go in the bicycle shop, I go in the bicycle shop and I buy the pedals and then they give me, you know, one of these pieces of paper that has all of the 42,000 words on it and there in these 42,000 words it says, and now you are put on notice that once you put it in your bicycle and you pedal away, they're going to get you and you're going to be hauled into Patent Court, then... then that's okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  Then explain... now this you might know because it's just following up on what Justice Souter said better than I did.  I think from these briefs I've gotten the impression that at least some people think that where you invent a component, say, like the bicycle pedals, and it really has only one use, which is to go into a bicycle, it's the easiest thing in the world to get a patent not just on that component but to also get a patent on the system, which is called handlebars, body, and pedals.  And since that's just a drafting question, all that we would do by finding in your favor is to destroy the exhaustion doctrine, because all that would happen, if it hasn't happened already, is these brilliant patent lawyers, and they don't even... they can be great patent lawyers, not just fine lawyers, and just draft it the way I said and that's the end of the exhaustion doctrine.  And that's why it is preferable to say it is exhausted.  What is exhausted?  One, the patent on this component and, two, the patent on any system involving this component where that system is the only reasonable use of the component, rather than using the terminology ""implied license"".  Now, I think that's an argument that's being made in some of these briefs, and if so I'd like to you reply.   INTERRUPTING ",06-937X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Say: Speak, go ahead, speak, speak.  Just not on our nickel.   Stephen G. Breyer  And they also say... by the way, that you answer this, I'd keep this in mind... you may be right about it being too much of an administrative burden, the treble damages et cetera, but they've made major concessions here, and they say that's a matter to be worked out on remand.  And it may be that they have to be very careful about inhibiting your speech.  So let's go back over those administrative provisions one by one.  They are suggesting to us, as I read it, don't do that now.   Stephen G. Breyer  If you have... you have a park service of the State and have you a hotdog stand there, it runs the hotdogs, it's private, but the State pays for everything.  The State pays for everything.  And it happens that, in the grant, they have no place for talking about the union.  You're saying they are required to add to the legislation, a special grant, so that the employer can speak of the union?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  Because they say here we are talking about 100 percent money that comes out of the State treasury and all we are saying is use that money for the State purposes, and those purposes do not include talking one way or the other about the union.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Would your answer be the same if... if... and I hide contrary to fact, perhaps, that a magic administrative scheme were invented so that there was no administrative problem, we could identify with the greatest of ease each penny that came from a State and which did not?  And then the State said, you know, we do have a policy here.  We actually favor labor unions in our State, and some other State might have a different policy.  But we think it best that the State officials involved when their company... when their department is being organized, to say nothing.  We think it best that the employers that we pay a hundred percent to, given their... their strong funding by the State, that they got to find some money elsewhere, and those we pay 50 percent to better use the private money, not use our money.  Now, no administrative burden whatsoever, but that's the policy.  Now, is there some rule or statute that would make that unlawful or pre-empted that policy?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, on all these things which I think they are asking us on the other side to leave for another day, none of them exist.  They all work perfectly.  It's only the magic system has been developed to, without any extraneous burden, segregate the State money from the non-State money.  And the only rule is don't use the State money when you speak.  That's the only rule.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  By the way, other states have exactly opposite rules, they are right-to-work states.  They give you extra State money.  So... but one State has this rule and--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Ah, well, if it's a very different case, then why aren't they right to say this is a facial challenge, leave that very different case which raises all the issues to be worked out when we discover whether this is--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Is my right-to-work example equally... equally pre-empted?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, they could not say in Utah, to take a State at random, the... here we have government grants and there's overhead, and we would like you to spend this overhead; indeed, you're certainly free to spend this overhead in speaking as much as you want, should there be an organizing campaign.  Don't worry about spending the government part.  Can they do that?  You say no, they couldn't?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.   INTERRUPTING ",06-939X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So you did on that point on page 27 and 25 and 29 of the ""A F L C I O> [=AFL-CIO] brief, I took the statements there, where it would say <organizations"", namely organizations, even those that receive a hundred percent of their money from the State are free to use their profits?   Stephen G. Breyer  If there are any, or any other non-state moneys they had?   Stephen G. Breyer  So if you sell them tables and they write you a check, the State, for the tables, at that point the check is yours?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is your recommendation as to... we've heard today, too, in the briefs it's there, I put the thing that I've heard as... well, the example with the tables is an example of it.  When does the profit actually accrue?  Is there treble damage provision that makes this much worse?  Are there administrative requirements that in practice make it impossible?  Is it administered in such a way that the employee we heard about would just not know what to say, the employer's representative?  All those things could be problems, and you say, well, they haven't been dealt with yet.  And your recommendation as to what we should do is what?   Stephen G. Breyer  And if we did that, how would all these problems be worked out?  I mean, how would the arguments that you... they think are far too burdensome, you think they are not and can be done properly, how does that get worked out?   ",06-939X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I thought--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I thought the question... and I apologize if I'm not paraphrasing it because I have my own.  This has arisen frequently.  Brussels has a treaty, and that treaty binds all the member nations, and supreme courts of various nations have come up against this problem: What would happen if the Brussels court or the EU court insists under the treaty that we do something that violates our own Constitution?  I think this is an example of that.  And the answer typically has been: Well, we'd follow our own Constitution, at least if it was a violation, what the EU said, of fundamental human rights or destroyed some basic structural part of our Constitution.  And the question that I would have is, doesn't that kind of approach... not exactly but that kind of approach... satisfy whatever problem there is in this respect here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If the ICJ were to do something which it had never done, like, say, put everybody in jail for 50 years... I don't know that there is such a thing... but suppose they did, if they did, I guess that might violate something basic in our Constitution, in which case we wouldn't enforce it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If we took that approach--   ",06-984X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe you could spend a minute explaining that, because, as I read the Constitution, it says all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every State... I guess it means including Texas...--  [Laughter]  --shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.  Now, as I understand it, the United States entered into a treaty.  That treaty said we will follow the interpretations and the judgments of the International Court of Justice in respect to the Vienna Convention.  And that Court did make a judgment in that respect, in respect to this client, and it said: Our judgment is that Texas, or someone in the United States, must redo the procedural hearing simply to see whether, in deciding whether there's prejudice or whether there's a procedural default, full account is taken of the importance of the Vienna rights.  That's what we're talking about.  It's a judgment of the court.  The United States has promised to follow that judgment of the court.  The Constitution says, since it promised by treaty, that is the law; and the law binds the States.  That may be simple-minded, but I'd like to hear what the answer to that, rather, chain of logic is... chain of law.   Stephen G. Breyer  I was not talking--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --about the President's memorandum at the moment.  And to be... to disclose fully what I'm thinking, I'm thinking that maybe if a president disagreed in such a thing, some kind of a question... I'm not sure what... would be presented.  But whatever ""what"", I don't worry about that ""what"" here, because the President, too, agrees.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, forget whether we recognize it this way as a judgment.  I'm saying we promised in the treaty to follow that thing.  Call it whatever name you want.  We promised to follow that thing, which I have in front of me... excerpts of which... called an Avena something.  And we know what that says.  I'm just looking to see what they call it.  They call it... well, you tell me what they call it.  They call it... it is not called the word ""judgment"".  It's called:  ""The appropriate reparation in this case consists of the obligation of the United States to. ""  --and then they listed it.  So I take it we have promised to carry out that obligation by treaty.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What are the words that the Senate said?  Because, when you say ""self-executing"", the easiest way for me to understand that is the Constitution means what it says.  But there happened to be a few instances where the nature of the obligation or the intent of the party makes it very difficult to enforce it as a binding judgment of a court.  That is not this case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, and so if they did that, now, will you quote the words or give me the reference where the Senate said: Although we entered into this and although we ratify it, we're not going to do it--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --unless you--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Fine.  Then, are you saying there are... there are 112, I believe, treaties in which we've entered into promises that we're going to follow what an international tribunal said.  Somebody looked up, I saw on the Internet, that at this moment there are approximately 116 regulatory entities in the world where we've entered, or others have entered into, regimes, where there are various adjudicatory tribunals of different kinds, mostly commercial, that bind us.  And is your view: All of these thousands, perhaps, or hundreds, anyway, of treaties are unlawful, and that our promises are not enforceable, because there's a constitutional question?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I'm thinking that are self-executing.  I'm thinking that there are... like WTO, NAFTA.  We can go down a long list of instances where the United States has promised to follow the decisions of tribunals that are not Article III courts and to put them into effect at once.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I wonder, without further ado, now, are you saying that all those are unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  ""Yes"" or ""no""?  I'd appreciate a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm sorry.  What I don't understand about this is that I thought that the ICJ in this case interpreted the treaty.  That's not Federal law.  That's the treaty.  And it said that the treaty--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Oh, then I don't understand you because the WTO interprets a treaty.  It interprets a treaty that binds the United States, just like the ICJ is interpreting a treaty that binds the United States.  So what's the difference?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe these other nations have an inquisitorial system where an investigating judge collects a dossier and the fact is noted in the dossier and the investigating judge and the prosecution give it such weight as it's entitled to.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You know that doesn't happen?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In an--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Of course it matters.  But the... of course it matters.  That's why when I read the... the ICJ opinion, I read it as saying that they're not telling you to set aside a procedural default rule.  What they've asked you to do is to provide, by means of the United States' own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences by taking account of the violation of rights.  And throughout they ask... when you decided whether the person was really prejudiced, when you decided whether there had been forfeiture of the rights, at that time, did you ask yourself that the reason he might not have raised them was because he knew nothing about them and his lawyer knew nothing about them, because nobody ever told either about them?  In which case there might be a causal connection.  As I read it, the ICJ left all that up to you but just asked you, please, look at it again having read our opinion and keeping this in mind.   Stephen G. Breyer  And how does the WTO differ?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How does the WTO and NAFTA and all our trade agreements differ?   Stephen G. Breyer  If you assume it is self-executing, just for one second, I'd like to find out... you said that the President was unreasonable in a sense of saying Texas do that over again... I assume the reason he asked Texas to have the hearing is because the ICJ knew... and I guess maybe he knew... that the only hearing they'd had on this subject... as far as I can see; I looked at it, there didn't seem to be any evidence in respect to their finding that there was no prejudice.  They said well, he had a lawyer, but that lawyer later got into quite a lot of trouble, I think.   Stephen G. Breyer  He had two lawyers.  One got into trouble, and the other didn't?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, they vigorously defended him.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  My point is there's no evidence of that.   Stephen G. Breyer  There is?  In the first habeas hearing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I read the whole thing.   Stephen G. Breyer  What I'm thinking of is the evidence at the first habeas hearing that led the district judge to reach his conclusion that there was no prejudice and that the procedural default was not excused... it's in that hearing that I didn't see what that finding was based on; and I suppose the reason that the President wanted Texas to do it is it would be easiest for Texas to go back to that.   Stephen G. Breyer  It was in the first hearing.   Stephen G. Breyer  So you think there was no reason for the ICJ to ask the President--   Stephen G. Breyer  --And what did happen to the lawyers Texas gave him?   INTERRUPTING ",06-984X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  On that point... the reason I think you're... there's a little chaos here is because you said... your question is phrased, does the FAA preclude enforcement of your arbitration agreement?  And you're going to say: We answer that question, no, it doesn't preclude it.   Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't require it; it doesn't preclude it.  But then would we have to go back and say what is the source?  There has to be some source of law that authorizes this contractual agreement, and there could be two possible sources.  And my question here is, is it clear that in fact either of these two sources does?  The first source is State law.  I gather the difficulty is that the State of Oregon has an act just like the Federal Arbitration Act, so we'd have to ask the Oregon courts: Is this a legitimate contract under Oregon State law.  The alternative source of law is the Federal judge's case management authority.  And there we have a statute which clearly gives the judge some kind of authority, but not for your case because your case exceeds the jurisdictional amount.  Therefore, in the absence of that statute, is there inherent authority in the district judge?  Now, I don't know the answer to either of those questions.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  My temptation is to say they're open questions and they'd have to be argued on remand, which makes this case the case of the century, I guess, in a certain respect.  It's quite a difficult case.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Well, in a certain area.  I overstate.  But the... is there any light you can shed on those two questions, or is there some third possible source of law?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Have you ever argued that this is a matter governed by Oregon law and it is enforceable?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Have you ever argued that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, under Oregon law.  Have you ever argued Oregon law?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then it's not surprising they haven't argued that Oregon law doesn't apply.   ",06-989X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's why just what you said is actually what's worrying me about the case.  Because what Justice Ginsburg said makes me think that there could be situations, a lot of situations, where Federal judges do want to peel the case off.  And you say send it to a master.  Maybe some would lend themselves to a master; maybe some wouldn't.  I have no idea.  And are we going to have to hold in this case whether a judge or when a judge, a Federal judge, does or does not have authority to do such a thing?  That's why I say... I was actually thinking the case of the century, because it's going to take a hundred years to finish.  But the fact is there are those issues there once we say Section 9 doesn't apply.  Then you're going to have to say... suppose we were to say it's just State law.  Well, suppose the State doesn't allow enforcement of this kind of contract?  Then we have the question of the authority... of the inherent authority, not statutory, of a Federal district judge to peel off bits of cases and decide them in different ways.  I don't know the answer to those questions, but I think they are quite important.  So what do I do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, no, because there is a holding in the whole Ninth Circuit, which accounts for a large percent of the country, that the district judge can't do this.  And that's quite a significant holding in that circuit, and we ought to review that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, if there is, then let's think... suppose that in the middle of a trial, the parties say, judge, this is so complicated factually, we have a way that we can get an agreed statement of facts.  They walk out the door; they have a friend who has a sign called arbitrator; and they come away from that friend with an agreed statement of facts, which they agree to submit to the judge to apply the law.  Now, there is nothing wrong with that, I imagine.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We know... I'm sorry.  I'm not even going to tell the judge how I find this.  I go to a crystal ball; I go to any way I want.  I will come in with an agreed statement of facts, and is there anything, if we have that agreed statement of facts, that would will stop the judge from saying I take this agreed statement of facts; there's a difference about how the law applies to it; I will resolve this case?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, no... I just say... well, I'll ask you the next question.  I take the answer to the first question is there's nothing wrong with that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm sorry.  I thought that, if in fact parties come in with an agreed statement of fact in a case, I've never seen a situation where the judge couldn't say, fine, I agree; that's the... the judge would say I'm sorry, even though you agree, I insist that you go to trial and?   Stephen G. Breyer  He can?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right, so there are public policy limitations.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, is there anything wrong here?  My question basically, obviously, is, is there anything wrong in this case if they had come in with an agreed statement of fact?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  I'm trying to get to my question; I'm not asking it very well.  What they agreed to is an agreed statement of facts, subject to Section 9 standards, Section 9 and 10.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What I'm driving at, whether I've asked it well or not--   Stephen G. Breyer  --is is how is it any different from coming in with an agreed statement of facts?   Stephen G. Breyer  Has that been a nightmare... has it been the nightmare you suggest in labor arbitration?  Because I think labor arbitration falls outside the act, doesn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  And has that turned into some kind of terrible nightmare where there are dozens of rules and they have a long complicated labor set of regulations on it?  I don't think so, but has it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if we run that pretty well, why wouldn't you run this pretty well--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --given a back-up, looking at it as a default?   ",06-989X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  How does -- how does this work in an ordinary case?  I should know the answer to this, but I don't.  It's a very elementary question.  Jones sues the president of Coca-Cola.  His claim is the president personally put a mouse in the bottle.  Now, he has no reason for thinking that.  Then his lawyer says: Okay, I'm now going to take seven depositions of the president of Coca-Cola.  The president of Coca-Cola says: You know, I don't have time for this; there's no basis.  He's -- he's -- I agree he's in good faith, but he's -- there is no basis.  Okay, I don't want to go and spend the time to answer a question.  Where in the rules does it say he can go to the judge and say, judge -- his lawyer will say -- my client has nothing to do with this; there's no basis for it; don't make him answer the depositions, please?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where does it say that in the rules?   Stephen G. Breyer  In Rule 8?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I thought Rule 8 was move for a more definite statement.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He shows a plausible entitlement.  He says -- there's no doubt it's a claim if the president of Coca-Cola did put the mouse in the bottle.  It's just there is no basis for thinking that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So he wants to go to the judge and say: I've set out a claim here; I copied it right out of the rules.  All right?  Now, what allows the judge to stop this deposition?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm sorry, I just don't have the answer to my question.  I must not have said it properly.  Imagine, way before Twombly -- these rules have been in existence for decades.  So we go back years ago.  Certainly, there have been many cases where, for whatever reasons, the plaintiffs included allegations that were just factually very unlikely.  I want to know where the judge has the power to control discovery in the rules.  That's -- I should know that.  I can't remember my civil procedure course.  Probably, it was taught on day 4.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I see that.  It says a person has a right to go and get discovery.  It doesn't say they only control it under certain provisions which don't seem to me to apply to the truly absurd discovery.  There must be some power a judge has.  And the second question I'm going to ask you, when you tell me what that power is, which apparently I'm not going to find out -- but -- but whatever that power is, which must be there, why doesn't that work to solve your problem?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what -- I mean, my basic question, which I really want to hear the answer to, is the Attorney General is very busy and what he does is very important.  The president of Coca-Cola is very busy.  The president of General Motors is very busy -- and very busy at the moment.  And what he ----  [Laughter]  What they are doing is very important.  There are quite a few people in this country who aren't even in the government, and what they do is very important and they are very busy.  And so if there is something in these rules that allows people to bring suits without any factual foundation, even though the -- the complaint says there is--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'll bet those people are being harassed--   Stephen G. Breyer  And the reason you can't make this argument under 26(b)(2)(C) is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The judge there is supposed to weigh burdens versus desirability of going forward.  And so why don't you make this argument right at that point?  If you are right you win; if not, you lose.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that's also true, I guess, of complaints, and every other legal question.   ",07-1015
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why -- why isn't the protection -- I have the number of the rule I want.  Maybe I am not understanding it.  But Rule 26(e)(2), says -- says, among other things, that the judge can change the number of depositions you get.  He could reduce them to zero if, for example, he decides the burden or the expense outweighs the likely benefit.  Can't he do that whether you are the president of Coca -- Cola or whether you are the president of Ford or whether you are the President, or you are the Attorney General?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can he do that or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, he can.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, but they didn't -- that isn't what 96 says.  What 96 says, which I think is important, is it says that they knew of and agreed to subject the plaintiffs to these harsh conditions solely on account of their religion, race, and national origin, and for no legitimate penological interest.  Because, if they are looking for suspects from 9/11, given the people they found, it's not surprising that they might look for people who looked like Arabs.  All right?  That isn't surprising to me, because that was what the suspects looked like.  So, they want to say, yes, that was part of it, but it's not for no legitimate penological interest; it was for every good reason: We didn't want more bombs to go off.  Now, suppose that's their view.  Suppose also -- I'm just hypothetically -- they never, and they know this, ever had a conversation where they said, go look for people of Arabic descent alone.  They never said that.  They said, look for those people who have other connections and had something we reasonably believe is 9/11-connected; they might be dangerous.  Suppose that's what they thought.  So they read this, and they think, Judge, I want to tell Judge that you have no evidence to show anything other than what I just said, which sounds as if it might be reasonably connected to the 9/11 investigation.  What is open to our two defendants, if you win this case?  If they're right, how do they prevent lots of depositions from coming in and taking their time?  How do they prevent this case dragging on and taking their time?  If the facts are what I just said, rather than what you think?   Stephen G. Breyer  They'll -- they'll deny the facts; then you'll say there's a factual matter.  And suppose hypothetically -- not what you think -- but you have no reason at all hypothetically, imagine, for believing that they did this solely for racial reasons unrelated to the investigation of 9/11.  Suppose you don't have any information that shows that, and they are going to say everything else is covered by qualified immunity, and you have nothing else.  Then what do they do to get out of 10 years of discovery?   INTERRUPTING ",07-1015
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I can imagine you could have a grain mill and they have lots and lots of grain absolute identical one to the other.  And the farmer takes his grain up and they operate on it, and then he drives away with the grain, milled.  Now, it may make no difference to anybody whether the identical molecules are the same; and I think in such a case you'd say they are processing it; they are not buying and selling it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You are saying if we have that, in fact, if the -- if the exact situation, if some farmers up in North Dakota send their grain just to be milled -- it's their grain -- up in Canada, and they come back, and it -- you know, it may not be the identical molecule, but it's identically the same; they have done this for 100 years -- now suddenly this -- the Commerce Department is going to say, that's a sale, and the antidumping statutes apply?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, would it or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  I agree with you, and I just wonder, what I would like to know, is if any businessman involved in any of these or related things before this decision of the Commerce Department would have thought that that is how the Commerce Department would have treated such a transaction?   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know.  I'm asking -- the question is the same as the last case, to me: Not whether they could have done it; sure they could have done it.  My question is based on my question of whether they had a rule that any reasonable person would have thought that is how they treated it--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Because after all, you have three precedents in related areas, not the direct area but in related areas, that suggest that they wouldn't have treated the millers that way.   Stephen G. Breyer  You know what, I'm thinking of those things, they're something called ""tollers"".  I don't know exactly what tollers are.  They seem to be like people who give haircuts.  They're sort of servicers of some kind.  They're talking about tollers and -- and subcontractors.  And that is a related area.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What -- what do we do about the question that is bothering me?  Maybe at some point -- maybe it's not a relevant question -- but I will assume for the sake of argument Commerce does have the power to classify it either way.  What is bothering me, and maybe that's not in this case, is that as the -- as your brother lawyer just said, this statute has been around for 90 years.  There has been trillions of dollars worth of foreign commerce during that time.  Yet I don't find cited here any instance in which Commerce ever before said that when you have title to a good, and you send it abroad, for even a big change in it, and then it comes back, that that is a sale.  Now, I might -- I don't know all the Commerce cases; maybe they did.  But what I found here is like a blank on that side, and on the other side the tolling cases, Florida Power & Light, the pizza case, to the point where I thought, if I was a lawyer advising a client, and that client said if I keep title to the good, am I home free, I would have to say, yes, you are.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now that's the -- the question I want responded to in the legal context of, has Commerce made a significant change in its policy?   Stephen G. Breyer  And I read -- at what page do I find all these cases?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, roughly.  I'll find it.  I will find it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But I will see a lot of cases where--   INTERRUPTING ",07-1059
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That is pretty important.  Tell me -- this is a hard area, obviously.  But the -- imagine -- think of all the toller cases that they've had.  Now -- now, is this right: That in every one of those cases there were two companies, A and B; and in every one of those cases A sells a finished product into the United States.  And also A sends the product to B to have some major thing done on it.  In every one of those cases the Commerce Department could say: We can take A as a Respondent; i.e. we think A might violate the law, because maybe it's an Italian company, or we think B might violate the law.  Is that true of all those cases?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, if it's true of all those cases, then I think what the opposite position is, what Mr. Farr said, I think -- I think, you know, I will -- he will say: Look at page 40 and 41 of their brief.  When I look at those pages, I am going to see a lot of cases.  And I bet, when I look them up, those Commerce cases are all going to use the word ""substantial transformation"".  And he will say: You see, that's what they did here.  Then he's going to add -- I don't mean to put words in his mouth if the words are wrong, but -- but he's going to add: Look at those tolling cases.  Those are all cases where Commerce had a choice of which to consider the sale.  It could have considered the sale from the processor A to -- to B to A, the sale if it wanted to; or it could have considered the sale into the United States if it had wanted to, to be the sale for purposes of calculating the price.  And so in choosing between those two, either of which it could have chosen, it chose the latter sale, the final sale, because that's how they could calculate the price.  But in your case there is no such person A, because the utilities are not people who could be respondents.  I mean they are not in the same position.  There is no sale onwards that they could choose.  So we will go to the other guy, the party -- the person who does the processing.  Are you following what I am saying?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And what is the answer to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  But, remember, they are saying in the tolling cases, in my words: Hey, we could have gone after the processor if we wanted--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --if there had been a substantial transformation, because the key to this concept of ""sale"" is the word ""substantial"" transformation.   Stephen G. Breyer  In which--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Is there any point in time from the time that the -- the processors get ahold of the uranium until the time it leaves their control that if they went bankrupt, anyone other than the utility could get ahold of the product?

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But Blankman -- that isn't the concern.  The concern is simply this, if they're correct: That this whole trial revolves around whether this individual is suffering post-traumatic stress disorder with -- with these amphetamines.  They have two expert witnesses who say that he's in very bad shape, everything the defense wanted them to say.  That's it.  That's their evidence.  On cross, the prosecutor gets both of them to admit that they're basing their testimony on what the defendant told them about his drug use.  At which point the prosecutor says, let's talk to Mr. Roby, who is the arresting officer, did you see he was on -- when you arrested him, was he on -- did he look like he was on drugs?  No.  Let's talk to Mr. Flynn.  When you processed him, did he look like he was on drugs?  And then let's talk to Ms. Blankman, okay?  So, now the case is submitted, and at that point the prosecutor says, there is no evidence that he was on drugs; he said that to those two expert witnesses, and it's baloney.  There's your case.  Now, in fact in the files is evidence that Mr. Roby, that very day of the crime and the next day, sent out all-points bulletins saying he was a dangerous drug user.  There is evidence in the files that Mr. -- that the FBI man sent out similar all-point bulletins.  There are three witnesses who have described the behavior on the day as frenzied, and we have heard the descriptions.  And you're saying that the lawyer, the trained lawyer for the government, who knew this information and knew the defense just what?  Just overlooked it by accident?  Just what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He also had cross-examined the two expert witnesses in order to show that they didn't really know that this man was a drug user, because their only basis for that was he told them.  So as I've read these briefs, I've come away -- including yours -- with a strong impression that this was a relevant issue, that the prosecution did not concede that he was on drugs at the time of the murder.  Indeed, that that was all that was at issue.  And so I just don't see, like Justice Souter, how you can say that this wouldn't at least be useful information if -- even for cross-examination, and I think more than that since you have three direct witnesses.  But leaving that aside, there's another part of this case that equally bothers me.  It seems to me there was a lawyer for the State here that twice told the courts that this matter had never been raised.  Is that so?  Or maybe he said that the courts had decided it, because the State has taken absolutely inconsistent positions, first saying that the trial courts decided it, and they did decide it, but by accident.  They thought that paragraph 41 referred to this claim when it referred to an earlier claim.  So first they tell the courts -- and you wouldn't know that unless you are pretty familiar because there were a lot of words written.  They tell the courts: It's been decided, judge.  Don't worry.  They decided it -- adequate State ground.  Then next they wake up to the fact that it wasn't decided, and then they announce: Oh, he waived it, despite the fact that there's a case called Swanson in Tennessee that says that you can raise a later claim if you have grounds for not knowing of it in the first place.  And he didn't know of it until 1993.  So I see the State taking opposite positions and -- and what seems from the briefs inconsistent with the State law, and I'm confused.  What is it that happened in this case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, ""waiver"" -- my goodness.  First, I don't think it's impossible to say 41 that make absolutely clear that they aren't waiving it.  He is raising it.  Then, aside from that, the paragraph of the district -- of the court of appeals' opinion says they were already decided or waived.  So it's ambiguous, at best, for you.  So let's go back and see what the State district court held, and I think that the State district court held that it had been decided, not that it had been waived.  Am I right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So there are cases in this Court which say if a State appeals court writes a matter -- something -- a sentence that is ambiguous so you don't know whether it was decided -- for example, they mean it was waived or mean that it was decided -- then the next best thing to do, which makes sense, is look to the lower court to see what they actually did.  So we follow that rule, and we get to exactly what Justice Alito said: That what they did was they were holding that this has already been decided.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Don't you think at this point the Petitioner is saying in his briefs: I've been getting the runaround.  First, they tell me it's one thing; then they tell me another.  All I can tell you is this: No one has ever passed on the merits of this Brady claim, which is a substantial claim.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you choose the procedures, but be sure that that's the outcome.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Could the explanation of this language in the opinion be due to the fact that the State first argued that it had already been decided; then in later courts the State changed its theory and announced that it had been waived?

Breyer  Well, what are the facts that suggest that he thought he was free to terminate that encounter with the police?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  I would say we've held a lot that that's just beside the point.  If you stop a car for a traffic stop, you can search it for all kinds of things.  You can do all kinds of things not related.  So if that's what they're relying on, I suspect that that's not right, that it had to do with a different subject matter.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I was lawfully stopped.  All right.  Go ahead.  I want to get all of them in front of me.   Stephen G. Breyer  The question is, how did she do that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  She said,  ""You can leave whatever time you want? ""   Stephen G. Breyer  No.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you're standing there and the policeman is in front of you, and they have stopped the car, and the woman who is the policeman says, I want to search you.  Do you think you're free to leave?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, then.  So now we have got two of them.  What's the third?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, it was on the highway.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It was in an urban area.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're stopped in an urban area.  The policeman says you are stopped, and you are stopped lawfully.  Will you get out of the car?  Yes.  The policeman begins to search for the -- the gun.  Fine.  You think you're free to leave?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's the fourth?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's the fourth?  I just want to get them all out here.  Is there anything else?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So, what they say is a reasonable person would have found -- felt that he could just say good-bye, and he would have felt this even though the car was stopped lawfully, she asked him to get out of the car, and she began to search him for a gun.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I -- can we not reverse that?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm saying if the question is whether the person reasonably thought at the time of the search he could leave, there's certainly a strong claim here that he could not reasonably or he did not reasonably think he could leave.  As long as that is so, the issue in front of us is when you stop a person, a policeman in the course of your duties, and that person thinks that he cannot reasonably leave, and you believe reasonably that he's armed, can you pat him down?  Well, asked that way, certainly a strong argument, the answer is yes, if you don't want to be killed.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose we go beyond.  I mean, once we go beyond, I become a little at sea as to what the answers are because policemen do things other than investigate crime.  A policeman is on protective duty.  The individual he is protecting is approached by a member of the Crips gang who has a bulge in his pocket.  Can the police, with reasonable grounds to think that that person is armed, pat down that person?  Or is he supposed to wait until the gun comes out of the pocket and the person who is being protected is shot?  A policeman is on a bridge.  Somebody stops the car in the middle of the bridge.  Traffic is held up in all directions.  The policeman goes to try to remove the car from the bridge.  In the back seat is a member of the Crips gang with a bulge in his pocket.  Is the policeman supposed to ignore that?  I mean, policemen do many things, and once you tell me that we're going beyond the facts of this case, I can think of all kinds of hypotheticals that aren't so hypothetical, and I become uncertain about when the policeman can and when he cannot.  So, how do you respond?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any dispute on the underlying facts?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.   Stephen G. Breyer  Here, what are the facts?

Are you saying that it is impossible for anyone to imagine a circumstance in which it would be held the defendant did not violate title IX, but in which the court held it did violate the Equal Protection Clause?  There is no such circumstance; no one can imagine one.  Is that what you are saying?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You cannot imagine one.  You think no one can imagine one.  So an obvious question on rebuttal is, since we have limited it to that universe, would be the other side must imagine one?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's simple.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Does a disparate-impact claim violate section -- title IX?   Stephen G. Breyer  If it's an individual, under title IX you can't bring the suit?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But you could under 1983?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So your point then is -- and that's why I've had trouble with this case -- is that if you look at the First Circuit opinion, it sort of seems to say: If there's a difference, of course you can have a 1983 suit, but if there's no difference, you can't.  I mean, everybody here seems to agree to that, I guess.  So I'm not certain what to do, because Selya started his opinion by saying this isn't a case where title IX doesn't apply; it does apply; they have the funding; but he doesn't talk about the exemptions and he doesn't really talk about the -- a difference between suing an institution and suing an individual.  So maybe what we should say is, maybe he meant it, but he didn't say it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you are saying if it's an individual acting in his official capacity, you cannot sue him under title IX?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then their answer to that which -- say, look, we want to sue an individual in his official capacity; that's why we want to bring our 1983 suit.  And then you reply: But there are bars here of collateral estoppel, claim preclusion -- whatever it is.   Stephen G. Breyer  They all have new names.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  But the -- the -- okay.  That's your argument.  So why don't we just send it back, say that's right; this suit is not precluded by 1983; indeed, that's the only place you can bring it; it's not precluded by title IX, and now, court, you go decide whether claim preclusion exists, or whatever you call it--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --collateral estoppel, or -- you understand what I mean.   ",07-1125
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's in O'Neal.  It says that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --which most of the Court joined, and the reason that it says it is because it just confuses everybody, at least me, to talk about ""burden"" in this context.  I think if O'Neal is right, it says what this is, is not involving a jury, not involving -- it's just what Justice Alito says, and following that through, what you'd -- you say to the judge: Judge, your job is to decide this.  Decide.  Decide whether you think that the one side -- whether there is error or whether the error is harmless or whether it isn't.  Decide it.  Now, it could be in a rare instance the judge just can't decide.  He's in grave doubt.  And so what we are talking about is what to do in that -- what should be a very, very rare instance.  Now, when I read this case, I thought that the Veterans Affairs is absolutely common sense on this.  It says: When you really don't know what to do, Judge, if the veteran got no notice at all, then probably the error was harmful.  But if he got the basic notice, and all that's at issue is who should produce what or whether he thinks that he didn't know that he's supposed to produce a lot of information, well, there, you know, it would be pretty rare that it was harmful.  And so you'd better say to him: Veteran, why did this hurt you?  That's all common sense, and it seemed to me that that's what the Veterans Court was saying, and then the Federal Circuit unfortunately, like I might have done, too, got it all mixed up with this burden of proof language.  Now, you tell me, legally, is that result which I am talking about sensible, and if so, how do I get there legally?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not criticizing you for that.  I'm not -- it's not a criticism.  I'm just really trying to figure out how to get to what I see as common sense legally.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The theory is he didn't know anything about this, got no notice whatsoever, so he didn't know that he's supposed to produce some more information or he'll lose.  That's the theory.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you connect it by saying normally a veteran who isn't that knowledgeable -- not everybody is a genius in law -- when he doesn't get a notice that tells him you got to produce something more or you lose, he might forget to produce something more.  That's the theory.   Stephen G. Breyer  So -- so fine.  If I get that record and if it is the way you describe, I'm not in grave doubt.  No problem.  If the record's the way you describe it, she knew everything she was supposed to know, so there's no harmful error, okay?  We are only talking about cases where there is real doubt in the judge's mind about whether this failure of the agency did or did not hurt the woman or man.  Now, when in doubt, we have the Veterans Court telling us the best way to administer this stuff is when they get no notice at all, and you are really in doubt, Judge, you don't know if it was harmful or not, here's what you do: Assume it was harmful.  They're the ones who know.  I don't know.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but suppose then we look at O'Neal, we read the first paragraph.  It was what this court said, and we all held it and, therefore, we say, those are the cases we're talking about where you're in doubt, and when you're in doubt, go proceed as the Veterans Court told you in terms of who has to show what.   INTERRUPTING ",07-1209
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  And so, why not just say that?  What's the big problem of saying, Judge -- and then you say just what you said?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then the judge again won't be in doubt anymore.  So there's no need for this case because, either -- either -- either the veteran's agency will say: Look, I walked that veteran through the process, I walked him through the process; walking him through the process, he was told everything he needed to know, and there's no real problem here.  It's just a formality that he didn't get the notice.  And if that's true, I'm not in any doubt, unless the veteran tells me that that's wrong, and here was something, okay?  On the other hand, we have your case.  In your case, she didn't go to the doctor.  If she went to the doctor, maybe she would have found something out.  Again, I have no doubt, there's harmful error.  So this case is a theoretical law professor's case that's never going to come up, because there's never any doubt.  Either the VA did walk him through it and there's no deal -- big deal, because she can't come up with anything, or she can come up with something.   Stephen G. Breyer  It certainly does because it makes sense to tell the government: Government, you have to come up with every possible, conceivable factual scenario and prove there wasn't a man from Mars who came in, and -- you know, that doesn't make sense.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know all this, and why don't you just tell the judge that and say: Look at my client, Judge, look at my client.  My client obviously isn't going to understand what to do unless the client is told.  And here my client wasn't told.  I'm the judge, I'm not in any doubt, you're going to win, okay?  So what I can't figure out is how to deal with this case, which, as I said, strikes me as a law professor's case that shouldn't make any difference in any real situation.   Stephen G. Breyer  It seems -- what I was trying to get to, which I don't see how to quite get there -- it seems to me that if something really went wrong, if there's -- there's no notice, that, veteran, you have to put in some material, or you are going to lose, if there's no notice of that, and he really didn't get any notice during all this cooperative process, then I think the Veterans Court is right.  At that point, I think it's fair to assume that he's hurt.  But if he got the notice -- I mean, there will be a few cases where he had nothing to produce, but a lot of them he would have had something to produce.  So that's -- they know it.  We don't know.  The Veterans Court knows.  Now, the other three matters -- who is supposed to produce what, and do you have general knowledge, you could produce whatever you want -- I would think it would be very rare that a veteran was hurt, if he knows the first, by not knowing the second, third, and fourth.  And, therefore, I'd think he better come forth to explain in the brief, in the brief, why this mattered.  Now, that's what it seemed to me the Veterans Court set up.  They know about it.  They set that up.  It's common sense.  So, how do I get to a legal result that says just that?  Or can I or should I?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why is that such a tough thing to do?  It sounds like it's sort of -- is there some law out there that stops you from saying in the brief, in a paragraph: We would just like you to know, Judge, that we had some evidence here.  Or we have some now that we want to present to them.  That's all.  And then if I see that, I'd say, my goodness.  And you describe it in three sentences.  Now, what is -- the Constitution doesn't stop you from doing that, does it?  I mean, what stops you from doing that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Stop you?  But the Veterans Court said to do it.  So they're -- they're the ones who know this area and they said you should have to do it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Between me and the Veterans Court, as to who knows best how to work this system, it's 10 to 1, and it's not me.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What they've decided there is if there's no notice at all, no, you don't have to have a proffer, because it's up to the agency to do just what you want.  But if it's one of these other three far more technical things, which occur far more rarely, on that one, you better tell the judge in the brief how it makes a difference.  That's their conclusion.  What's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but I don't understand that.  You mean -- let's suppose, contrary to your wishes, that the client was not hurt.  He was hurt by some other thing, nothing to do with the bazooka.  That's not your client -- that's the imaginary client.  But everything else is the same.  Well, does that mean because they forgot to tell the client that the client has to go and produce some evidence, and she thought the Veterans Administration would produce all the evidence?  Because they forgot that, your client wins and gets the money?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, that doesn't seem--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I know.  Now you're going to be back in the remand, and you now have to produce some evidence, don't you, or you lose?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So then why is it a big deal that you summarize what you're going to produce in the brief?  We're back where we started.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you want to call them ""a proffer"".  I just want to say a description in the brief of how you're hurt.   ",07-1209
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But -- but the -- the problem that I am having at the moment is that they did -- from your point of view, is that they -- the other side listed 28 cases in which they said the Oregon courts have followed this rule of the instruction has to be good as a whole.  Now, I have looked up those 28 cases, and they do -- they do say that.  They do say it, or they imply it, or they apply it.  They are not completely on point, but they are not completely out of point, either.  And -- and so I suppose what happened is that the judge there just looked at this instruction on 32a.  It looks like sort of it's all together.  It really does look like it's all together, the (1) and the (2).  And he ran his eye down the page and he said, well, here are two other ways in which it's no good, and so that's the end of it.  You can't raise your objection.  Maybe you should have had four instructions instead of one, but you did just have one.  And under Oregon law, unless every part of it is right, the judge is correct in not giving it, even if he never mentions the other part.  And that 28 -- it does seem as if that's what those 28 cases do say.  So what do we say about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean -- please, I -- I don't want to appear skeptical, but I am.  And -- and that's because I have looked up in some of those cases, and then I sort of looked at the -- which doesn't -- most of them don't give you the instructions, so it's a little hard to say.  But then I looked on page 32a of this appendix and looked at what your instructions looked like.  And -- and if I were sitting there as a judge, I would think, well, gee, that looks like a single thing there.  They have it indented, and they have a (1) and a (2), and it just looks like it's one ball of wax.  So can I really fault this Oregon court for just doing what I said?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, they have some other handbook that says beware of that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because you are going to run into this rule that says if there's any part of a single instruction that is wrong, goodbye, even if the trial judge never mentioned it.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, it would be pretty odd.  Did the person who wrote that read these 28 cases or some share thereof?  And if you were going to do that -- it wasn't you, I know -- why -- why wouldn't you just, if you have one instruction, copy the -- the model instruction?  Then you won't make errors in the other parts.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  True, but you could add that to the pattern.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not speaking of this from the point of view -- I mean I -- when I read that petition for cert, I thought this is a run-around, and I'm not sure that I think that now.  That is, in the -- the reason is because I put myself in the position of not the trial judge.  The person to put yourself in the position of is the Oregon Supreme Court justice.  And what he is doing is he's reading that instruction.  And -- and what can you say in response to what -- what he might have thought?  He knows this rule.  The rule is if an instruction is -- is unfavorable in any part, if it's wrong, you are out.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He knows that rule, because there have been a lot of cases on it.  And then he reads your instruction, and as I looked carefully -- I didn't know this the first time when it was here, but he said because it's right in paragraph 1 -- I mean, it's wrong in paragraph 1, where he was wrong -- I don't have to go to the rest of it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now we send it back, so he says: Okay, now I've got to go to the rest of it.   Stephen G. Breyer  The best you have come up with -- and I think you have researched this pretty thoroughly -- and the best you have come up with to find a case where they didn't apply the rule is that George case, right?  ""George"", I think, is the name of it.  And there, there is an alternative ground which is that the judge had to -- had to give the instruction himself, and it's a criminal case.  And we Shepardized it, and it has only been cited twice.  And -- and so I'm slightly at sea, to tell you the truth.  And -- and what is the standard I'm supposed to use to decide whether that State ground is adequate as a matter of Federal law or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The State interest in the rule in general, I take it, is to require the lawyers, if they are going to object to the instructions that the judge is going to give, to produce an instruction that is a correct instruction of the law.  That's -- that's why, I guess, they have this rule.   Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and you'd better get it right, because if you don't get it right, you're going to lose your ability to claim that the judge was wrong in refusing to give any part of it.  Now, if that's the reason they have that rule, that would seem to apply as much in this case as in any other case.  Why wouldn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is -- what is your response to the Chief Justice's suggestion that maybe we should reach the issue of due process on the amount?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, I'll tell you my subjective reaction going through these 38 cases is they are not quite in point, but I really take away the idea of the bad faith, particularly because the first time what the judge said, which I didn't understand its significance then, was the judge said: Well, since the first part of that paragraph (1) was in -- was in error anyway, I don't have to reach the questions of whether there were other mistakes under State law in the rest of the instruction.  They did say that the first time, I think.   INTERRUPTING ",07-1216
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I would say the 28 cases are not quite as clear as I suggested.  That is, I couldn't find in those 28 cases really a comparable situation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In each instance it seemed as if one of two things was the case: Either (a) where the instruction was in error, it really was the matter brought up in the first place, or the court said, but he gave the essence of the instruction he wanted anyway.  Now, which of those cases do you think -- I am leading up to, what of -- what of those cases do you think is your best support, because I couldn't -- they are not perfect.   Stephen G. Breyer  What -- what you can't tell from that is what was the part of the sympathy instruction that they thought was wrong, and was the part that they thought was wrong really part and parcel of the part that the -- that the appellant was complaining about.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but that's another -- I remember that, because they said on that one -- some floor covering thing, wasn't it, that they had some liability for bad floors or designing the floors wrong--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --If that's the case, what they said was: Don't worry about it because basically he did give the instruction that you wanted, though in a different way--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and besides that, they added--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, I know you're right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, in the last one, what I have here is that the court said the so-called requested instruction was never requested at all--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --at all.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is the -- what is the -- I will go look at that again.  But what is the standard?  I mean, remember, what I think your brother said at the end is correct.  Imagine that yours is a death case, and we have said as a matter of Federal law that this execution is unconstitutional, and then we send it back.  And the court then says: Oh, we forgot; there are a couple of matters of State law here that bar the Federal consideration of the death question.  And here they are.  And then they come up with just this.  Is this -- is this a situation where you would be equally -- that's my problem.  And so, put yourself in my shoes and -- and tell me what you would do if this is a death case and not the case that you have?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm just imagining that what has happened is that the instruction that they have given for the defendant in the death case violates Federal law, and then we send it back, and what happens is that the State court says, oh, it may violate Federal law all right, but it's -- the Federal court is blocked from considering it because there are these two other State grounds that mean that the lawyer--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So, what are the elements?  Imagine -- I'm trying to get help, if I were to try to put pen to paper on this.  Suppose they win in this.  Then we'll be back at the State law issue that I thought was going to be there, which was the issue of -- you are talking about the colloquy.  Did they give the essence of the Federal mandated instruction, or didn't they?  And then look how cooperative the judge was, et cetera.  But that isn't before us now.  What's before us now is something that blocks our consideration of that or anybody's consideration of that.  And imagine this is not your case; imagine it is the most, you know, striking case, that's why I used a death example, and we go through exactly the same thing.  And then the court does exactly the same thing, the State court, that happened here.  And now what are the words that distinguish whether the court is in essence, to be colloquial, giving everybody the runaround or whether the court is applying a -- an absolute, clear, you know, fair, standard of State law?  Which really they should have gone into first and saved everybody a lot of trouble.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what they say is -- look at the two errors they found.  One is in saying ""may"" instead of ""shall"", and the other is in saying ""illicit profit"" instead of ""profit"".  And they are pretty picky.  So, this is -- this is very picky, they say.  And not only are they being picky, but they are being picky after the event.  And they could have raised it first, and they have 28 cases supporting them, but none of these cases is right on point because the subject matter is, you know, closer, bound up.  And so they put all this together and say it's an unreasonable application of a rule that was there.  And you say--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Sorenson was the agent and the principal, the broker who was selling some land.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I think in that case they also said: By the way, you've got basically the instruction that you wanted, and you overlooked -- no, that was the case where they said: You overlooked in your instruction an important allegation of fact, which allegation was that the guy had been rehired as a broker.   Stephen G. Breyer  We didn't say it was in error.  I mean, there is nothing wrong with that.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING ",07-1216
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So I'm trying to figure out how the statute works.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it seems to me that the way it's supposed to work -- have you read, by the way, the facts of the case for December in Bell v. Cohen?  No?  Okay.  Forget that.  I was going to shorthand that because it's similar to the hypothetical I'm thinking of.  What happens is that the -- the State court now says, okay, I assume all the facts in your favor and you don't prevail.  All right.  Now, he goes into Federal court and he has some new facts.  Now, either they are such that they transform the claim and it's a new claim.  I mean, in that case there is an argument for that, maybe not in yours, or they aren't.  Now, if they aren't, then what he is supposed to do, the judge, is go look and decide on the basis of what they presented to the State.  That's the end of it.  Now, if they are, he is supposed to exhaust.  You go back, you exhaust this new claim like any other new claim, and if the State bars it, then you go and see if there was cause and prejudice.  And that's how it's supposed to work.  And if there was cause and prejudice, then you have the hearing.  Okay?  That's how it's supposed to work factually.  I have no idea if that's what went on here, but if it -- it didn't seem to me -- there was some confusion about whether the procedures are adequate in the State.  Then there is some other thing that this might be the same claim.  I mean, I don't see how we get to the question we took this case to decide, frankly, without knowing what the basis was and whether it was correct for the district court to give him any hearing at all.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's the first step.  The first step, I'd go and see -- but at any rate, you go ahead.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why wouldn't you say right off the bat, new claim, go present it to the State court, and exhausts it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no.  Suppose we have -- that's what I want, not these facts, but I want the facts where really, he couldn't have discovered this, because the first time that the district attorney opened his files for the Brady claim was 140 days after.  So we now have some totally new, which he couldn't have gotten; no one disputes it.  Where, that kind of thing -- I think he would have to present it to the State court, wouldn't he?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you must have been assuming then that the State would not give that person a -- a new opportunity to consider the new evidence.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose it were really new.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but so is it in Tennessee, and in Tennessee there is an exception where you could bring the thing up because you couldn't possibly have gotten hold of it.   Stephen G. Breyer  So in Virginia a person discovers for the first time, 140 days later looks at the D.A.'s files, and discovers something that shows the whole trial was a farce -- I mean, something unbelievable, and there is no way for the person under Virginia law to bring that up in a State court?   Stephen G. Breyer  I might say the new claim -- okay, so it's a new claim.  I don't know if yours is, by the way, but suppose it's a new claim.  Then what you ought to do is go back to the State court and exhaust.  So now what you show is that that's futile.  Now we get to your question before us.  Okay.  So it's an imaginary case.  It's less imaginary in December than here.  But, anyway, the -- the -- you get back to the State court.  Now, what is supposed to happen?  At that point I guess the statute leaves the judge free to develop the facts.  It doesn't say you can't.  So then you do it.  Now we have the question, which when we took this we thought we could reach, but I don't know if we can -- now we have the question: When the judge makes the decision on the basis of those facts, if they have never developed any of this in State court, fine.  Then have -- then just do it as if it were a regular case, don't defer it.  But suppose some of the things have been in State court related to this but not others.  Now what do we do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean that's not an obvious answer to that one.   Stephen G. Breyer  What it's going to do is it's going to be finding facts on the basis of certain evidence.  And what you will have gotten your new claim granted on is the fact that you found some new evidence that's very significant, and you couldn't possibly have found it before.  Now what do we do?  Do we defer in part; do we defer -- I mean now what does the district judge do?   INTERRUPTING ",07-1223
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I'm still trying to understand the statute.  I think their point is we get around (d), (d) doesn't bar us because the district court here, the Federal district court, found that it was an unreasonable determination of the facts, not unreasonable on the substance, but unreasonable because of the procedure.  In other words, the State that barred this evidence was having an unreasonable procedure and therefore the determination of the facts is unreasonable.  So you're saying that isn't what those words ""unreasonable determination of the facts"" mean.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You mean you're saying that (d)(2), ""unreasonable determination of the facts"", means the factual outcome.  In other words, if the factual outcome is reasonable it doesn't matter if the procedures are inadequate; is that your claim.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No?  I thought you just said that in answer to Justice Souter.   Stephen G. Breyer  And not whether their procedures are correct?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So that's the first thing we have to decide to get to the question.  If your wrong on that -- and I doesn't know the answer to it -- if you're wrong on that, then they're rid of (d).  So they say then, we're rid of (e) because it falls within (a)(2), the factual predicate and due diligence, okay.  They say we are rid of (e) because of that.  Now, how they get around capital (B) I'm not sure, but that isn't in the case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They're arguing due diligence.   Stephen G. Breyer  (I).  You mean of (e)(2)--   Stephen G. Breyer  --(E)(2).   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So we also get -- they get around that because they say the due diligence.  You also have an argument about how (2) applies.  And if you're wrong about both of those then we get to the question, which would be: If the -- if the hearing's properly before us and it's a new claim -- it's also saying it's a new claim -- if it's a new claim it has to be exhausted.  So under Virginia law, under Virginia law, is it really true that -- suppose, not this case, but suppose a Defendant 140 days after discovers the DA says, makes some remark.  He couldn't have known about it.  He goes to a special file.  He couldn't have found out about.  And lo and behold, it's the worst thing you can imagine, and you can imagine some pretty bad ones but this is even worse.  Now under Virginia law are you -- is it your view that Virginia courts would say you're out of luck, good-bye?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No matter what, it's goodbye?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No excuse?  Even if--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So they are right about, they are right about the exhaustion being futile.   Stephen G. Breyer  The first time he discovers DNA evidence in the DA's file that shows he couldn't have done it, there is no way to get relief under Virginia law?   Stephen G. Breyer  Not in State court.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, then they're right about that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, then let me ask you on the merits.  If he's right there and it's exhaustion and it really was a new claim, then wouldn't we apply a decision that does not defer to the State court, because after all the State court never heard this issue?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  There is no real argument between the two of you as to the -- as to the issue that we thought was presented.   Stephen G. Breyer  But there's certainly an argument--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --If it's really a new claim, you're going to say they applied--   ",07-1223

Breyer  So we're talking about two months.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's exactly what Justice Kennedy started to ask.  I mean, I said why doesn't this thing go away after two months.  I mean, you've done it anyway, and Justice Kennedy said because you want a holding from the Court that will help you in other cases because you think what the court below did here was wrong.  And you said ""three reasons"", and you got out the first one, and I would like to hear the other two.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I wouldn't -- look, you have an EIS for the reason that the agency itself, once it reads it, might decide to do something else.  That's the whole point of an EIS.  So if the agency goes ahead with the action before reading the EIS, it becomes committed to that course of action, and the chances that the EIS will lead it to back up are the same as the chances that any big agency will back up once it's committed to a course, namely a lot lower.  And that I always thought was the whole harm that the EIS is there to stop.   INTERRUPTING ",07-1239
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't see evidence to the contrary on two important points.  The first was that the Navy had affidavits which says -- they say -- I read them.  Maybe I just missed the contrary.  But they said that: You are requiring us, judge, to turn the sonar down to six decibels or up to six, whatever, whenever we had to run into a situation called layering of different temperature levels.  And we tell you, as naval officers, that that's just where submarines like to hide.  And we also tell you that if we can't train people to do that they will miss out on an important part of how to find these submarines.  I saw no answer to that.  The second thing they said was that: We're willing to turn off the sonar if there's any marine mammal that comes within 500 yards, which is a quarter of a mile, about.  But you insist that we turn off the sonar when any animal comes within a mile and a quarter.  And that's quite a big distance more.  A lot of animals come in there, and if we have to turn off the sonar all those times, we are not going to be able to get much training done.  Now, those two things seem to be quite important.  And I just might have missed, which I might have, which is why I'm asking, what the response was by equivalent experts to those points.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What do you mean, despite the complete absence?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's the whole point.  That's why I thought they didn't prove anything.  Fine, they went on some exercises and they didn't run into these layered things.  So obviously they couldn't have training.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what they are saying is, when you do run into that situation you've got to train people to deal with it.  It doesn't prove much that when you didn't run into it they didn't train people to deal with it.  How could they have?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I can't -- look, I don't know anything about this.  I'm not a naval officer.  But if I see an admiral come along with an affidavit that says -- on its face it's plausible -- that you've got to train people when there are these layers, all right, or there will be subs hiding there with all kinds of terrible weapons, and he swears that under oath.  And I see on the other side a district judge who just says, you're wrong, I then have to look to see what the basis is, because I know that district judge doesn't know about it, either.  So, the basis so far I'm thinking on this one is zero.  That's -- because what you have told me is they completed some exercise where they didn't find any layering.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Generalities.  You see -- of course, I agree with you as a generality.  What I am missing here is the specifics, because I am nervous about it, as you can see.  And what I am nervous about is that there just wasn't enough on the other side, on your side.   Stephen G. Breyer  This is -- I want to give you a chance to say what's so terrible about what they're doing.  I will express a little frustration.  Not your fault.  But why couldn't you work this thing out?  I mean, they are willing to give you quite a lot of conditions, and you say, well, we have got to have more conditions.  And you are asking us who know nothing about whales and less about the military to start reading all these documents to try to figure out who's right in the case where the other side says the other side is totally unreasonable.  And the issue at law seems to be something that is going to last for two months.  So -- so, why?  What is so -- what is the important thing here?   Stephen G. Breyer  How does the basic thing work?  Because to a layperson, when I think of the armed forces preparing an environmental impact statement, I think, the whole point of the armed forces is to hurt the environment.  I mean ----  [Laughter]  I don't under -- I don't understand how it's supposed to work.  Of course they are going to do something that is harmful.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You see the point, I am trying to give you a -- overstating it.   Stephen G. Breyer  You go on a bombing mission, do they have to prepare an environmental impact statement first?   Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can you try something out in your mind?  Maybe you can't react to it.  I'm trying to figure out how -- the structure requirement, what to say.  And a thought that is occurring to me, which I am not wedded to -- but I'd like some reactions to it -- is to say that there is a structure means that among this association of people there must be rules, understandings, or behavior that tend to keep the association together over time, other than those which would be essential to allow them to commit the particular crimes at issue.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I know, but I'm -- I'm trying to work out in my mind is that a sensible thing to say because the trouble with the word ""structure"" is everything in the universe has a structure.  And so it's awfully vague, and I'm trying to make it a little bit more specific.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That isn't what I said.  I said rules, understandings, forms of behavior that tend to keep the association together over time, other than those rules, understandings and -- and behaviors that would be necessary -- necessary meant strongly -- to commit the particular crimes at issue.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   ",07-1309
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  When you say individual, the first part of the definition of enterprise speaks about any individual partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity.   Stephen G. Breyer  So then, I've read somewhere that people feel that where that individual is involved, the individual is acting as an -- a legal entity such as a sole proprietorship.  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm talking about a legal entity.  And in the second clause, what we're talking about here, specifically, it is a corporation, a union, or a group of individuals associated in fact, although not a legal entity.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Two people -- two people walk along the street and know each other.  That's Posner's example.  And one of them says I have a great idea.  Let's go in and take some money out of the post office.  The other says, what happens if a policeman comes?  The first one says, we'll bribe him.  Okay?  Then they do it.  That's it.  Period.  Now, of course that's illegal.  But is RICO supposed to catch that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what is it that keeps them out?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, here we have two -- two -- two related crimes.   Stephen G. Breyer  There was between the two.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that is the bribery.  I mean, what happens if 3 months from now the postal inspector comes to catch us?  We'll bribe him.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean, you're quite right.  I agree with you that these are different efforts to try to catch the same problem.  And the problem is that I don't think anyone sees that the simple conspiracy and carrying out of two criminal offenses by several people together without more -- without something more -- should violate RICO.  I think your answer to that will be you agree with that, but tell me if you don't.  And then if you do agree with it, the very difficult problem is to figure out how to get the people to clearly show--   Stephen G. Breyer  --You agree with the first part?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What did you think -- what did you think of the -- probably not much of it, but what did you think of my effort there?  And I'm -- I'm trying to point out, as you see, I'm open to anything that will deal with what I think of as a functional problem and the functional problem is exhibited by that Posner example I gave you or by two investment companies that decide what we'll do is we'll issue a letter that's going to be shown to two different people -- that's their only association -- or maybe 100 people, but they know who they are, and they're going to be shown this letter over a period of 5 or 10 years, and someone later comes back and says there's a false statement in the letter.  Well, they shouldn't issue a false statement, but is that RICO?  I mean, so -- so the object -- the object is to find a way of not overextending RICO where there is nothing there but a conspiracy to commit two crimes.  Pattern is one help.  The pattern is pretty vague, so all the courts but one have come along, I take it, with this other help, which is playing on the word ""structure"".  Now, you heard what I said is -- is a weak effort to try to do something.  What is your best effort to do something to deal with the problem?  Or what's wrong with my effort?  Whatever you want to say.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's different.  That's -- of course, the same evidence can establish two separate elements.  The problem will be conflating the elements so that every single case that you have the first set, you also have the second set.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean, that -- always, in a case where you sue the investment company because of their one letter used four times, it's the act of the individual.  In the case that Posner used, it's always the act of the individual.  There's always a criminal act of an individual.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And he has to be associated, however, with an enterprise for it to fall within RICO, and there also has to be a pattern.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let's go back--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --That's right, and our problem is he's doing it with one other person whom he met once, and they agreed to do it, and that's a common law conspiracy.  And now suddenly he's done it twice with another person who helped him and they said they'd do it, and now we have RICO.  And my belief is -- which you may not agree with -- that that common garden-variety conspiracy to, say, rob a bank and then transport the money a few months later, that that's all that's at issue.  That shouldn't be within RICO.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You might come back and tell me it should be.   INTERRUPTING ",07-1309
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, they didn't.  What we're going to discover, I suspect, when we actually dig into this record, which is pretty extensive, are two things.  The first is the California Court of Appeals does not seem to have dealt with the particular issue in front of us.  They talked about a due process issue at the end of their paragraph.  They talk about things that are close to it, but they nowhere say expressly how they are deciding the question of whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel for the reason that he didn't put on this insanity defense.  That's going to be our first problem.  Then I looked to see and got the record out to see, if he raised it, and he did raise it.  So we have the fact that they didn't talk about it, and then we have the fact that, of course, the Supreme Court of California just says one word, ""denied"".  Then when we discover round two in the Ninth Circuit, we are going to discover some language which says we are not relying on this rule.  There is no such rule, as a rule of you have to make a defense as a last resort.  Here's what they say.  Where this -- instead of that we say, forget about that, we were wrong the first time, we assume.  Where the State court has provided an adjudication on the merits -- that is, it did say denied -- but has not explained its underlying reasoning or held an evidentiary hearing, we conduct an independent review of the record to determine the State court's final resolution of the case, whether it was reasonable or unreasonable.  So they say we did conduct that record independent review, and our conclusion is that it was unreasonable.  Okay?  Nothing to do with any special rule here or anything.  We just think it was unreasonable.  All right.  Now, what are we supposed to do with this?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is that deference going to be?  I take it what it would be is that the person, the defendant, would have in his petition -- which we don't actually have -- would have said the facts are thus and so, and since they had no hearing, they would have to take those facts as being thus and so.   Stephen G. Breyer  And then we would have to say, was it unreasonable of them on the facts as they might have taken them most favorable to the defendant?  Is that what we're supposed to do?  Was it unreasonable of them to conclude for the State's favor in light of reading these facts as most possible favorable for the defendant?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that what we should do?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then we have to reach this hearing issue because we have to say, insofar as the hearing reached a different result, we should ignore it for the reason that the statute tells us to consider the reasonableness of the State court's decision in light of the facts on the record before it.   Stephen G. Breyer  So we have to reach a huge number of issues which we've never decided.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then how are we supposed to do it?  That's why I raised it.   Stephen G. Breyer  You keep saying 29 years.  Is it 29 years to life?  Is that just a misprint or--   INTERRUPTING ",07-1315
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But there's no hole in the statute.  What it says to do, quite explicitly, is it says that you have to see whether the State court decision was unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the State court.  So it tells us what to do.  It says look at the evidence in the State court, and like any other instance where there is no hearing -- every day of the week, judges refuse to give a hearing.  Now, when they do that, they have to assume the facts in favor of the losing party.  So the question is, assuming the facts in favor of your client, was the decision that he loses unreasonable?   Stephen G. Breyer  And you said yes.  Is there any finding on that in the Federal court?  No.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now -- now, that's -- that's why I don't know how to proceed because it seems to me to decide that question just as I said it.  When I said it, I don't think what I said is clear in the law of this statute.  There are two sides to it.  We just had a case where there were many briefs on this question.  So -- so I'm -- I'm slightly uncertain what to do.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's the law of the Federal Government, I would have thought.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's summary judgment law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's my fault.  I'm -- I'm referring by shorthand to a Rule 56 summary-judgment-type standard.  All those facts are assumed on your side in which they're material, and there has to be in the evidence a reasonable basis for dispute.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's my mistaken refusal -- I should have said rule 56.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what about -- what do you do with the last sentence of the supreme -- of the California Court of Appeal's opinion?  None of the exculpatory evidence defendant recites, including evidence of his mental disorder, was reasonably likely to persuade a jury that defendant did not premeditate and deliberate the killing.  And from that they conclude that there is no reasonable probability that, but for the errors, a different verdict would have been reached, i.e., that it doesn't satisfy the second part of Strickland.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I was just reading from the California Court of Appeal.  Because I look at that.  I think when I go back and see what was the evidence in front of them, I'm going to find all these -- all these things, not the last part by the way, not -- not the part about the counsel admitting he was wrong or whatever this argument we're having now.  We won't find that, but we'll find everything else there.  And so they're using that as the basis to say there was no prejudice.  And now, I guess that the Ninth Circuit and the Federal courts would have to defer to that finding on prejudice.  Now, what's your response to that?   ",07-1315

Breyer  I have my memo that I haven't looked through carefully, but I'd be quite interested.  I -- I thought he asked for counsel.  He was given counsel.  Subsequent to that, this statement was elicited.  I'd like to know that because the Sixth Amendment says you have a right to assistance of counsel in your defense.  Period.  And I guess, if he had a lawyer, the lawyer could have told him, don't talk to informants in the jailhouse.  He could have said, I'm going to talk to who I want.  Or he might not have.  But I'd be interested in knowing, did he have assistance of counsel at the time the statement was elicited?  It's one thing to me if he did; another if he didn't.  Don't know?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How can I find out?   Stephen G. Breyer  So it might be he asked for counsel but hadn't yet received counsel.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, I see the problem.  I wonder if you have an answer to another question.  You may not.  I can't find it.  It seems to me it's been 20 years since this -- nearly 20 -- since the Court decided the Michigan case.  The other cases were decided even earlier.  And it's just surprising to me that it's never come up or rarely, rarely come up, the -- the question of whether the -- the State can introduce into evidence a -- a statement made when the State questioned an individual who'd asked for counsel or had counsel out of the presence of the counsel.  I mean, does that normally happen, or does it never happen?  Why is there so little law on it?  Have you any idea?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I'm not certain about.  And this is why I -- I've been asking these questions.  What I can't figure out in my own mind is this.  I ask for a lawyer.  The State has some period of time to give me a lawyer.  Now, it's one thing if what's going on is once I ask for a lawyer, the State should deal with me through my lawyer.  That's how they're supposed to do it.  But that isn't as basic -- that's like a rule of ethics in most States in the civil context and other contexts.  That's not as basic as if I ask for a lawyer, and then the State just doesn't give me one, though it should.  That's a different violation, a different kind of violation.  One is a kind of a rule of ethics incorporated in the Constitution.  The second is what the cases -- is what the Constitution is really about, give him a lawyer when he asks for one.  And which is this case?  That's why I'm having hard time.  Is it the first or the second?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  But that -- that -- I mean, I'll amalgamate that for you.  I'll say they're exactly the same thing.  But what I want to know is what rule was violated, what Sixth Amendment rule -- rule.  You know, you heard what I said, the rule, don't talk to a guy who wants a lawyer until you talk to the lawyer.  No communications with a client.  It's a communication with the lawyer.  That's one rule.  And the other rule is he's asked for a lawyer, but you never gave him one.  Now, which is this case?  I mean, I first thought, well, if he didn't have a lawyer at all, then it must be the second, but then I thought they must have a reasonable time to give him a lawyer, and they haven't violated that second.  If you have any view on that, it would be helpful to me.   INTERRUPTING ",07-1356

Breyer  --do you object to a three-sentence per curiam opinion in this case where we say, to the extent that the Hawaii Supreme Court could be read to suggest that the Apology Resolution either resolved or cast a cloud, legally speaking, on the title of the trust land, or suggested in any way that land be enjoined -- the sale be enjoined, the court made a mistake; and insofar as it is resting on State law, that's up to them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How could it have done that?  I mean, I didn't see anything in here that suggests anything like that.  That's to suggest that the Apology Resolution created an obligation on the part of the State courts to enjoin sales until everything was worked out.  Now, I have read this Apology Resolution about six times, and I certainly didn't see anything like that.  Where does it say--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --You agree that the Apology Resolution does not say who's right about the claim?   Stephen G. Breyer  Like what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What?   Stephen G.

Now, I know from the newspapers -- I don't know the merits of it -- but the trust that has been set up is the subject of controversy continuously.  So what I don't see -- and I hope we don't have to get into this -- is what the relation between the trust principles as enacted in the legislature is and the trust principles set forth in the Admissions Resolution.

So now you are saying, no, it's really different because look at (b) and (c).  That's your basic argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  So I look at (b) and (c) and it says, well, when you lease something under (b) and (c), which is not (a) -- it's (b) and (c) -- you have to have all this supervision and so forth, or it has to be at a fair value, something like that; is that right?

Breyer  Thank you, but now what of course is at the back of my mind is I'm trying to see, is this -- is this statute stronger for you than the statute we already considered?  And I start with some suspicion, because I think if it was a stronger statute for you, you would have argued it the last time.  So I wonder why you didn't.   Stephen G.

I look at the language and so forth.  The language doesn't seem any stronger for you, at least at first blush.   Stephen G. Breyer  But that isn't really my question, because I've tried to erase from my mind any suspicion about why you did or didn't argue it last time.  And looking at it straight afresh, I think when the Court of Claims got this back, as any judge would, the first thing they do is look at the words of the old statute, look at the words of the new statute, and try to figure out if the new statute that you cited is somehow more supportive of your claim than the old one was.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So what have we got here in that respect?  What we seem to have is two later provisions that say the government will have no liability when it enters into leases.  I mean, maybe that helps you, but at the moment I am slightly escaping it.  And then I guess there are some regs that were promulgated after the lease was entered into and seem on their face to deal with other matters.  Okay, now, what am I missing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you got to that, then I have -- I'd like one follow-up, and that's it.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  What do you do if there is not a liability in question?  Suppose a school district deliberately, to obtain greater racial diversities in the schools draws district boundaries in a particular way among neighborhoods or plans a construction program.  Then suppose having done that, indeed having once drawn the boundaries, a group comes to the school district and says you can achieve greater diversity if you redraw the boundary.  You can achieve greater diversity if instead of building this school where the -- where the foundations are laid already, you build the school over here instead.  Is that, in your view, different from your case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It is?  How?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's just what I'm doing exactly.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But I'm interested in the distinctions, not whether it's similar to Justice Thomas's or not.  I'm interested in the distinctions between this program -- I'll add one more if you want just this program, an employer--   Stephen G. Breyer  --And the difference between that and drawing the school district boundary, which takes from the individual children who live in that neighborhood the right to go to this school, which they think is a better one, and sends them to that school, which they think is a worse one, the difference between changing that boundary and changing the exam is what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What do you think of an employer who does the following?  He advertises a job.  Everyone comes in and applies.  He says May 1 is the deadline.  When he sees the applicants, he thinks, I'd prefer more diversity.  And solely because he lacks diversity among women, minorities, and whatever, he says, you know, I'm going to extend the deadline 2 months, and I hope I'll get a few more minority or female applicants.  Now, what's his reason?  He wants more diversity in the workforce.  Now, in your opinion, does the Constitution permit that extension?   Edwin S. Kneedler  --I -- I think that's a more difficult question, but there may -- there may be a situation where the employer is concerned that his recruitment or his job announcement has had a disparate impact in terms of the -- of the applications that he has gotten.  In -- in that situation, the employees who have responded and may be advantaged, like the people promoted here may actually be taking advantage of a test that imposes barriers and disadvantages other people.  So when -- when we consider the impact in a situation like this on somebody who has passed the promotion test, it's important to consider that the people who have passed it may have benefited from a test that is discriminatory.   Stephen G. Breyer  Do you -- I'm still back on -- a university decides that tenure requirements lead to fewer women professors, so they say as an experiment what we would like to do is not have them for a couple of years; see what happens.  On your view is that unconstitutional?  Because, after all, it will certainly mean that certain majority race assistant professors have now lost the promotion they otherwise would have.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That it's unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  It would not be unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And what about--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  Oh, oh.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what we are doing is not giving the promotions to the assistant professors who otherwise would have job security.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, so.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's the result -- it's that you identify the person that makes your -- so in Texas, for example, they take the top 10 percent of all the high school graduates and put them in the university.  Now, suppose they just decided, you know what we want to do?  The top 5 percent.  We want to see how that works.  And, of course, then there are people who in fact would have gotten into the university -- and perhaps we can imagine a majority of the majority race -- and now they don't.  Can Texas do that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know that, but I -- I ----  [Laughter]  That was not my objective.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I want to test out just what it is about this case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you said no.  Can Texas do that or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  And the difference here precisely is what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But in your -- in my example, to go back, the thing you've identified, it seems to me, is Texas couldn't do this.  It couldn't look at the class that they're going to choose with the 10 percent and say, you know, there are not enough minorities, I think we'll go to 15 percent this year.   Stephen G. Breyer  It could not.  And moreover, in the case of the tenure, what the school couldn't do is it couldn't say, looking over at the present tenured faculty and those who were just ready for promotion and who in all probability will be, we're going to go to the non-tenure system this year.   Stephen G. Breyer  That they couldn't do that.  And again you that say the ordinary employer across America who announces a deadline for getting in applications cannot, once it sees those applications, say, you know, there are not enough minorities.  I want to extend the deadline.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And therefore this is a very far-reaching decision.   INTERRUPTING ",07-1428
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I have purposely gone, of course, to the concurring opinion because I believe it's the controlling opinion in Parents Involved, and there are two examples in that opinion.  One is strategic site selection of new schools, i.e., a planned building, and the second is drawing attendance zones with a general recognition of the demographics.  Those are given as examples of instances where there is race consciousness, but it does not trigger strict scrutiny.  Now, why is your case like that rather than being like those examples where an employer or a government official picks particular people or uses quotas in order to get a certain quota or pay attention to race in an individual selection, both based on race, which clearly does require strict scrutiny?  And if there is a difference, even then why is yours justified?   ",07-1428

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Just to clarify in my mind.  Case one, the defendant has no lawyer.  He is -- they give him Miranda warning.  He says: I don't want a lawyer.  Okay.  Now, do you want to speak against yourself?  Yes, he says, I do.  Sorry, strike -- he says: No, I don't; I don't want to say anything, but I don't want a lawyer.  Six hours later the policemen say to him: Are you really sure that you don't want to speak?  He says: Well, maybe I will, and he makes a full absolutely voluntary decision.  That's okay under the Constitution, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, it's the same case, except this time he says: I have a lawyer; I hired him yesterday.  Now the policeman cannot say, are you sure?  Is that correct?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's the law.  So, the law is -- and the reason for that second is because once you have a lawyer, police communicate through the lawyer.  Isn't that the reason, basically?  I just always thought that was the reason.  Once a person has a lawyer, another lawyer communicates through the lawyer.  They don't go and talk to the client.  I thought that was the kind of rationale for it.  Maybe I'm wrong.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, if the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm not talking about that.   Stephen G. Breyer  I was trying to give a hypothetical and my hypothetical is a different one than you were just told.  In my hypothetical the person has a lawyer, and I thought where he has a lawyer the police are not allowed to go and ask him questions about whether he wants to waive.  Of course, he can volunteer it.  Am I right about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's correct, that's correct.   Stephen G. Breyer  Correct.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Correct, that's the conundrum of the case.  Now I understand it.  The conundrum of this case is he didn't tell the police, I have a lawyer.  He had one.  Now, if he had hired one and not told the police, it would be the same result as we just said, wouldn't it?  If he had one but didn't tell the police, the police could not initiate questioning; am I right or wrong?  All I'm driving at is shouldn't the result here be the same?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The same whether you hired the lawyer or the same whether the lawyer was appointed?  At least that's what's in my head.  And if you can show me that you want the same result in both cases, that would go a long way towards convincing me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He tells some of the police.  Some of the police know.  It just happens that these particular ones don't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask -- I'm getting a different idea from what you're arguing.  I want to try it on you and see what your response is.  It's simply this, that there's something backwards about this case, and what's backwards is this, that when they're talking about a prophylactic rule in Jackson, what they're thinking of is the following: Everyone agrees that when a person really has a counsel, at that point, unlike the Miranda point, the police cannot talk to him further, though he can initiate.  Now, everyone agreeing, what do we do with a case where a person doesn't have a lawyer, but he requests one?  Now, in such a circumstance, we're going to treat it as if he had one.  That's the prophylactic part.  But here's a case where he really has one.  So it doesn't fall outside Jackson.  It falls within the basic assumption of Jackson, that the difference between having a lawyer and not having a lawyer is, if you have a lawyer, the police can initiate nothing.  You can't talk to him.  Now, if that's right, your case -- I mean, I'm afraid, their side, for your point of view, is a fortiori for Jackson, not the borderline of Jackson.  Now, explain to me why I've got it wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  Accept that, for argument's sake.  Accept that, and then same -- same question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Interesting.  I think this is very interesting to me because I'm learning a lot.  Suppose -- Let's assume Justice Alito is absolutely right and that when you have a counsel, that's what you've done and that's the reason why you don't talk to the police, or at least they can't initiate.  Fine.  Take that as the rationale, and now apply it to this case.  Since he has a lawyer, whether he said yes, no, maybe, ""I accept"" or not, it would have nothing to do with it.  The same rationale would apply or would it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I see.   ",07-1529

Breyer  So, how does that differ from you using your printer and there's an ink cartridge and you replace them after a while, and mine has a little thing attached that says don't put it in your ordinary garbage bin because it's dangerous or whatever it is, put it in this envelope and do something?  Now, I'm sure that HP makes those and knows that several million people won't do it.  They will throw it in the garbage bin, and they ship to it me.  All right.  Are they now arrangers?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, some?  Oh, probably millions.  I don't know anybody who does put it in the right garbage bin.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then how is that then different from Shell?  Shell here knows that to some degree their people are going to spill this.  And, of course, shell arranged the transport.  And in my imaginary hypothetical -- I don't really know -- so does HP.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, now maybe HP knows that there is a particularly bad customer like Breyer who ----  [Laughter]  --because I foolishly admitted at dinner that I dispose of them all improperly.  Now are they Shell?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --So then, suddenly if HP, in fact, uses -- I guess they lease -- you know, they have a common carrier, imagine -- or suppose it's car batteries, same problem.  They have their own trucks, and they -- or they use Fed Ex; I don't know.  And they, in fact, put in an instruction, which says: Really do it; really put it in the special now.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm trying to find that point.  And what I have found you so far to say from the briefs is that what Shell here did -- I'm not saying it easy -- but what they did was they arranged the transport, that seems to me to be common, and they put some instructions in which said the right way to dispose of it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, doesn't everybody do that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So then, in your view, what it is, is a company arranges with a transporter for disposal when the company knows that the transporter on arrival may spill some of the product?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I guess then every oil company -- well, I mean, every liquid product company in the United States is going to be -- fall within that because a lot of people do spill things.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, but that's the point.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That is that point, because I think you're focusing on the word -- you don't use the word ""for"" disposal, and I think that is the key word, and the question is intention versus purpose.  So that in your trash hauler case, it seems to work pretty well for me that when we say that that trash truck of course intended in the sense that it was its purpose to dispose of the trash when it got to the dump, but the leakage along the way -- it was not its purpose.  So how do we deal with that?  The statute tells us that they are an owner of a facility or a vessel that leaks, and therefore they are liable that way.  Now, that seems to work.  So we get your example.  What doesn't seem to work is when you import the notion of intention, in the sense of knowing that, to the arranger provision, because at that point I don't see how -- and I have to buy that to get your argument.  At that point I do not see how you get every thing of Clorox on the shelf in the supermarket and don't put Clorox right in the arranger provision and lots of other companies that shouldn't be held as arrangers.  That's my problem.  Are you following that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It does say that, but my problem is I can't find in the distinctions that they made useful distinctions that will do that.  It will say ""many"", but it won't say, for example, the car battery manufacturer who sends his car batteries out in his own trucks to places where people will get them, and he knows that they're not going to do it properly no matter how hard he tries.  Well, he's not an arranger.  He didn't arrange the transport for disposal; he arranged the transport for sale.   ",07-1601

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why shouldn't the law track medicine?  I mean, we're not... we're interested in a person having a fair trial.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I didn't think this case has been decided by prior precedent.  I thought there was some opening here.  Going back to what I think I said in Martinez and Justice Kennedy said, we were... I was interested in, and perhaps he was, in a few empirical facts, because we'd heard lots of complaints from trial judges who said this makes no sense at all.  Very disturbed people are being deprived and end up in prison because they're disturbed rather than because there guilty.  Now, I wanted to know the facts.  And it seemed to me we have a excellent, really fabulous... that this has happened, and Professor Hashimoto seems to have gone and written, done research, which we have in front of us.  As I read that research, I first learned that actually the pro se defendants don't do a bad job of defending themselves.  And by and large, they do surprisingly well.  And so perhaps that eliminates some of the concern.  But the other thing that it tells me is that there is a small subclass of pro se defendants who may in fact do badly.  And we have in front of us one of those individuals and that, therefore, a rule which permitted a State to deal with this subclass of disturbed people who want to represent themselves, who could communicate with counsel, but can't communicate with anybody else, that if we focus on that subclass and accept the State's argument here, interestingly enough, we've gone a long way to deal with a serious practical problem, and we've advanced the cause of seeing that individuals have a fair trial.  So I'd like you to comment on that, and that was my reaction after reading that study.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Your response to that, as it was to me, I take it to be: Well, focusing on this subclass, the judge has other ways of dealing with the problem.  My thought about that is, first, I don't know.  Maybe the damage is done by that point before the jury or elsewhere.  And my second thought is, because I'm not certain about whether your answer is right or wrong, nor are any of us really, this is a perfect instance where the States should experiment.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There isn't on this, but of course part of the job of being a psychiatrist or a psychologist or a doctor is continuously to evaluate the accuracy of studies.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I must be just missing something here.  Tell me what I'm missing.  What about the definition of ""claim""?  It says a claim includes a request under a contract for money or property, and the request is made to the contractor if the United States provides any... any of the money.  Is there an issue here as to whether some of the money provided... are you saying there was no money provided by the United States or maybe there was no money provided?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well... so why doesn't that end it?  Why doesn't... how do you win, then, given the language I just read?   Stephen G. Breyer  ""Claim"".  And there has to be a claim.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's right, that's right.   Stephen G. Breyer  But that's why the definition... it seems to me at the moment... that's why I'd like your view... that the language is perfectly ambiguous, the language of  ""knowingly makes a false statement to get a false claim paid. ""  Now, the ""false claim"" is the claim that they made to the contractor, because that's the definition.  And you are saying: Well, they made this statement to get a false claim paid by the government.  Now, you could read those words ""paid by the government"" to say  ""and there has to be a causal connection. ""  which is what you're saying, that you have to make the false statement, make the claim, and that led the government to pay.  But you could also say it's paid by the government when the money to pay it comes out of government funds, because it was paid by the government even though the government gave the money to build the school 100 years ago.  But it's there in the bank account, and then the contractor took the money from the bank account that the government put in and paid it.  In such a case, linguistically, you can say it's paid by the government.   Stephen G. Breyer  It was a false claim.  That's there.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it doesn't say that.  It says it was a false claim, which it was.  It's false, and it is a claim to the general.  And was it paid by the government?  Yes.  It was paid by the government, even though everything you said is true, because the money to pay it came from government funds.  So that's why I'm having a problem.  I can read those words ""paid by the government"" either way.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true.   ",07-214X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What you are saying is covered, I take it... and this is... I want to know how this has worked out... what is covered is... imagine government grant programs.  And suppose there are vast numbers of grant programs now that go to all kinds of entities throughout the country, and a large portion of which are just grants.  They're paid and the government is not going to get a penny back.  Now, there are instances of frauds in such situations of subs against the person who gets the grant.  And in... I can't imagine a case... maybe imagine, but it would be imaginary... where the Government couldn't say: But we got less than the grant was supposed to pay for.  And you're saying all those are covered.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  To get less than it was supposed to get.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And so this is what surprises me on your side.  It's 20 years later.  And if all those things are covered, given the vast extent of government grant programs in the United States, has your interpretation worked to bring within this statute, and lots of qui tam cases against municipal frauds of all kinds, things that they just never thought of at the time of the Civil War?  Do you see what the question is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Have there been a lot of such cases?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

That was your point to Justice Scalia, I guess.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what was that argument?  Because you said it wasn't in the brief, and what is it?  How do you still win?   Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Do you want to get... looking at this case of Lake Shore, as I read... as I read that case, I'm thinking that they looked back to the admiralty case, but they're saying this isn't an admiralty rule.  It's a Federal rule.  And the Federal rule is that to make the corporation liable for punitives in the absence of bad conduct by anyone in the corporation but for the lower executive, you can't do it.  But if it were a higher executive, the president and general manager or, in his absence, the vice president in his place, then you could.  So they are distinguishing among levels of corporate officials.  Now that seems to be the Federal rule, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, what happens to that Federal rule?  One thing we know happened to it is that time passed; Erie v. Thompkins came along; and most of the relevant cases left the Federal courts or Federal law and were decided under State law.  Was there anything left in the Federal system besides admiralty where this Federal rule might apply; and, if so, what happened to it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what's happened?  And the reason I think I'd like to know is because it seems to me it makes a difference from the point of view of stare decisis whether the Federal rule, as Federal rule, has always stayed the same or the Federal rule has eroded so that in place X and Y it disappears, remaining only in admirality, in which case you have a genuine outlier.  And I don't know what the history is.   Stephen G. Breyer  I know.  That's beside the point to my question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But the... I mean, the obvious kind of thing would to be say that the standard would depend upon the reprehensibility of the conduct of the officer of the corporation, including the captain, if you lost on that.  And where we said roughly before zero to 10... and you are quite right that this is a huge amount of money... you'd say zero to five, up to five times.  I mean that would be rough and ready.  But the idea would be to impose enormous deterrence upon large firms involved in your industry that you are representing not to make certain the officers on the ship behave in a reprehensible way.  It's crude, but I mean that's the kind of thing that we said in the due process cases.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then why wouldn't you--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Why wouldn't you--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --You're going to say... you're going to hear in two seconds... they're going to say this is the company that makes the most amazing profit, et cetera.  And so you're trying to deter them.  So we know what, you know... so, what do you say to that?   ",07-219X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's... that's why I'm interested in the same question I asked on the other side.  As I read Lake Shore, it seemed to me my first reading of it that it picked up this distinction that Justice Story made, and it said quite right, you could impute punitives or exemplary damages to a corporation where its managerial official is the one who causes... who behaves recklessly.  But wait, we don't mean quite that.  We mean some managerial officials.  And they seem to refer in the admiralty case, I'll tell you one who he isn't, namely, the ship's captain.  He's not in that category.  And then in this other case, they say... they talk about a superintending agent authorized to imply, employ, and discharge the conductor.  And they give that as an example of a managerial official where there would not be exemplary damages assessed against the corporation in light of his conduct.  So when I read that, I thought that this Lake Shore case is just picking up the earlier case; and that's the Federal law.  And you've given the examples where the State law has changed; and I have no doubt you are right.  You read the cases very well.  But is there an example where I could say that the Federal law has changed, too?  And you started down that track, but the reason this is of probably more than inordinate concern to me is that I wrote the case in Sand, I wrote a dissent in Legion, I looked into stare decisis law and made fairly clear views of what it is.  So what would you say to someone who has accepted certain legal principles that we have had in prior cases?  And you want to say nonetheless you win.  Okay.  Why?   Stephen G. Breyer  And so it differs from Sand, for example, where they are like two cases?   Stephen G. Breyer  It differs from Sand?  You say it is not... I'm interested in your last remark.  In the Sand ways I found... you know we went through it, public policy was on the other side.  But... but we had several cases, it wasn't a thousand; it was more like two; and the Supreme Court had said in two cases, one very clearly, you know... you see the point there.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why do you say there is no stare decisis problem?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That wouldn't... you might win on that one.  I mean if you show that.  They have... we have to assume that that isn't so, don't we--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --for purposes of this argument?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Okay, that's all.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's fine.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  On the second and third, this is what--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --some time available.  I would like you to address at some point at your convenience what should the standards be if, in fact, the captain of a ship, or responsible for conditions, for example, negligence or recklessness is now going to be not only imputed to the corporation but subject for punitives.  Now, what I'm interested in, in the back of my mind is: This is a very dramatic accident.  It involves oil spills, and they cause a enormous amount of trouble.  But there are accidents every day, and ships are filled with accidents like automobiles in other places.  And there are all kinds of things that go wrong.  And if, in fact, it has not been normal in admiralty until now to assess punitives against the corporation on the basis of the activity of, say, the ship's master, failures of responsibility, then it will be a new world for the shipping industry and for those who work on the ships.  What happens when a sailor slips and is hurt, and it's very serious to that sailor, et cetera?  What principles do you have to suggest, if any, for creating a fair system that isn't just arbitrary?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  What's even the theory of that?  Because the theory of punitives is that the individual who's receiving the money wasn't hurt one penny's worth?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that really the money ought to go to the people generally in the State or it ought to go to other people, rather than those people who have already been compensated.  That's the theory of it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That exhibits the difficulty for me of trying to figure out how to do it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is the relevance?   Stephen G. Breyer  What's the relevance of the leg that we're assuming Exxon, other than the captain, did bad things?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You seem to be now talking about the evidence that they did bad things.  But that's the leg that they did--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, doesn't that show, then, that there had to be a finding that they did the bad thing?   INTERRUPTING ",07-219X

It used to be common maybe urban legends, but of political bosses voting whole graveyards of dead people.  All right.  Now, that would be almost impossible to catch, I think.  Someone walks in, saying: I'm Joe Smith.  He doesn't say: I'm Joe Smith dead.  He says, I'm Joe Smith, and he signs something.  And the poll worker looks at it and the signature looks very weird.  Well, what's the poll worker supposed to do?  He's not going to go disrupt the election.  And is there going to be a policeman there to follow this person home?  Of course not.  So that's their claim.  Their claim is that we have a lot of anecdotes and there is a certain kind of fraud that you really just can't catch at the poll.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what's your response to that?  Because that's their argument on the other side.   Stephen G. Breyer  I know there are arguments on both sides.  But at the heart of this is what was Judge Posner's claim and others that this isn't the kind of fraud that you can just dismiss and say it never happens because the person would walk into the poll later and try to vote.  What they are talking about is what Justice Scalia was talking about, and I'm simply trying to focus your answer on that part of the question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, they say that's because you can't catch it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How would you catch it, which is my question.   INTERRUPTING ",07-21XX
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if you're worried about fraud--   Stephen G. Breyer  --If you're worried about fraud, what I don't understand, and I'd like to track it through with you, is the registration system.  As I read the Indiana voter registration application, all a person has to do to register is to write in, enclose a utility bill that has his name and address, and if he doesn't have a photo ID, he can write the four numbers of his Social Security; and if he doesn't have that either he doesn't have to do anything, and they will give him a number... and you mail it in.  And you're registered.  So all a person who have to do if he wants to be fraudulent is make out a fraud one of those, and he has a photo ID; he can go to the polls.  So my question to you is this: given that system of registration, focusing on the issue before us, why don't you just say and we'll give to you... you put on... if you don't have a photo ID, we'll give you one.  Now there it would not stand as an obstacle; that apparently is what Georgia has done.  And it doesn't require people to go out and spend $10 or $5 or something digging up their birth certificate, which if you tried to do, is quite a job for many people.  And therefore, you'd have all the things you want.  All you would do is with the 43,000 people who don't have the IDs, you'd say we'll get you one.  No big deal.  You have a photo machine there when they come in to register; they have to go down; you take a picture of them and you hand it to them.  And I would think that that less restrictive way would satisfy your anti fraud interests far better than the way you've chosen, but I leave my judgment out of it.  I just would like you to talk through why that isn't a less restrictive way, which is far better in achieving your anti fraud interests, or at least as good.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We are going to give... all we are doing is, we will give you the photo.  It has nothing to do with validity.  That photo proves that Mr. Smith who comes in and asks for it is the same Mr. Smith who registered to vote.  And that's all your system does in the first place.  So what is the answer to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not arguing about that.  I'm saying your whole... I'll repeat it once more.  I'm saying your whole system is a system designed to assure that the person at the voting booth is the same as the person who registers.  I accept that, absolutely right.  And I'm simply saying given that, why didn't you say Mr. Proto... Mr. Likely, like to register:  ""Come in. ""  ""If you don't have a photo ID, we will give you one. ""  Now, what's the objection to that?   ",07-21XX
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Could you go back to the--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I just wondered if you could say in a minute.  One possibility is that the amendment gives nothing more than a right to the State to raise a militia.  A second possibility is that it gives an individual right to a person, but for the purpose of allowing people to have guns to form a militia.  Assume the second.  If you assume the second, I wanted you to respond if you... unless you have done so fully already, to what was the Chief Justice's question of why, on the second assumption, this ban on handguns, not the other part, of the District of Columbia, a total ban, why is that a reasonable regulation viewed in terms of the purposes as I described them?   INTERRUPTING ",07-290X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You're saying that this is unreasonable, and that really is my question because I'd like you to assume two things with me, which you probably don't agree with, and I may not agree with them, either.  [Laughter]  But I just want you to assume them for the purpose of the question.  All right.  Assume that the... that there is an individual right, but the purpose of that right is to maintain a citizen army; call it a militia; that that's the basic purpose.  So it informs what's reasonable and what isn't reasonable.  Assume... and this is favorable to you but not as favorable as you'd like... assume that we are going to decide whether something is proportionate or apply an intermediate standard in light of the purpose.  Now, focus on the handgun ban.  As I read these 80 briefs... and they were very good, I mean really good and informative on both sides... and I'm trying to boil down the statistics where there is disagreement, and roughly what I get... and don't quarrel with this too much; it's very rough... that 80,000 to 100,000 people every year in the United States are either killed or wounded in gun-related homicides or crimes or accidents or suicides, but suicide is more questionable.  That's why I say 80,000 to 100,000.  In the District, I guess the number is somewhere around 200 to 300 dead; and maybe, if it's similar, 1,500 to 2,000 people wounded.  Now, in light of that, why isn't a ban on handguns, while allowing the use of rifles and muskets, a reasonable or a proportionate response on behalf of the District of Columbia?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I didn't read... I read the two military briefs as focusing on the nature of the right, which was quite a pretty good argument there that the nature of the right is to maintain a citizen Army.  And to maintain that potential today, the closest we come is to say that there is a right for people to understand weapons, to know how to use them, to practice with them.  And they can do that, you see, with their rifles.  They can go to gun ranges, I guess, in neighboring States.  But does that make it unreasonable for a city with a very high crime rate, assuming that the objective is what the military people say, to keep us ready for the draft, if necessary, is it unreasonable for a city with that high crime rate to say no handguns here?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, why?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you want to say yes, that's correct, but I want to hear what the reasoning is because there is a big crime problem.  I'm simply getting you to focus on that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That brings me back to the question because Blackstone describes it as a right to keep and bear arms ""under law"".  And since he uses the words ""under law"", he clearly foresees reasonable regulation of that right.  And so does the case not hinge on, even given all your views, on whether it is or is not a reasonable or slightly tougher standard thing to do to ban the handgun, while leaving you free to use other weapons?  I mean, I notice that the militia statute, the first one, spoke of people coming to report, in 1790, or whenever, with their rifles, with their muskets, but only the officers were to bring pistols.  So that, to me, suggests they didn't see pistols as crucial even then, let alone now.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's your response to the question?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why... now, when say ""keep"" and ""bear"", I mean you are... I think you're on to something here.  Because you say let's use our common sense and see what would be the equivalent today.  Fine.  If we know that at the time, in 1789, Massachusetts had a law that said you cannot keep loaded firearms in the house, right, and you have to keep all of the bullets and everything and all of the powder upstairs, why did they have that law?  To stop fires because it's dangerous?  They didn't have fire departments.  Now we do... or they weren't as good.  We now have police departments, and the crime wave might be said similar to what were fires then.  And, therefore, applying the similar kind of thing, you say: Fine, just as you could keep pistols loaded but not... not loaded.  You had to keep powder upstairs because of the risk of fire.  So today, roughly, you can say no handguns in the city because of the risk of crime.  Things change.  But we give in both instances, then and now, leeway to the city and States to work out what's reasonable in light of their problems.  Would that be a way of approaching it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not self-defense being the harm.  And I agree with you that this, the firearm analogy, floats up there, but it isn't going to decide this case, the Massachusetts statute.  I agree with you about that.  What you've suddenly given me the idea of doing, which I'm testing, is to focus not just on what the kind of weapon is... don't just look to see whether it's a cannon or a machine gun, but look to see what the purpose of this regulation is, and does it make sense in terms of having the possibility of people trained in firearms?  Let's look at those military briefs.  Let's say that the generals have it right, there is some kind of right to keep trained in the use of firearms subject to regulation.  We have regulation worried about crime, back to my first question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Thinking of your exchange with the Chief Justice and think of the trigger lock in your view and what the question was, do you want... I don't know how well trigger locks work or not... but do you want thousands of judges all over the United States to be deciding that kind of question rather than the city councils and the legislatures that have decided it in the context of passing laws?  I mean, isn't there an issue here and a problem with respect to having courts make the kinds of decisions about who is right or not in that trigger-lock argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  Whose judgment is that to--   ",07-290X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can you explain one thing to me?  I take it that they... everybody says they went through all the right IRS hoops to get back three years' worth of damages, i.e., they get their payments back and they get interest.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what they want is they want three years before that.   Stephen G. Breyer  And they're too late under Title 26.  So what you're saying is, one, you can't get any interest and, two, you can't get your money back at all.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm saying for three years they're home-free.  They get their payment back and they get their interest.  Now let's go to the three preceding years.  I'm a little confused about that because I can't work out... I suppose that the government is saying: You get nothing, you don't get your money back, and you don't get your interest.  Or is the government saying: You get your money back; you just don't get the interest?  Which is it?  And I don't see how it could be the latter.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING ",07-308X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Your point is that you don't have to go through the refund requirements of 7422 if the government was... although it did ask for the money as a tax, they are really out to lunch?  I mean, the trouble... is there any authority for an argument like that?  I mean, the trouble I guess that I would have that argument is, one is linguistic, because it goes on to say  ""or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected. ""  And then the other thing is just common sense: Suppose you have an insane tax collector.  You know, I mean, that could happen.  And the insane tax collector they discover some years later has been assessing all these penalties for no reason and people have been paying some of them because, terrible tragedy, terrible thing.  But I guess they'd be stuck, I'd always thought, with the three-year statute of limitations, so even those it's really nuts.  Now, is there... is there any authority for us making a distinction between an insane... to get an extreme, an insane assessment of a tax and just a wrongful assessment of a tax?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  What about the ""any sum"", ""in any manner""?  You know, what about that language?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  ""Any sum in any manner wrongfully collected. ""   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Their argument is, I'm terribly sorry, that if the way you're hurt is you paid a tax you shouldn't pay and you want to get a refund, go through the administrative procedure.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In looking at your argument, I see it now, I think, if I'm right.  You're... that it would have very broad reach.  It would reach... it doesn't just concern the constitutional claim; it concerns any claim you'd have against the IRS.  And there's authority that says if the IRS's position is too far out, you can go get an injunction.  That's what you're pointing to.  And then you're argument is, because of that authority, that kind of an exception for the far out IRS claim also applies to the statute of limitation and administrative requirement.  And your problem is the latter has never been held.  And the reason that that's a problem, I take it, is because when you're talking about injunctions, you're talking about basic equity, but when you're talking about later on administrative requirements, there's really no reason they couldn't have filed the claim.  And if we were to accept an argument on the... to the contrary and analogize it, it's going to cut through rules, regulations, statutes, constitutional claims, everything, really making a hash of their provision there... of the administrative provision.  So, what is your response to that thought which--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --What do you want to do about your argument, as I hear it, has nothing to do with the nature of the claim that you're asserting to get the money back.  It has to do with the nature of the IRS's defense and... well, can you do it that way?  Can you say the word ""any tax"" or ""any claim""... I can't remember that other.  What was it?  It was any... ""any sum""... ""any sum"" or ""any tax"".  Can you say, well, it means one thing if they are saying that the reason they want it back is that it violates the Constitution, and those words mean a different thing if the reason that you want it back is it violates an IRS reg; it violates an IRS statute.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if it doesn't mean anything different and then if the very far-out claim to a tax is so far out it isn't a tax, that would be true in the regulation context, in the statutory context as well as the constitutional context.  Am I missing something?   INTERRUPTING ",07-308X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't understand that.  If it's never confirmed, then I guess the tax is okay, isn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  But so what?  Isn't that... I mean, I assume that's totally illegal, that you get... I thought we're talking about this provision where everybody agrees that it has to be under a plan confirmed under section 1129.  So if there's no plan confirmed, I don't know how you would fall within this exemption.   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  If it's your point exactly, then I guess I must agree with that.  I'll hear from the other side.  Except I thought your point was it makes it difference whether the transfer takes place before the plan is confirmed or after.  So I may be just confused about that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, no, I'm asking you this.  You then concede... let me for my own point of view; forget what the... maybe I'm confused about the facts or maybe I'm not.  But let's suppose there is a plan and it is confirmed.  The transfer, however, took place a month earlier where a private group of creditors came together, every creditor, with the debtor and they worked out a sale tomorrow, and they transferred the assets tomorrow.  Four months later, the plan that includes every word of that goes before the bankruptcy judge, the bankruptcy judge thoroughly understands the situation, and he says: I confirm the plan.  Now, under those... in that circumstance, I guess you now are... are you prepared to concede that Florida cannot tax?   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course not.  So then... then the fact that there is no plan seems to me irrelevant, that situation, from the present case.  So now let's look at this case, where there is a plan and it is confirmed.  My question, going back to what I thought the facts are, is this: Imagine the situation I've just described... thorough investigation later by the bankruptcy judge; plan including it is confirmed.  And you say if the transfer took place first you can assert your tax, but if the transfer took place second, after the plan, you can't.  And my question, if I'm right on my assumption, is I'd like you to provide a reason why any human being, a reasonable human being, would want to make that distinction?  Why would anyone want to say we want to give all the money to the creditors and not let Florida get some if it takes place, the transfer, after the confirmation, but would think differently about it and would want Florida to get some if the transfer takes place before the confirmation, which confirmation describes everything in depth, is thoroughly investigated, et cetera?  What reason could there be for such a distinction?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not speaking of the language for the moment.  I want you to forget about the language and assume the language is ambiguous.  That's a different question.  My question is, assuming that the language is ambiguous, as every lower court has found, assuming that, however, is there any reason why a reasonable human being would make this distinction?  That's my question.  And there may be an answer, but I want to know what answer is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That is not an answer.  [Laughter]  I would appreciate an answer to the question.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's the problem?  If that's the problem, I thought that there had to be a filing for bankruptcy before any of this kicks in.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Then the answer can't be you could go back 50 years.  The answer would have to be you go back until the filing for bankruptcy.   Stephen G. Breyer  What?  That's what I want to know.  And I'll add a qualification.  I'd say I would read into this a context, and the context is the whole section that gives the exemption from the State law only kicks in when you file for bankruptcy.  So, I... now, it's my question.  I guess I could make the hypothetical the the way I want to make it, and the way I want to make it is that this section applies once it kicks in, the bankruptcy filing, and it does not distinguish between the pre and the post-confirmation, you know, where the confirmation takes place after the transfer or the transfer after the confirmation.  You're arguing to the contrary.  And what I want to know is what reason there is?  Do I have to repeat the question?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is the reason?  That's what I want you to focus on, for making that distinction.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And it's not the litigation.  What you've said so far is, at least as I have taken it in, that the practical harm is the following: There will be a certain number of transfers that take place after the filing, but before the actual confirmation; and in respect to those transfers, the State is left in a position of uncertainty.  You don't know if you can assert your tax or not assert your tax until that transfer is later confirmed as part of the confirmed plan or not.  That's what I take it as you're having said.  And then I think I'll hear in a minute somebody say, but that kind of uncertainty is rife in the tax laws.  It often occurs that a taxing authority is not certain about how to characterize a transaction until later events take place which are part of, or related to, the transaction; and the IRS and all the State tax departments survive.  So if I'm right in guessing that, discuss.  [Laughter]  That's all I can say.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why can't you just say that?  Why can't you say, you want to record this taxation, pay the tax.  And when you come in later, because it was confirmed, show us the paper.  We'll give you the money back.  How does that interfere with... with anything?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why is it an administrative burden?  The burden is entirely on the people who want their money back.  They come in.  They file a piece of paper.  It says Federal bankruptcy judge signed, plan confirmed, and it would take, I guess, a few minutes to read through it to see they're telling the truth, which you always have the problem in a tax, and then you give them their money back.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Of course, you can't file it if they don't tell the State.  So if they're not going to tell you, they're not going to have their transfer recorded.  I mean, look, we're going into this, and on the other side, of course, there is the following consideration: That there are creditors who are owed a lot of money; and all these creditors are in a room; and they think, if I can sell these assets tomorrow, I'm going to get a lot more money than I will if I have to wait for six months.  That's why we want to go through with this.  Now isn't that an important bankruptcy interest, to make the creditors more whole?   Stephen G. Breyer  It's on page 38, the last line, the next to the last line.   Stephen G. Breyer  The red brief.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I'm sorry.  Doesn't the rejection have to take place prior to the plan being confirmed?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Does it or doesn't it?  Prior to in your opinion or not prior to?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm sorry.  I don't understand how that would work.  I have a contract with Boeing for $500 million.  I decide to reject it.  Now if that breach doesn't occur until the plan is confirmed, how does the trust... how does bankruptcy judge know how to treat Boeing as a creditor?   Stephen G. Breyer  I understand that.  But I'm sorry... doesn't the plan which its confirmed have a list of the creditors and how they are treated?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  How do we write the plan if, in fact, no breach has occurred and he hasn't become a creditor until the plan is, in fact, confirmed?   INTERRUPTING ",07-312X

Now, assume for the sake of argument that he has correctly identified a problem with that.  Now, my understanding is that once the limit is exceeded and you have this extra amount, three things happen: One, an individual could contribute two or three times the amount to the party directly.  A second possibility is an individual who has exceeded the global amount now gets a bump up and can contribute.  And the third thing is the party thing.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  There is no... there is doubt in my mind that this particular kind of crime has not been the subject of a Supreme Court opinion.  My problem is I can think of many, many awful, truly horrible circumstances that categorized in many different... under many different criminal statutes; I'm not a moralist.  I'm a judge.  As a judge, I look at the law.  It seems for 43 years, no one has been executed but for murder.  Moreover, this Court has never approved the execution for any crime other than murder in those 43 years.  Right.  If I accept your argument, since I'm not a moralist, since I can think of horrible things all over the place, have I then opened the door so that, in fact, States will find lots of different crimes which are seriously horrible; and suddenly, we will be in the business of creating under the Constitution some kind of highly complex categorization, really a moral categorization of crime, method of commitment, method of, et cetera, et cetera.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So the answer is yes?  Your answer is if we take your position and that's... I'm not saying it's not a good argument, just take your position, but if we take your position, I can think of instances of kidnapping; I can think of instances of torture.  I can think of instances all over the place which are truly horrible.  But then to take your position, what we're going to do is we are going to say legislatures all over the country do have the right under the Constitution to go, try to categorize horrible by horrible, not just death.  Not just murder.   Stephen G. Breyer  Perhaps at the time, 200 years ago, that's true.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And it's not true... I've read the definition of section 41 of rape under the Louisiana code.  I won't repeat it but it's very broad.  And it can broad in the sense that rape itself can include a vast number of instances of child molesting, each of which is bad; but there are degrees.  So I suppose that child molesting of all those kinds that are listed in 41 (c)(1) and (2), which you know I'm sure, would count as rape if committed on a person under 12.  Some are absolutely horrible.  Some are just bad.  But that's what the other side means when he says it gives tremendous discretion to the prosecutor to pick and choose who should be executed needs further narrowing.  What's your response.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Those are the only two.  So these other things don't count.   Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can you... can you give me one second on my own error here, but I just traced the statute through.  What I did was I looked at section 42.  It says,  ""aggravated rape is a rape committed upon, et cetera. ""  and then it says  ""where the victim is under the age of 13. ""  Right.  So it doesn't say what rape is.  So I assumed it picked up the definition of rape from section 41.  And section 41 defines rape as anal or oral or vaginal sexual intercourse, and then in section three it defines oral.  Now am I right; is that the correct statutory thing, or is there some other statute?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then I go back to my if that is the right statutory thing, because it seems to cover, particularly in its definition of oral intercourse, a very wide range of child molesting, all of which I agree is quite bad, but it's still a very, very wide range.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't say it wasn't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I mean, my question relates back to what Justice Souter was talking about, about the narrowing of the statute.   Stephen G. Breyer  You started out by saying it's the worst cases of child abuse, and that's... child rape... and that's why I was interested in the definition.  It seems to me this definition simply covers all instances of some kind of physical intercourse with a child, including oral, vaginal, anal.  I can't imagine one that wouldn't be covered if the victim of this is under the age of 13.  Now, am I right in thinking it's not the worst instances; it's every instance of rape defined that way?   Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.   Stephen G. Breyer  So the amendment--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Thank you.  I see.   Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What happens in Texas?   Stephen G. Breyer  No counsel right would attach?   Stephen G. Breyer  But they didn't... they don't--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What is the law here in Texas in respect to this particular magistration proceeding?  I noticed what happened is that the magistrate tells the person arrested, he says precisely:  ""I find probable cause to believe. ""  that you...  ""that there was probable cause to arrest you. ""  That's what they say, right?  It said:  ""I have determined that probable cause existed for the arrest of the individual accused therein. ""  All right.  Now, what happens... and I think it would be helpful to know the answer to this... in what might be a rare instance, but the truth of the matter is there was probable cause to arrest that individual when he was arrested, but there isn't now.  So because he came in... you know, he said here's 14 cousins, I was somewhere else at the time, they all agree.  I mean, everybody agrees on a certain fact that means there isn't now.  And what I'm driving at is does the magistrate here... is he required, does he have the power to commit someone, even though he honestly believes there is no longer probable cause, in which case he is making the decision, the magistrate, not the policeman?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I could... I can think there would be tremendous constitutional significance and it would make a difference if all that's really happening is a policeman is arresting someone, in which case we might have liberty interests and others at issue.  But what's happening in this proceeding is that the magistrate is deciding that there is probable cause to hold him, in which case it's more like, not completely like, but more like what happens in an indictment or an arraignment, et cetera.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  But I want to know what's Texas law, if you know it, in respect to that question?   Stephen G. Breyer  So we have a magistrate who has to find that there is... no, to make the arrest or to hold him now?  Do you see what I'm doing?   Stephen G. Breyer  Do you see why I'm doing it?  So, what's the answer, if you know?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I know there may not be, but what about in general.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  That's what I would think.  In which case we have before us bringing this person before a State official who himself has the power to decide if there is probable cause to hold him, and he is saying, yes, there is probable cause to hold him.  That's... that's what's happening; is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose you were to say that where the State arrests an individual, brings him before a neutral official and intends and does impose a significant restraint on his liberty for the purpose of bringing that individual to trial, there is a presumption that that... forget the presumption.  If that happens for the purpose, the primary purpose, primary purpose of bringing the individual to trial, at that point the Sixth Amendment right attaches.  Now, the State would not have to give him a lawyer if there was some other purpose primary, for example, as in Gouveia, keeping the prisons safe.  For example, it's quite clear under the circumstances, there are 14 people accused, they couldn't have all have done it, they want to investigate further.  Or maybe there are other examples.  But, for the primary purpose, then the right attaches.  So you pick up Gerstein and add to Gerstein that additional requirement.  What about that?  What harm would that cause?  What inconvenience would it cause, what difficulties, et cetera?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And you couldn't... you couldn't because of the fact that bail... if you're going to insist on bail, that in effect is incarceration.  But the reason I asked the question, which I would ask you the same, is there are a lot of States, we're told, that do have counsel attach in circumstances similar to this.  So they must have some way of dealing with the problem that I raised if it's really a problem.  And I want to... and that's... and I want to... if we're going into this, I think I need to know how this is dealt with.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You see, you would have given him a counsel.  I mean, in fact, if he had wanted one, Texas would give him one.  So Texas must have... it must not be a problem.  The problem, I just--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  So the problem I raise can't be a real problem.   ",07-440X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  General, that is... my question would be the converse.  Suppose I agreed with you to this point hypothetically that, of course, there's a relationship here.  In this case, there's a relationship.  He wouldn't have lied if he... if he hadn't had the explosives.  Suppose I accept that.  Now, if I interpret the statute that way... there has to be a relationship, but including that... then what are the other cases you want to prosecute?  In the other briefs they list every funny or comical or absurd example they can find; and so I don't believe you want to prosecute those, but tell me if you do.  And if there are some other ones, what are they?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  So suppose, in other words, if we... if, hypothetically, I were to say, well, here there's a relationship; after all, it is a necessary condition for the lying that he was carrying explosives; and it is foreseeable that he would lie on his passport, because he was carrying explosives illegally.  So that's all you need.  In other words, if that were the decision, you would say fine, that's the end of it.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, it didn't facilitate it, but it caused it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if it didn't... all right.  Would you be satisfied with a result that says, look, if this carrying of explosives is related to the felony in the sense that it is a necessary condition and foreseeable that a person would do such a thing, that's sufficient?   ",07-455X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why should we agree with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's exactly what's bothering me.  The issue in this case doesn't seem to me to be these weird hypotheticals.  Of course it requires a relationship, in my mind.  But I don't see why the relationship couldn't be exactly the one Justice Alito was talking about.  I mean, imagine a person has a packed car filled with explosives.  He's going to blow something up.  A policemen comes up; he shoots the policeman.  The reason he shot the policeman was because he had his car packed with explosives.  And if this... if this provision... I mean, I can't understand why this provision wouldn't be aimed directly at that kind of thing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Suppose I don't agree with you about that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That may be, but I don't know... but you could say that.  You could say that.  But the problem is I have to answer the question... I have to reach an answer that I believe should be sensible.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what should I do--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --if I think that shooting the policeman because he's going to catch the criminal filled with explosives is within this statute?  And similarly, lying to a customs officer so he won't catch me when my car is filled with explosives is within the statute?  Suppose I believe that, but I also think the statute is not meant to govern those odd hypotheticals that you come up with?  There has to be a relationship, but the one I described falls within the word ""relationship"".  Now what do I do?   Stephen G. Breyer  I understand that argument.  But suppose I don't accept the argument?  Then what do I do in this case?  That's what I'm asking.   ",07-455X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Standing itself, I mean, it's a little unusual.  Suppose -- I mean, Congress here has passed a statute and the statute specifically aims at a class of litigants.  And it says to the class of litigants, if you are a member of it, we are telling you what we want the agency to do and that is to promulgate a certain appeal procedure.  Now, if you are a member of the class that frequently litigates and you frequently take advantage of that procedure, why aren't you heard as a litigant, at least enough for Article III?  And we know as far as prudential standing is concerned, Congress wanted to give you standing, so I think would it take care of that.  Are you saying no matter -- that just normal litigants in the courts who reappear time and time again in certain kinds of cases, don't have standing to challenge a procedural rule, if Congress under Article III and Congress specifically tells them they can?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let's imagine that Congress did, Congress did say: By the way, lawyers who have handled 17 tort cases in the last year where the value has been more than $500,000 and who will sign an affidavit saying they intend to continue in that branch may appeal from the court's promulgation of the following general rule, dah, dah, dah.  And that Constitution prohibits Congress from doing that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  Those who -- fine, forget that, yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You mean Article III and at Westminster -- at Westminster, when Westminster, whatever they had, they must have had some procedural rules, and sometimes they had general procedural rules -- I don't know what the history is; I could look it up.  But I would be amazed if the lawyers at that time or the clients who had certain cases were not permitted to challenge those rules as contrary to some other rules.  Do we know the answer to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no.  Generally.  Because you have a special procedure, here's what you can generally challenge our rules.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, then your answer is, if Congress says you can do it, have a general challenge to people who generally appear, your answer is if Congress says they could do it, Article III doesn't stop them?   Stephen G. Breyer  Ah.  What's the answer to that different question?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Ah, but--   Stephen G. Breyer  --And I am pursuing this, but I'm actually having a hard time with this.  Suppose -- suppose Congress passes a statute; the statute says every citizen of the United States has a right to receive notice of a certain set of Forest Service actions.  Everybody.  We want everybody who wants it to have notice.  Now, if somebody really wants that notice and they don't get it, can they sue?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Sorry.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In any case, I'm trying to make it look like FOIA.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's just what I am trying to do, and you say yes, they probably could, at least if you are just supposed to get a piece of paper that says ""Notice"".  Now suppose Congress says, if you can show you are the kind of person who regularly asks and needs such notices, and if a regulation is promulgated interpreting this statute, you can challenge that reg prior to enforcement.  Now does that violate Article III?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose they did this.  Suppose they said each agency has the legal power to promulgate regs interpreting FOIA as to when you get the thing, and when you don't, and moreover people who are regular FOIA requesters can challenge those regs prior to enforcement; what about that one?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I am looking for a principle that is going to help me.   ",07-463X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The problem they are asking you on this -- it was at least a problem for me -- I think it's tough on rightness is because the government is saying here: Look, you want to challenge it outside the context of a particular action that you don't like.  Well, there's never going to be an action, never going to be such an action that we are going to take that you won't find out about, that you will not be able to challenge in that context if you are really hurt.  There isn't one.  You can't name one that's ever been or imagine one that ever will be, okay?  Now, is that so?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You see where they are going next.  And if you -- suppose that the thing you just told me, too, has problems or suppose it's pretty hard to find one, then the -- why this has never been decided and why it's difficult.  Because I would start with Abbott Labs and say there are three considerations.  How easy is it now to solve the legal problem?  Here?  Perfectly easy.  Nothing's going to change.  Factor two, how likely is it that they will work with this legal rule and change it around here?  Zero.  But three, what kind of harm is it going to cause to the plaintiff if you were to deny him relief now?  And they are saying here that's also zero or next to zero.  So what do you do if the factor that cuts one way is zero and the factor that cuts the other way is zero, or near zero?  Now, I have to admit I have never seen a case on that.  I don't know if there has been one before, and I don't know exactly what to do.  And if you can go read the appendix, maybe I can escape the zero.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can I go back to standing for a minute.   Stephen G. Breyer  You may have looked this up and may have found something here.  Suppose an organization that has a purely ideological interest, so it can't get into Federal court, nonetheless can go before an agency; but they are not going to get into Federal court.  Now, suppose that agency then has a reg that they think is lawful and makes their life more difficult.  I guess that the fact that they suffer a procedural injury would not get them into court.  They are already somebody who doesn't; they don't.  So I can imagine cases saying that.  Contrast that with the case with a person who has a very concrete specific injury, a terrible allergy to chemical X, and they often litigate that there is too much chemical X, and now they are before an agency and they frequently complain about chemical X, but they don't have a particular case, but they will often be there.  Now, the agency promulgates a procedural regulation that hurts those people who normally have a concrete injury.  All right?  There I wonder if that purely procedural injury cannot serve as a basis for standing.  Now, do the cases ask -- so I am contrasting the two kinds of questions, and I wonder what you found in the cases as to the second kind, as opposed to the first kind; and you are free to answer this as one word  ""nothing; go look it up yourself, which is a fair comment. ""  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You think you are like the second?   ",07-463X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What about he didn't like him?  I'm the supervisor; I didn't like him.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, you say related.  If the truth is I don't like this person, good-bye, now, is that rational?  When you say... I mean, you know as much about the case now as I do... not this case but, you know, that's all we know.  Is that rational or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now that seems to me to be the problem, that either... going back to Justice Scalia's point, you're either going to say rational in these circumstances, which means you go into it whether the time sheet was this or whether it was that or the other; or you say, hey, it's always rational because he could have fired him because he doesn't like the person.  That's... and I don't see some intermediate step there.  To put the question differently, every government has a, State and Federal, has an administrative procedures act.  That forbids unreasonable, arbitrary action.  But why do they need that if the Constitution does it by itself?   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know if that's... that's why I started this.  I read through, at least briefly, the circuit cases in this area.  I was trying to figure it out.  And it seemed to me that those circuit cases just really are finding some reason to dismiss the employee's claim, that they are not taking this seriously, that is... I mean, I don't want to criticize them because I don't know the facts of the case; but I couldn't figure out a standard.  And then I thought, well, the standard has to be the APA standard, and if it's... I know that standard.  And the reason that you don't have a million cases under that standard is because States have civil service systems.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So it seemed to me that's the standard you want to apply.  You want to bring all those cases into Federal court, and I'm not sure they are doing it now, really, in practice.  Now what's wrong with what I've just said?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, but you could... you could take sentiment... I thought you could break the cases, for the most part, into two parts; one, what Justice Ginsburg said, and that's where the real reason is some kind of general characteristic, of a disfavored group.  The second is the instance where the... where the body that's acting is a body whose business it is to classify.  That's zoning, taxation, and it means really classifying in fact, not some theoretical thing where you say, oh, well, they're classifying it employment because they put you in the class of such and such.  But those two seem to me to handle the bulk of the cases, which, if I'm right about that, would leave your client out in the cold.  So I assume you'll tell me why I'm not right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I wondered if I was right, you know; that I thought that maybe, looking back, that there is something about zoning and taxation where it normally is alleged that it's rule-making activity.  And that perhaps you would apply all of these things you are talking about where what the... even if it is employment, where what the employer is doing, or anyone else is doing, is creating rules, is classifying.  And not a made-up classification like you put me and one other fired person in the fired-person category.  I don't mean that.  I mean like taxation and zoning and legislation.  Is there anything to that?   Lisa S. Blatt  There is some support in the case law, but what I think your concurring opinion was trying to do was to help local and State governments.  And it is one thing to say the mayor denied my building permit, and I'm going to make the employee allege animus, and that might be difficult to do.  But for someone on the mayor's staff, it's not that difficult to allege animus on the part of your supervisor.  Employment frictions are inherent in the workplace, and perceptions of unfair treatment readily arise by an employee who thinks he or she was unfairly treated.   ",07-474X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you think the answer is yes, I mean, because--   Stephen G. Breyer  --because the Administrative Procedures Act forbids arbitrary, capricious action.  So you're saying the Constitution--   Stephen G. Breyer  --does not constitutionalize all--   Stephen G. Breyer  --arbitrary, capricious behavior--   Stephen G. Breyer  --of the Federal--  Government--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --or the State government.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  So the answer is yes.  Okay.   ",07-474X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I am quite curious why -- I am curious, why did you answer Justice Alito's question ""yes""?  I -- I would have thought that if you win this case, the Attorney General would still have tremendous leeway in deciding where, when, under what circumstances, the duress defense applied.  Why isn't that so?   Stephen G. Breyer  If that's right, then why do you not -- why was your answer yes?   ",07-499X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why not any statute?  I'm mean, starting where Justice Kennedy left off, you said a hundred years.  It's thousands of years.  You could go back into the history of the human race--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and you will discover, of course, that your word ""involuntary"" is never something where the action is involuntary that we praise or blame people.  Rather, every action where we praise or blame people must be a voluntary action.  The classic example is: ""The wind blew my arm"".  Now, you are saying that if this person's arm was blown by the wind, that this statute prevents him having asylum in the United States or having -- you know, withholding.  How could one assume that involuntary actions are covered by this statute -- are not covered?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Are covered.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Then once you say that, then let's talk about intentional actions.   Stephen G. Breyer  And are you going to have intentional actions?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because praise or blame typically involves a voluntary action, an intentional action, and an action where there is a degree of freedom, which is to say that the choice is not too skewed.  And we see that in the criminal law by a reading into statutes that say nothing of the word ""intentional"", and by the use of the duress defense.  Now what reason do we have for thinking that Congress didn't mean these words here in exactly that way, which traces back at least to Aristotle?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, but Aristotle doesn't say criminal law.  He says praise or blame.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's absolutely right.  But do you think Congress intended that this absolute bar should apply where the person is in no sense blameworthy?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  People use that word ""intent"" in the course of the human race to encompass the notion of duress.  I mean, that's -- that's sometimes done, sometimes not.  They are part and parcel of the same thing, which is whether you can blame the person for what he did.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In criminal law they were not, I agree--   Stephen G. Breyer  --because that's -- because we've seen the need for specificity.  But the question, I think, Justice Stevens had, and certainly I have, is why do you read some aspects of what it takes to hold a person responsible into the statute, but you don't read other aspects of what it takes to hold a person responsible morally into the statute?   ",07-499X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why, if there is no negligence?  Why do you need to argue that and why do you argue that?  I mean doesn't there have to be at least negligence on somebody's part?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, either of those things are negligence or worse.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what I didn't understand is why you would charge the police with anything or suppress a warrant where there was a mistake but no one was negligent or worse.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But what you argued for--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --you said, it should be suppressed even if no one is negligent or worse.  And I have trouble seeing why you're suppressing a warrant where no one does anything wrong at all.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, I don't know what the underlying law is here.  I mean -- I guess it's little weird, but what happens if the policeman arrests the wrong person, but it's nobody's fault?  You know, the person was pretending to be his brother.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or the mother said it's John and it's really Joe.  And so, the policeman wasn't at fault.  They arrest the wrong person.  I guess that's happened in history--   Stephen G. Breyer  --but do they suppress things then?  I wouldn't think so--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --but maybe they do.   Stephen G. Breyer  But do we suppress?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We do not?  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So there's no reason then, if we don't suppress when there's no error in the part of the policeman, none, it was just a weird circumstance, then I don't understand why we would suppress here.  And nor do I understand why you have to argue this because I thought it's clear here that there is error, and it was negligently caused.  There were four months that went by without anybody doing anything about this mistake.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can I use 30 seconds of your eight minutes because I want some clarity on this.     Stephen G. Breyer  Divide in your mind two separate things: The nature of the bad conduct: is it negligent, reckless, deliberate; and the other question is who engaged in it -- a police department official or some other official?  I thought this case was about the second question, but now I'm confused about the first question because I suppose a policeman, an arresting officer makes a negligent error.  He goes to the wrong house.  And he never looks at the number; and he arrests, starts to arrest the wrong person: Is the evidence suppressed?  If the evidence isn't suppressed, frankly, I don't see why a clerical official should be held to a higher standard; but if the evidence is suppressed then quite possibly the clerical official should be held to the same standard.  So you've heard the government say well, the answer isn't clear; very often a negligent official -- a negligent officer would not have that evidence suppressed.  Well, what is it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He was not.   Stephen G. Breyer  I want to know if he is negligent.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Excuse me, because I think I'm getting a different view from the government.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So we've got this--   INTERRUPTING ",07-513X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  There is one question I have in my mind, and it's the only factor I thought of hypothetically that cuts against you.  This is the argument and I'd like you to respond to it.  I take everything you said as so.  I'll assume all that.  And so I'd still say the rule, the basic rule of suppression, putting Leon to the side, basic rule is -- the opposite of Holmes: If the constable blunders, you suppress the evidence.  Okay.  Now, our prior case -- here we have a case where the constable blundered.  I grant you, not the arresting officers.  It was a different policeman, and it was a different form of error.  But five months this thing -- this warrant had been recalled five months earlier and you agree that it was negligent.  Therefore, the constable blundered.  And the virtue of our earlier case where we said don't suppress, it wasn't the constable who blundered.  So I see an absolutely clear line: If the constable blunders you suppress; if it's somebody else who blundered, you don't.  Now, every time I've tried to think of a substitute for that clear line, I've run into trouble.  I've been sitting in my chambers with my law clerks and we've tried out five substitutes, and I can't find one decent substitute that isn't filled with problems.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is your substitute?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  Well, I'm overstating my point.  What I'm really driving at and trying to show you is you, if you want to have a different rule than within the prior case, remember the one where it wasn't the police that blundered, you have to come up with some rule.  And I want to know what your rule is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So now we have -- let's think about that.  The special rule is now we have the Leon exception and now we have a new exception, and the new exception is called for isolated police clerical errors.  Well, that's going to be interesting, I suspect.  The first thing you'll have when you try to impose your rule is you will have the defense attorneys throughout the city going in to see if it's an isolated error.  And they will, of course, have a right to decide whether or not this is the only such error, whether there are other clerical errors, how often they occur, what the -- is that an administrable rule?   Stephen G. Breyer  One other question.  Suppose that the error here consisted not of a computer, but rather Joe, who is the policeman, has a partner called Sam, and Sam told Joe that this is Harry Smith, when negligently it wasn't Harry Smith?  It was Joe Smith.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean does that count as a clerical error if, in fact, it's the man's partner who tells him this negligently?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Negligent.  It's Negligent police work.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's negligent error.  You mean we don't suppress the negligent errors of the partners who, after all, say, let's arrest this man over here, and through negligence they have got the wrong man?  We don't suppress?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There must be millions -- not millions, but there must have been cases where two policemen or one policeman goes off to arrest someone and negligently arrests the wrong man.  And when he does that and does a search, we don't suppress.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's Leon.  I'm not thinking that.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not thinking of a warrant.  I'm thinking of a policeman who has a warrant for Jack Smith and he goes to arrest Jack Brown because through negligence he went to the wrong house.  Now, under those circumstances would we suppress the drugs that happen to be found in Jack's house.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, there must have been a lot of cases.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what about the lower courts?  What have they done?   INTERRUPTING ",07-513X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Where -- where is it?  I mean, if you want to -- if you want to search, you can impound the car.  If you want to search, you can ask for consent, which you probably won't get.  If you want to search, you can look in the window.  There's no problem there.  It's just under the seat and in the glove compartment we're talking about.  If you have probable cause to think that there's evidence of a crime even in the glove compartment or underneath the seat, you can look at it without a warrant.  Why do you need this as well?  You say we need this as well because the guy who's locked up in back of the squad car might take off the handcuffs, open the door, run out, and grab a gun from under the glove compartment.  That's a little thin.  And then you say, well, the rule is it needs to be administrable.  And then I say, okay, the rule is administrable if you've got him locked up in the squad car and all you want to do is have a good snoop around, take it in and impound it.  That's administrable.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I got that point.  Are there many people, by the way, they arrest but they leave them standing outside the squad car?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean are we going to have one of these spectrum things?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's actually a serious point, maybe in your favor because it -- what was worrying me about this is, if you lose the case, there would be policemen who would then let dangerous people stay in the car so they could search it.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I mean I don't know if it can go off on that.  The -- it seems to me I -- I thought when I looked through this, which was quickly, it seemed to me everyone was assuming that it's contemporaneous.  Of course, if it isn't contemporaneous, that's a new world, and maybe you would win on that.  I don't know.  But don't we have to for present purposes take it as a contemporaneous search, which I think is what the lower courts found?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I'm sure there are, but what is your opinion?  I mean, is there some reason what I have been doing -- you can tell me -- I am finding this case very, very difficult.  And I am not at all certain in my own mind, and I am being quite frank with you.  And the reason is that although I don't think Belton is very logical, it has been the law for 27 years; and I take very seriously, as we all do, the principle of stare decisus.  That is why your response to Justice Alito really sort of shook me.  Because I was thinking, one, I have to take this as contemporaneous; and I have to run squarely into the problem that for some period of years Belton has been the law and maybe even before Belton.  I don't know about Thomas Jefferson's automobile.  But, nonetheless, no disaster has occurred, and so why would we overrule an earlier case?  Now that's -- that's exactly my problem.  And so if you were interested in that, you have to give me an answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well are you saying do you have any in my own mind perhaps differently from you I think that the stare decisus is really brought into play when you think the earlier decision was wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  And at that point I'd still need a reason why you should depart from that earlier decision at the moment what the other side says is we tell our police a simple thing.  We tell them when you arrest somebody who is in a car you can search the passenger compartment of the car okay.  Simple.  And we've trained a hundred thousand police officers to do that and they do it.  Now, is there some indication that that's turned out to be abusive?  Is there indication that there are other problems with the rule, has it turned out to be complicated?  What kinds of things you could say that will overcome what I'm putting forth as a kind of reluctance.   ",07-542X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But you -- what about -- I'm trying to work with this distinction where I agree with you that it's hard to see exactly what it is.  But if I look at Bazemore, I think there we have a large number of employees.  And if you look at a complicated thing, a salary structure, earlier, you see that that salary structure systemically paid black people less than white people.  And at the time, for whatever reasons, there wasn't a statute -- we assume that that was lawful at the time.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then later it turns out that they are keeping that salary structure, although not for racially motivated reasons.  They are keeping it simply because that's what it was.  And the Court says, you've taken that complex structure, and you are administering it now, and the administration of it now is what is unlawful.  Then, look at your case.  We had a complicated structure involving seniority, really.  And part of that old seniority system was this rule which was legal at the time.  It is no longer legal.  Now, we move that structure over until now, and we see we are administering the same complex structure today in the same kind of way that was at issue at Bazemore.  It's a complicated set of rules that you have to apply today in order to see who is entitled to what, just as they did that in Bazemore.  So I began to think, doesn't that, on the key matter, look very much like Bazemore?  What is your response?   ",07-543X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I take it you are not saying anything that is in effect and is still there, you do retro, you win.  I take it -- maybe I am not right, but I take it that what -- what the point is here is that you -- you took a complicated superstructure of rules that was creating boxes and those boxes were created on the basis of discrimination.  Then you move it, whole cloth, into the post-new world.  And it's the administration of that complicated system of rules that was created out of the discrimination, but it's administration today that makes it like Bazemore.   Stephen G. Breyer  It does that, but what I can't figure out is does that have a lot of implication for other areas or not?  And the other thing I'm not sure of is how it squares with Ledbetter.   INTERRUPTING ",07-543X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But you should have said ""no"" to the question, I think.  Because I thought the question -- whatever it was, you are saying that there isn't a reasonable likelihood that its error influenced the outcome.  You are not saying that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   ",07-544X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I agree with that.  And my question is going to be -- at some point, both of you seem to agree with that so -- pretty much, it's a harmless error standard of review.  I think a wrote a case on that, which says that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Right.  So why don't we just send it back and say apply the standard?   Stephen G. Breyer  You're saying that I should have grave doubt myself and any judge would have to.  He made an argument here I think that wasn't such a bad one.  He said look at page 14 and you'll see the mistake, you know, in the joint appendix.   Stephen G. Breyer  There it is.  And it's absolutely wrong.  The basic instruction under the law says you have to be engaged in the crime and you have to have a certain state of intent.  You have to have committed this murder in order to help the crime or at least in order to escape.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that's wrong.  Put them together, but then look at the instruction on page 13, which he actually gave, and the one on 13 really does seem to say that, or more so.  It says, you can only apply -- jury, you can only apply this special instruction if two things are true: First, in lines 9 through 12 of that instruction, it seems to repeat that you have to be engaged in the crime.  And then just before that, it says, and you have to have one of two states of mind.  You have to either intend to kill the person or at least be recklessly indifferent.  And since that's what we said on page 13, the fact we made a mistake on page 14 doesn't matter that much.  That's one of his arguments that I'm sure they have a lot of evidentiary ones and a bunch of other ones.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm sure that would be -- I mean, what worries me is proliferating arguments among judges.  Why not just say, you know, apply Brecht.  I'd like it with the O'Neal clause because it seems to me the O'Neal clause applies.   Stephen G. Breyer  Just go do it.  And then they can say ""we already did it"", or they can say  ""we didn't already do it, but we'll do it now. ""  Let them say what they want to say.   ",07-544X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You have a discovery problem.  I don't see that it's a standing problem.  And two things it reminds me of are, one very common, a financer takes an interest in receivables and he's going to have to collect them as receivables and there may be 50,000.  That could have the same kind of practical problems.  Or we had cases in the First Circuit you may or may not be aware of where somebody went around and had assignments for 50,000 cabbages that were delivered a day late in 50,000 box cars and each one was worth about $10.  Nobody figured a way out of that.  They had to pass a special statute.  There was... and so it seems to me you're better off than the cabbage people because have you two possible remedies: One on discovery; you could ask the judge, Judge, see what the Communications Commission thinks.  It's called primary jurisdiction of the kind.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or you could go to the FCC and you say, FCC, you got us into this.  Now, you have some rules here that make some sense in terms of collection.  You have both those agency avenues open to you, not open to the cabbage people, and this doesn't seem a standing problem.  Now, what's your response to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  How is that different?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Just on that very point... I need clarification on this.  How is that different than the case of the financer who takes accounts receivable, which is very common?  You finance the accounts.  You take a secured interest in accounts receivable.   Stephen G. Breyer  And there you might foreclose on the secured interests.  Then you as the financer have to collect from everybody.  How is your case different from that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In the respect you were just talking about.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know, but I mean, there may be many reasons for that.  I'm just saying it's a normal, practical problem, I believe, in the banking community.  I don't know.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Go back to my question, I'd like to get an answer to it.   Stephen G. Breyer  In respect to the problem you were just mentioning, the discovery problem of counterclaims or those problems, is this case any different than the financing case I just mentioned?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.   ",07-552X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well I guess it could be that you're asking them to go back into records that are somewhat old.  What you're asking to find out is... is every call made out of a payphone that was long distance call, and we don't even know who actually turned out to be the carrier.  It's like asking them, tell us exactly on the payphone at that corner over there who was called at 9:15 a.m. to some number in 1987, and maybe they should have records of that but they don't.  They have estimates--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --They say maybe the time necessary to go through those records, to figure out whether you should give 12 cents to the person who ran that payphone, is really not worth it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And therefore, if they are right in some claim like that, is there a way to get this worked out at the FCC?  I mean, it... it... I don't think it was the purpose of this statute to have 12 cent claims, even aggravated, brought back years later under some set of procedural rule that will be so expensive to get the discovery that this just won't be worth it.  Now that might be right.  And if it is right or whether it's right, can the FCC work this out?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm aware of that system.  I'm aware of that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  But my question is to get to that figure there may be billions of calls, for all I know.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it could be quite expensive to track down each of those calls individually.  I don't know if it is or not; but if it is, is there a way to get this problem worked out at the FCC or do we have the cabbage case grown large?   Stephen G. Breyer  In settlement they may work out.  But if it is... for example costs a dollar to fight a claim that's worth 12 cents, individually, before you get to billions, they don't want to be in that situation where they are really paying money for nothing; because in their opinion they already paid.  I mean we understand this kind of problem.  So I go back to my question.  They have one view of it; you have another of what's going on here.  And their view is very unfavorable to your clients and your clients' view is very unfavorable to their clients.  So I would like to know is there a way to get this worked out at the FCC?  Maybe that will turn out not to be relevant in this case but I'd still like to know your opinion.   Stephen G. Breyer  Do you... this is giving me a thought here.  Just a total imaginary case, nothing to do with your clients.  Put yourself in the opposite position.  Suppose you were representing a defendant and that defendant were asked by this imaginary plaintiff to dig up records on the computer.  To dig up each individual record costs $1, there were billions of such records, and the value to you, to the other side, the plaintiff, imaginary in this case, was 12 cents a call.  Okay?  So you say look, those people are asking us to dig up billions of records, it's going to cost us a dollar each to do it, and all they are going to get out of it is 12 cents a call.  But of course we are the ones who have to pay the dollar, and they get the 12 cents.  Now, is there a way for the legal system to solve that problem?   Stephen G. Breyer  Other than standing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the defendant says... now your client, I am not going to settle; there are no such claims.  This is ridiculous but it's going to cost me a dollar to prove it.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So, in your view, it says in Cipollone that this -- that the four people said in Cipollone that this statute does not pre-empt State law where it's based on a prohibition of making a false statement of material fact.  For example, to make a funny example, somebody could advertise smoking 42 cigarettes a day will grow back your hair.  [Laughter]  That's totally false, and in your view, that would be pre-empted, if Congress attempted to pre-empt a state law that says you cannot make a completely false statement of material fact--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --if it's based on -- has something to do with smoking and health.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I was trying to produce an -- I mean, it will build strong bodies eight ways.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Excuse me.  The reason I think the plurality wrote this, I'm guessing, is that when you read through this statute it seems as if what Congress had in mind in the statute was not setting aside State law, which is tradition, about not making false statements, false and deceptive advertising law.  It was concerned with a different thing.  They said, to the cigarette companies: You have to put on the label  ""Smoking is dangerous to your health. ""  We don't want States telling you to put other things like that on the label, and we don't want States forbidding you to put a picture of the Marlboro man or Lauren Bacall with her cigarette.  We don't want States to tell you that you can't do that.  That would be focused on the object of the statute, which no one said had as its objective setting aside traditional unfair and deceptive advertising law.  I think that's the argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why -- why would Congress -- I mean the difficulty that the other side raises here is just what Cipollone said.  I can understand totally why Congress would not want 50 States telling cigarette companies what to say about health and smoking or taking off pictures of the Marlboro ad.  I can understand that.  What I can't understand is why Congress would want to get rid of, in this area, the traditional rule that advertising has to tell the truth.  Now, what you said was you could end up with different applications of that in different States.  Of course, every national advertiser faces that situation at the moment.  Everyone who advertises across the nation could find deceptive -- anti-deception laws differently administered in different States.  Yet, they'd survive.  There is no evidence even that there is a problem.  So why would Congress want to get rid of that particular statute?   Stephen G. Breyer  Isn't the point, it doesn't pre-empt rules about location; it pre-empts rules about content?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's the government's position.  Now, if that's their position, isn't it just one additional step to say depending on what the history of the statute is, that it pre-empts regulations about content that don't have to do with lying about the content?   INTERRUPTING ",07-562X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why couldn't you say exactly the same thing about a State mode seeks to protect consumers, and they have a -- they have a rule, and the rule is not only the cigarette company do you have to say cigarettes are dangerous to your health, you have to put skull and crossbones?  That's the state law.  And you say why?  They say because we are trying to protect consumers.  And then you would be up here saying, they are not trying -- the duty there is not the duty to put the skull and crossbones.  It's the duty to protect consumers.  Now, that argument would get nowhere, as you understand.  And they are saying you're making just that kind of argument here, except substitute the word ""deception"".   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I want you to get you to talk about just for me for 30 seconds.  I can't deal with this conceptual thing.  It was hard for me to see it conceptually.  I can understand -- and that may be enough to any other person here, but I can understand somebody saying yes, this language is very absolute but it doesn't mean to cover everything that it literally applies to.  For example, it probably doesn't cover a requirement about workers smoking who put up billboards.  And another thing you say it doesn't cover is traditional anti-deception law.  That would have to do with the purpose of the statute not the text.  I'm not making your argument for you.  I'm giving you an introduction, and I want you to give 30 seconds dealing with the purposes that either says there is something to that line or there isn't.   ",07-562X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I ask you -- let me ask you a naive question possibly or may -- may reflect a misunderstanding.  But my understanding is that suppose you are -- you are an employee.  You believe your employer discriminated against you, say, on gender grounds.  You have to go to the EEOC.  Now, the EEOC looks into it, and very often what they do is they don't really resolve it.  They just give you a letter that gives you a right to sue.  So here Congress was so worried about this kind of thing that they said our specialized agency, you know, won't be the bottom line.  People will go there and then they have a right to sue later.  Now, that's how Congress felt about this particular statute.  Why would they want the union to be the bottom line when, in fact, the employee himself hasn't agreed?  I mean, the employee might agree in the first place.  He might say I'm going to take that letter, I'm not going to bring my suit.  That's up to him or her.  But here the employee wants to bring her suit, just like the EEOC letter.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly.  That's my point, is that the statute as a whole reflects a considerable effort not to let this employee get cut off at the pass, and an employee who is reasonably determined to get to court probably can do it.  It's not definite.  The EEOC doesn't have to give them a letter giving them a right to sue, but probably can do it.  And if that's a situation where you have this whole expert thing cut in, it seems to me there's a parallel here that Congress then wouldn't want the union and the employer together to be able to cut that right to sue off, at least not very easily.   INTERRUPTING ",07-581X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  And it's also true -- is that also true with an ordinary tort suit or any other kind of suit?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  A tort suit.  It says, some -- the union -- the same thing here, but we are not concerned with discrimination; we are concerned with workplace safety.  Somebody is hurt as a result of a machine improperly functioning, or there isn't adequate notice or so forth.  Is your view the same there?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   Stephen G. Breyer  Doesn't this allow discrimination -- doesn't this refer to discrimination by the employer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you say section 30 -- it doesn't say anything about union discrimination particularly; it just talks about discrimination.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  So you're saying sometimes unions do discriminate?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And sometimes unions also would rather have the more effective machine or sometimes unions feel that their workers are stupid not to read the machine label properly or -- I mean, I can replicate anything you -- I think.  We can think of tort suits, the two of us, which could put unions and employees on opposite shores, just as we can think of discrimination suits.  Most unions don't want discrimination.  I mean, most of the time.  And most unions don't want dangerous machines most of the time.  So if I decide for you in this case, am I also saying that they can't arbitrate ordinary tort suits or contract suits or just whether or not the workplace which is made of wood is filled with termites?  I mean, you know?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that the only reason?  Because, in other words, if I think I see no more reason why a union today, whatever was true 40 years ago -- that I see no more reason today why a union would like discrimination than I can see a reason why they would like a dangerous machine.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If I think that, then I should decide against you?   Stephen G. Breyer  Very helpful of you.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then I replicate my question because what I'm thinking is simply that there are thousands, maybe tens of thousands, kinds of claims that people go to arbitration over.  And what I'm wondering here is if you win here, what is the set of such claims that I have now said that a union, through a collective bargaining contract, can force the employee against his will to go to arbitration over?  I don't have a feeling for that from the briefs.  I don't have a feeling that you want to say that discrimination claims are special in that regard, that there's no line in that regard, or that there's some other line.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, can you give me a hint as to the principle?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I just want to be sure that at some point you'd answer this question, if you can: I -- I -- the issue in front of us, as I see it, is just what you said: When can a union require the worker to accept arbitration rather than a court case in an instance where the union member has not signed a special waiver?  That's the question, right?  Okay.  And what I think some of us were struggling for here is: If we say yes to you they can force them, or no to you they can't, what's the principle?  Now, the easiest kind of case where you tend to think they can force the worker into arbitration is where the right grows out of the collective bargaining agreement, period.  Then we have what we were talking about with Justice Souter, a common law tort claim.  Then we might have a State law giving a claim.  Then we might have a Federal law like this one giving a claim.  And we just heard, as soon as Justice Scalia thought of such a case, then the response was, which was the FLSA: Oh, well, maybe we can't, you know, force the worker to give that one up either.  So what is the line here that we are drawing with this case?  Is it a line that says discrimination laws, Federal, are special?  Federal laws are special?  State laws are special?  Common law is special?  Collective bargaining, too?  What is the principle?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's why I am asking you for the principle.  [Laughter]   ",07-581X

What is their -- what can they do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, what they -- what they now -- they now do this?  In other words, whenever they cover a baseball game, whenever they cover anything live, they have to have some kind of tape system or for the Emmys, everything is on tape and it's all delayed five seconds?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not talking about breaking news coverage.  I guess I'm talking about, you know, any one of -- they cover the wrestling matches, they cover -- you see what I'm driving at.  And I would like to know what is the state of the art?  You are saying the state of the art is right now when I turn on my television set, they all use a delay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or are you saying they all have to use a delay?   Stephen G. Breyer  Did the FCC explain all this in its opinion when it said, we understand that now we're going to have to -- every incident is going to have to be -- have a 5-second delay and they will have to have tapes, and we think it's worth the cost?  Did they explain all that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't see it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Could you review me to one thing in the record if it's there, or just tell me.  I did find an explanation for the agency deciding that ""fleeting"" is not going to be an automatic exemption.  They've talked about that.  What I didn't find is an explanation for a second thing, which had to do with their first prong of their former test, and that was the distinction that used to be made between using these words as swear words and using them as descriptive words.  Now that, I think, showed up in their former policy because they said if they were used as a swear word we are not going to go after them, at least not immediately.  So that had to do with prong 1, not prong 2.   Stephen G. Breyer  So is there an explanation why they made that change?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It hasn't?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It explained -- I mean, the change I saw was that previously the use of these words as a swear was treated differently from the use of these words as a description.

I just wanted to be certain you are finished with what you wanted to say there.  I -- because I am interested in the practical question of: Do all the stations have tapes?  And leave sports events out of it, and leave news out of it.  Are there other events that these small stations might want to cover that don't have the tape or that now don't use the tape; anything else you want to say about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the -- the -- one question I have on this is if I look at the two standards, and the first one, ""best practical"" -- it talks about cost-benefit.  It says you shall consider the total cost of application of technology in relation to the effluent-reduction benefits.  Then you look at ""best available"", and they've changed the phrase.  It doesn't get rid of cost, but it simply says you shall take into account the cost of achieving such effluent reduction.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So they both use the word ""cost"".   Stephen G. Breyer  Then you look at what Senator Muskie said at the time.   Stephen G. Breyer  And what Senator Muskie said at that time is the object here is when we move to better -- to better technology, we -- you know, when you get past the practical and you get into the other, it says to stop considering costs?  Not quite.  He says:  ""While costs should be a factor in the administrator's judgment. ""  So he is not against using costs.  He says that you have to do it under a reasonableness standard where you are taking into account all the goals and so forth.  Now, that's ambiguous.  But, as I read it, it says: Of course, you can't avoid taking into account costs, but don't do it too much.  And, therefore, you would say: Don't apply one of these big formal things when you reach your final goal.  There are other ways of getting there.  Of course, see that it isn't absurd.  And for 30 years the agency has had a way.  It has talked about ""grossly disproportionate"".  Now, that's the whole background to the question.  My question is, of course: Why not let sleeping dogs lie?  Let the agency take into account the way it has done it to prevent absurd results, but not try to do it so that it's so refined you can't even take account of what a fish is worth unless they happen to be one of the 1.2 percent that goes to market.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, fine.  Then what are you arguing?  Are you arguing that you should take costs into account?  Because I don't think -- or I don't think you should reach much disagreement on that point, that sometimes you take them into account--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --the way that Senator Muskie suggested.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, now, what they are going to argue, I guess, is going to be up to them, and I'd be very interested in hearing it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then you would be satisfied with the following ruling: The Second Circuit went too far in saying that you can never take costs into account.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Of course, you can sometimes take account of them, and the standard that we think is there -- I'm just imagining this -- is the one they have used for 30 years.

So -- it's simply saying the Second Circuit was wrong, the use of the word ""cost"" is meaningless without some idea--   Stephen G.

Now, if you say I'm talking about using that machine for an entire industry, you would say, my God, that's certainly available.  But see -- but here I have just one part of the industry here; I have a little plant; and you know, to hook that machine up, it's only going to save one paramecium.  Neither of us wants that.  And so the logical thing to say is to say, well, it isn't available for that.  And I would be with you there.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But to be honest about it, I'd have to say the reason it isn't available is quite -- it isn't available for minimizing the -- the harm, that particular adverse impact which is killing a -- a water animal.  The reason it isn't is because it doesn't kill any water animals.  Well, let me be honest, it kills one, or it kills two--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Or it kills three, and don't tell me de minimis, because as soon as you say ""de minimis"", I'm going to add one, okay?  [Laughter]  But what I'm trying to show here is that -- that there -- it isn't meaningful to talk about cost being available for an end, without some -- about something not being available for an end in light of its costs, unless you take into account what that end is.  I mean, we'd spend trillions to make America secure so not 50,000 people die, but we won't spend trillions for a road accident.  And -- and of course you take those things into account.  So that's -- that's exactly the point I wonder about.  Are you really saying, pay no attention or are you saying, which I could understand better, but you have to say what you want -- I mean, that what we mean is: Yes, they can take costs into account; that's what they do under the comparable standard, best available technology, but just use your head, don't do it too much, don't use it -- like take other things into account, too; don't do a formal cost-benefit analysis; don't try to evaluate the paramecium.  Do the difference between the -- you know, the two standards: Best practical, best available.  Do ""grossly"" or ""wholly"" or something.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no, but best available says take costs into account.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, there's a way of doing that which is what I'd call a commonsense way that they have some discretion over, that doesn't involve some enormously elaborate thing; and that's what I am searching for.  I don't -- I am not sitting here with an answer.  I'm trying to find a way of making sense of this.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Those two things seem contrary to me.  I don't see how you could -- do you see why?   Stephen G. Breyer  But how is it -- how is it feasible if it has no benefits at all?   Stephen G. Breyer  Then we are going to reach our insane results.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can't make any other judgment.  So imagine the consequence of that environmentally.  They can't make any other judgment.  Suppose the EPA is right: It's going to add 20 electric plants, huge plants, purely to save the fish, and the result is the cost of electricity goes up, and the result is there are no electric cars because people make the comparison with oil, and now they have to have petrol.  I mean, it's very hard for me to believe that Senator Muskie would have written a statute that would have foreseen such an effect.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's exactly where I agree with you.  So I go back to page 170 of the legislative history, which I have read now six times, and I agree with you that it is not totally clear.  Maybe you think it is.  But it seemed to me what he is saying there is just what you've said: Don't go into this with some elaborate thing, but remember costs are still relevant.  And what I've been searching for throughout is a set of words that would help me translate that thought into a legal reality.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, what about the particular case?  What they said here is that, if you require the closed circuit for everybody, we are going to have to build -- we are going to have to pay an energy penalty of 2.4 to 5.3 percent.  You will have to build 20 additional 400-megawatt plants, which is huge, many, many, many billions of dollars, and the -- just to replace the capacity you have lost.  And the result, which seems quite logical, would be to increase by a lot, not just a little, the consumption of fossil fuel.  Well, now how are they not -- you seem to be arguing that they can't take that into account, which, for an environmental agency, I would have thought,  ""But they must take it into account. ""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So if they did exactly the same thing they've done, which I've just read you, and they put a label on it, instead of saying ""thinking of benefits"", we were calling it now ""taking into account environmental impacts"", then they could do it?   Stephen G. Breyer  I see that thought, and this is what's concerning me, but there may be a very good answer.  A lot remains to be done with EPA.  They have an enormous job to do.  And I wouldn't want to get them tied up in unnecessary red tape, where everybody is suddenly taking them to court on rather technical things.  So if this 170 -- read it out of the ""available technology"" definition, you can take costs into account; just don't do it in this other way.  I can see how they could work with that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I'm worried about what you are saying.  It may make it so difficult for them that they won't be able to do the job.   Stephen G. Breyer  I agree.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the page -- the page of the legislative history or the page of the text of the statute that says what I think is a -- I mean, try it with your son.  It costs $100.   Stephen G. Breyer  Your son says, 100> [""].  You say, ""That's too expensive"".  He says,  ""But I didn't tell you what it was for. ""  What?  [Laughter]  I mean -- you see?  Now you tell me the page, and I have read a lot of it; tell me the page of the legislative history or the phrase of the statute where it says what you just said -- that you cannot take into account what you were buying for that $100.   Stephen G. Breyer  What page?  I will read it again.   Stephen G. Breyer  I know 316(b).   ",07-588X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is there anything else?  I -- I think you're quite right that -- that, look, I can't find anything in the history that suggest lab reports would be admitted because they would be considered being prepared for trial.  But business records are kept out.  So we have here a source that's unlikely to be particularly biased, the University of Massachusetts labs.  And we have the checks of the discipline, the scientific discipline.  On the other hand, it's being prepared for this trial.  So it seems to me some things go one way; some things go the other way.  I don't know exactly what the predominant things are.  That's what I'd like you to address as much as possible.  And when I look at the definition of ""business records hearsay exception"" today, it seems to me that the ""hearsay exception"" does cover today some of the things under ""business records"" that would be prepared particularly for trial.  You could have a company that goes and measures lines on the street, or tread marks, or a variety of things.  And I guess they come in under the ""business records exception"".  Do they?  I mean, is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, of course, it wouldn't.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that's why -- and maybe you have nothing else you want to say on this point.  It's the same as Justice Kennedy raised.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It seems like there are some things going one way, and some things going the other on the issue of whether to call it ""testimonial"".   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There have been bad instances.  You are absolutely right.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what -- what I'm trying to work out in my mind is not necessarily what happened in the year 1084.  I'd -- I'd be quite interested in your views on what's a workable rule.  And when I look across the country on this, it seems most States have worked with a rule that has allowed the defendant to call the witness if he wants.  There is not a particular unfairness to that.  If he can get ahold of the witness, no problem.  But they said: We are not going to make the State do this because it's a waste of time, for the most part.  It just delays the trial, and there is really nothing at issue.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But if I assume -- I'm really uncertain as to whether it has covered ""testimonial"" or not.  And also, I'm not enamored particularly of seeing on a close question what happened in ancient history.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, is there anything else you want to add to me on those assumptions?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I absolutely see that point.  So that -- all right, go back to the plea bargaining, which is your first thing, which makes me a little nervous for the reason that I see this bargaining system as a system where the prosecutor makes a charge, the prosecutor controls the sentence, then the defense bar would like to have an added weapon, and this added weapon is if you actually go to trial, I'm going to insist that you call these people.  You don't even know where they are.  I'm not going to accept the lab report.  And then maybe the prosecutor will lower the requirement or maybe the prosecutor raised it in the first place because he thought you would say something like that.  So I'm not -- is there anything you can say about how this works in the presence of plea bargaining?  Do we know any -- do we have any information on that?   Stephen G. Breyer  What's your distinction with the recordkeeper?   Stephen G. Breyer  What's your distinction from your own theory of the recordkeeper?  Does the recordkeeper all have to -- do they all have to testify to testify that this is indeed the record?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, there's a hearsay -- there is a hearsay aspect.  I'm not saying it's the only thing.  There is a chain and so forth but, there is a hearsay aspect to that which you see, okay.  The certificate says this is Joe Jones' birth certificate.  That's what the -- now, that's that person outside of court who made that little piece of paper for purposes of this case.  And moreover, the statement that it certifies to is directly relevant; indeed, the whole thing falls without it.  So, are you going to say the same thing applies, your rule, and you have to call the recordkeeper in or not?  And I think you're going to say not.  And if you're going to say not, I want to know what the distinction is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You are going to calling in -- you're going to--   ",07-591X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  How can we administer something like that?  His point I think is, look, you can't make any distinction either of something that is evidence was prepared with an eye towards trial or it wasn't.  And if it was prepared with an eye towards trial, well, then call the person and have him testify.  That's it.  And if that encompasses every test under the sun, so be it, because there is no way to draw a reasonable line.  You start talking about reliability and their amicus brief is filled with horror stories of how police labs or other labs have really been way off base and moreover really wrong.  And you say, oh, distinguish between a police lab and University of Massachusetts?  Try going down that road of which one is reliable, which one isn't reliable.  How do we know?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's his point.  No workable way to do it.  There can be horrors on both -- in both areas, and so follow what the history was where there was no history on this being admissible.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Aren't there some things I read in the paper all the time, about these laboratories in various places, and they lost the results, they got it all wrong?  That just doesn't happen?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you make me think the public certificate.  Let's imagine birth and death records.  There is a whole building full of them; they are on microfiche.  Now, I am not sure how Massachusetts works, but I suppose if you want to introduce one you call up the -- the keeper and the keeper looks it up, produces it, and has a separate piece of paper or maybe written beneath it which says:  ""This is a true copy of the. ""  and you don't call in the keeper.  Now that statement on a piece of paper,  ""this is a true copy of the birth certificate of John Smith. ""  that was prepared specifically for this trial.   Stephen G. Breyer  So I take it that has nothing -- I mean we'll find out, but if they win, every one of those cases, every document you have to bring in the person to make clear that the document that says that this is a copy of the document--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Is that what -- is that the point?   Stephen G. Breyer  You're going to work either.  Because the person -- Sir Walter Raleigh's accusers wanted to testify about something that was nontestimonial: what happened on the day.  So what we are looking for -- I mean, I agree with you that it is a very peculiar result that's going to have every public document in the United States suddenly have the keeper of that document having to come into court.  On the other hand, I'm having a hard time figuring out what the distinction is between that and all these other things.   INTERRUPTING ",07-591X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What I don't understand about--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Finish because there's something--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That's the part I don't understand.  It's not your fault.  I don't understand it in the cases either.  What First Amendment right are we talking about?  There is an individual who, under the agency shop, pays dues to a union.  Now, suppose the union uses some of that money in a way that has nothing to do with politics, nothing to do with speech, but it doesn't happen to benefit that particular member.  For example, you can have a central union headquarters 4,000 miles away where there's a librarian who's doing research on a matter that will help lots of people, but nobody in this area.  Or you could have a program to commemorate the people who were hurt in the State of Hawaii at a union uprising or strike of some kind where nobody in this particular area is ever going to go.  Now, both of those activities are totally legitimate union activities that have nothing to do with politics.  But this particular place won't benefit from them.  Okay, what in the First Amendment prohibits the union from paying for such an activity out of general union dues assessed on everybody?  And why would the First Amendment prohibit such a thing?   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  If they are chargeable because they have nothing to do with politics, perfectly legitimate, why isn't it also chargeable to pay for the costs of a lawsuit which has nothing to do with politics, totally for a union purpose, it just doesn't happen to benefit that person who's miles away in a different local?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't want you to tell me about cases.  I'm abstracting from -- I want to know the reasoning.  I want to know why.   Stephen G. Breyer  I said there is no politics in any of these expenditures.  42 bishops would swear there is nothing here that has anything to do with politics.   Stephen G. Breyer  But that's the reasoning that you seem to accept and I guess all human activity is banned.  Because to my knowledge, all human activity takes place through speech with a few exceptions that are not here relevant.   Stephen G. Breyer  And the case -- the case that says that a union member, person forced into the union agency shop -- and I guess a lawyer who has to pay to be an integrated bar and I guess a doctor who has to join a medical association -- the case that says that these people have a First Amendment right to get back money that's being wasted, is what?   Stephen G. Breyer  So unless it's political in your view, you don't have that right?   ",07-610X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is there a rule or a reg somewhere in the Labor Department that says if the national union takes its money from its local, spends it in a way that has nothing to do with politics whatsoever, zero -- but either wastes it or they build too big a building, or they do something that doesn't benefit Local Number 432, does 432 have any remedy?   Stephen G. Breyer  There is no remedy at all.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So union members who are being gypped, they just have to put up with it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  Are you saying you could bring a lawsuit or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  So either -- in these cases everybody in the union whether they're forced or not, has this kind of remedy or nobody does?

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is it the case that there are two other individuals who have attached this judgment?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And is it the case that Iran's position in respect to those attachments is that those attachments, insofar as they are valid and executed, require a setoff from whatever we owe Iran or vice-versa?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I'm saying I take it from something I have read in this that Iran believes that if, in fact, it won a judgment and that judgment is from someone like Cubic--   Stephen G. Breyer  --who they thought was prevented from delivering planes because of the embargo -- so it was relevant -- that that judgment, which they get if they collect on it, should be deducted from other money the United States owes them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --unless instead of them getting it, the attacher gets it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The attachee gets it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Has to get the money for the attaching person.  That's my point.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so that is at issue before the -- and -- and it is at issue in those cases.  If the person who attaches it gets the money rather than Iran, Iran will say: We do not have to have a setoff.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Isn't that right or--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --And that is the same question that you think would be presented through this attachment, is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Dr. Elahi is one of several persons, is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What I'm trying to get at is Iran's position vis-a-vis the Elahi judgment is the same as its position vis-a-vis the other two attachments on the Elahi judgment.   Stephen G. Breyer  That if Iran ends up with the money, you can subtract it from other money the United States owes them.  But if the attaching people end up with the money, you cannot.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You would take the same position if, in fact, this money which is owed to Iran by -- by Cubic -- that is, Cubic, which then Iran got a judgment on -- instead of a judgment in favor of Iran, Cubic had written them a check, and they had taken the check and bought a house in Manhattan, or they had put it in an Iranian bank account, and either Mr. Elahi or one of the other two people sought to attach the bank account or the house or the grocery store, which they might have also have used.  Am I right--   Stephen G. Breyer  --or wrong?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't see why either is the slightest a bit more attenuated.  In either case they are owned by the Ministry of Defense of Iran.   ",07-615X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  So what is the -- it seems at the moment, frankly you could read it either way.  Let's imagine that -- that Cubic sold some jets that we blocked and they get some money, and they did it under their contract, and they got 2 million dollars.  And suppose they said, we owe Iran this money, and they pay Iran the money, and Iran puts it in a bank account or buys the grocery store.  All right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now suppose that happened.  It makes it simpler.  And then what happens is three people, including Mr. Elahi and two others who don't accept money, the other two, attach it, on the ground Iran owes us this money.   Stephen G. Breyer  We want the grocery store.  And suppose, further, Iran then says, if they get their money, you cannot subtract it, United States, from what you owe us.  But if we get the money, then you can subtract it.  That's their view.  The United States' view is different.  Who will resolve that question?  The tribunal.  So they say, what is at issue is not who owns the grocery store; what is at issue is the question of whether we get the money or you get the money.  What money?  The money that is the value of the grocery store, or the bank account, in which case it's identical.  Now I think in that situation it's easy for me to say that money, the grocery store, or the bank account, of course is at issue before the tribunal.  For the question is, does Iran get it or does the United States get it, in the situation where the two other people -- leaving Elahi out of it -- can attach it.  I can easily read it that way.  I can also read it the way you want.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right?  So now, which do I do?  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  I'll then add that the strongest argument against you, it seems to me, is the whole point of this was not simply to compensate victims of terrorism.  That's a worthy goal, and that's one of the points.  But it was to compensate them consistent with the proper running, in the interests of the United States, of the Iranian-American Claims Tribunal.  And so this is just the kind of issue we don't want to simply take away and let the victim have, because there is a strong risk the tribunal will rule against us, and we will have to pay it twice.  Okay.  That's the argument against you.  Now, what's the argument for you?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's one, but--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That creates the issue, because the question is whether money that never goes back to Iran, but rather goes to an attaching person, is money that is or money that is not subtracted from the amount that the United States owes Iran.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that question is the question--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --is the question that is before the commission.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They are totally knowable.  In order to decide what they are all you have to do is to look at the issues before the commission and decide whether those issues concern specific, concrete property; that is, the property that you have an interest in.  With my grocery store, with my bank account, and with this claim, it is absolutely specific, and Iran has put before the commission the question of whether if you pay the money to an attaching person, we don't get it, or we do get it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I gather.  Now you can tell me I'm wrong on that if you want.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They are trying to attach the ACMR system.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They are trying to attach the Cubic judgment.  The ACMR judgment is in Canada.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that's one piece of property.  The other piece of property that is at issue is the judgment, and the way it's at issue is I take it that two other people are saying, we attach it; Iran says because they attach it, you don't subtract it from the ACMR judgment; and we are saying, even though they attach it, you subtract it, and therefore it's before the tribunal as well.  That's my understanding at the moment, and I'm asking you to explain why that's wrong.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the -- the other thing -- and I think this counts against you, but maybe you have an answer to it, that there could be a lot of property that was directly at issue in '79 or '80 that Iran didn't get.  And because they didn't get it, all kinds of things happened with property, and you get more of it or you get less of it.  And during the interim years all kinds of things happened.  And it could be that those transformations at different times are directly before the tribunal, in respect to how much damages you are going to get, and how much -- we can easily think of cases if we have three or four hours.  But you see where I am going?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I can understand Congress in passing this statute having one of two possible things: One is say we are just going to cut an arbitrary line here because it's a compromise, and what we will do is, you can go ahead, victim, and seize anything you want, as long as it doesn't narrowly fit within this.  That's a somewhat arbitrary line but a compromise.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The other way to look at it is to say, well, what we that had in mind here is we will pay these victims something; you know, they are going to get something right from Congress right now, because they are hurt.  But in return from that, we don't want you taking action that will really affect our liability to Iran.  And if it's the second, then we needed broader definition; if it's the first, we don't.   ",07-615X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  At the end of your argument, could you just spend a minute because my state of mind is I'm sorry we limited it.  You've sort of briefed this question pretty fully.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I'm tempted to try to decide it.  I know you want to make your four points.  Go right ahead.  But at the end, could you possibly say, why shouldn't we just go ahead and decide the substance, not as a technical matter.  Are we really going to get something out of remanding it that we don't already know?  But don't do that now, but whenever you want.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, could we do this?  I mean, what's bothering me about this is -- is you have a very strong argument following the plan documents.  They have had some chance to reply to it, but not a full chance.  It seems a little unfair, and the Fifth Circuit had -- would probably know what they say.  Okay.  Can we, say, grant the question now and ask that people file an additional brief if they want to say something?  It just seems to me an awful waste of money and everybody's time to send it back and have it make another trip.  So what's your suggestion as to how we proceed?   Leondra R. Kruger  Well, Your Honor, I think it would be possible to -- to either order for the briefing on the issue or to grant the question now at this juncture.  I think it would also be conceivable to read the question that the Court did grant on as encompassing the Federal common law--   Stephen G. Breyer  You see, I want to be fair to them.  I mean, we want -- you want to be fair to the other side to be sure they have a chance to say everything they have to say.  That's what's worrying me.   Leondra R. Kruger  --Well, Your Honor, that is an important consideration.  I do think that in the opening brief the Petitioners did brief the question of what effect is to be given to a waiver if indeed a waiver is not prohibited by the anti-alienation clause.  And that Federal common law rule that Petitioners suggest is one that does, I think, naturally invite some consideration of the conflicting statutory directive in the form of the plan documents principle that this Court has recognized in its earlier cases.  And certainly in its reply brief Petitioners did address this issue in full.   ",07-636X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that doesn't make too much sense, does it, where all that happens is it's just waived.  The wife waived the amount because when she waived the amount, she doesn't give it to anybody.  She just doesn't take it.  So it goes to the beneficiary -- it goes to the person who made up the plan.  It's a little hard to pay to him, because he is dead.  So I mean if you read it literally, it doesn't seem to apply, these (ii) and (iii), to the case before us, which is a case of waiver.  And of course the argument, yes, she makes is that throughout the law, waiver is treated differently.  And if it weren't, you'd have to pay gift tax, for example, when you waive a benefit that's given to you by someone else.  And so let's interpret this and make sense of the language you quoted, and consistent with the rest of the law to say a waiver is waivered.  It's not giving something to somebody else.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The argument is against you and I would like to hear what you have to say.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm -- I didn't follow, I'd have to admit.  I think -- and you perhaps can explain it to me -- but, I thought the things that you are quoting are QDRO is about an effort to alienate some property that would otherwise go to the person who was setting up a QDRO, in other words, the wife here, in other words Liv here; is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  The one person who couldn't be an alternate payee is the payor.  And so, in fact, when you waive something, it isn't that it necessarily goes back to some alternate payee, as it didn't here.  It simply went back to the payor.  And so the language of this prevision you're quoting just doesn't deal with this case.   Stephen G. Breyer  I know you do, and that's what I need to ask.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm sorry.  It says, if it's not, the issue to wit is not resolved, then the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts to the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you think that includes the giver, the payor?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's where this goes if you waive it.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm five minutes behind.  I just got your point on the (iii)(1).  I see it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay?  I get it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Let me go back for a second because, while I got it five minutes late, if I have it right, I still don't see why Congress would have done it literally.  I think what you're saying is:  ""Read the full four pages. ""  ""What those four pages say are, Judge, you have an order, a divorce decree. ""  ""It's defined as an order. ""  ""Look at it. ""  ""It's qualified or it isn't. ""  ""If it's qualified, pay the money to the person it names. ""  ""If it's not qualified, pay the money to the person, namely Liv, who would have been entitled to the amount if there had been no order. ""  Okay.  You read that literally as you want and what it says is:  ""Liv, you're being divorced. ""  ""You want a divorce; your husband wants a divorce; you're going to be divorced. ""  ""You cannot waive the benefit under the plan. ""  Now, why would Congress not want her to be able to waive it?  Why?   Stephen G. Breyer  I can understand an antialienation provision.  That's some guy who is going to come along and grab this money when you want to take care of a widow, and you want to take care -- but -- but this isn't that.  It's just -- she just wants to waive it; she doesn't want it.  That's the widow herself.  Okay, so why would Congress--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I see.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is the -- is the wife -- I'm thinking of the Chief Justice's question, too.  If your -- the woman is the wife of X, and X has a pension.  Doesn't something vest, say if she's in California?  Doesn't she have some vested right to some of that pension?   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose she's married for 40 years to Joe Smith, Joe Smith earns a pension and then he wants a divorce.  Doesn't she have some right to some of that money.   Stephen G. Breyer  Does she get some of the money he saved?   Stephen G. Breyer  So it's not exactly that you could have just changed the beneficiary.  If you just changed the beneficiary, you'd have to give her something else.   Stephen G. Breyer  But in the divorce proceeding she's going to get some of the money, which is now Justice Ginsburg's point, to which she is entitled.  So obviously she will get something, but she's entitled to it.   ",07-636X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The rule I suggested, though there are arbitrary aspects is a better targeted, more administrable -- or equally administrable or not much worse administrable arbitrary rule.   Stephen G. Breyer  There must be somebody there to get you over 50 percent.   Stephen G. Breyer  Thirty-three plus 11 is 44.  So where does the rest come from?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's 40, and then -- oh, I see, 39 plus 11.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If they vote cohesively.   ",07-689X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't see how those claims could possibly succeed, but I thought -- let's go back to sort of step 1.  My mind turns a little confused when I start thinking of these cases.  Are we talking about a case of -- where the claim is normally vote dilution?  Is that yes or no?   Stephen G. Breyer  Section 2 -- does vote dilution mean we who are a minority group, let's say a black group, could have elected a candidate of our choice more likely than the white group, but because you are engaged in vote dilution, that isn't going to happen anymore?  Is that the form of the claim?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's the form of the claim.  Then, it's our problem here that to see whether that's so, you have to see whether the black group did really vote as a group.  Did they used to have a good chance to elect the person they want, and does the white group tend to also vote as a group and swamp them?  Is that what we are trying to find out?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There are a lot of reasons that can happen.  But is the evil we are trying to get at, the evil of a black group, when they stick together in polarized voting, having less of a chance of getting their candidate elected than when the white group does the same?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what we are trying to prevent?  Okay.  If that's what we are trying to prevent, then haven't we learned that putting a threshold, because you can't even get in the door -- you can't even get in the door -- unless the black group accounted for 50 percent of something, the voters or the people who turn out, that that doesn't make much sense for the reason that Justice Scalia started with.  It doesn't make much sense because sometimes they account for 51 percent, but they can't elect anybody, because they all divide on four different people, or maybe they didn't turn out.  On the other hand, sometimes if they account for 43 percent, they could elect the candidate of their choice.  So it looks as if that 50 percent is pretty arbitrary and we're looking for a better criterion.  Is there anything wrong with what I've said so far?   Stephen G. Breyer  Here what we've -- could we look to see whether the three Gingles factors, whatever they are -- one was, is the black group numerous enough to elect the candidates of their choice?  Reasonably compact, politically cohesive?  And then you look to see, does the white group tend to vote as a bloc to stop them?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what we should do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then I'm back to my problem, that sometimes the 50 percent criteria just doesn't measure that first part.  And so you say, well, any other matter would be worse, but I bet we could invent some that were actually better.  Suppose you wouldn't have to go to 20 percent; suppose, for example, you started looking in the 40 percents, and you said, you know, if the black group is going to elect their candidate with 40 percent, or 45 percent even, they're going to need a lot of crossovers, because they may only vote -- you know, only 80 percent may turn out.  They are going to need a lot of crossovers.  And the more crossovers you have to have, the harder it is to say that that white group is out there trying to beat them.  So there's a kind of natural stopping place.  When I worked out the numbers, it seemed that natural stopping place fell around 42-43 percent.  It sort of fell -- as you said, that the black group -- you insist that the black group had to be twice as many as the white group that crossed over.  A little arbitrary, but at least we were getting to the same -- to the right thing.  I mean -- respond as you wish.   Stephen G. Breyer  If you want an absolute, arbitrary rule, which is what you were heading toward which will just -- the question is whether they get in the door.  If they are in the door, they have to prove the three factors.  And you want to keep certain people out.  Okay.  Suppose you say, well, 42 percent.  That gives you down to 40, with your two back, instead of 50.  But you are out anyway if the crossover vote from the white majority is more than half of what the whole vote is with the black and white together on that side.  So you have a two-to-one ratio.  Now, the only virtue of that is that there was an effort to try to get an arbitrary rule, which you have with your 50 percent, even -- only a little bit more difficult than that to -- to administer, and is likely to get in more cases that are justified.  But they still have to prove their three factors.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It takes into account the realistic fact that in every group, including lots of African-American groups, there is -- it is not 100 percent African American at all.  There are -- there are a few others who will come along, and -- and that's still the candidate of that community's choice.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So we want -- a little flexibility here is all that I'm suggesting.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You can't get below 42.  I'm not going to get below 40 no matter what, even with your thumb on the scale.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They are -- they are finished at 40, and they are not even in at 40, if they have to depend more than two-to-one on the crossovers.   ",07-689X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  It is quite difficult.  I mean there -- we don't know quite a lot about whether they would have gotten a warrant, how -- how dangerous it was, whether the drugs were likely to be hidden.  And I was thinking of it, and that's why I am saying this, is that it's a perfect reason since constitutional questions in this area are -- are like the stars in the sky.  There are so many.  Rather than having the judges answer each one and getting everything mixed up, why not just have them take whatever is the easier path?  As a judge I like to take what is the easier path.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if it's easier to deal with the qualified immunity, deal with it and forget the rest of it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I see that, but unless we do that here, they are never going to get the right message.  And so what we will have is 1,000 judges trying in an average in a year 50 or 60 cases each with multiple facts, and we will have approximately over a 10-year period hundreds of thousands.  I've exaggerated, but there will be many, many -- many, many conflicts, many, many confusions.  And unless we say, no, we are not doing it ourselves, how will they ever get the message?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We don't always have to do it, but I mean once.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --to the question.  I mean, look, if I have to answer the constitutional question -- and what bothers me is this consent at one remove.  What?  You are saying a drug seller who lets in a disguised policeman in order to sell him a drug because he thinks he's a druggie is suddenly consenting to the entire LAPD coming into his house?  I would think that is the last thing he would have thought about wanting, not the first.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, maybe they both should be the same.  I--   ",07-751X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Imagining -- you are imagining different cases.  We can imagine a spectrum of cases.  In some cases the policeman or the confidential informant will be there, and he really couldn't have gotten a -- a thing in advance -- a warrant in advance.  It wasn't certain, and they are in there and they see a lot of drug behavior going on, and the drugs are going to be hidden, go, disappear the second he leaves; and if he tries to arrest them, everybody is going to jump on him and kill him.  Okay?  So there are a lot of cases just like this one, but with a few changes, which are -- he needs to call the police, and there will be others where he doesn't.  So that's why I am so uncertain about what it is we are deciding here on the merits.  We would have to say on the merits this is a case where there are no exigent circumstances.  Can we say that?  I -- would not want to ""never are there"".   ",07-751X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can you help me with this?  Suppose I'm a trial judge and I instruct the jury in a technical matter, an important but technical matter, and when they have questions about it I say read the instruction.  Suppose I'm right as far as the instruction goes.  But say the prosecutor gets everybody mixed up.  Now, I guess if the prosecutor gets people mixed up enough, that could becomes a due process violation.  But I suspect that it has to be quite a lot of mix-up, that intuitively is what I suspect.  Are there any cases I should look at, one that would tell me how mixed up the prosecutor has to get everybody before it's a due process violation?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In Brown, in that case did they find that he did get them too mixed up or he didn't?   Stephen G. Breyer  He did not.  So unless in this case the prosecutor got everybody more mixed up than in the Brown case, we should just reverse.   INTERRUPTING ",07-772X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's exactly what the instruction said.  My problem is, I guess different people, I understand, can read the same words and come to different conclusions.  But I have read the instruction and the statute, probably over a dozen times by now, and I can't find the slightest ambiguity.  It seems to be absolutely clear.  What it says is you're instructed that a person is guilty -- I would say what crime is the jury considering -- of a crime.  Namely, second-degree murder crime, if it is committed by another person for which he is legally accountable.  Then it says you're an accomplice -- an accomplice -- it says a person is an accomplice with certain knowledge when he aids another person in planning or committing a crime; the crime, second-degree murder.  What is the problem?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's a different argument.  I want to know first -- in my mind in two different categories.  Category one: Is there an ambiguity in this instruction?  And my answer so far, which is what I was asking you, is zero.  Why not?  And then the second question is, could the prosecution get people so mixed up about something, a typical thing like this, that it would violate due process?  That's why I asked the question before.  And I said, obviously the answer is sometimes they could.  And then the question is, did they here?  And what he referred me to was Brown, which I've looked at, in which I said the prosecutorial and problem in that case did not rise to a federal due process question.  So, I guess -- though it's only one person -- you would have to convince me that this is somehow worse prosecutorial conduct than existed in Brown.   Stephen G. Breyer  All my questions from the whole case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  But what I mean by that is that the prosecution would have had to have gotten the jury more mixed up than -- I was using shorthand for that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --more mixed up than they did in Brown, where I thought it was pretty bad.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In my -- it it doesn't mean either.  It means jury you are instructed that the person is guilty of a crime -- in other words, the jury is sitting there and they are asked the question: Is the person guilty of second-degree murder?  Now they are to apply the instruction.  A person is guilty of second-degree murder if da, da, da, da.  And when it gets to ""the crime"", it is referring to second-degree murder.  I don't know how -- anything else it could be referring to.   Stephen G. Breyer  You're convincing me that different people can reach different conclusions.  What I'd like you to say is something that would change my mind on my initial conclusion that there is no ambiguity.  I think you could say something like that, because as you quite rightly point out, other people have reached other conclusions.   Stephen G. Breyer  So, then, what I take is authoritative on that are two sentences from the Washington Supreme Court opinion, though people -- other judges have been all over the lot.  The first sentence it says: The trial court correctly instructed the jury that it could convict Mr. Sarausad of murder -- they mean second-degree murder -- as an accomplice only if it found he knowingly aided in commission of ""the crime"" charged, which was second-degree murder.  That's their interpretation, which I could understand.  Then the second thing is, it does not offend the principles of accomplice liability to hold responsible one who knowingly aids such conduct; namely, conduct that creates a substantial risk of death when the substantial risk of death results in actual death.  So that would seem to be hornbook law.  If you engage in conduct that might well cause substantial or -- substantial risk of death and you know it, you know, you know you're engaging in this conduct, that's the Washington view, that's it.  You've had it.  And here they go on to say that he knew there was plenty of evidence that he knew that he was engaged in a drive-by shooting.  And then to put every dot on every ""I"", they say a drive-by shooting does run a substantial risk of death.  Okay.  Now that's what I read and at that point, I said I'll ask you that, because then I can hear the best answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  The prosecutor, I mean I thought, though I'm not -- this really is ambiguous, I think, but if you do hold somebody's arms behind his back and punch him in the stomach, that does perhaps -- at least might run -- I can see a person saying that that runs a substantial risk of death.  I mean Houdini died that way, apparently.  So maybe hitting somebody in the stomach does create a substantial risk of death.  Do you know anything about -- one way or the other on that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They intentionally hit somebody in the stomach, you say, knowing all about--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I realize that but what the State supreme court holds.  I think correctly, that if the person conscious of the risk knows that a particular individual is engaging in certain conduct for whom he is responsible, he is -- he is guilty of the -- if the event that you know there is a substantial risk of comes about.  I would be amazed that a State would say the contrary.   Stephen G. Breyer  Washington -- in the State of Washington you think the law is that if Joe Jones helps Dead Eye Dick shoot his gun right at somebody's leg and then accidental -- then, you know, he doesn't aim quite right, the guy dies; then it's a good defense to say well, I knew he was Dead Eye Dick.  I thought he'd just hit him in the leg.  I mean, that -- we know that isn't a good defense in Washington because the Supreme Court of Washington tells us that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's the difference between that and punching him in the stomach?   Stephen G. Breyer  This argument -- I'm beginning to get your argument.  The statement is -- the prosecutor never suggested Mr. Sarausad could be found guilty if he had no knowledge that a shooting was to occur.  You're saying that's absolutely wrong.  There's no support for that in the record.  In fact what the prosecutor was arguing is that, even if a shooting didn't occur, he's still guilty because of other gang activity, and when we read the record, we find that's so wrong the statement in the supreme court opinion, that habeas was right.  Is that the argument?   ",07-772X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  There is a dispute between people.  You look at their underlying dispute, the underlying one, and you say: Is there diversity?  What's the problem?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why -- why wouldn't you do just what I said, just what we started with?  You take out the arbitration agreement, and then you look to see what this dispute is about.  And if it's about something that happens to involve all people from one side in one State and from another State on the other side, there is jurisdiction.  Why is that a problem?  I don't understand.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's your view, but I mean believe me, I think I can keep that problem under control.  That was your original point.  I see the point, it's going to spread too far; you'd have to have some rules that cabin it.  Assume I got that under control; maybe I don't.  This is a case of  ""well, his brother was worse. ""  What do you want to say about the criticisms of the horrible things that happen if we adopt your position?   INTERRUPTING ",07-773X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So your theory -- I mean basically I think you concede that the other side has a point in sometimes it will be difficult to say what the dispute is precisely and, therefore, difficult to know if precisely this dispute does or does not -- one that you can get into Federal court on.  For example, it hasn't even arisen.  You know, there is no lawsuit.  And I guess what would happen, what the judge should say is they should say to you you'd like to have this in Federal court, wouldn't you, this dispute?  What's it about?   Stephen G. Breyer  And once he says what's it about, both sides will say, well, basically it started off -- it's just about collecting some money from in-state parties.  So that's not Federal.   Stephen G. Breyer  So that, you know, something could happen here.  It could happen that they could decide they want to sue in a big class action and get huge amounts of money under usury laws of the State which don't exist, so they have to proceed under an FDIC reg, and then it could be Federal.  And the judge might say to you:  ""What? ""  ""You're just imagining. ""  And that would be up to the judge.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's a kind of a defense.   Stephen G. Breyer  But you'd say then it might be the case that it wouldn't be so hard to decide.   Stephen G. Breyer  A real suit.  And--   Stephen G. Breyer  --And in a real suit, there is a class action brought not just on behalf of the one you're trying to sue but on behalf of everybody, where they have to proceed under a Federal reg, and they are going to get a huge amount of money, and you say that's what we want arbitrated.   Stephen G. Breyer  So this one is not so hard to figure out.   Stephen G. Breyer  There might be some that are.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, in his case, in the Chief Justice's case, wouldn't you say they don't get into court, probably don't because they are bringing this under a State law?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is this right?  I'm asking if it may sound favorable to you, then I'll get a good response in rebuttal.   Stephen G. Breyer  If you read it the other way -- if you read it the other way, the way the Petitioners want to read it, then is this so or not?  That then you look to see if there is Federal jurisdiction of the arbitration agreement; is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, under their interpretation.   Stephen G. Breyer  So, what you could have is you could have two parties sign an arbitration agreement that lasts for a year that governs all disputes between them, and one is from Vermont; the other from California.   Stephen G. Breyer  So there is jurisdiction.  And all the disputes happen to involve just pure matters of -- that never could come into Federal court.  I mean there are such matters you could argue about.   Stephen G. Breyer  But nevertheless, we have a Federal court issuing this injunction, under their theory.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Assuming they are right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, I see.  The arbitration agreement has to meet the amount in controversy.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So then probably no arbitration agreement in itself meets the amount.   Stephen G. Breyer  So if you didn't look through, then this would apply to nothing?   Stephen G. Breyer  If the arbitration--   Stephen G. Breyer  --The arbitration agreement has to -- they talk about the arbitration agreement, then you could have really important Federal questions in substantive issues--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that couldn't come in because the arbitration agreement doesn't?  Or you could have State questions that would suddenly come in because the arbitration agreement does.  The arbitration -- but now you're saying, well, that second case is never going to arise.   Stephen G. Breyer  Probably not, because no arbitration agreement has -- so then it becomes a nullity of the statute?   Stephen G. Breyer  Except to overcome the ouster.  Okay.  We've got your side of it.  [Laughter]   ",07-773X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What happened... I have a factual question.  In around July, Mr. Sam Jones is sworn in and now he is in office until sometime after, I guess, September 1988, a little over a year, and then the Governor appointed him.  Well, he must have gotten paid during that year.   Stephen G. Breyer  And then when the Governor appointed him, what does the appointment look like?  Does it say it's retroactive?  No.  I would be surprised.  I mean, you're not going to tell me it is.  So my guess is he's appointed as of... let's say he's appointed by the Governor.  It must have said as of when, and it probably said as of September '88.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I think it's important to me because, for this reason: I would guess they don't make it retroactive or you'd know it, and therefore we... we have more.  We have the facts, the following facts, as to whether... and this is what Fordice says; it says this is a practical question.  It's not some theory about whether it's unconstitutional or not unconstitutional.  The question is as practical matter was it in force and effect?  And, as a practical matter, one, there was an election under it; two, somebody was elected; three, he took office; four, he held that office for a year and was paid for it.  All right?  Why, as a practical fact, as a practical matter, we do not say that special election law was in force and effect for about a year and two months?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, their registering is a precondition of voting.  Not one person had ever voted.  Moreover, they all had to register again.  So the net practical effect of the election, of plan two in Young v. Fordice, was null, zero, zilch.  And the practical effect here is that somebody is elected under the law, holds office for a year and two months, and is paid.  It seems to me quite a big difference.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  I mean, that's what I wanted to know.  I mean, maybe it's different if this was a retroactive something or other, but I... you're not aware of that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So I assume it wasn't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Suppose I reject that on the ground of what I said.  I'm not saying I would, but suppose I did.  Isn't that the end of this case?  Because then, if I reject that, there is a plan.  The plan is called ""the special election plan"".  It is in effect for a year and two months.  People hold office in election and they're paid.  And then a new plan comes along, the governor's plan.  Now that seems to me a change, and the statute says that if you have a change, which this would be, you've got to preclear it.  End of matter.  Now, what's your argument about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm just using that as shorthand, the shorthand for a system under which the officeholder is appointed by the government... by the governor.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I'm saying if we start from the base that the plan is special election which was in force and effect for a year and two months, then for whatever set of reasons there is a change, and the State has to preclear the change.  Now, what's the answer to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So you're saying that if the cause of a change is a court decision, then you do not have to preclear.  So that if in Mississippi in 1975, there had been a ruling of a court which said segregationist plan number one here is no good, so we're going to go back to the even worse plan that was before, that that wouldn't have had to have been precleared?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You see where I'm going, and I'm not phrasing it correctly, but you can answer it anyway.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But what my question is, is there any authority for the proposition that between 1964 and today, it mattered whether the cause of a change in a State plan was a decision of let's say five members of a court... of a State court... or whether it was a legislative decision.  Because that's what I think you're arguing, and is there any authority that supports you on that?   ",07-77XX
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, is it?  Because... I mean, what they're saying is let's use a little common sense here.  And you look at Fordice and there it was an instance where it just didn't take effect at all as a practical matter.  And then we cited those two cases you're talking about, but I can't tell from the Fordice opinion... there was a ward system that was in fact in force or effect.  But I don't know how long that ward system was in effect.  It might have been for a long time, and people might have taken action under it.  And the same thing is true in City of Lockhart.  I can't tell.  You may know.  But my point is they are saying: Here we have a middle case, and what we want is to use enough sense to say, look, it wasn't really in effect.  People challenged it the minute they could.  They... everybody knew it was unconstitutional, or a lot of people believed it.  And the Governor then did something to make up for it.  If you're going to say that that little bit counts as putting it in force and effect, you know what we're going to have?  We're going to have every municipality all over the country that doesn't always know what the rules are, and they pass something, and people challenge it immediately, it's obviously wrong, and they're stuck with it as a matter of Federal law.  That's going to be a mess.  They're saying something like that, so I'd like to hear your response.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, Young versus Fordice, that's Young versus... I mean, if it never went into force and effect, of course we don't reach questions like republican form of government or 1964 safe harbors and so forth.  And so I think it's an important matter.  And as I read Fordice, we have over here an instance where nothing happened.  You know, some people registered and then immediately they were told the registration was no good.  So it wasn't in force and effect.  When I looked at Perkins v. Matthews, that was not a case where the law was challenged immediately.  Rather, what Justice Brennan said is that this has been in effect from 1962 to 1965 at least, and in 1965 they had an election under the ward system.  So even if it might have been unconstitutional or it was, it was still in effect for three years.  In the other case, City of Lockhart, Justice Powell says this statute has been in effect, we assume, from 1917 to 1973.  That's not exactly a fleeting matter.  So... so here we have a case where they challenged it instantly, where it was litigated as fast as it possibly could be, where in fact, as Justice Ginsburg just said, a different decision of the circuit court would have led to the opposite of it never would have even had it.  So what harm does it do to the enforcement of the civil rights laws of the United States if the holding of this Court were, well, under these circumstances, where challenged immediately, et cetera, it never took force and effect?

Answer this question, please, because it will help me: The obvious response is the response the Government made.  You can take any -- which is what Justice Alito said.  So I would just like to you elaborate on it.  You can take anything that the D.A. does that is wrong in the case, you know, some horrible thing he did.  And maybe he shouldn't be immune, but he is, okay?  Or maybe he should be.  There we are.  So, here I know I can't bring this suit, but here's what I claim: You failed to have a system that did.  and now we fill in the blank.  And whatever that blank is, it's going to be something that would have stopped him from doing this bad thing.  In your case, it happens to be an information dissemination system.  In other case, it would be some other kind of system that would have the effect of stopping this bad thing.  So, their point is that, if you can go ahead with yours, so can anybody else go ahead with theirs, and that is the end of immunity.  Okay?  Now, what is your response?  That's what I want to know.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Sure, it's easy.  What the prosecutor does is he makes the most horrendous prejudicial argument you'd ever see.  So we say: What you need in the D.A.'s office, since this happens all the time, are classes, or what you need is a special section of the library where they have horrible arguments underlined, okay?  [Laughter]  And so, I can do that.  So can you.  You are very good at it.  And any good lawyer can do that.  And that's their point.  So, if your only response, that's your response, your point is that a good lawyer, while he can do yours, couldn't do others, I understand the response.  I'm not sure I agree with it.   ",07-854X

So that charity goes and says, could you -- we'd like a payroll deduction.  Can they get it, or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  You don't know.  Okay.  So, then, we do know this.  We do know -- what I'm wondering is: Isn't this case, to me, quite confused about something fairly simple?  The question would be: Look, one, do you or do you not in Idaho allow anybody to have payroll deductions for anything?  And I take it your answer to that question is: Yes, we do allow some payroll deductions for some things.  Okay?  So then we look at this one, and it says: No payroll deductions for union activities that are political.  All right?  Now, you either do have or you do not have a justification for that difference.  If you have a reasonable, or whatever the sufficient test is, justification for the difference, you win.  And if you don't, you lose.  And, indeed, whether you are the State or the county could have to do with the plausibility of the justification.  Here we are, end of case, traditional.  You just -- you didn't argue it that way, I guess, below.  What's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There certainly, I would think, would be a problem if the right-to-work people can get there.  And you are not going to let the unions get there.  But I don't know the facts.  So shouldn't we just send this case back and say: Please look at what the situation is?  If they have to treat some people one way, some people another, bad; if they don't, everybody is treated alike for good reason, probably okay.   ",07-869X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  It's at that part, just where you are, that I've always had a hard time not for lack of trying.  I don't understand what the word 15 times you can explain it.  And the thing I don't understand it about is it seems to me government engages in thousands of different kinds of activity, and there isn't some special test.  When they say that in the jury room, the jury room is there for juries; it's not to show movies of Steven Spielberg.  And there isn't some special test when you say the purpose of the biology class is to teach biology, and we don't want people coming in here teaching some other thing.  I don't understand what this special test called 30 seconds or 45 seconds to see if you can help me?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't -- for example, in biology class, the school board says: You know, biology teacher, I want you to teach biology; I don't want you to teach politics.  And then there is some special scrutiny about how the biology teacher is to teach or -- but they say just face it.  The jury room is for juries.  It's not for politics.  All that is subject to some special First Amendment test?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They might.  But you know a lot of them, you know you could show movies in jury rooms in the evening and people might find it much better.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Are you saying -- is it your view that heightened scrutiny applies whenever a government tells any group that wants to raise money for political purposes in any way they want involving the government that it can't?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Okay.  I thought the answer would be no.  Then, will you try to say in a sentence or two if the answer is it heightened scrutiny doesn't apply to any kind of an effort to raise money for political purposes where they say to the government you got to help me, when does it apply and when doesn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But then you are making -- say it always applies except in a few little exceptions.  I mean I know there is one for government speech and so forth.  But you're saying whenever the government tells a person you can't, for example, go to the city hall and raise money, you can't do it in the jury room, you can't raise money here, you can't raise money there, dah, dah, dah, or you can't speak there, you can't -- it's always heightened scrutiny?   Stephen G. Breyer  You cannot -- you have to use heightened scrutiny when the FDA, for example -- you know, the case I wrote in -- the FDA says you cannot advertise on a label for a drug.  We don't want advertising.  We don't want advertising on the label.  That's heightened scrutiny.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And regulation of government employees is the same?   ",07-869X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Am I right in -- I just want to get the facts right.  Am I right, you did this historical research, and if you start with Apprendi we can go all the way back to Nebuchadnezzar and you haven't found a single case ever where it was a jury rather than a judge that made this question of how you put together sentences for two separate crimes committed on the same occasion?  Is that right, or is it an overstatement?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't say how far you went back.  I said as far as you went back.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know what Nebuchadnezzar found, but I take it you did look to see what was true at the time of the writing of the Constitution.   Stephen G. Breyer  And at the time of the writing of the Constitution, which sometimes some of us feel is relevant, in that instance they did have the judge, not the jury, decide how to create a total sentence where the person had committed two crimes on the same occasion.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about the -- what about restitution, forfeiture, taking a child and having him tried as an adult?  What about probation?  What about alternative drug programs?  What about diversion?  I mean, I can think of five or six where there might be a factual finding necessary to proceed to a situation where the total amount of punishment is greater rather than less.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And doesn't the sentencing -- doesn't the Federal law define a sentence to include restitution, to include what is the equivalent of probation?  I mean, there is a broad definition of the word ""sentence"" in the law which includes some of the things that I mentioned, though not all.   ",07-901X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  In Oregon traditionally if a burglar had broken into a house and while he was in the house commits a rape, traditionally in Oregon that would not be considered two crimes?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can you cite me an Oregon case which says a burglar who breaks in and commits rape is only guilty of one crime?   Stephen G. Breyer  How are you to prove these?  I am always curious as to the defense policy as to why.  Stricter and stricter rules here, and I have a hard time figuring out why.  If you have an actual case and you have to go to trial, are you prepared to put on all the evidence that although you want to say that your client did neither of these things, that if he did do them, in fact they were just one thing and weren't separate things?  I mean are you prepared to go into all that detail in front of the jury?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, you are saying that the standard they use here for a separate sentencing, that it has to be a separate crime and so forth, has to go to the jury.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So I wonder if you are prepared to put all those facts before the jury, say, in a case where you want to say that it wasn't my defendant who did it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That way, you have to have two--   Stephen G. Breyer  --And in addition, it must be true too that the defendant is entitled not to pay restitution if the facts show that there was no money taken.  And you needn't, by the way, convict the person.  You can convict him without finding that.  So the same would be true of restitution.  We would have another jury to decide restitution, another thing that has never been done; is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, couldn't impose restitution without making a finding as to how much money was taken.  So I don't -- I don't -- I can't imagine the legislature--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  The Federal courts have not and I guess the same rule would apply.  Or what about forfeiture of a car used in the drug -- again, forfeiture, I guess, would take place with another jury being impanelled to try the question of whether there was a car; is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  It's a punishment.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe not.  Maybe it would just be an in rem proceeding.  What about the -- what about the proceeding -- what about the determination that a person who is going to trial goes to an adult court rather than a juvenile court, the difference being the extent of the punishment?  You are not entitled to -- a complete defense to the punishments that they could impose.  Do you see where I am going?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not sure which of these things would actual follow from your rule and which wouldn't.   Stephen G. Breyer  But they will say no one can get this lower punishment for the juvenile system unless the person is indeed a juvenile.  Who makes that factual finding?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If we are going to depart from what the Framers did in fact foresee in this kind of case and we do accept Apprendi as something different from what they did apply, does that require us to depart as well in all these other cases which have the kinds of differences that you have listened to?

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose the reason -- suppose the reason that they did that -- suppose they are very honest about their reasons, and they say, we think class actions are very often a very good thing, because a lot of people who are hurt can get some recovery and it acts as a deterrent.  But there is some bad things about them.  And one of the bad things is, somebody files a lawsuit, and before you know it, the litigation expenses are so high that the company feels it has to settle.  Now, in our view that latter factor predominates.  And that means that these procedures, class actions, will sometimes -- too often -- lead to the unjust, inefficient settlement of disputes.  And that's why we are doing it.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, if that's exactly what we did, why isn't that second-guessing the judgment of the rule that they are saying it is efficient -- an inefficient procedure.  It is inefficient in terms of the object of -- of the Federal rules and what the class wanted.  We want efficient methods of achieving justice.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Overdeterrence because they feel that the class action procedure is one that leads to forcing companies to settle, and to that extent the class action procedure does not lead to the efficient determination of disputes but to the inefficient and unjust determination.  That's their honest reason.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, it does.  It says it's the judicial process that does it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's the judicial process and its expanse--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --that forces the settlements that create unjust results.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That may be, and suppose they said, you know, a 30-day period for appeal creates unjust results in our opinion, and therefore we think it is more efficient to have a 90-day appeal period.  That wouldn't last for 2 seconds, wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So how is this different?   ",08-1008
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why do we need that theory?  I mean, why not just say what Newman said and the others said?  There is no free-standing right.  There is just a right not to convict a person with made-up evidence, and of course a prosecutor insofar as he's involved in the prosecutorial stage is absolutely immune.  But if he's involved in the investigatorial stage of that event, well, then he's not immune absolutely.  That's a policy decision.  That has nothing to do with free-standing rights.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Then I'm making that argument.   Stephen G. Breyer  Mere foreseeability.  You can fill in those boundaries, Toffler, not Toffler, as you wish.  But the basic theory isn't a problem because, after all, we're just drawing a line somewhere within the stage of an ongoing tort on the basis of policy, and Buckley suggests such a line.  I don't see a conceptual problem there, is my problem.  Maybe there are practical problems, but I don't see a conceptual one.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I interrupt you right there.  I would say they are not absolutely immune for the whole constitutional offense.  That's the line I'm trying to draw.   Stephen G. Breyer  So I agree with you on that.  I agree with you.  I won't do it.  I'll take it as one tort.  Began before the investigation stage, ends with conviction.  One tort.  Now, within that tort we draw a line and we draw a line based on policy purposes as to when the prosecutor is absolutely or qualifiedly immune, and where that line comes is Buckley, approximately.  Okay?  Now, I don't see a conceptual problem with that and I'm having a hard time finding a practical problem.   ",08-1065
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  There's a different tendency, which I would say this is a slight fluke, what you're describing.  I'm more worried about what Justice Alito brought up, that, other things being equal, I think it's probably a good thing to get prosecutors involved in the questioning process.  That -- that has a kind of check on the police.  And the concern I'd have is that the -- this will discourage the prosecutors from becoming involved in the witness -- witness questioning process, at least not before the police are well on the way.  And that is a very negative incentive, I would think.  So what is your most pro-prosecutorial rule that you could live with that will in fact minimize the risk of that kind of disincentive?  Now, are you just going to say, well, Buckley?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or is there something -- I mean, I can see Buckley with the, you know, probable cause.  It turns on and off as you're talking to the witness.  First what he says, you have the probable cause; then you don't; then you do; then you don't.  I mean, I -- I'm not -- I just want you to give your best thought to this problem and tell me what is the most safe rule that will allow you to win your case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We have amicus briefs here that give us a lot of reason.  They say -- they say it's very discouraging to, you know, AUSAs or DAs going in and talking to the witnesses with the police.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And they say they do it in Chicago, I think.  In other places, they do it a lot.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, also, you're making me more worried because I think, if 85 percent of all the defendants -- or 90 percent plead guilty, it might be a highly desirable thing to get prosecutors involved in the truth-discovering process, I mean, so that they don't just see themselves as the job of -- well, we're going to take somebody, put them in jail.  Maybe -- maybe that's a reason for pushing it back a little bit, this -- this line.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where have you got it now?  You've got it as when there is probable cause for believing that someone has committed a crime?   Stephen G. Breyer  Someone?  So it's someone -- needn't be the particular person they eventually indict?   Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   INTERRUPTING ",08-1065
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, so what if it isn't?  I mean, suppose you had a statute, and the statute says it is a crime to mug a man from Denver.  That's a Denver ordinance, by the way ----  [Laughter]  --because no one else would pass it.  But I mean, if those are the elements of the crime, I guess, we do normally apply ""knowingly"" to each of them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Whether -- even if it isn't ordinary usage.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I was slightly trying to push you on to the next argument.  [Laughter]   ",08-108X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  Because that's what we normally bring into sentencing.  I mean, normally, in that we don't impose mandatory -- we impose mandatory sentences when the person does something, you know, that's wrong and he knows it's wrong.  When -- when harm occurs, and the harm wasn't known or intended, you can take care of it if you are a judge.  You increase the sentence.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's the problem?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why not just says ""means of identification"", then?  I mean, it's odd to write a statute that has elements and you put the word ""knowingly"", and the ""knowingly"" is supposed to modify some elements but not others.  I can't think of other statutes that do that.  There may be some.  It's pretty peculiar.  You could have left off the last element.  I mean, if you are drafting a criminal statute, anyone would know that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Give me one where what they've done is they have used ""knowingly"" at the beginning, and there are four elements of the crime, and -- I'm not saying there are none, but I'd like to know what they are where ""knowingly"" doesn't modify something there is strict liability for.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's going to be jurisdictional -- probably jurisdictional hooks, like Hobbs Act, and there could be -- there could be some.  But I don't see -- you tell me.   Stephen G. Breyer  You can do it--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Even that isn't -- I mean, here you're treating it as if it is a separate thing.  That's fair enough.  And what are the words ""of another person"" doing there if really they are not supposed to make any difference in terms of mental state?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All that is true, and that's actually where I was going.  It -- it seems to me where the ambiguity is precisely is that none of us doubts, I don't think, that what Congress is after with this extra two-year mandatory is identity theft.  And where the argument lies is between, did Congress do this by punishing people only who intend to engage in identity theft or people who, while not intending to do so, have that effect?  That's the issue.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I don't think I can resolve that one way or the other from anything you have said.  It's rather hard to say.  So, therefore, suppose I use the rule of lenity this way, which I am trying out, I'm not buying it: In the case of mandatory-minimum sentences, there is a particularly strong argument for a rule of lenity with bite.  And that is because mandatory minimums, given the human condition, inevitably throw some people into the box who shouldn't be there.  And if this person should be there and we put him outside, the judge could give him the same sentence anyway.  So the harm by mistakenly throwing a person outside the box through the rule of lenity to the government is small.  The harm to the individual by wrongly throwing him into the box is great.  The rule of lenity is, therefore, limited to a very small subset of cases where it has particular force, but this is one of them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's why I raised it.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Now, but when you say it isn't referred to, it seems to me to be referred to.  It says  ""The term ""debt relief agency"" means-- ""  ""any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person. ""  And the term ""bankruptcy assistance"" is defined to include  ""appearing in a case or proceeding on behalf of another or providing legal representation with respect to a case or proceeding. ""  Doesn't a lawyer provide legal representation?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So doesn't the term ""provide legal representation"" include a lawyer?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes; they include other people besides lawyers.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know.  What is it getting at with  ""providing legal representation with respect to a case? ""   Stephen G. Breyer  It would seem to be a lawyer.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  Those are other people who are covered.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What the attorney says is, Here's what we will do; when we file for bankruptcy, I will ask the Court to approve my own fees as something that is continuing after bankruptcy.   Stephen G. Breyer  And he says, This is what they will be.  So what is the harm--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --since that's what he has to do, of making him tell his client that that's what he has to do?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, you -- you can't?  This prevents you had from saying, What I'm going to do is ask the bankruptcy judge to approve what I just said?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Of course.  And so what's wrong with the law that tells the lawyer that's what he has to tell the client?   ",08-1119
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What he -- what I think his argument is, as I understand it, is if you look at the definition of ""bankruptcy assistance"", you will see there are seven different things that a person could do and fall within that definition.  And all of those seven things are probably provided by the kinds of agencies you see advertised on television, which say: We will help you with your debts.  And they probably aren't lawyers.  And, so, if you look at the six of the seven things, it's clear that all of those are provided by those television companies.  And the seventh is simply added in, namely the providing legal representation, to be a catch-all to be sure that if one of those companies actually does something that is legal representation, even though they are not lawyers, they are caught, too.  So he is saying, read the whole paragraph and then you will see they are after the companies that appear on television and they're not after lawyers.  And then he says that's the history of the bill, and so forth and so on.  Okay.  Now, that's the argument, and so it isn't -- can't quite be brushed off as quickly, I think, as you did.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  I mean, there could not only be lawyers.  I mean, there are numerous proceedings where your brother, your mother, your cousin, your friend appears for you.  They say: Bring a friend, bring one of us.  [Laughter]  We will charge you very little, we will save you money.  I am a lawyer, by the way.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I have relatives who aren't, and you can bring one of them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't how this works exactly.  I'm not an expert.  I thought that, when someone goes bankrupt, that one of the things you ask the bankruptcy judge for is permission to pay for ongoing expenses, and that would include an attorney's fee.  Otherwise, people could never be represented.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, so why is there some incentive here?  All the attorney has to do is follow ordinary procedure.   ",08-1119
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What's the strongest case, I mean, that you can muster in favor of this proposition, my question being the same as Justice Sotomayor's?  What's the strongest case where you can find any court that said a matter is void -- it's void, not -- not just legal error, so you can attack it 90 years later -- it's void just because the lower court that made the error didn't apply a clear statute?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Give me your strongest case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But I'd like an answer to my question, because I can -- I have read the treatises, which I have in front of me, and they say that it's void only if you show a -- the same thing that Justice Sotomayor just said.  And so, since I don't think there is some kind of constitutional due process error here, and there's clearly jurisdiction over the parties, I guess you are saying there wasn't subject matter jurisdiction, which is a little vague.  And so I want to know what's the clearest case, strongest for you, where a court has ever said that a failure of some -- of some other court to apply the language of a statute properly, no matter how clear, is a lack of subject matter jurisdiction?  What is your strongest precedent?  That's all I'm asking.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well -- we're conceding that they violated the statute, the bankruptcy judge.  The question is whether it's void.  And void, as you just said, was three categories: One, was there a violation of basic due process for your client?  I don't see it.  Two, did the bankruptcy judge have jurisdiction over the parties?  It seems the answer is yes.  And, three, did they have subject matter jurisdiction?  Which we started by saying was vague.  So I asked you for your strongest case.  You said Vallely.  I have only looked at it quickly, but it's only four pages.  And what that case seems to say is that there is a statute which says there is bankruptcy jurisdiction over all commercial businesses except for insurance companies and two other categories.  This party here is an insurance company, and therefore they can attack it later, because there was no jurisdiction over an insurance company.  Now, if that's your strongest case, I don't know what the others are going to say, but it seems to me you don't have much precedental support to put this in a category of lacking jurisdiction.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what about the consequence of -- there happen to be -- well, I counted -- 14 different kinds of things that follow that comma, including criminal fines, sentences.  There are all kinds of things.  And is it the consequence of my accepting your argument that anybody who is a creditor in respect to any of those 14 things can come in at any time and announce under Rule 60(b)(4), even if it's 10 years later, that the district court -- the bankruptcy court made a mistake?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, that would be quite -- to me -- extraordinary.  So I hope the answer from your point of view must still be no.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Wait a moment.  What would it be in the case where you have a discharge order and it says things in it which somebody feels fall within 1 of these 13 categories?  Now, are you saying that that somebody can come back and make his argument 15 years later, because he will say that, since it falls in that category, the judgment is void insofar as this language covers what I don't want it to cover?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but you see, it's the same problem that's bothering us.  I would like a yes or no answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is it the case if somebody feels the conditions were not met with in the 13 categories that -- or 14 -- that follow the comma, he -- you feel that they were met.  The other side says, they weren't met.  I sent him a notice, but it was in a balloon, okay.  You know, was the notice a real notice, wasn't it?  People argue about that.  So in any case where you have a person who says, no, they weren't met, and the other side says, yes, they were met, that first person can come back 13 years later and say that the judgment was void?  Is the answer of the government yes or no?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Is there any--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Oh, they may not have said it right, but they -- but they -- that's a different problem.  But the -- the -- why doesn't the Treasury just say to people: We're not going to insure your loans where you don't object.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Then the government is harmless.   INTERRUPTING ",08-1134
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But why would it not be a sanctionable matter under Rule 11?  If -- the lawyer knows that he is supposed to make this special claim to get this kind of discharge -- he knows an ordinary claim won't do it.  He submits a paper that asks for the ordinary discharge, but he has to sign it, and that sign -- that signature, is a -- is a certification that to the best of his knowledge, the claims and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law.  So if he signs it knowing that that isn't the way to do it -- indeed, there is not even an argument for doing it that way, for modifying the law -- then why isn't that a sanctionable matter under Rule 11?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, the reason I ask that--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --The reason I ask that is I think the argument on the other side is that it's so clear in the law that this is not the way to go about it, that you have to make a separate piece of paper saying you have special hardship; that that's so clear what Congress wanted, that 40 years later you can come back and attack it, if they didn't do it.  I mean, that's basically, in my mind, their argument.  But I think a simpler way would be to say if it's that clear, if it really is that clear, the bar itself will enforce the rule by not knowingly deviating from the way that Congress set it out, to which there is no legal objection.  Now, is it really -- what do you think of that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I wasn't making any conditions.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's -- that's what why it's a -- this is actually -- the part that is a lack of understanding or a complete understanding on my part, is -- is how Rule 60(b) works, because -- because it does-the law does have the three categories -- the three categories that your friend described.  And this third category is supposed to prevent a discharge even where the creditor doesn't object, unless certain things are filled out, and they weren't.  So the three are there, made an objection.  If at any point the creditor had come in and objected, not to the discharge but, you know, just said, hey, it's the wrong form; you've got it wrong.  It's like an error-they win.   Stephen G. Breyer  But -- but they waited a very long time.   Stephen G. Breyer  So now they have to come in, I guess, under 60(b), and it must be either 60(b)(4) or 60(b)(6)--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and I take it there's a time limit on that, and the time limit is ""a reasonable time"".  Is that how we are supposed to do, that we have to say they didn't file -- if fact they never filed 60 -- it's your side that filed the 60(b)(4), I gather.  So this is good and mixed up.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's good and mixed up.  So what is -- how is it supposed to work?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING ",08-1134
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What about the right in Miranda that says -- in Miranda --  ""We hold an individual held for interrogation must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with the lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation. ""  Okay?  Where does it say that?  Interpret it any way you want.  You know, we are used to grand juries.  In a grand jury, he can go consult with a lawyer, but he doesn't have the lawyer with him.  So, where does it tell him that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm just asking you to point to the words that tell him that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Don't have you a right to talk to a lawyer at a grand jury?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, correct.  And so aren't you supposed to tell this person, that unlike a grand jury, you have a right to have the lawyer with you during interrogation?  I mean, it isn't as if that was said in passing in Miranda.  They wrote eight paragraphs about it.  And I just wonder, where does it say in this warning you have the right to have the lawyer with you during the interrogation?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't use the word ""present"", Miranda?  It says right here: ""We hold"" -- it says --  ""not just prior to questioning, but also to have counsel present during any questioning. ""  That's what Miranda says.  And then Miranda, after discussing it for five pages, goes on to use the words I just said.  You have to tell him he has the right to have counsel with him.  So it does use the word ""present"".   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what FBI are we talking about?  Because the FBI advice of rights says:  ""You have the right to have a lawyer with you during questioning. ""  Were they -- and -- and I was taken by the fact,  ""We hold that an individual must be clearly informed. ""  And so, is there some other case that says -- or some other FBI statement that they give people that doesn't use the words ""with you"", that says you don't have to say ""with you during"", or doesn't have to say ""present during""?  Was there some other case that said that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Excuse me.  Can you just devote one minute before you finish--   Stephen G. Breyer  --to the question of why these are adequate?  If you remember my question, I tried to explain why I thought they might not be adequate.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But there were four.  One is to have during, in the presence of, the right to have a lawyer during the interrogation, in the presence of, with him at the time.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, that's one of the four.  That's one of the things they devote two pages to Miranda, and they repeat it when they summarize what you have to say.  I just want to know where in this statement does it say that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Really?  I guess anybody who has had prior experience with the law, as this man might have done, might be familiar with a grand jury proceeding.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no.  But I tell you: Here's your right to talk to a lawyer before questioning.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you then repeat, you can assert that right whenever you want, to talk to him before questioning.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And my question is, how does that tell him he has a right to have a lawyer with him during questioning, that the questioning he has a right to have take place from beginning to end in the presence of a lawyer, a matter that the Miranda Court repeated three times in the summary and wrote eight full paragraphs about why that was important?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where does it say it approves that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It wasn't though, actually.   Stephen G. Breyer  It isn't -- it isn't consistent with it.  That's interesting.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They didn't say anything about during.   Stephen G. Breyer  So anyway -- then they don't need to mention FBI warning at that time, J. Edgar Hoover's letter or whatever it was, just talked about telling you, you have a right to counsel.  It doesn't say anything about ""during"".   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So then you think that, in fact, going by that warning, that there is no constitutional right to have them say a word about during.  This would be okay if they said nothing at all about it.

Breyer  Is -- is there since then -- I mean, as I read it now I see that, as I said, it seems very clear that they intend you to have to say that the counsel has to be -- is present with you.  Present, okay?  Now the FBI warnings, which they did say is consistent, don't say that.   Stephen G. Breyer  They don't.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, since the time of Miranda, has this Court ever talked about that?  Has there been any lower court or have there been -- has the practice of the departments to any great extent been such that they stopped talking, or did not talk, or never spoke about a right to have a counsel with you during -- during -- ""during"" just dropped out.  They just said forget about ""during"".  It wasn't--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --This Court has referred to ""during"".   ",08-1175
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  No, I think they're saying -- which I am getting gradually--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I think what he's saying is: First, we know what bribery is; we can deal with that one.  Second, we know what kickbacks are; we can deal with that one.  And what he means by the honest services other than that is, imagine a list of 5 million bits of honest service that a workman has to perform for his employer.  Now, on that list, there might be 35 requirements to disclose something where the interest of the employer goes -- employee goes the other way.  And he's saying it violates the statute not to do that in circumstances where the employee knows that the failure to disclose will, in fact, lead the employer, to whom he should have disclosed it, to make a significant decision; namely, that decision to avoid which was the reason he didn't disclose it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I think what he is saying is that's rather precise.  That fits with what was there before, and therefore, all the government is saying is: Now we have those three things.  If you didn't quite -- I didn't quite get that out of the brief, but that may be my fault.  All right?  So anyway, it was probably there; when I go back, I'll see it.  And those are the three things.  So he's saying: You see?  It doesn't matter the source as long as there is a clear legal obligation, which could come from corporation law, for the employee to disclose the conflict in this situation.  I think that's what it is.  Well, and so what's your response to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You are saying, I take it, that there was no duty in Alaska criminal law, disclosure law, to disclose.  I think you might find in a treatise on agency that there is a duty to disclose.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not even in the Uniform Commercial Code or the--   ",08-1196
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  And this is supposed to be something that the average citizen who works there just knows all about?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He intended not to disclose something, right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, okay.  I see.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, now -- now think of that answer -- complete that answer, if you can.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, go back to -- I'm trying to get you back to your general answer that you wanted to give.  And I -- I -- remember my list of 6,000 things--   Stephen G. Breyer  --which I made up, and these are all the things that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --an employee owes an employer.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, some of them -- you have taken out three -- no bribes, no kickbacks and no conflicts of interest where that's defined in the narrow way you've defined it.  You have to know you are not disclosing, you know you have the obligation, you know action will be taken on it, and the action will be taken to help somebody else or to the detriment of the employer or something like that.  Right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Something like that.  Okay.  [Laughter]  So, now, I think, well, I go back to Justice Scalia's language of that statute.  And I say, oh, my goodness, why did you pick these three?  I mean, I can easily -- I make up comical examples because they illustrate the point.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But I don't mean them to be comical.  Look, think of a person who is really angry at his employer and he changes all the direction signs around in the building to mislead him so that the employer will miss the key meeting and make the wrong decision.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, why not that one?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  That's not my point.  I don't believe the way you've interpreted the statute that you could or would -- could prosecute what I just made up as a funny example.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I can make up thousands of examples from the list, and I think Justice Scalia's original point was something like, well, you've taken some words, 28 words that cover 6,000 things, and out of those 6,000 things, you have picked, perhaps randomly, 3 which--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --you say it covers.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, you picked them -- all right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I thought there was a principle that a citizen is supposed to be able to understand the criminal law that was around even before Justice Scalia.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the Sherman Act criminalizes price fixing.  You see, I can say that in two words, intentional price fixing.  Do you think what we have been talking about this morning can be reduced to anything like those two words?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, let me ask a quick question here.  I notice, in the Skilling case, the first question is whether the statute requires the government to prove the defendant's conduct was intended to achieve private gain, et cetera, and if not, whether the statute is unconstitutionally vague.  Now, does that first question give the government an opportunity sufficient to say whatever it wants in its brief about the constitutional question?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So we could assume that, if you need time, at that time, you could ask for whatever you wanted to ask for?   ",08-1196
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But there is no such answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought, in contracts, there is no such answer.  When you interpret a contract and it doesn't say, you try to figure out -- I used to be taught that; probably I am way out-of-date -- you try to figure out what a reasonable party would have intended.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I thought that's what Bazzle said, that--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Not as out-of-date.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I see that now, but then -- but there are two separate questions.   Stephen G. Breyer  My question was, first, the same as Justice Ginsburg.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I have a question for you on that, because in reading these briefs, I thought your description of who is to decide this matter of whether there is to be a class action was just what you said: The question of who should decide it is a matter for the parties.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So when I looked at -- I just have been reading Bazzle three, five times, and there seemed--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  But what it seems to say is that that's a matter to figure out from a contract and background circumstances.  In Bazzle, the contract was: Any -- all disputes relating to this contract.  Here, it doesn't say that.  It says:  ""Any dispute arising from the performance, termination, or making of the contract. ""  Now, a class-action determination does relate to.  Maybe it doesn't arise out of, okay?  That's an argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So why are all these briefs saying that what Bazzle said was: Whenever this is silent, it goes to the arbitrator; the who question is answered at arbitration.  I can't find it saying that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, I know.  I know.  But what I actually thought doesn't matter.  What matters is what is said.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you're -- so the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question is, as to the who question, who shall decide whether or not in your case class actions are permissible?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The who question in Bazzle, because of the contract and background, was the arbitrator.   Stephen G. Breyer  The who question here, irrespective of the contract is the arbitrator for the reason that Justice Ginsburg said.  There's a separate saying: You are the who; you, arbitrators, are the who.   Stephen G. Breyer  So now we look to the what.  They then decided it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What -- what did they decide?  And you are saying that's wrong.  And there you run into all the authority, Misco, who used to be in other places, saying when the arbitrator says something, unless it's in Marrs, follow it.  That's what you are addressing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That -- isn't that -- you and I have a contract.  I'll ship you 17 pounds of durum wheat, and you will pay me $43.  In the meantime, a green worm eats up all the durum wheat, and therefore they can't send durum wheat; they send some duhu wheat.  All right?  Question: Is the contract valid or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  Answer: We have courts for that purpose.  We have arbitrators for that purpose.   Stephen G. Breyer  Arbitrators will look to see what it says.  If it says nothing, they will try to determine what the parties thought.  If they can't determine what they thought, they will look to custom, analogy, et cetera.  Now--   Stephen G. Breyer  --They won't?   ",08-1198
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's where I started this.  We don't get many contract interpretation cases, and that's why I -- I needed to go back to Jack Dawson, who is a great contracts professor.  And I am--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What?   Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't have that pleasure, but the--  [Laughter]  The -- but the -- as I recall, the way I would have interpreted -- imagine a worker who says: I have a right, permission -- it's permissible for me to eat lunch next to the machine.  The employer says no.  The question was what is -- does the contract permit this or not?  So the arbitrator or the judge reads the words.  Nothing.  They have no idea.  Then the judge or the arbitrator reads the rest of the contract.  Hasn't a clue.  Then the arbitrator or the judge goes and looks and sees what's practice around here?  ""I don't know"".  Then they might look to what happens in the rest of the industry.  Then they might look to what happens in foreign countries with comparable industries.  Then they might look to public policy.  They might look almost to anything under the sun they think is relevant, and the way, in jargon, you describe the bottom line is: They have found a meeting of the minds as to what this means.  Now, of course, it isn't really a meeting of the minds.  But that's just the summary of the conclusion as to what, objectively read, those words in the contract mean.  Now, that's how I think I would have learned it.  Is that still done, or is there some other way of describing it?   Stephen G. Breyer  If that's contract law--   Stephen G. Breyer  --then I take it what they're saying is: It may be true that the arbitrators, when they looked at some of those elements, really got it wrong.  Now, if they are correct on that -- this is the other question I have.  You are going to say: No, they're not -- they didn't get it that wrong; wrong, maybe, but not that wrong.  All right.  Now, can they not do this?  The next person who has this form contract does not so readily agree it's up to the arbitrator to say whether that contains a class action or not.  Rather, they say: I read this contract as reserving that question to the court.  It's not the same language as was there in Bazzle; it's not the same industry of the kind you had in Bazzle; and, therefore, a judge should decide that.  That's the meeting of the minds on the who question.  And then we'll get it all resolved, because the judge might come out differently if they're right, and maybe arbitrators will follow the judge.  I'm interested, because we might have to write something, in your answer to that question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not -- we know they're going to -- they have something already in place.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There's a supplemental agreement here because I thought--   Stephen G. Breyer  --in reading this, the supplemental agreement submitted the case under Rule 3--   Stephen G. Breyer  --of the AAA, and it's supplement--   Stephen G. Breyer  --rule 3 of the AAA supplementary rules says, an arbitrator shall, quote,  ""determine, as a threshold matter, in a reasoned, partial, final award, on the construction of the arbitration clause, whether the applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of or against a class. ""   Stephen G. Breyer  So I thought the supplemental agreement said--   Stephen G. Breyer  --apply Rule 3, and therefore, it was asking the arbitrators to decide the question put in Rule 3.  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  So then we could get the question by reading page 7 of the blue brief.   ",08-1198
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So suddenly it's all a lot of things that would have been pre-empted to go to the board.  For example, you have a labor dispute on a construction business, and one union's out there telling the other: Keep on going.  And then some other group comes in and says: Don't let them do that to you.  And another says: You don't have to do that under your contract.  And there are 19 unions and they are all fighting about -- each other, and everybody is going to end up suing each other in Federal court.  I thought the purpose of the LMRA was to stop that.  The purpose of the Labor Act, the Wagner Act was to stop that.  They didn't want Federal courts any more than State courts interfering in that kind of thing.  So why should we read an exception into this?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It would reproduce the situation that led all the Congresses and Presidents in the 1930s to stop it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, that's right, and they said: Here's how we'll deal with that.  We'll deal with that by giving the employer and the union a right to go into court and enforce the contract or get damages for its violation.  That we figure furthers labor relations.  But it's pretty hard for me to see how it could further labor relations by letting any third party under the sun come in and say everything that went on during a labor dispute is a -- is a tort in respect to the contract that might not even have been signed yet.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but what -- there is no doubt about the formation, just as Justice Sotomayor said.  There is a contract, the contract that was signed on December 17th.  It is formed.  You don't doubt that it's formed.  They don't doubt that it's formed.  And that contract has an arbitration agreement in it.  And one of the questions that will be arbitrated, I take it, is whether that December 17th contract, because of its retroactivity provisions, provides damages for what happened in July.  And part of that will require the arbitrator to interpret the December 17th contract--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --to decide whether it does cover that event of July 2nd.  Now, what has this got to do -- I mean, I would have thought -- is that-I mean, what is your argument?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, why isn't--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I think people are not communicating.  Imagine on December 17th you and I enter into a contract and it's all written in red, all right?  And one of these red sentences says: I will pay you $32 extra an hour from the moment that the blue contract went into effect.  See?  Now, whether -- that moment when the blue contract went into effect is a question, isn't it, that we would turn over to the arbitrator, the person who is arbitrating the meaning and application of the red contract.  That's simply a question of fact and contractual meaning like any other.  Now, what have I said that's wrong?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why is that a difficult issue?  I can easily modify the hypothetical.  The red contract says: Joe Smith will be paid $32 extra an hour from the moment when this red contract takes effect.  Okay?  And, now we have an issue, when everybody's agreed, we'll send the meaning of the contract to arbitration.  We'll send the application of the contract to -- to arbitration.  One of the questions is: When, for purposes of the $32, did this contract, which we have admittedly signed, take effect?  Why isn't that question for an arbitrator?  Is there any authority at all--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --anywhere that says it isn't -- I can't -- I can't even know what authority-what reasoning it would be.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I thought of another way of putting this because I am having a hard time with it.  You and I could do this, couldn't we?  We could try to enter into a contract on May 1, and who knows what happens, we disagree about what happened, and by the way that had an arbitration clause in it.  Now, whether -- since we disagree about it, that would go to the judge, whether we formed that contract with its arbitration clause, because everything's up in the air.  A year later, we enter into another contract, and what that contract says is, we are going to arbitrate every dispute between us, including that old dispute about whether there was that old contract, okay?  And we could do that, and then you would -- you would certainly arbitrate the issue of contract formation, even for the old one, because we said we would do it, right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So why isn't the December 17th contract that second contract in respect to the July 2nd?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that may be, but then you might have -- then you'd have a remedy in State court.  I think the argument was that -- anyway, I have this argument: 301 doesn't pre-empt anything but the contract claim.  Now, go bring your claim in State court.  You might have a good claim in State court that isn't pre-empted.  Suppose one of their employees hit somebody over the head.  You'd have a great claim, and that isn't going to be pre-empted.  Now, yours might be, because there is a set of tort actions in State court that the labor acts pre-empt; in particular, those that involve conduct that is arguably protected or arguably forbidden by the labor acts.  So, if you fall outside that category, you are not pre-empted.  And if you fall inside the category, you should be pre-empted; not by 301, but by the labor law which gave this kind of decision to the labor board to make.  What is -- is that argument sensible?  Is it right?  What do you think?   ",08-1214
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Just before you finish, Chief, is it all right if you -- I'm not quite clear on how this pre-emption works, and I perhaps didn't have it right.  But imagine 301 had never been enacted.  I thought, had that never been enacted, certain kinds of State claims, particularly tort claims of interference with labor contracts, for example, might have been pre-empted anyway by the Labor Relations -- by the -- by the LMRA.  I thought that did the basic pre-emptive job.  And then where it is pre-empted by the LMRA, 301 creates an exception to the pre-emption, so that it isn't pre-empted, if you have a suit.  Now, my thinking is probably out-of-date and wrong, so I would like you to explain how it works.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, because I think that your response to the Chief Justice's question, which is why I became uncertain, is that it is the LMRA -- not the LMRA at all that pre-empts tort actions and State activities that interfere with labor relations, as this might.  It is, rather, section 301 itself that pre-empts it, and then it is odd because it pre-empts it, but it says, we won't give you any, and -- and that's why I became uncertain.   ",08-1214
1,NO QUESTIONS,08-1224
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why -- why not?  I mean, is there anything to prevent the United States Government to say: Mental illness is a serious problem in the United States, and we feel the States sometimes do a good job, sometimes they don't, but we want to set up a group of Federal mental hospitals and treatment centers of the most modern kind, and in these circumstances, there will be a handful of people who pose a threat to themselves or others, in which case they must be restrained.  There might be due process problems, whether you have the right person, whether they should be restrained, et cetera.  But doesn't the Constitution give authority to the Federal Government to set up a system of mental illness prevention and cure, if in fact they determine that that's a desirable use of Federal money?   Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't have the power to set up hospitals?   Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, if the doctors were to say, there are a thousand people here suffering from mental illness, your own daughter or mine or someone has a -- is threatening suicide or threatening murder?  There are lots of real cases like that, where people have terrible times, and there are not adequate State facilities.  And were the Federal Government to say, this is a problem that we wish to go into and help with, you are saying the Constitution prohibits that?  Where does it prohibit it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, once you're down that road -- I was rather surprised, but not too surprised, that, I think perhaps with prompting, I heard you say, I think, that the Tenth Amendment would prohibit the Federal Government from setting up a system of mental care, which you'd better tell the people across the street, if that's your view.  The -- the -- is that what you are actually saying?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Of national mental care for mentally ill people.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because you either think that the Constitution prohibits that or you think it permits it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, probably the Commerce Clause power.   Stephen G. Breyer  So it's fine--   Stephen G. Breyer  --The -- go back once more because I am obviously getting nowhere with this, but I thought that, if you set up a set of hospitals, as I think the government could do, there will be a few people, sometimes, who have to be restrained in those hospitals for themselves or others' benefit.  If you set up a system of mental hospitals, that's even more true.  If you set up a university, some people will be sick, and they will be in the infirmary, and occasionally, you will come across a person who has to be restrained, et cetera.  Now, once you are down the road where you admit the government can do that, how is a prison any different?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You set up a prison where, in fact, occasionally, people have to be restrained for health reasons, et cetera, and just as in the other cases, sometimes that can last past the normal release date, so can it in prison.  Maybe there's a better way, but why isn't this just a normal part of running this institution, just as it is in the other cases?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not, actually.  I'm just showing you the connection between running an institution, which, for whatever set of reasons in the Constitution, you have the authority to do, and then it becomes, as part of that institution, part of the job to take care of people in a certain way.  Sometimes that requires a restraint, and sometimes that restraint could last beyond the period where in the absence of that need the person would no longer be part of the institution.  That's true of a hospital, of a mental hospital, and of a prison.  Whether they rest on the same power or a different power, the government has the power, Federal, to establish all of those institutions.  I'm just drawing institutional connections.  That's -- that's what I'm saying.  Maybe that's an unnecessarily complex argument, but I was just seeing it that way.   ",08-1224
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what is the basic purpose of this statute?  I'm having a hard time with it.  Is it -- is the purpose of the statute to try to get a lot of people to register who haven't registered at all?  Or is the purpose of the statute to get the people who had registered in one State and then moved, and make sure they register in another State?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I mean, if they are just trying to get people to register in general, and they are not particularly worried about travel, then they are using this travel as a kind of jurisdictional hook.  And if they are using it as a jurisdictional hook, they'd like to get everybody, as many as possible.  That argues against you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I have a hard time seeing just what they're aiming at.   Stephen G. Breyer  Basically, at the time they passed this--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --most States didn't require registration.   Stephen G. Breyer  Would you say this at the moment -- you may not know, but I think it would be helpful.  At the time this was passed, would you say almost all States had some kind of registration act?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, thinking of that -- thinking of that set of registration acts in virtually every State, did most of those or none of them or a few of them or how many made it required that a person register who had committed a crime, a sex crime, in a different State and had moved to that State?  Most, all of them, none of them?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Universally.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So -- so, therefore, every person who has committed a sex offense, or almost everyone, would have been subject to a requirement to move when he committed the offense and would have been subject to a requirement to register when he moved under some law.  Now, Congress's purpose then must have been just to try to get uniformity here.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't.  He said, first the crime has to take place, before the travel.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And, moreover, there's a statutory limitation, because after a certain period of years, you don't have to register anymore.  So the hypotheticals about the infant and 20 years ago are out, because the longest it could last is 15 years.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then you wouldn't have committed the crime as an infant, so there we are.  But it's still a long time, 15 years, I grant you.   INTERRUPTING ",08-1301
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what about going back to the purpose?  There's a section on page 26 of the House report where they go in some length to saying that the purpose is this is going to help with 100,000 missing people.  Don't worry; if you can't remember, it doesn't matter.  What they say is there are 100,000 missing.  What they do is they travel, let's say, from Alabama to California and they don't register.  Now, this statute is going to help with that.  Well, how does it help with that?  They are already supposed to register in California.  And I thought, well, maybe the way it helps with that is that it imposes some new information requirements, so that Alabama, if it were complying, would now have a lot of information about the sex offender, and it would have an obligation -- it could more easily track him down, or at least California could or somebody could more easily track him down, because he has to give information to Alabama, and Alabama has a registry up.  Is there something like that in this?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but that's -- that's true of everybody whether they have moved or not moved.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That is, what I'm -- the reason I brought up the other is because if this is just a jurisdictional hook, I can see why Congress might be trying to get as many people as they want to register.  But this -- this also serves some purpose, like we're going to make Alabama get some information, makes it easier to catch these people, that purpose wouldn't be served when the travel takes place before this takes effect because Alabama wouldn't have kept the information then.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So Congress passes this statute.  And how does it help specifically with that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So the person who hasn't registered in California--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --He's afraid of the Feds.  He didn't -- he wasn't afraid of the California police, but he's afraid of the Feds.  Okay.  I've got it.  I've got that.  Any other thing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  As far as I can read that page, it seemed to me, insofar as what you've just said is true, that would happen only after this statute is passed.  And, therefore, the fact that he had moved before the statute is passed would not trigger the cooperation.  It might trigger the Fed prosecution part, but it wouldn't trigger the cooperation part.   Stephen G. Breyer  The only reason I bring it up is if this is a very close case.  That tends to cut somewhat against you; namely, that the thing applies full-force in terms of its purposes to people who travel after, but it only applies as sort of this weak thing to people who travel before.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Have you been able to find -- when in doubt about the purpose, let's turn to the language.  Is it the case that you found any other statute, any other statute, where Congress phrased a jurisdictional hook in the present tense?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you find anywhere where they're both phrased in present tense and it was pretty clear that Congress intended to catch activity that was -- at least where the jurisdictional part took place before the statute took effect?  You find that good an analogy anywhere?   INTERRUPTING ",08-1301

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Nothing in the agency that I can find says that the agency really wanted a mix of options.  I mean, they said it's up to the manufacturer.  But in Geier which I think all of this could be just avoided.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the agency would simply say, do they want to have this to be a maximum or just the minimum.  It's so easy to say that, but I haven't found agencies saying it.  I don't know why.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We are forced to deal with the situation we have; and the situation we have in Geier is filled with indications that they really wanted a mix because of the unusual circumstances present there.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You have to point to something here that shows that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It also said -- it did say as a practical thing, not -- not some theoretical legal thing.  Who is most likely to know what 40,000 pages of agency record actually mean and say?  People in the agency.  And the second most likely is the SG's office, because they will have to go tell them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So if the government continuously says, this is what the agency means and the agency is telling them, yes, this is what it means, the chances are they will come to a better, correct conclusion than I will with my law clerks--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --because I have a lot to do.  All right.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's the practical.  I'm sorry, but that is the practical idea that I think underlies what was said in Geier.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, but it did -- we are dealing with 1989 primarily.   Stephen G. Breyer  And in 1989, I think -- we are at least quoted on the other side -- what the agency said was, well, we see these lap and shoulder belts are actually more effective.  Now, we are reluctant to recommend them for the center seat or aisle seat because people might get caught in the spools.  On the other hand, manufacturers may be able to work out that problem.  Therefore, we encourage the manufacturer to try to figure out a way around it.  And the SG, looking at all that stuff, says, you see, they didn't mind if manufacturers were put under another legal obligation to do it, because they'd have no objection to making the manufacturers do it, they are just not certain yet.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now that's -- that's how I read what was said.   Stephen G. Breyer  They wrote:  ""Of course, in those cases where manufacturers are able to design and install lap/shoulder belts at seating positions adjacent to aisleways without interfering with the aisleway's purpose of allowing access to more rearward seating positions, NHTSA encourages the manufacturers to do so. ""  It doesn't sound like they are against a tort suit that would require you to do so, because, in principle at least, all of those things should be taken into account.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Those arguments are what I think Justice Sotomayor was saying: It is a huge problem for manufacturers.  It's called tort suits in different places and different juries and different States.  But that is beyond the scope of this case.  If the agency wants to displace those tort suits often, all they have to do is say that the purpose is something like you are saying and that they are intended to be displaced.   Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't have to.  That's why I am only making this comment, rather than in the form of this question that maybe I don't understand why they don't.  It would make our job simpler.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is there a way for the lawyer -- a lawyer sees that his client has a good case against the government, and thinks he can get an EAGA fee, so he says to the client: I'd like to represent you and I can get paid for this.  But the client says: There are a lot of debts I owe the government.  Now, is there any way they can work it out so he can get the representation?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, the lawyer and the agency and the client sit down, and the lawyer says: Here, I can get some money for this client and that will help everybody, but I want to be paid.  So I want you, Agency, to agree that on the repayment schedule if I get an EAGA fee, then I get to keep it and I don't have to give it to my client, who will have to give it to the government.  And then they can sign a piece of paper and then that's done and the lawyer gets to keep the money.   Stephen G. Breyer  And has that ever happened?   Stephen G. Breyer  But it could now.  Now people would know about, and they could do it.   INTERRUPTING ",08-1322
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  On the first one, imagine that the -- a trust owes some money to the government.  Now, suppose a lawyer representing the trust recovers.  Now, they recover on a separate debt, okay?  Separate debt?  One.  That money goes to the trust.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The trust first owes -- the trust owes $1,000 to the government.  The trust then independently recovers $500 from the government on a different matter.   Stephen G. Breyer  The government couldn't offset that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Of course it could.   Stephen G. Breyer  But the trust is not a person entitled to the benefit of the payment.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The beneficiaries of the trust are entitled to the benefit of the payment.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's not entitled to the benefit of the $500.  The trust holds money for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust.  So--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --it can't -- you agree that that couldn't be?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, and once you agree that that couldn't be, I think you are in trouble on your first argument.  I'm not sure.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, similarly, the -- the guy -- the client here receives the benefit of the money that he has just gotten from the government, including the attorney's fees.  It happens that he can't keep those attorney's fees, just as the trust can't keep the $500.  He has to give the attorney's fees to the lawyer, just as the trust eventually has to give the $500 to the beneficiary.  So I'm simply saying -- drawing a parallel, which -- go on to the next issue.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, how is it different?  Look.  This, what I was talking about, has nothing to do With EAJA.   Stephen G. Breyer  It has to do with when the government's allowed to offset some money.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it's allowed to offset some money when the money is money that it would otherwise give to a payee.  All right?   Stephen G. Breyer  And then you've defined ""payee"" as a person who has some beneficial interest in that money.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I think that the client here has no more and no less beneficial interest whether he's a person or whether he's a trust.  That was my point.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't understand your earlier point.   Stephen G. Breyer  Imagine that if Joe Smith is in a lot of financial trouble.   Stephen G. Breyer  His house is being foreclosed on--   Stephen G. Breyer  --all his bank accounts are attached.  Then he gets some money from the government and -- including an EAJA fee.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it's $5,000 of money and 1,000 for the fee.  They put it in his bank account.  It was attached, good-bye, nobody sees the money, because it's whoever attached it got the money.  Is that possible?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm making this up.  I'm not talking about the government.  I'm saying the government paid him 5,000 plus 1,000 in an EAJA fee, and the bank got all the money because it had attached his bank account.  Is that possible?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm making it up.  No.  It has nothing to do with -- I'm just making up--   Stephen G. Breyer  --a hypothetical.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right?   Stephen G. Breyer  You follow that.  Those are the facts.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So a year later, Joe Smith is doing much better.  Couldn't the attorney now sue him for the $1,000, say I'd like it?  It went to the bank because they had attached the bank account.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, suppose it happened to be that that 6,000, 5 for the one and 1 for the other, came from Social Security.  Then how does that make a difference?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It couldn't take 1,000?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Couldn't take any of it.  Because of?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that in here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

But what's your argument -- apparently from what I've read in this case, the Second Circuit uses a standard of plain error that nobody else uses.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And it says that all the other circuits say: This is our set of standards, and we've set them forth.  And the Second Circuit says: No, it's -- you have to have a new trial if there's any possibility, no matter how unlikely.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, nobody else uses that.  It seems contrary to our cases, and is there any justification for their using it?   Stephen G.

Breyer  What's your response to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So why don't you make the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --The very magnitude of the error would argue for -- you'd win on any test.  I mean, why does that say you have to use a special test that is specially designed to find when there is hardly any error?  Here there's such a bigger error, according -- that you think that you would have won under any test.  So that -- so why -- why do you do have to have this special favorable test?  That's -- that's the question that I'm thinking of.  I'm not thinking of whether you are right or whether you are wrong on the -- how much evidence there was and how awful it was.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true.  And also no person should be convicted with a confession that was coerced.  And no person should be convicted with evidence given under torture.  And no person should be convicted with evidence unlawfully seized by the police.  Now, for all those latter things, every court apparently uses the normal standard.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Doesn't this say the opposite?  It says we are -- you have to let anybody in -- anybody -- regardless of their status or beliefs.

Breyer  That's what you say, but that's not what the policy says.  The policy says that you have to let everybody in, regardless of their status or belief.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you cannot discriminate on the basis of status or belief.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --you have to -- you have to let these organizations discriminate on the basis of belief.  And they say: No, we don't want to; that's too complicated for us to figure out which ones we should, which ones we shouldn't.  We'd rather let them work off-campus.  We just don't want to get into this business.  It's not just against religion.  It might be against a Turkish-speaking society that thinks Turkish is extremely important to speak or a chess club that thinks the same.  It could be a lot of people.  Now, why do you -- what's wrong with us, a First Amendment -- an organization itself affected with First Amendment interests, saying we just don't want to have those on campus organizations, too much trouble.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's their way of doing that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Let me make an imaginary example, and that's--   Stephen G. Breyer  --If -- if a homosexual person said, I want to belong to this club, and I believe in its principles, I don't believe in sexual relationships before marriage, and that's why I want to work for homosexual marriage, which I do, so my consistency there, is that person -- I am consistent in what I work for, what I believe, and on -- as far as premarital sex is concerned, it's totally 100 percent with your organization that you are representing; would they admit that person or not?

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What we have is a rule, a stipulation.  And as I read it, to try to make sense out of it, it does seem to discriminate against organizations in respect to which intellectual purity would be important.  They're going to have a harder time.  The ones that don't care that much will have an easier time.  Now, in trying to judge the constitutionality of that, I first have no idea which these organizations are.  We've got one of them, but there may be a lot of others.  I don't know if the Democratic Club is or is not.  I don't know how big the tent they want.  I don't know whether the Turkish Society even exists.  I don't know how the chess club feels about players of tiddlywinks.  [Laughter]  So I have an absolute void in this record, which in turn I think would be important to fill that void, because their justification--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --is they don't want to get into this, it's too complicated, and we're not doing that much harm to them because they can meet off-campus, and it's a big, disruptive influence, all of these things.  And then sneaking in here is this anti-gay bias issue, and -- and they want to say: That isn't much, because that isn't really the point here, and that's what we think, anyway.  It's just an example of something.  So with that great unclarity, asked to decide a constitutional issue where I feel I'd need more facts and I don't have them--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Hastings, let's say, or Berkeley has four or five or six different religious chapels for services on Sunday or Saturday, and they say we're open to all branches of religion, orthodox Jews, conservative, and reformed.  And then the orthodox say we want men and women to sit separately.  Now, can Hastings say or Berkeley, no, we'll let the reform come, we'll let the conservatives come, but not the -- not the orthodox Jews.  They can't have their service.  Would -- would that be constitutional?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but what is your opinion?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So if, in fact, the -- the--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

I mean, I -- what I have fear of, to put it out for you, is that jury selection can go on a very long time.   Stephen G. Breyer  And judges have to -- have to run their trials.  And if we tell the judges that they have got to do more, that will become exaggerated, and they'll administer it in a way that will make it hard to select juries.  That's the harm I'm worried about.  So I'm asking you, how would you sketch a line that prevents that harm?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't ask you -- I just asked you to do your best.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

The second half, which I'm really worried about, is that we get into the business of running the trial court's trials.  So I want to know what it is that the trial court at that stage, in your opinion, other than transfer, has to do?   Stephen G. Breyer  What happens if -- I gather -- that a -- that a trial judge has a panel in front of him and people say, yes, I think he is guilty?  And -- and the trial judge says, now, if you listen to the presumption, can you be fair?  You look him in the eye, and if he says, yes, I can put this aside, trial judges do accept those jurors.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  There's no problem?  I went through the 200 pages, and I counted -- this is only my own subjective recounting of it, but I counted six of whom only one lasted, but I counted five others that they had to use peremptories on that include one juror, 29, who herself was a victim of this offense to the tune of $50,000 or $60,000.  The judge said: I will not challenge her for cause.  I counted another, juror -- what's this one -- juror number -- number's 74, who when he looked her square in the eye and said, ""Can you be fair""?  She said,  ""I can't say yes for sure. ""  ""No. ""  Okay?  So, in my own subjective account, there were five here, maybe six, certainly three, that perhaps if they'd had an appeal on peremptories, which apparently they don't, they might have said these should have been challenged for cause.  So I'm concerned about the 5 hours, about the lack of excusal for cause, about the very, very brief questions that he provided to people who had said on the questionnaire they could be -- they could be biased.  They said we think he's guilty, for example.  And all those are cause for concern.  At the same time, I'm worried about controlling too much a trial judge.  I've expressed those concerns.  I know this is a special case.  Half, almost, of the jury questionnaires they just threw out.  And the community -- you know all the arguments there.  You see what's worrying me.  And I'm worried about a fair trial in this instance and to say -- and I'm genuinely worried, and -- and I'd like to hear your response to the kind of thing I'm bringing up.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'd never heard of an instance where a trial judge would not challenge for cause -- but I'm not saying it doesn't happen -- where the juror herself is a victim of the offense to the tune of $50,000 to $60,000.  See, we are getting into an area that I'm not familiar with, but I think that that's not supposed to be.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, but it's not just one.  There were like five, of which I have given you the worst, and they had to use up all their peremptories.  And they can't appeal this.  And it's that taken together, plus the one who sat, juror 11, provides, as they point out for the reasons they say, some cause for concern.  And that's what I'm trying to get at.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Go ahead with it, but they didn't challenge 63 for cause, so I guess they waived it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Let's try juror number -- let's try 76: Judge:  ""Here's the detail that really concerns me. ""  ""You said, 'I think they're all guilty. ""  ""'. ""  ""Right"".  ""Now, there's nothing wrong with thinking that, if that's what you really think. ""  ""You just need to tell us that. ""  ""Okay"".  ""That's what you think, isn't it? ""  ""It's been a long time since I answered that questionnaire. ""  ""Right. ""  ""Now, as you-- ""  Okay?  Now, that's -- that, as far as I could tell, is as close as I can get to a recantation of what she thought originally.   Stephen G. Breyer  You can -- well, you focus on what you just put together.  You said intent to deceive, intent to violate the law.  I believe in another case, you're saying they don't have to have an intent to violate the law because there was no State law that prohibited whatever was at issue.  So is the government now saying -- which is a big difference -- that you cannot convict somebody unless they know, i.e., they intend to violate a law that forbids the conduct in which they are engaging, other than this honest services law, or are you not saying that?

You know, fill 12 -- fill a hundred with 12 in each.  And when we tried to do that, just for the interest of it, I -- I found that you would expect, with these numbers, something like a third to a half of juries would have at least one black person on it.  Now, that may be wrong, because I am not a mathematician, but -- but putting that together, it looks as if there is a pretty big disparity.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  On the other hand, that isn't what they testified to, so I guess you're going to tell me just ignore it and forget it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you know, maybe it's the only way to do it, that the statistician stays with these urns, which I guess they have computer programs for.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I don't know, in other words, and maybe I should just -- I hate to write something, like, saying 2 and 2 is 6.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  You can skip it, if you want.  If there's any comment, fine.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know.  The one thing I learned from the urn business is it never turns out the way you think.  [Laughter]  For example, it had the example of, like, the eight: There are eight out of a hundred, and you run this thing a thousand times, and you'll discover that there is one black juror on about half the juries, or a third, anyway.  That's much more than I would have thought intuitively.  And I might not have even read the example correctly.  So you see why I -- I'm at sea, as soon as you tell me to be a statistician.  I even got a book called Statistician for Lawyers.  That didn't help me very much.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So, is there anybody who said whether -- if all -- they all take their jurors first, the districts, and Grand Rapids uses a higher percentage of jurors.  So now there -- and they have more of the black jurors, so that there are fewer left over--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That could be.  Now, is there any -- in this record, does anybody say whether that's okay or not?  I mean, to -- to have people serve jury duty near where they live or nearer where they live, on its face, is not so bad.  Did -- did anybody say whether this is good or bad?   Stephen G. Breyer  Are you--   ",08-1402
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Now, why is it -- I'm just not clear in my mind.  Why is this siphoning bad?  My impression, which may be wrong, is you -- you have a thousand people in the room, let's say, and if you let the district courts choose first, people will serve nearer where they live.  Now -- and so most of them would rather serve nearer where they live.  And the result of that could be, for the reasons that were stated, that then there are fewer minorities on the more general jurors that draw from a wider area, and I don't know about the merits of that.  I mean, I see a negative, and I see a positive.  So is it -- it doesn't seem to me obviously bad, nor is it obviously good.  So what should I do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but -- but that's just the explanation of the problem that we're seeing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The problem we're seeing is that if Grand Rapids has a higher juror utilization rate and they have a higher minority population, then you will end up with the leftover juries having a lower minority population.  Now, the explanation for that is that you choose the district judges -- you choose the district jurors first.  My question to you is: I -- if you're just a -- I'm not instructed in this area.  If you were just to tell me, what do I think of that, I would say I'm not sure.  I think you have fewer minorities, that's true, but people get to serve closer to home.  Now -- now, can you enlighten me a little bit about this?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I wouldn't say that, but I still haven't -- I will try again.  Forget the cases.  As I'm hearing this, all I'm hearing is: Well, if you let the -- if you say that the wider area should choose first, you will get a higher number of minorities, but very tiny number; I mean a very small addition, one or two people.  And if you do it the way they're doing it, you'll lose those one or two people, but you will let people serve closer to home.  So I just think -- as a person, not as a judge -- that's why I am letting you answer it as a judge -- but I mean, I'd say, well, it doesn't sound like much of a big deal.  And -- and I do see an advantage in this, of the way they are doing it, so, now, you tell me what's -- what's wrong with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  So what if--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  So is--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What about the -- the more I listen, the more I think you think there are a lot of things people could do.  They could send three letters; they could explain in the letters why it's important to come; they could try reversing the thing a little bit with the districts first or not first -- all kinds of things.  But what -- but now you're forcing them into this legal rubric.  So what about a decision, which you wouldn't like, probably, but it would say we can't say that they're unreasonable in respect to not having all of these, but there -- who knows?  You know, when they get around and others try them, et cetera.  In other words, unreasonable/reasonable is one standard, and ambiguity plays a -- a role here, too, that might be helpful.   ",08-1402
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What do you say about -- I think I read in one of these briefs that what I think is the most relevant similar statute, RFRA, has been held not to encompass the same word -- not to encompass the monetary relief, and also there was some legislative history where people testified and told Congress at the time that the word ""appropriate"" won't encompass monetary relief.  Am I remembering that correctly?   Sarah Harrington  Well, I would give you the same answer I just gave, which is that we are not pointing so much to the use of the -- using the phrase ""appropriate relief"" in the statute as we are to the Spending Clause context.  And this Court has held that when there is these conditions placed on Federal funds, the recipient of the funds understands when it takes the money that when it intentionally violates the conditions to which it has agreed it will be subject to suit for money damages.   ",08-1438
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I was looking at the cases the best I can at the moment.  I think you might say that there are a lot of cases which interpret the word ""appropriate relief"" to include monetary relief.  And then there is some that don't.  And to get a rule out of them, you would have to say, well, they are looking to context.  And in context it sometimes is clear, sometimes occasionally not.  But here, isn't this and maybe this was asked, but I want your answer.  The context here, the words appropriate relief, govern both the prison situation and the land use situation, don't they?  You are given an action when the government through a general land use regulation infringes somebody's right to build, for example.  Now, wouldn't that kind of interference with the use of property quite often and normally require some kind of monetary compensation?  This isn't just the odd thing in a prison, where it's talking about it might be called building a religious building or building some kind of parking, all kinds of things that have monetary compensation.  Do you see my question?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know, but isn't it the same word that governs both?   Stephen G. Breyer  If it's the same word that governs both and if land cases very often involve claims for money, I would think that would cut against you.  But that's why I ask.  I want to get your response.   Stephen G. Breyer  But there are loads of cases that have nothing more than appropriate relief and in those cases context makes it clear.  The only one really I thought strongly -- your strongest case seems to me to be RFRA.   Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, so often, what I'm thinking of, a church wands to build, and they can't because of a land restriction.  And it turns out that that land restriction violates this statute.  And in the meantime they have had to rent buildings, they have had to maybe build somewhere else and they have had to do all kinds of things that cost money.  And that's why I would think in that context money would be a natural thing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  To fulfill appropriateness.   Stephen G. Breyer  Let me ask -- get this information from you.  As I understand it, there are some cases that find the words ""appropriate relief"" in a statute to include damages and there's some that don't.  Let's look at the ones that don't.  There is some where it's pretty hard to do it because it's in a heading called ""injunction"", and that's obvious.  But there are only two statutes, really, where the courts have ever held in significant numbers that the word ""appropriate relief"" does not include money damages.  One is the IDEA, the Disabilities Act, and the other is RFRA.  Is there anything else that you've come across?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but are there any others?  I mean, I just want to get down on a piece of paper what I have to look at.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So you don't have any others, I'm judging from your hesitation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What?   ",08-1438
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why wouldn't you, if necessary, simply say that a video game that appeals to the prurient, shameful, or morbid interests of those 18 -- or under, but let's take 18 -- and it's not suitable in the community for those 18, and it has no redeeming importance of any kind, no serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for those 18, that at least as to those, you can't sell it without -- the parent can buy it but the child can't buy it.  So you can't sell to a 12-year-old something that would be horrible for an 18-year-old.  Is that -- would you be willing to accept that if necessary to make this okay on its face?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, on the principle, I mean, it's been quite some years, hasn't it, before this -- since this Court has held that one instance that courts -- that the country, legislatures, can regulate are fighting words?  And we regulate fighting words, don't we?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because they provoke violence.  And the American Psychological Association and the American Pediatric Association have said that certain kinds of video games here create violence when children are exposed.  There are 80 people who think to the contrary, there are two huge things of metastudies that think that -- not to the contrary.  All right.  So what are we supposed to do?   INTERRUPTING ",08-1448
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Talking about common sense, why isn't it common sense to say that if a parent wants his 13-year-old child to have a game where the child is going to sit there and imagine he is a torturer and impose gratuitous, painful, excruciating, torturing violence upon small children and women and do this for an hour or so, and there is no social or redeeming value, it's not artistic, it's not literary, et cetera, why isn't it common sense to say a State has the right to say, parent, if you want that for your 13-year-old, you go buy it yourself, which I think is what they are saying.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It does, it does.  What it has is -- and I have looked at the studies, perhaps not as thoroughly as you.  But it seemed to me that Dr. Ferguson and Dr. Anderson are in a disagreement.  They aren't in that much of a disagreement actually, but they have looked in depth at a whole lot of video games, not movies they are talking about or other things; they are talking about video games.  And both groups come to the conclusion that there is some tendency to increase violence.  And the American Psychiatric -- Psychological Association, the American Pediatric Association, sign on to a long list on I think it is the Anderson side that this does hurt children.  I have to admit that if I'm supposed to be a sociological expert, I can't choose between them.  If I can say could a legislature have enough evidence to think there is harm, the answer is yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  They need additional help because many parents are not home when their children come home from school.  Many parents have jobs, we hope.  And when their children are there, they do what they want.  And all this says is that if you want that gratuitous torture of, let's say babies, to make it as bad as possible, what you do, parent, is you go buy it; don't let him buy it on his own, and he's 13 years old.  Now, what's the common sense or what's the science of that?   Stephen G. Breyer  You are away from the common sense.  If you are going back to the common sense of it, what common sense is there in having a state of the law that a State can forbid and says to the parent that the child, the 13-year-old, cannot go in and buy a picture of a naked woman, but the 13-year-old child can go in and buy one of these video games as I have described?  I have tried to take as bad a one as I could think of, gratuitous torture of children.  Okay.  Now, you can't buy a naked woman, but you can go and buy that, you say to the 13-year-old.  Now, what sense is there to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You mean love is not something that people have tried to encourage children to understand and know about?  I mean, what's the difference between sex and violence?  Both, if anything--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Thank you.  I understand that.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  It's not susceptible.  Throughout you have been arguing your point, which is fair.  You have some experts who favor you and you make that point very strongly, and your point's a pretty good one and a serious one, that it's very hard to draw this line under traditional First Amendment standards.  But I would like you to deal with their point for a moment.  And I take it their point is: There is no new First Amendment thing here.  There is a category -- call them X -- which really are involving things like torturing children, et cetera.  Maybe you don't like to sell them to anybody.  You have an X or some special thing.  But they exist, and they fit within a Miller-type definition.  They are much worse than the simple girlie magazine that was involved there, and they will use traditional First Amendment tests.  That is to say, there is speech at issue, that speech is being limited, it is being done for a good reason, compelling interest -- namely, this problem with the X videos and the torture and living it through -- and there is no less restrictive alternative that isn't also significantly less effective.  See, I want you to deal with that directly, because what you have been doing for the most part is saying we would have to be in some new, total new area, et cetera.  But their argument is you don't have to be in some totally new area, et cetera; apply traditional First Amendment standards and we win.  That's their argument and I would like to hear what you have to say about that, specifically.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  This is not an exception.  It is the traditional strict scrutiny First Amendment test.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let's -- to get you to focus on it, I'll say I've made the argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Your answer -- your answer to the first question of Justice Alito and the Chief Justice was yes, isn't that -- that you are saying that there is nothing they can do?  So now, am I right about that or am I not right?   Stephen G. Breyer  I am right.  Okay.  All I wanted was an answer to that.   ",08-1448
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You should -- you should have a very direct answer to this question.  Were you finished, because I don't want to interrupt that train of thought?   Stephen G. Breyer  Can you -- can you -- if you are right, it seems to me you should have a very clear, concise answer to the question that I'm just going to ask you.  And this is the question: Imagine that there was no delegation, none.  Now we have five members; is that right?  One of them dies.  So there is a vacancy.  Now, can the remaining four exercise the board's power?   Stephen G. Breyer  Clearly.  Okay.  So what is the difference between the situation I just described and this situation where the Board simply delegated its power to three people and one of them dies?  What's the difference?  I can't find any difference in the language.  So what is the difference?   Stephen G. Breyer  Correct.   Stephen G. Breyer  Except that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to the first sentence, which says  ""The board is authorized to delegate to any group of three all of the powers which it may itself exercise. ""  So, what's the difference?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I know that, but I'm asking why does that make a difference?   Stephen G. Breyer  Except.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then what is the reason -- I now see.  Your answer to my question is that the--  vacancy clause applies to the full board but not to the group.   Stephen G. Breyer  --Okay.  Now, got that answer.  And now I see how you could read the statute that way.  So, now I would like -- and that would be in your favor.   Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and, therefore, I would like to know, since you could also read it the other way, why should it be read your way?  I mean, I can think of a lot of reasons why not.  One is something that Justice Scalia was raising: It may work havoc as to what remains effective, what doesn't, what about the board staff decisions, which are, which aren't.  I can see a lot of reasons for not doing it.  But what are your best reasons for reading that vacancy clause the way you want me to read it?   Stephen G. Breyer  So I would have thought, but this is only me -- other people don't necessarily go in for this kind of argument.  But in thinking of the -- the -- the arguments in your favor, the one that sort of resonated a bit with me was that this is a very Republican Congress in 1947 that passed Taft-Hartley, and one of the things they were really aiming at was to move the board from three to five.  And this is a way so that that just doesn't happen.  But I assume from the briefs filed that there is no supporting legislative history for that, what I've just said, so I better wipe it out of my mind.  [Laughter]   ",08-1457
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  To read -- you can read the language the way you want, that -- because of the vacancy clause.  You see, there is a sentence there that says  ""A vacancy shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise the power. ""  That implies in the absence of that clause, five to four, they couldn't.  Okay?  Now, you say that clause applies to the remaining members, i.e., to the three.  And now we don't have three.  And since we don't have three, there are -- and you have to have three.  Because they're not -- there's not -- there are not the remaining members, you see.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  As long as there was another member, you could -- you could do it.  But without that remaining member, you can't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any other legal -- this is what -- one thing, if I were thinking without the language for a moment, and I -- the Taft-Hartley Congress did, I think, want to limit the powers in a number of ways of the board, maybe expand the membership to be sure there would be both parties in larger numbers.  If you could limit this to adjudications, you would say, well, then they can't set major policy with just two members.  But I don't see a way to do that, particularly since the board has often set rules in adjudication which have broad application.  So am I right in thinking that we have to decide either, it is okay for two members to set the most major policies, or we have to say they can't even conduct adjudication, even the simplest adjudication, even the least significant?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  But that is a rule.  They set a rule in the adjudication--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --And is it -- is it correct numerically that, in fact, under identical language except the word 1935 to 1947, there were two-member panels and they decided about 400 cases, and then they took the same language, and now since 1947, roughly, what are the figures?  How many cases?  Has it only been this instance where it has been two members or have there been other instances?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that when the 400 cases that you are talking about were?   Stephen G. Breyer  And 1947.  And how many cases were decided by two members about, I'm not asking for -- during the times you are talking about before the present two-member boards?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you need the ""except that"" once you have language.  You need it because now you have a bigger board and it says there is a three-member quorum.   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought they -- they simply are taking the earlier phrase, the earlier statutory phrase, and they are changing those words because grammatically you now need it?   ",08-1457
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what are the instances in which somebody who is not a signatory might seem to have a right to enforce it?  I can think of one.  Suppose he's a third-party beneficiary of the contract.  Are there others?   Stephen G. Breyer  What?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, which one applies here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Estoppel?  I don't understand estoppel.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know what estoppel is in the law.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know, but I haven't unfortunately had a chance to read all the practice treatises.  So, could you explain to me quite simply what is the theory of equitable estoppel that allows someone who is not a signatory to an arbitration contract to have it enforced?   Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, whenever I sign a contract with anybody -- I sign one with Smith, I ask him to buy some wheat, I sell him some wheat, and there's an arbitration clause.  And now I sue all kinds of other people, and the contract is part of the lawsuit.  Are there many cases like that?  Maybe it was a shipper, or something, who they sent the contract to, and he had to figure out what to do on the basis of the contract.  Or maybe there was a cousin who told me to go to see Smith in the first place.  Maybe -- I don't know.  There are a lot of people.  So, now all those people have to go to arbitration?  Because you're saying whenever I go in and have a contract with X and there's an arbitration clause, then in any future lawsuit where I sue anybody and that contract is an essential part of it, the breach thereof, he could put me in arbitration.  Boy, that sounds extreme.  I mean, I guess there are -- there'd have to be several treatises on this, but it doesn't sound intuitively sensible.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, okay.  That's all I wanted to know, was what's the theory in this case.   Stephen G. Breyer  If that's the theory, I -- unless I think it always applies, I could just say I don't have to decide about a third-party beneficiary.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I just have to decide whether you can enforce it.  Now -- so you'd better say some other things.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  I wouldn't have asked my question if you hadn't said we have to go beyond the question whether they had jurisdiction and answer the merits, which is whether you can in fact enforce it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now you're saying, no, we don't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I could just rely on my third-party beneficiary example?   ",08-146X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I thought the first issue -- I never got past the first issue.   Stephen G. Breyer  And the first issue was, does he have a right to appeal?  And I read the statute, and to me section 16 says yes.  He asked for a stay.  It was denied, and it says an appeal may be taken from an order refusing a stay.  So there's an order refusing a stay; he appealed.  Why can't he appeal?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any -- is there any other example in the law -- I can't think of one -- where you say this party has so silly an argument, which is really what you're saying--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that we don't even let him appeal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It seems to me I've gotten a lot of appeals where the appeal, I don't think, is too meritorious, but nonetheless I never heard of saying you can't appeal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  As to that, if you did that, I got your first point.  I understand it.  I agree with it.  As to the second point, you say -- I was surprised because I hadn't quite taken that in -- that we are now supposed to reach what we would call the merits of the appeal.  Now, there you just heard your co-counsel say: Look, you don't have to decide whether my equitable theory is good or not.  You haven't read these treatises, I have; which is a fair comment.   Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and all I want you to say is that sometimes, at least, a third party could enforce a contract to arbitration that two others make.  The statute doesn't say he can't.  The statute doesn't say he has to be the one who signed it.  And if you think of a third-party beneficiary or an assignment, for example, you would think, of course, there are other people, say an assignee, who could enforce it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Your proper -- I see.  This is actually a pretty difficult question to me, and -- because it seems to me sometimes they have to be able to enforce it, the assignee, the third-party beneficiary.   Stephen G. Breyer  And now what I don't know, is -- what they're doing -- it's true that section 3 and all the other sections, they talk about the agreement, but they don't say that the individual who is asking for the stay has to be the same person who signed it, as they couldn't.  So how do we know which among all the possible people in the case who hasn't signed it should and should not be able to enforce it?  Their argument is look to State law, okay?  And your argument is derive some principles yourself.  Really.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so, so -- is it possible to answer this case by saying he's wrong in thinking you always look to State law.  It may depend on what the State law says.  So that's the answer to the question.  You should have had your appeal.  Go appeal, and let the courts below work that out first, knowing that the State law is relevant but not always determinative.  Then we'll get some -- we'll get some case law on this and we'll be in a better position to figure out what the right answer is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you see it's a little hard.  I can imagine a case where they're sitting in the room drawing up the contract, they put it in the arbitration agreement.  There are four other people directly related to the room.  The parties look around and say, hey, we have arbitration here, I hope everybody understands everybody is going to have to do this.  And they all say, okay, don't worry about it.  Now, I'd say, hey, maybe they're estopped.  And there they're going right through the contract.   Stephen G. Breyer  So I hate to write the words ""equitable estoppel is never relevant"".  I would rather write the words  ""I'm uncertain State law is relevant policy. ""  You know, it's not true that it's always relevant.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What would you think about saying that some parties -- some parties to the case who are not parties to the contract can as third parties, nonetheless, enforce arbitration?  We have listed a few examples, assignees, et cetera.  When considering whether this is one of them, judge, the key question -- we can tell you what the key question is and what it isn't.  What it is has to do with the intent of the persons who did sign the contract.   Stephen G. Breyer  Something related to that.  We don't have to be specific.   Stephen G. Breyer  What it isn't is a case management device.  Because what I think the temptation would be for the judge is to -- is to -- let's send them all off to arbitration if we can, and then I would not have to worry about this case for a while.  And they'll come back, and they'll figure it out.   Stephen G. Breyer  So is that -- is that right, or is it wrong?  What's your insight or guess on that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm just looking for ways of separating these sheep from goats.   ",08-146X

Breyer  --No, I'm not talking about the waiver.  I'm saying, imagine that it's clear that a person hasn't waived his right.  Now let's suppose he says,  ""I do not waive my right. ""  Okay?  Now, is it clear law that once he says  the police cannot continue to question him?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that clear law, yes or no?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, yes.  If that's clear law, would you say that at some point before the 2 hours and 15 minutes expires where they're continuously asking him questions and he says nothing, that it has become clear that he has not waived his right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  For the question is not this.  The question is whether, after 2 hours and 15 minutes of silence, it is clear -- it's nothing about Supreme Court law.  Supreme Court law is clear: You cannot question him after he makes clear he hasn't waived his right.  So then the question becomes, is it reasonable for a State court to say -- after 2 hours and 15 minutes of asking questions and he says nothing, is it reasonable to hold that he has not -- conclude that he has not waived his rights?  Is that the question?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What would you do with Miranda's statement  ""But a valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused. ""  --I grant you, as modified in Butler to say that the State has a heavy burden of showing that the silence followed by a confession -- the State has a heavy burden of showing that that is an affirmative waiver.  Now, those I think are the two statements of law, the third being that after, if there is no waiver, the police cannot continue to question.  Now, I thought that was the clear law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I grant you, you might argue for a change in the law.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why do you say it would change the police's behavior?  Inbau and Reid and, you know, the -- the NAC -- the Defense Lawyers' brief here is filled with quotations from typical police manuals, and they all seem to say things like you have to have at -- once the waiver is given, the police may proceed with interrogation.  That seems to be what police today are instructed across the country.  It says you cannot question people until he indicates after the warning is given a willingness to answer questions.  That's the police manual.  So why do you say this would extract a price on law enforcement when the typical police manuals seem to say what the Petitioner here is saying?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean the Respondent.   Stephen G. Breyer  Which -- which are the police manuals that go your way?  Because I want to look at those, too.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I don't think that was the question.  The question, at least as I understood it, is that Miranda says you cannot admit a confession into evidence unless he has first waived it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then it says, clearly, that even if the police and the prosecution testify he did waive it, even if they say he did, explicitly, still, if there's a long questioning, even then, the court should be very careful about admitting it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And doesn't it flow from that a fortiori that if he doesn't admit it and all there is, is the long questioning that, there has been no waiver?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He answered three questions.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  One, do you believe in God?  Yes.  Two, do you pray to God?  Three, have you asked God for forgiveness for shooting the boy?  Okay.  So, where -- where did he waive it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, in this case, after 2 hours and 15 minutes when he gave the answers I just said, when did he waive his Miranda rights?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I think any then -- then Miranda is--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --It says you can't admit the stuff after a long questioning unless he waives.  Obviously, he says something or there would be nothing to admit.   INTERRUPTING ",08-1470
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, Miranda does not say that.  I mean, I think -- I think that Justice Scalia is right on that, that Miranda doesn't say you can't question him.  The pages that you read to us say that if you have a lengthy questioning, then the fact that he then gives a statement cannot be taken as a -- cannot be admitted.  That's -- that's what it seems to say on page 476--   Stephen G. Breyer  --in the absence of some special circumstance.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Am I right?  I mean Miranda does not explicitly say that you cannot continue questioning.  Am I right about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm asking because I don't know.  I didn't see it in the--   INTERRUPTING ",08-1470

Hypothetical one, your clients, let's say, or some other people, know that what the Kurds' hypothetical plan is, is to pretend they're a political advocacy organization, but to go around shooting the people who don't agree with them.  Okay?  Case one, the hypothetical defendant knows it.  In case two, he doesn't know it, but it's true.   INTERRUPTING ",08-1498
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, wait.  They want to apply.  They want to do--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --They say in this case that they want to provide training in the issue of humanitarian international law, and they want to provide training and expert advice and assistance in respect to how you petition the UN.  Now focusing on those two things, and going back to Justice Sotomayor's question, why -- what is the government's interest in the following?  Under O'Brien or any other test, you look at it and say, does teaching have a First Amendment interest -- training?  Yes.  And what about teaching about advocacy?  That's what they are doing, teaching about a certain kind of advocacy.  Therefore there is a First Amendment interest implicated, seriously.  Now, when that is seriously implicated, there is also a government interest, on the other side, in not having terrorism.  But there is a less restrictive alternative which they suggest, that in that situation, what they're entitled to read this statute as saying is that, if they believe and a person reasonably would believe that their teaching, assistance, training, would not significantly aid this organization in its unlawful ends, then they are not guilty.  Now, what is the government's interest in not accepting that interpretation?  The First Amendment is hurt; there is an interest; but there is what they describe as -- and what I have narrowed -- a less restrictive way of going about it.  And they have to be reasonable in what they think.  Now, what's the objection to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm sorry.  I'm not talking about tsunami aid.  I am talking about the instance where the teaching is itself teaching about how to do something, and that something is the kind of thing that the First Amendment protects.   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine, and if a reasonable person would know that, that it's going to help them, then it is unlawful, if it's going to help them and a reasonable person would think it was going to help them in their unlawful activities.  But we're not--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, but petitioning the United Nations -- and that's what you are teaching them -- does not, on its face, seem to me to be something that reasonably you would think was going to aid them in their unlawful objectives, but for the realm of ideas.  Now--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and then Congress put a thing in here which says: Don't construe this statute in a way that will abridge First Amendment rights.  So it's aware of the problem of First Amendment rights.   Stephen G. Breyer  And is there any evidence that something like that would, in fact, but for the realm of ideas, help this organization commit its terrorist acts?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, in that -- on the -- just forget the harmonica for a second; I'm more worried about the lawyer.  You're saying that a -- a group abroad which may have some American citizens in it -- let's assume they do -- want to hire a lawyer.  And this lawyer is supposed to file some amicus briefs and do other activities.  You're saying Congress has forbidden that in this statute, and that's constitutional?   Stephen G. Breyer  But I want to know if that's what you're saying, what I just said: that an organization has American citizens, engages in terrible stuff, but they are not entitled under the Constitution to have a lawyer in the United States who does legal work like filing amicus briefs.   ",08-1498
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  How does that work?  I think that would be useful for either you or Mr. Clement, if you've thought this through.  Is this right different from others?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There are two ways.  One is that -- look at -- all you have to do is look at the briefs.  Look at the statistics.  You know, one side says a million people killed by guns.  Chicago says that their -- their gun law has saved hundreds, including -- and they have statistics -- including lots of women in domestic cases.  And the other side disputes it.  This is a highly statistical matter.  Without incorporation, it's decided by State legislatures; with, it's decided by Federal judges.  Now, think of this, too: That when you have the First Amendment, or some of the other amendments, there's always a big area where it's free speech versus a whole lot of things, but not often free speech versus life.  When it's free speech versus life, we very often decide in favor of life.  Here every case will be on one side guns, on the other side human life.  Statistics, balancing life versus guns.  How are Federal judges in your opinion, rather than legislatures in the States in a Federal system -- how are Federal judges supposed to carry this out?  I want to see where we're going.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Heller, I didn't think, explained that with great -- I was dissenting, though.  I didn't think it explained it with total clarity, but that's a dissenter's view.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let me be specific, suppose Chicago says, look, by banning handguns not in the hills, not hunting, nothing like that, nothing outside the city -- in the city, we save several hundred human lives every year.  And the other side says, we don't think it is several hundred, and, moreover, that doesn't matter.  How do you decide the case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're saying they can have -- no matter what, that the City just can't have guns even if they're saving hundreds of lives -- they can't ban them.   ",08-1521
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But there is a difference.   Stephen G. Breyer  There is a difference here with the other amendments.  There is a difference, and the other amendments -- you have the First Amendment's, the First Amendment expression.  Here we have right in the amendment written a militia-related clause.  And the way that -- the way -- the way that the right might be incorporated in respect to that is light years different from the way it might be interpreted if you think what it is, is the right to have a gun to shoot a burglar.  They're just two separate things.  And as to the first, it's pretty hard for me to see why you'd incorporate it, for reasons I won't go into.  As to the second, I understand it.  So we're starting with a difference in purposes at the least.  And shouldn't that make a difference in how you incorporate?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because the -- one of the reasons--   Stephen G. Breyer  --at least, is that -- you've read, I'm sure, that all the law professors at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, London, et cetera, that say even Blackstone in the 17th century thought that this is primarily a right to raise an army through Parliament to -- well, I can't go on here.  I'm just saying think of that brief, and you'll see the differences, even accepting Heller.   Stephen G. Breyer  So do we read the -- the clause at the beginning -- the militia clause -- we're supposed to read the words of the Constitution, aren't we?  I guess--   Stephen G. Breyer  --the answer to that's yes.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.  Very well, and doesn't that suggest what the purpose of putting the right there is even under Heller or at least one purpose--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --And does that not give us a clue as to what they thought that--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --the ordered liberty was?  That's your point?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, suppose it is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Suppose it is.  Assume for argument's sake that it is.  Still, I take from what you are saying that -- let's make up an imaginary importance of ordered liberty chart, and we give it to James Madison and the other framers.  And he would say, insofar as that right to bear arms is important for the purpose of maintaining the militia, it's high on the ordered liberty chart.  Insofar as the right to bear arms is there to shoot burglars, it's low on the ordered liberty chart.  And if that's what they'd say, it's conceivable that part of this amendment would go through and be incorporated; namely, that part which would prevent a law that would disarm people to the extent they couldn't form militias.  But that part which would disarm people to the extent that they couldn't shoot burglars, that would not be incorporated.   Stephen G. Breyer  Step one -- step one is make my chart.  Step two is look at what's high.  Step three is, even though that high part, even that high part, nobody could think was incorporated.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He did, actually.  He did.  That's how he went about it.   ",08-1521
1,NO QUESTIONS,08-1529
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't understand your Westfall Act argument.  I must be missing something.  My understanding is, many years ago, Congress passes a statute and says: Give absolute immunity from Bivens actions.  Sue the government; don't sue the employee.  It says that, basically.  A long time ago.  Then, sometime after, Congress passes another statute, and in paragraph (a) of that statute, it says: An even larger group of people, just sue the government.  And then it says: As to this larger group of people, paragraph (1) of this statute doesn't apply to Bivens actions.  So, what does that got to do with this earlier statute?  Doesn't it refer to it.  I don't -- in other words, I understand your Carlson argument.  I got that one, but I don't understand this argument if I have the statutes right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, is there an answer to the question?  Because that would be important.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's your Carlson argument.  I got that one.   Stephen G. Breyer  I understand that one.  The one I don't understand is what's the relation of the Westfall Act to this argument?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, right.  They give the government employees the same kind of immunity that -- a little more limited, and that's in paragraph (1).  And then paragraph (2) says: Paragraph (1) doesn't apply to Bivens actions.  It doesn't say anything about the earlier statute.  It applies to a different group of people.  It has all kinds of requirements, nothing involved with 233.  Okay.  So, what is it to do with this case?  Now, what I'm thinking now from your hesitation is it has nothing to do with the case; it's the Carlson thing that is the important thing.  Now, you tell me why I'm wrong.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're talking about the Westfall Act.  Absolutely right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I just say, what does the Act have to do with this older Act?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Westfall -- Westfall Act is not -- is not the FTCA, is it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, it is the -- in other words, you think -- I thought the FTCA Act is an Act that gives you action against the government.   Stephen G. Breyer  So it says: This Act is the exclusive remedy -- the FTCA is an exclusive remedy for all employees, but this provision which gives us an exception does not give you the exception, does not make it exclusive for Bivens actions.  Okay.  You go ahead.  You explain it to me.  I don't want to keep repeating my skepticism, I want to listen.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I think his point is it doesn't matter whether they did or didn't consider it; the question is the statute was decided by Justice Brennan as an example of a statute where Congress did explicitly say whatever it thought that this particular remedy was a remedy exclusive, an exclusive remedy, and that satisfied the second requirement of Carlson.  That was Justice Ginsburg's first question.  And -- and there -- that's, I think, the problem for you in this case.   ",08-1529
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is this the language?  The -- if it helps with Justice Scalia's question, the language says  ""a rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the STB shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it receives. ""   Stephen G. Breyer  And so that's what it has to do.  It's a bill of lading for property it receives.  And you are saying ""receives"" means receives from the shipper.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It does not mean receives from another carrier.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is -- is there a way to -- are you finished?   Stephen G. Breyer  We don't even get into this problem if -- unless the ship line is a rail carrier?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it says  ""A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the STB shall issue a receipt or a bill of lading. ""  That's what leads us into the problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  But mid-carriage -- it only talks about -- they use that word ""received"".  That's why I thought possibly it didn't because it says--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That's a separate argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  Did the Ninth Circuit pass on that argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  Did the Ninth Circuit pass on that argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  It did not.   Stephen G. Breyer  So that's not right in front of us?   Stephen G. Breyer  It's quite different.   ",08-1553
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Then under that view, I guess that -- that any intermodal transport, China, all the goods coming from China, which tend to move under a single bill of lading, as soon as they get to the United States and go on a train for 50 miles a new bill of lading must issue?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right, so you're saying they don't have to issue--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Fine.  If they don't have to issue a separate receipt, what we are talking about is a bill of lading that was issued by the ship.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, if that's correct and if the ship -- the only one that has to do that, it says, is a rail carrier, and a rail carrier is a person providing common carrier rail transport.  And then that's defined to include intermodal equipment used by or in connection with a railroad.  And my understanding, which I'm asking you for correction -- is that the argument here is the ship is providing intermodal equipment used by or in connection with a railroad.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it's the words  ""used by or in connection with. ""  that I am focusing on, because to apply those words here seems to me to bring every international shipment in the world, no matter how small the American portion by rail and no matter how big the foreign part of this transport, it brings it all within Carmack.  And it means that the bill of ladings issued by people throughout the world are all going to have to apply to meet the terms of the Carmack Amendment, which had the purpose of railroads in the United States, and that's going to be a nightmare.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, first, is it true what I said?  And second, if it is true why isn't it way contrary to purpose and a nightmare?   Stephen G. Breyer  So why don't they have to issue a bill of lading?  That's what they say.  So every company, the Finnish company, Chinese, every company, every shipowner, even if you've never have been to the United States -- sad for him, but nonetheless -- if every one of those is going to have to issue a bill of lading, whatever, meeting whatever requirements are there, and we know at least one requirement you think applies.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Your point was--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --if it creates such difficulty, why were the railroads in favor of it before?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Anything here that says on land?  Anything in Carmack that says on land?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, if it's in a ferry boat?  Remember, we have a very broad definition of ""rail"" where ""rail"" includes all things that have nothing to do with rail.  So now we have got that broad definition, and I would have thought we through what has to be in the receipt and then we get to the -- that section and where it's exempt, because they got -- want to get rid of it; then you have to put in -- you have to put in a certain kind of waiver, which is very hard to achieve.  And that -- that's my understanding of it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but they can't get rid of the thing you like.   Stephen G. Breyer  And--   Stephen G. Breyer  --How do they do it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There are two things here I don't understand.  I'm just trying to get clear.  In the first part, 706(a), it talks about -- in the definition of ""rail carrier"".  102-6, I guess -- it says railroad includes -- railroad transport will include intermodal connect -- intermodal equipment transport used in connection with a railroad.  What is intermodal equipment?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So now, if we read it literally, to go back to my -- I'm trying to produce the worst example that frightens me the most.  There is three miles of railroad transport in the United States, but it carries the chassis, or it carries that big box, which has come all over the world, from all over the world.  And if we read this with no limitation, this definition makes ships that carried it from other places, railroads, and once that's railroad transportation, we are into Carmack.  And now, if STB exempts it, what happens is the provision comes into play that says you can't exempt an exempt carrier, in effect, from the liability provision.  And it means the ships that had to issue the bill of lading now have to allow the kinds of suits -- now, here is the point I'm not certain about -- I would think against them, not just against a railroad carrier, and perhaps against them for anything that happens, even on the ocean, and not just the railroad carrier for something that happens within the United States.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, explain to me: What is it that gets us out of that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, where does it say that?  Because I better read that one.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Where?  Do you know -- do you know offhand where it says that, just so I can--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Good.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's COGSA.  That's not Carmack.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what gets us out of Carmack?   Stephen G. Breyer  Then why are we suing -- why are we suing -- why does the ship being sued here?   Stephen G. Breyer  Can we go back one more second?  Can you just give me the citation in Carmack -- not COGSA, but Carmack -- that would get our intermodal shipment out of the board's jurisdiction?  Because what I'm thinking about is the intermodal shipment and the boat sinks near Hawaii.  Okay?  Now, on your reading of Carmack, not COGSA, what gets that shipment sunk in Hawaii -- or Midway or Guam or someplace -- what gets them out of Carmack?  Which words?   Stephen G. Breyer  And it includes transport just as you defined it between the United States and another place -- United States and a place in a foreign country.   Stephen G. Breyer  So that's what this is.  This is a shipment between Shanghai and San Francisco.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, sorry, between a place in -- oh, transportation in the United States.   Stephen G. Breyer  Between a place in.

In 1950, this department is bought by the Dior clothing company.  Now, it's a private entity, and someone would like to sue the department because they didn't pay the bill.  It is now a private entity.  They are suing them for what happened years ago when they were part of the state.  Is it sovereign immunity, this statute that blocks the suit, or some other principle?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The statute would block the suit.  There's precedent with -- you know, famous precedent with King Farouk, which says the opposite.  It says: You were king, you are not king now; therefore, there may be a different principle, but we can sue you now.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And you're saying if a state disappears, it no longer exists, so you couldn't possibly be interfering.  You couldn't possibly be interfering in the workings of the state--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Breyer  --even though there is no present interference?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

At that point, the State Department comes in and says: You can't maintain this suit because of the act of state doctrine for the very reason you've said.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's my question: Do you need the act of state doctrine or does this statute cover it which removes the discretion from the Executive Branch to decide on a case-by-case basis?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why can't you say that if the person, the individual you are suing, is a member of the foreign state, is engaged in the kind of activity that you're complaining about, is subject to the orders of the foreign state, and the relief would affect the foreign state, you are suing the foreign state?  But where he was a member of the foreign state, and you want money from him, even though what he did in the past was an act of a foreign state, this lawsuit is not affecting him in his capacity -- is not affecting the foreign state.  Indeed, there isn't even one.  So in the first set, he falls in the FSIA.  In the second set, he doesn't.  And you happen to have the second set, and, therefore, he may still be immune for what he did in the past, but that would be a different docket.   Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what is your--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Right.  The question I think, as I understand it, which is certainly why it's bothering me, is: Don't think of this case.  Think of the set of cases where it's clear that the plaintiff is suing an active state.  He's suing France or he's suing England or -- he's suing an active state for an official act.  And the judge says: I have read the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act; dismissed.  Judge, let me amend this.  And all he does is he fills in the names of the individuals, because there were some individuals who did the act.  Now, does he suddenly fall outside the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act just because he listed the names of the people who did it, and everything else was the same?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then, this Act does nothing whatsoever.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it doesn't protect--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --the state, because all I did there is I made my complaint the same, relief was the same, everything was the same.  I happened to go to the Internet to find out who were the human beings working for the state who did the thing I'm complaining did.  And all I did was fill their names in, in the complaint.  And I cannot imagine any complaint that isn't open to that, because a -- a state can only act through an individual.   Stephen G. Breyer  So wait--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --you're saying this Act is only good as against a bad lawyer?  Because any good lawyer would simply fill in the right names.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There is never a case where this Act would give immunity if the plaintiff has a good lawyer.  Is that what you're saying?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh.  Oh, that's a different answer--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Fine.  If you're going to give that answer--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --which I thought was what you would give--   Stephen G. Breyer  --then I have added my question: Sometimes the individual, in the first set of cases that Justice Ginsburg mentioned, does count as the state.  Sometimes the individual does not count as the state.  And the trouble I'm having, in this case, is to work out the principle of when that individual would fall within the FSIA -- as you now, via Justice Ginsburg, have conceded, sometimes it does -- and when it doesn't.  And I've tried to work with the idea of relief, or maybe the nature of the cause of action, or maybe the time that the suit is brought, such as a time afterwards.  I'm not an expert.  You're more of an expert than I.  What are the principles that determine when?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then that -- I mean, I'm sort of there.  You may agree with this, that if you have an individual and with what's being charged here is he is, in fact, now acting as Secretary of Defense, and this action is an action he took in his official capacity, that's it.  Forget it.  This Act covers it.  But where you're claiming it's not and he's not now a member, the reason for the Act disappears, and you go back to the act of state doctrine.   Stephen G. Breyer  But all you have to do is write a different word in.  Now, that's the question that's--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and then Ms. Millett sort of backed off that.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that -- and if -- what I'm seeing here is two extreme positions.  You're saying: Never, no matter what, can you simply write the name ""Joe Smith"" under the word ""Niger"".  Okay?  Can't do it.  Even though every act -- no matter what, you write that human name in, and you -- this statute doesn't apply.  To me, that means it never applies.  All right?  The opposite would be that never, under any circumstances, can you sue an individual for a -- for a -- for an official act.  That seems the opposite.  I should think sometimes you certainly could.  Maybe after he has left the government.  But I'm looking for the principle, if I'm right, that would divide the two.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You want to stick to your extreme position?  Never, just write the thing in--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, do you want to stick to that position, that all the plaintiff--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --has to do is rewrite the name?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's an excellent reason.  Can you give me one single example ever of a complaint that would ever be dismissed under this statute--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --if -- if my lawyer is clever enough to look up who the individuals were and substitute their names?   ",08-1555
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is this to do -- I mean, the obvious question, to me, is -- since I wrote the -- I think I wrote the opinion in Castillo -- is we looked at the language of the statute, very similar to this, and we said: Machinegun means a separate crime.  And they recodified it.  And it looks to me as if all they did was take the things that we previously said were separate crimes and put them in (B), and take the things that are obviously sentencing factors and put them in (A) and (C).  All right.  Now, that's what it looks like if you just read the statute.  I didn't find anything in the history that suggested any other intent.  So why do you think that that change makes the difference?   Stephen G. Breyer  To make your life a little more complicated and difficult, though perhaps it makes it easier, we reach the questions that Justice Scalia was raising, I think, and they are important only if you win, only if we say that it is a sentencing factor.  If it is a new crime, we don't have any problem, because if it's a new crime, the jury has to find the fact.  But if it's a sentencing factor, then we get into the problem of Harris versus Apprendi.  And then you have to decide whether it's maximum, minimum, et cetera.  But in Harris, I said that I thought Apprendi does cover mandatory minimums, but I don't accept Apprendi.  Well, at some point I guess I have to accept Apprendi, because it's the law and has been for some time.  So if and in fact, unfortunately for everyone, I was -- it was 5-4 in that, I think, so my vote mattered, and I don't know what other people think but in -- on this Court.  But if that becomes an issue, if that should become an issue about whether mandatory minimums are treated like the maximums for Apprendi purposes, should we reset the case for argument?  Or do you feel, in your opinion that -- that you've had enough of an argument because you devoted two or three pages to this topic?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I think basically Apprendi did significantly change McMillan, but that's--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Does the government believe that it has sufficiently argued this, or would you suggest on the government's behalf that if it becomes an issue it's set for reargument?  That was really my question.   INTERRUPTING ",08-1569
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  No, their -- their -- their basic argument is look at the statute.  (A) has what is undoubtedly a set of sentencing factors.  Brandishing and discharging are as traditional as they come.  Then look at (C), and you find some other ones that are sentencing factors, because recidivism is as traditional as it comes.  And between those two they put (B).  So since the neighbors, (A) and (C), are certainly sentencing, they must have meant (B) to be a sentencing factor, too.  I -- as I understand it, that is one of their basic arguments.   INTERRUPTING ",08-1569

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why are you going through all this sort of parsing?  I mean, I'm looking at the legislative history as well as the statute in 1970.  What is your answer to the last point that they made, that what Congress wanted to do was to make simple possession a misdemeanor?  That's why they changed the word, which -- ""offense"" to ""felony"".  That's why they changed the word ""felony"" to ""misdemeanor"".  And I can't imagine why else they amended the statute, and just because I was curious, I looked it up, and that's why they amended it, right?  So -- so I mean, the legislative history makes that clear.  So what you've done is figure out a way -- the government's figured out a way to do the opposite of what they want, to take people who simply possess and transform it into a felony.  Now, what justification is there in the law for doing that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  As to the first, I said ""subset"".  I didn't say you undermined the entire statute.  I said you took a subset of people who simply possessed, and that subset you transformed into felons.  Now, your response I guess is just what you said.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And what's the second?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there another example in the law, anywhere in the law, where -- and there may be, I'm asking -- which you've come across, where we have an illegal business and there is a customer; and all the customer does is be a customer; and is there an example where just because he's a customer in a statutory provision that normally has a lesser penalty -- all right; imagine those circumstances -- you still can punish him as if he -- as if he ran the business?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not aware, and why should this be the first?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's the way they're a customer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The way they're a customer is they use the telephone, and I guess one side thinks that's not a big deal, and the other side thinks that, anyway, in terms of what Congress thought, it's a tremendously big deal because Congress was really worried about telephones.  Okay, that's possible.  So can you get a parallel that's like that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What one comes to mind?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's the jurisdictional hook.  What I'm looking for is there's a business and a customer, the statute punishes the business worse than the customer.  Now, we get the customer as if he were a business participant.  That's what I'm looking for, where it's the way he does it -- i.e., whether he uses a telephone or whether he uses a telegram or semaphore signals or -- where the -- where the means of communication here or something like that suddenly transform him?  Anything else that comes to mind?  I didn't expect there to be, but I just thought maybe you'd think of an analogy, which would be helpful.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what about the legislative history?  Because I would read it -- and in fact what it seems to me that you're suggesting, when you read the statute, is using a telephone is -- because Justice Kennedy came up with a good example of what I was thinking of.  If the buyer sits there with a gun, well, that's different, he shouldn't have the gun, and it's not surprising that he gets a higher sentence.  And you're saying by reading the text you've discovered Congress thinks that cell phones are sort of like guns.  Okay.  I grant you somebody might have thought that.  Justice Souter thinks it's not intuitively obvious, but is there any legislative history that suggests that that indeed is what people in Congress thought when they passed this statute?  I'll read it if there is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And what should I read?  Where -- what exactly--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Normally, where that is involved, I've learned, it's called what Justice Scalia called it ""a jurisdictional hook"".  They don't think the underlying behavior is worse, but they believe there has to be a basis and should be a basis for Federal prosecution.  I started out where he was.  I thought this is just a jurisdictional hook, but now you say no, it isn't; it's much worse than that.  It's like carrying a gun, not quite as bad as that, but on that -- in that direction.  So I'm asking you what would I read in this history to show that what you're claiming is right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's what -- you've cited that in the brief so I can find it?   ",08-192X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You have answered Justice Souter.  I took your answer to be the following: That if the corporation had paid -- paid for a program and the program was 90 minutes which said vote for Smith, vote for Smith over and over -- that's the program -- that you concede that the government could ban this under the Act.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't think they would.  We agree.  It's an imaginary hypothetical.  But, in fact, if they did have 90 minutes of vote for Smith or vote against Jones, you concede for purposes of this argument that the government can ban it.  Is that right or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, okay.  So one of your arguments is this is a special corporation --  You can't.  Now suppose it's General Motors.  Can they?   Stephen G. Breyer  Mr. Olson, I'd just like to get -- I want to get an answer to the question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now then, my question that I'm driving towards is: Since General Motors can in your view be forbidden to have our film of 90 minutes vote for Smith, vote for Smith, vote for Smith, or vote against Jones, vote against Jones, vote against Jones, how is this film, which I saw -- it is not a musical comedy.  What ----  [Laughter]  What -- how does this film vary from my example, and why does the variance make a difference?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I want to get the answer to what I was asking.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, that isn't -- that isn't the suggestion.  The suggestion I was going to, or trying to get to, is we know you can't just say vote against Smith, vote against Smith, vote against Smith.  Now, I wanted to know the difference between that and a film that picks out bad things that people did -- no good ones, just bad ones the candidate did.  And then we have another film that picks out just good things candidates do.  And so candidates run films that show the good things they do, and then someone else shows the bad things they do.  Now, why is that not the same as vote against Smith?  Though I grant you, it's more intelligent.  It's more informative.  It's even better electioneering.  So we're after electioneering.  Why doesn't that fall within the forbidden category?   Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I guess it's the same as if you were to say, you know, I think Smith is a great guy.  That's all.  I'm sharing information.  And what I don't see is if you agree that we could ban the commercial that says, I see Smith is a great guy, why is it any different to supplement that with the five best things that Smith ever did?   Stephen G. Breyer  I wonder if that's -- I mean, I take it the answer to the question, can the government ban labor unions from saying we love this person, the corporations, we love them, the environmentalists saying we love them, is of course the government can't ban that.  The only question is, who's paying for it.  And they can make a determination of how much money the payors can pay, but you can't ban it.   Malcolm L. Stewart  That's correct, and they--   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If that's correct, then I take it the interesting question here would be -- I don't know if it arises in this case.  Suppose there were a kind of campaign literature or -- or advocacy that either a corporation had to pay for it, it couldn't pay for it through the PAC because for some reason -- I don't know -- the PAC -- and there's no other way of getting it to the public.  That would raise a constitutional question, wouldn't it?   Malcolm L. Stewart  --It would raise a constitutional--   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that present in this case?   Malcolm L. Stewart  --It's not present in the case.  I don't think it would raise a difficult constitutional question because presumably if the reason the corporation couldn't do it through the PAC -- the only reason I could think of is that it couldn't find PAC-eligible donors who were willing to contribute for this speech.  And if that's the case, the corporation would -- could still be forbidden to use its general treasury.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know about that.  But I guess I would be worried if in fact there was some material that couldn't get through to the public.  I would be very worried.  But I don't think I have to worry about that in this case, do I?   Malcolm L. Stewart  That's correct, both because the question isn't presented here and because Congress--   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I agree with you about that, but I thought what saves this -- many people thought it doesn't save it, it's -- the whole thing's unconstitutional, the whole Act.  That isn't what I thought.  So what saves this is of course you can't prohibit all those things.  What you do is put limitations on the payment for them, see that there are other ways of paying for it, say, through PACs, and then limit very carefully the media that are affected and the times for which they are affected.  Now, that's the statute before us, and it's that you have to address.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the individual contribution also covers people who would like to give $2500 instead of $2400, which is the limit.  And maybe there are 100 million or 200 million people in the United States who, if they gave 2500 rather than 2400, nobody could say that that was really an effort to buy the Senator or the Congressman.  So is that unconstitutional, too?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So here the obvious argument is: Look, they said the compelling interest is that people think that representatives are being bought, okay?  That's to put it in a caricature, but you understand what I'm driving at, okay?  That's what they said in Buckley v. Valeo.  So Congress now says precisely that interest leads us to want to limit the expenditures that corporations can make on electioneering communication in the last 30 days of a primary, over-the-air television, but not on radio, not on books, not on pamphlets, not on anything else.  All right?  So in what respect is there not conceptually at least a compelling interest and narrow tailoring?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's important--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, of course, it did -- was a basis for prohibiting speech by, in the sense of giving contributions above $2,400, by 300 million people in the United States.  But the point, which I think is the one that Justice Kennedy was picking up, is are we arguing here between you and my questions, is the argument in this case about the existence of a compelling interest?  Because Congress seemed to think that there was certainly that; it's this concern about the perception that people are, say, buying candidates.  Are we arguing about narrow tailoring?  Congress thought it was narrow tailoring.  Or are we arguing about whether we should second-guess Congress on whether there is enough of a compelling interest and the tailoring is narrow enough?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If that is so -- this is a point that is concerning me.  I don't know the answer precisely.  But suppose you are right.  Suppose we overrule these two cases.  Would that leave the country in a situation where corporations and trade unions can spend as much as they want in the last 30 days on television ads, et cetera, of this kind, but political parties couldn't, because political parties can only spend hard money on this kind of expenditure?  And therefore, the group that is charged with the responsibility of building a platform that will appeal to a majority of Americans is limited, but the groups that have particular interests, like corporations or trade unions, can spend as much as they want?  Am I right about the consequence?  If I am right, what do we do about it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not -- I'm not -- I am saying am I right in thinking that if you win, the political party can't spend this money, it's limited to hard money contributions, but corporations and trade unions can spend unlimited funds?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not suggesting that.  I am suggesting we will make a hash of this statute, and if we are going to make a hash of this statute, what do we do about it?  And that's why I want you to take a position on another important part of that statute, and that is the part that says political parties themselves cannot make these expenditures that we are talking about except out of hard money.   Stephen G. Breyer  Actually I read that sentence that you just read as meaning the corporation's an artificial person in respect to which the State creates many abilities and capacities, and the State is free also to create some disabilities and capacities.  Not a statement about balancing rich and poor.   ",08-205X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if we -- if we go -- if we go that route, what we're  doing is creating an accounting industry, aren't we?  Corporations give huge amounts of money to the C-4 organization, and then somebody, perhaps the FEC, has to decide whether in fact that is a way of subverting the prohibition against the direct payment for the communication, right?  Okay, so Congress said, we don't want that.  Congress said, that's going to be a nightmare, and we decide Wellstone, for whatever reasons.  Now don't we have to focus on whether Congress can say that or whether it can't?   Stephen G. Breyer  And I don't know why it cannot say it.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is -- I -- I remember spending quite a few days one summer reading through 1,000 pages of opinion in the D.C. Circuit.  And I came away with the distinct impression that Congress has built an enormous record of support for this bill in the evidence.  And my recollection is, but it is now a couple of years old, that there was a lot of information in that which suggested that many millions of voters think, at the least, that large corporate and union expenditures or contributions in favor of a candidate lead the benefited political figure to decide quite specifically in favor of the -- of the contributing or expending organization, the corporation or the union.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, it was on the basis of that, I think, that this Court upheld the law in BCRA.  But we have heard from the other side there isn't much of a record on this.  So, if you could save me some time here, perhaps you could point me, if I'm right, to those thousand pages of opinion and tens of thousands of underlying bits of evidence where there might be support for that proposition?   Stephen G. Breyer  BCRA has changed all that.   ",08-205X

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is it the case that we can't find a single pre-Jones Act case where punitives were awarded and what was sought was maintenance and cure?  I -- I found some, but they seem ambiguous to me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is your best?   Stephen G. Breyer  So we have a history all the way back to Catherine of Aragon, and what we've been able to find in these pre-Jones Act cases is really two or three, or maybe -- I found ten actually, that I couldn't say--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Leaning over in your direction, I could take maybe three or four.  And they show a little ambiguity.  But give them all ten, and that's still ten out of hundreds of years of history.   Stephen G. Breyer  With attorneys' fees there is a compensatory aspect.  The -- the basic obligation is to keep this seaman alive and well, and then you give him some wages if necessary, and, you know, you give him medical care.  And -- and now he's going to be out that attorneys' fees as a result of his sickness.  So I understand that.  Punitives does not compensate him for anything.  It is a policy matter for the State.  He's a beneficiary of a windfall.  And it seems a more radical step to make something up out of whole cloth here with punitives than it does with attorneys' fees.   Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe it would be a good thing.   Stephen G. Breyer  But the -- the problem here is it has pros and cons.

And -- and then I found they seem to stand for a little bit less than I had the impression they stood for.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

I mean, I asked my clerk to go get some figures out of the record and she says in 2008 in the sixth grade, just to take an example, 77 percent of the English learners in Nogales failed the tests as compared to 32 percent statewide.  In the tenth grade 84 percent failed the reading exam compared with 34 percent statewide.  In 2008 the reading exam fourth graders, 67 percent failed in Nogales, the English learners, compared to 30 percent statewide.  Now, I'm sure that progress has been made, but it doesn't seem to me, looking at that kind of thing -- and the record is filled with that kind of thing -- that that -- that you could say that the objectives are achieved.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, isn't the point of this to teach the children to learn English?   Stephen G. Breyer  He doesn't actually have the right to ask me questions.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Let's take the one you mentioned.  Let's take the one you mention.  The one you mentioned, I take it the student academic achievement in mathematics, which is something called the AYP guidelines test, they are for high school, which you mentioned.  It has -- I think it's 2008, maybe it's 2007 -- we have limited English proficient students, this is passing their test, 22.4 percent of the English learners are at students scoring at or above proficient.  The overall rate is 68 percent.  So it seems like about a third.  Now, if you look at the reading language arts, the average is 73.5.  Limited English proficient is 15.4.  And that's quite a difference, 75 percent as to 15.4, in the high schools, on the tests that you have mentioned.  So I just say -- my only point is that we have a couple of findings here; you are right, they have made progress, but they are not quite home yet.  And I would say that, looking at this record, it seems to suggest that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let's do another one.  What they started out in the year 2000 is they said one problem with this State is we don't know what it costs the average -- the increased program.  They haven't done a good study to tell what it costs.  But we think it's somewhere around $1500, maybe it's $1300, maybe it's $1400 per student.  And as of this very moment, the State is providing 3 to $400, leaving it up to the school district to find the rest of the money, which it has to take from other things like English, or -- is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is the one State funding?  Because I looked at your brief, page 22 to 23, and if I understand it correctly it says that the educational expenditures, that is to say monies, increased in this Nogales and USD--   Stephen G. Breyer  --maintenance and operation budget, by 30 percent.  Well, I'm sure they did.  But that's I take it the entire maintenance and operation budget.  The numbers I had -- and I am quite interested to know if they are wrong -- the numbers that I have is that the only survey they've done across the State, or the most recent one, says that the English language instructional costs range between 1570 and $3300 per pupil.  And then if you look at the amount the State provides outside of the reading, writing and arithmetic, which they provide, et cetera, for all students, what they provide is -- currently it's $340, and if that law had gone into effect, 2064, it would have been $450.  Now, are those numbers totally wrong?   Stephen G. Breyer  There is a minor thing that I -- I think -- I'm not sure that Justice Ginsburg said.  I thought that the funding order was not fund the plan you come up with; but rather, come up with a funding plan that bears a rational relationship to -- to the plan you come up with.  So is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And now the district court is at considerable remove.  He says they have not yet come up with a study and a plan that seems satisfactory, and they haven't shown how the funding is rational in relation to the plan that they haven't fully developed, though they've made progress.

So I imagine if that's so, they certainly know about it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, so there is no notice problem.  If there were a notice problem, I guess there would be a due process problem.  So, I don't see what notice has any more to do with this than the NCAA tournament.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, in the original confirmation, there are problems in asbestos cases, like other bankruptcy cases, of giving people notice.  Bankrupt people often give notice to many who aren't there.  And I don't know that -- maybe there's a constitutional problem with some of them, but I would have thought jurisdiction under the statute is clear.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And so what is -- is this about notice?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I didn't think so.  I thought this was about the case of the meaning of the words in the statute that they have authority in the bankruptcy court to issue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the title.  And we've said that the test is whether the outcome of the proceeding -- this is the other State proceeding -- could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.  So, as I understood it, that's the test.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what -- that's what this Court said.  Now, they may be few and far between, an order like this, but where there are special reasons for it -- suppose it's a pension fund, and you want to reorganize the company, and this is the employees' -- they're -- the employees' pension fund is worried about claims which are related directly.  Or suppose it's an officer, or suppose it's a worker, and to reorganize the company you must cut the claims off.  And otherwise, it is down the drain for everyone, no more money in the fund, no more jobs for the employees.  Now, what is it here that would say there is no special circumstance such that a bankruptcy judge can ever do it, no matter what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is what you are saying also true of the various other asbestos cases that have, I think, done this?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, of course, this has enormous practical impact on the debtor.  If not him -- not this one, because it's already a done deal -- you will never get insurance companies--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --to go into this kind of thing if they are going to be sued for the very act of helping the debtor defend the asbestos cases.  And so, I can't imagine an insurance company in its right mind going into that when in fact all these suits are still open.  That presumably is why the bankruptcy judge cut it off.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why does it say -- it doesn't say that.  What it says in the release is it says: We are releasing or everybody is enjoined from bringing a suit for policy claims against Travelers, and a policy claim is any and all claims based upon, arising out of, or relating to any insurance policy.  And then the bankruptcy judge, in thousands of findings, I guess, said that your lawsuits do relate to the relevant insurance policies.  Indeed, the claims are based upon the joint -- the obligation of Travelers to defend those very policies, given the obligation to defend Johns-Manville.  So the relation is exceedingly close, and the language covers it, and there are thousands of pages of findings, I guess, that show that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In your view, if Smith has a $2 billion or $4 billion claim against company X and the pension fund together, company X is in bankruptcy, and so the judge says: I want to enjoin this claim, we will settle it, you know, but the pension fund -- doesn't -- doesn't the bankruptcy judge -- if in fact without the pension fund you couldn't reorganize, wouldn't the bankruptcy judge have authority to cut off the claim against the pension fund?  It's a question of whether the company goes down the drain or whether it doesn't.  And--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --the pension fund was all mixed up in this together.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, there is nothing here in indemnity.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that would be true of all the workforce and they have claims against the individual members of the workforce?  They have -- it seems to me it would be an unusual case, I agree with you on that, but to say never -- to say never is what's bothering me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why not -- because there is a good constitutional protection; it's called the Due Process Clause.  If the bankruptcy judge goes too far, it's a due process violation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, there's language, broad language.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Who stated it?  Who stated that?  I mean, when I -- I read what the judge said at the time.  I've read language of the order, and I haven't found there anything that said that.  What it talked about was policies that were seriously intertwined with the liability of Manville.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is this the confirmation order?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's different.  Okay.  So the confirmation order--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --But there's another piece of paper called ""the insurance settlement order"", which says that the confirmation order and all these other definitions and the injunction just refer to derivative liability?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes or no?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No?  Okay.  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then I don't see what it has to do with it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  That's a different definition than the definition of ""policy claims"" in the injunction, presumably.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  I have a confirmation order and injunction.  It defines ""policy claims"" in both as a lawsuit relating to any or all of the insurance policies.   Stephen G. Breyer  And your other piece of paper says what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You go on.  Don't worry.  I'll look it up.   ",08-295X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The arguments in this case, my initial reading of them, are more balanced than any I can remember, really.  For each one, there is a counterargument and I'm somewhat left up in the air.  So if -- since we have to decide it, it should -- should I take this into account: That if the Respondents are right, you are absolutely correct that there will be a lot of people, perhaps, who get rewards at the Federal Government's expense who shouldn't have them.  No question.  They front-run the government.  They read the report, run in court fast, before it's in the newspaper.  But if you are right, then they are going to have to assign people to look at these obscure administrative reports that didn't even get in the newspaper.  So they want to do that, they don't have people to do it, and they say these people are performing a service of sorts by reading them, the reports, for them and telling them about it.  And there it is, balanced.  But they are the ones who suffer.  You see, they suffer both ways.  They suffer if people don't tell them; they suffer if in fact too many people are getting unjustified rewards because the money comes from the Federal Government, the 10 percent, 25 percent.  So if they're the ones who suffer, should I not pay special attention to their views as to how the balance works out?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  As you can tell, I have taken that point in.   Stephen G. Breyer  So my question wasn't that.  My question was, Should I or should I not give them a little expertise weight on the grounds that they are the ones who know it best, that they are the victims?   Stephen G. Breyer  I just want to get your expertise on this, because you have probably read the legislative history of the 1986 amendment.  All right, am I right in thinking this?  If I go back and read it -- which I will -- I will discover, not once in this entire 1986 history anywhere, House, Senate or conference, does the word State appear in any relevant context?     --No.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not right.  Okay.  So when it appears--     Well, I guess it depends on what you mean by the relevant context.   Stephen G. Breyer  --What I'm -- the relevant context has to do in my mind at the moment primarily in respect to the first clause,  ""criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding. ""  Is there any indication that those were meant to apply -- any indication that those were meant to apply to State as opposed to uniquely Federal, criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings?     No, Your Honor, it is -- it is clear from the legislative--   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  Clear from the record -- clear that--     --That it was Federal proceedings that Congress had in mind.  And -- and if you would take--   Stephen G. Breyer  --And the word hearing--     --If you would look on page 19 of the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --There is one ambiguity whether this clause, the first -- what we call first and second refers to State as well as Federal.  If the debate took place in a context where everyone's just thinking of Federal, it's not surprising they didn't put in the word Federal.  They don't think of everything.  All right.  Now, that's my question.  You started with the House.  The House to me does think just of Federal.  The Senate's ambiguous on that point--     The Senate--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and the conference is yet more ambiguous on that point.  So is there anything -- when I look at the conference and the Senate versions, I'm going to say, gee, they did -- sorry, they did actually think of Federal and State, too, and it's sort of mixed up?  Or am I going to see that that context there is Federal?     --The context is -- is Federal.  References to States in connection with the act that Congress has thought about it are treating States like other private qui tam relators.  They Petitioner referred to the Dean case, and, in fact, that was something that the -- the legislative history refers to, but what was offensive about the decision in the Dean case was that Wisconsin had been the original source of the information, but had been barred because it had provided that information to the government.  And, under the government knowledge bar, they had been precluded, so -- so Wisconsin would have been taken care of under the original source provision, but it doesn't reflect a view that States have a particular distinctive role.  In fact, as this Court's decision in Cook County reflects, municipalities are treated just like any private corporation for purposes of the act.  They can be defendants, they could be plaintiffs, qui tam relators, but there is no reason to construe the statute in a way that would allow a local government, technically, to shield itself from qui tam suits by disclosing the facts that would be the underlying information support of the fraud claim in, perhaps, a report that was intended to -- to whitewash the situation--   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I agree with you about that.  I think it's the silence, though, that might cut against you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the reason that it's -- it's basically silence -- the reason I am thinking that cuts against you is because of this sorting of the context where they are focusing on Federal.  And, if everybody is working in that context, then nothing said about State means they are just assuming it's all applying to Federal.  Now, what I'm looking for, you might be able to put your finger on, is something that shows that my last statement is not right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I think in the -- it was -- it probably came out in governmental affairs in the Senate, which I think had 17 members at the time.   ",08-304X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The question is, what sense does that make?  I mean -- and I thought you said that the category 1, which is the criminal proceeding, civil or administrative proceeding, I thought you said it does not apply to State proceedings in your view.  You said that was the better view.   Stephen G. Breyer  What's the state of the law on that?  I thought it was virtually -- what is the state of the law?   Stephen G. Breyer  I think you'd have to say that.  But -- but now, what is the state of law on that?   Stephen G. Breyer  What are we supposed to do?  I mean, to me it makes no sense.  We are only talking about things that don't get into the newspapers.  So -- and the purpose of the Federal Government's reading of this would be, look, we don't have people to go send around to every -- read every State report.  We just don't have that personnel.  So we rely on these whistleblowers and we know some will be unjustified.  I would think the same thing would be absolutely true of State criminal proceedings that don't get into the newspaper.  There are probably 50 -- several thousands -- thousands and thousands.  So how to read these differently is a problem for me.  And I think that's on your side of it.  But we are back to Justice Scalia's question, which to me is the -- is the question here.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any history, which I pay attention to -- is there any legislative history or anything else that you can point to, to me that's important, showing that that first criminal hearing means just Federal?   Stephen G. Breyer  And they meant criminal hearing.  Criminal hearing meant Federal criminal hearing, not State.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You say ""exactly"".  I was looking for the backup for that.   ",08-304X

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What about more than that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why not -- I mean, suppose -- the part I don't understand in this statute, which may not be relevant -- I would appreciate the help.  It seems to me that (a)(10) large (A) and then (F) have something to do with the parent who never goes to public school, the child just goes to private schools to begin with, and they get something.  If they have -- if they have a disability, this program pays them something, right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's at the very beginning, at the end of addendum page 1.   Stephen G. Breyer  What is that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So in other words--   Stephen G. Breyer  --a parent who has a disabled child who never thinks about the public school system still gets some money, but not as much, for the disabled child?   Stephen G. Breyer  It's money to the school.   Stephen G. Breyer  To the school.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so, it's money that goes to the school for a program?   Stephen G. Breyer  Money that the children can get.  I get it.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, would it then work, what is -- would this system work under the statute?  You say, parents, if you are going to a disabled child, you simply go to a private school, you get the services you just mentioned.  Now, if you put in -- put the child in a public school, and they find a free appropriate public education, fine, that's the end of that, you have to do it.  Now, if they don't give you a decent one, you can, you can send the child to a private school, but it has -- you have to give it a shot to the public school system.  Now, that's what you don't want the interpretation to be?  You don't -- you are against that.  But -- but let's amend it a little.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I am reading the language.  You may require the district to pay for someone who has been enrolled in special services--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --You haven't heard my amendment.   Stephen G. Breyer  My amendment is the norm will be give the public school a shot, but there could be circumstances, you're getting the run-around, there is need to put that child in a public school now.  In other words, special equitable circumstances that make it reasonable for the parent not to give the school a shot, though that's the norm.  And in those unusual circumstances, there would remain grounds for equitable relief.  What about that as an overall interpretation of the statute which has several parts to it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you have to be willing to accept that it's an unusual situation, though it may well exist, that the judge is going to reimburse the parent where that parent didn't give the public school a shot.  They will have to show there is a good reason for not doing that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that all right with you or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you are simply saying that it was reasonable for the parent here.  I'm not asking that question.   INTERRUPTING ",08-305X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  May I ask one other question before you leave this, which is where Justice Kennedy started?  Suppose a State says: In our State, we want to tax all oil and gas property, and here's how we do it.  We assess the value of all oil and gas property, ships and everything else included.  Then we impose a tax of 20 mills per dollar of assessed value, something like that, on all of it.  Now, the State will collect all of it, and we make one exception.  We define which property the State will directly get the money from, and then the city can do the rest, if it wants.  Now, here's what we do with the State money.  We give it to the city.  So if the city wants to, it can put the same tax on that little bit of property left over, which is a subcategory of oil and gas property.  And by the way, the name of that little bit of property left over is called ""a ship"".  Now, is that a tonnage tax, and is that what Alaska has done here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I described to you the entire tax.  We know no more about it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The way it does is just as I said.  And maybe I was -- it was too much for you to take in.  So the point is that it's a tax on oil and gas property.  That's Code section 1.  Code section 2 is defined subcategories -- (a), (b), (c), (d, (e), (f) -- all of that.  Code section 3 says (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e).  The -- the State government collects and remits it to the city.  (G), the city can assess the same tax if it wishes.  It doesn't have to -- and keep the money.  (G) is ships.  And the reason I have asked that question is I read something from -- Alaska Department of Economic and Community Development which suggested to me that that is Alaska's tax.  I might have that wrong.  I just read a sentence or two, and maybe I am wrong that that's Alaska's tax, and--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --But if it's Alaska's tax--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --what's wrong with it?  It's a -- it's a tax on all oil and gas property, and all they do is they let the city collect some of that if they want, and they collect the rest of it and give it to the city.   Stephen G. Breyer  What I'd like to know is: Do you think what I said was a misdescription?  What's worrying me about this aspect of this case is a possible need to send it back to find out what Alaska's tax system is.  Now -- now, if what I just said is a -- is a correct description approximately and if the other side thinks it is, too, then at least I -- I know how to go about deciding it.  And if I don't, I don't know quite what to do.   ",08-310X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's a different argument.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can we just get to--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --That makes matters worse.   Stephen G. Breyer  Let's -- let's suppose I accept just what Justice Ginsburg said, and said that it's a hopeless morass if we look at all taxes.  Let's look at this tax.  This tax you call an ad valorem tax on personal property levied by Valdez, and then on page 11 of your brief you say that's not just on ships; it's also on mobile homes, trailers, recreational vehicles, and various types of personal property defined under State law as oil and gas property, motor vehicles, machinery, supplies and maintenance equipment.  They come back and they say, as to your mobile homes, trailers, and recreational vehicles, all that's happening there is either you have exempted them or they are fixed in place, and they are like real property, and that's what you are doing.  As to the other things, you do not impose a tax on those other things.  Rather, the State imposes a tax on those other things.  And it may be that you help the State do it by providing them with the assessment, and it may be even that you could do it, but you haven't.  And, therefore, the only thing you have imposed this tax on are the ships.  Now, I think I have that argument right.  If I do, what's the answer to it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If I don't, what's the right argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  ""May impose"" doesn't help if you don't do it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The state imposes it or--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --And that happens with all these other properties?  That is, in Valdez, you pay the city -- you pay the city -- for the -- for the taxes on that oil and gas property that isn't shipped?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And you write the check to the city.   Stephen G. Breyer  All the things you listed on page 11--   Stephen G. Breyer  --The -- the oil and gas, motor vehicles, machinery, appliances, supplies, and maintenance equipment.   Stephen G. Breyer  So they write a check to the city.  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  What about a porthole tax?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is a porthole tax in your view okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  A porthole tax.  They charge for portholes.  Anyone who has a porthole who comes into our city pays the tax.  That's not a tonnage tax.   Stephen G. Breyer  So, in your view, a masked tax.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, but the porthole tax applies, by the way, to that ship's captain who has retired, who has built his house with portholes instead of windows.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So there are 2 or 3 percent of the -- I mean, it's only 99.9 percent on ships.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about the -- Grier -- you haven't mentioned that -- Grier in Norris v. City of Boston, where he says the tonnage -- you know what he says; it's on the front page of their brief.  All right.  That seemed to me to say, don't interpret the Tonnage Clause to apply to tonnage.  Interpret it as the same thing as if it's mass, it's mariners, power of the steam engine, number of passengers, the master or owner of the vessel -- all those fall within the Tonnage Clause.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'll ask you that question because I'd like to hear your answer to that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask you this question for a second, please?  And just take 2 minutes to answer it or not.  You don't have to answer it, but it seems to me this is the question.  This whole issue depends on the evidence before Congress.  So, in reading the briefs, I have six categories of evidence.  Compared to the City of Rome, the registration turnout still has two States, Virginia and Texas, with significant disparities.  As to minority officeholders, there is a big improvement, but if you look at Mississippi, Louisiana, and South Carolina and a couple of others, it is still not great.  The DOJ objections: The number of DOJ objections has fallen a lot, but it still exists.  In terms of election observers, which were not mentioned in City of Rome, we have their statistics that two-thirds of the observers are focused on five of the six States that are covered.  In terms of polarized voting, not mentioned in Rome, we still have testimony that the polarization is significant and common in certain places.  And as to successful section 2, section 5 suits, once again not mentioned in the City of Rome, but since 1982 there were at least 105 successful section 5 suits and 653 successful section 2 suits.  All right.  I just summarized that because I'd like to hear in a couple of minutes, or five, or whatever you want to take.  I'm trying to lead you to what I think is the heart of the case.  It seems evidentiary.  That is what I read.  What is your response?   Stephen G. Breyer  Whatever you want.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You should have a chance to answer the same question.  You heard my question, the time question.  What's your estimate?   ",08-322X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So what is the reason in your opinion if you had to summarize it in ray sentence or two, you would say that the reason that Congress didn't go into other States and decide which ones to add to this or go into these States district by district and decide which ones to subtract from this, the reason that Congress didn't modify voting rights statute but simply renewed it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.  I have another question.  How long did it take Congress to compile this 13,000-page record?   Stephen G. Breyer  And how long would it have taken Congress in your opinion to have compiled the record to figure out what's happening in this respect in every State or in these States district by district?   ",08-322X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, he was just talking about probable cause.  How could that be duplicative?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Look, I thought this case, though I grant you I could well be wrong, is not about a final forfeiture hearing where you have to show that it's more probable than not that the car was used for drugs.  But under the Illinois law, just as Justice Alito said, you can seize a car without a warrant.   Stephen G. Breyer  And there are lists of circumstances.  But in the Florida statute that Justice Thomas wrote about, it said that a person whose car it is, is entitled to a hearing, I thought, in a brief time to see if there was probable cause, just as a person arrested.  You have to bring them before a magistrate within a short time to see if there's probable cause.  Now, how do you do that in Chicago?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you're saying the answer to the question is there is no way?  A person who doubts this probable cause has no way.  He has to wait 6 months until there's a forfeiture hearing.  He's out of luck because then it merges with the merits.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  That's your answer.  There is no way.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then I don't see why you win this case.   Stephen G. Breyer  What?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, is there a way or not?  You have pointed to three statutes.  Do they give him any way?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Look--   Stephen G. Breyer  Am I right that what is -- what is the rationale your supporting it for the following: My car was parked on the street.  There happened to be some big drug crime nearby, and the policeman took my car.  In my opinion, there was no probable cause.  I would like my car back.  Now, I take it that in Illinois there is no proceeding, as there was in Florida, so that I can claim there was no probable cause, and I -- none at all.  I never get that determination made; and, moreover, I have to wait, for 6 months possibly, before I get a different determination made, which is whether they had -- more likely than not, whether that's entitled to forfeiture on the merit.  Is that the law?  If anything like it is the law, what's the constitutional justification for it?   William M. Jay  Well, let me begin, Your Honor, by pointing out that it's not the law, because the State's ultimate burden at the hearing is not preponderance of the evidence; it's probable cause.  It's -- it's precisely the same burden that--   Stephen G. Breyer  You mean they can keep my car even if it's more likely than not that it was never involved?   William M. Jay  --When the -- when the State shows probable cause, the burden shifts to the claimant to prove by a preponderance -- so the ultimate burden is by a preponderance.   Stephen G. Breyer  But it's still -- okay, fine.   William M. Jay  But it's--   Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.  That is -- all right.  That's a burden of proof thing at the final thing.  That's not the thrust of my question.  The thrust of my question is: Do I have to wait for up to 6 months before I have any magistrate, any neutral official, pass on my claim there was no probable cause to take my car?   William M. Jay  --And, Justice Breyer, you--   Stephen G. Breyer  And the Florida statute, by the way, doesn't do that.  It says of course you get a hearing on probable cause.   William M. Jay  --The Florida statute--   Stephen G. Breyer  Am I right?   William M. Jay  --The Florida statute -- you are correct -- unique as far as I know among all the statutes legislated by the 50 States that use asset forfeiture or the Federal Government, does provide an adversarial probable cause hearing within the--   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So nobody gives you -- they go around taking cars even without probable cause.  There's no way to do -- it happens in every State.  What's the constitutional justification for making a person wait for 6 months before he gets a neutral judicial official to say whether there was even cause to take his car?   William M. Jay  --The constitutional justification, Justice Breyer, requires that a reviewing court look at each step in the process, and it's not just a matter of 6 months from beginning to end.  That process in Illinois and in many other systems has different steps.  The first step is investigation and notice.  The -- and then the second step is deciding whether to pursue this.  The third step is completely in the hands of the claimant, where the claimant decides whether to pursue a judicial hearing.  And the fourth--   ",08-351X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But if I have a different position, which is I'd like to see if it's practical to decide this case now, two things stand in the way in my mind which I'd like you to address.  The first is your opponents are saying, no, you shouldn't really address this issue now because there are three Illinois statutes which actually give them, anyone who wants it, a right to a hearing at least on probable cause.  And that's a matter of Illinois law.  And although the statutes don't seem to say it, they might.  And the second is that this seems mixed up in my mind -- not necessarily your fault; it may be my mind -- but it seems to me there are two quite separate questions: when you are entitled to a final hearing of whether forfeiture is right or wrong; and whether you are entitled to a preliminary hearing on whether there was probable cause under the statute to obtain the car.  Now, that latter question I think might be impractical in many cases to work out until there's been a trial of an individual who's accused of a crime, which may be much later.  But the former question is where I think you have a point, that there are five instances here in this statute where a policeman could seize a car without a warrant and he has to have probable cause under most of them nonetheless.  So your clients might say: He did not have probable cause; I want a neutral magistrate to contest it.  Now, in my mind that reaches -- that's a different question than the final hearing about who's entitled to the car.  And I also see the three statutes and now I see a case where here in front of me everything is mixed up.  So I think -- perhaps I'm just seeing it that way, but those issues are mixed up confused and not separated out.  So why don't we wait?  What's your answer now?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, can we--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Go ahead.  Finish.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, can I get to the merits for a second?   Stephen G. Breyer  Go back to what Justice Alito and Justice Sotomayor were asking.  This statute gives a policeman the right to seize some property without a warrant if it's a circumstance where you could seize a person without a warrant.  That's basically what it says, doesn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  In that kind of situation, I would think maybe you are entitled to a quick hearing where the only subject would be: Was that language carried out?  Was that policeman right?  Was there probable cause, or wasn't there?  Now, if that's the issue, I don't see why you give up at all on the baseball card.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Would you--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Would you think you should have the burden in the following situation?  At 10:00 o'clock on March 21st the employer says: I'm going to get rid of Smith because he's too old.  All right?  That's it.  Writes out the letter, ""Good-bye, Smith"".  An hour later someone walks into the employer's office and says: I've discovered that Smith was just convicted of larceny.  Now, he already fired Smith because he was too old.  But I take it he can make the defense: Well, Smith would have been fired anyway; that isn't the reason I fired him, but he would have been fired anyway.  And he can get off, but he should make that defense, shouldn't he?   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  So the answer is yes?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So now we have the same situation, but the jury has said this bad reason, his age, was a motivating factor.   Stephen G. Breyer  To me -- no, didn't say played a role.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what it says in this instruction that I have -- I don't see the other one--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, I have on page 7 of -- of the appellant's brief that the instruction was  ""the plaintiff's age was a motivating factor-- ""   Stephen G. Breyer  --""in defendant's decision"".   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, when I read that, I think--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  Okay.  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Perfect, perfect.  I didn't want to complicate it, but that may work in your favor to complicate it, and I want to be fair.  [Laughter]  Fine.  It played a part.  It did have a role: Age motivated in part.  Now, why isn't that the end of the matter?  Because we have a statute that says age shouldn't play a role in.  ""Play a role"" means it made a difference.  I mean, to me.  Otherwise it played no role.  It was an understudy, a ghost.  It ""played a role"" if it would have made a difference.  ""Played a part"", it would have made a difference, just like my first case.  So we have an action, other things being equal, that should be illegal under this statute.  But then, just as in the first case, we give the employer a defense: If you can show that in the absence of that age there in your mind, you would have done it anyway, which means the mix of motives would have been different, then you get off.  So, if in the first case we in fact say it should be on the -- burden should be on the employer, why shouldn't it be in the second case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Will you--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Will you go back?  I'm sorry to be hung up on this point.  Maybe there are 15 cases that just prove I am wrong.  But I'm -- I'm trying to figure out -- let's try other areas of the law.  The dam is a nuisance.  We now show, to prove that it's a nuisance, that it played a role in the death of my fish.  I mean, isn't that the end of the case?  Damages might be at issue -- how much of a role -- but as far as liability is concerned the gears were rusty.  The rusty gears played a role in the derailing of the train.  Again, it might be a question of who is responsible for what, but that there is liability I think in most areas of tort law would be over once you prove that the defendant's factor played a role.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So is the law here -- am I wrong about ordinary tort law?  Possibly.  I don't know it that well.  Is it that I -- is it that this area is special?  Is it that there are cases so you can say any of those three?  I am prepared to be totally wrong.  I hope not.   Stephen G. Breyer  You can say that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I think ""played a role"" combines at least the necessary condition, but I don't know--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --if you have to--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --""Played a role"" -- how did it play a role if it was not a necessary condition?   INTERRUPTING ",08-441X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  How is it supposed to work?  This is what is bothering me at the heart of this case.  I imagine that banks, particularly right in these last few months, are in situations where there are three categories of -- of borrowers.  One might be a category of people whom you are reasonably confident in, and the second is a category of people who are borderline or less so, and there are also minorities.  Now, where you make the decision as a bank to deny them the loan, it sometimes is difficult to say whether that decision was made for a discriminatory reason, namely race, or for a legitimate reason, namely because this was a person unlikely to pay the money back.  Now, how is a bank to function if 50 different attorneys general plus the Federal agencies all look at the books of the bank to look at the individual loan and to make that kind of determination about which quite honestly reasonable people will often differ?  And how -- how is that really a problem, or am I just creating that?  And if it's really a problem, how in your opinion does the Federal law deal with that problem, if not in the way that your opponent suggests?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If I may say so, that response overlooks the question.  I don't doubt the single standard.  What I do doubt is in the -- in the category of uncertain cases, that 51 different individuals, 50 State attorneys general plus one Federal individual, will reach the same result.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  These are hard and, therefore, they will reach a lot of different results under the same standard.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So you deny the hypothetical.  You are saying that my analysis of the problem is wrong; there simply is no such problem, and since there is no such problem, it doesn't matter if everyone enforces it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is your answer yes or no to what I just said, that you deny that the statement of the problem is realistic and therefore there is no problem in your view about having 51 different people enforce the same standard.   Stephen G. Breyer  And should such a problem arise, what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I want to--   Stephen G. Breyer  --You are just at the point of getting to what I -- the blank in my mind.  And the blank in my mind is when you said, but if there were such a problem, as I had described, but if there were, then they could -- and now that's the blank.  Then they could what?   Stephen G. Breyer  For example, just give me two, a couple.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is it -- could they -- could the Federal authorities pre-empt the State law, in your opinion?   INTERRUPTING ",08-453X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can I -- can I take what Justice Ginsburg just said, and give you a thought that I am interested in your response to?  I haven't seen the letter from the Attorney General.  Is the whole thing in the record?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, reading Judge Parker's description of it, it seemed to me that what he had said was that there are statistical disparities between interest rates and race.  Well, as long as, most unfortunately, income is correlated with race, with minorities being towards the bottom, of course such statistical disparities will exist, some legitimate, some not.  So if the only basis for getting this information is that allegation, it's hard to see how this differs from the case that Justice Ginsburg put.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But it might be quite a different case, if they had gone into court and found individuals who were really getting different interest rates and who really seemed very, very similar, but for race.  But at that point, they'd have to go get this same information, because that's where they would find whether that prima facie case was right or wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  Do you see what I'm doing?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm dividing the matter vertically, instead of, say, horizontally--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and I want to know if that's possible.   ",08-453X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't see why that's the issue before us.  Look, procedurally this is a little boring, but it seems pretty well established in the law.  I read a case called Toledo Scale and then there are a bunch of cases on jurisdiction, which I'm not going to name them because I'm sure you looked at them, but Travelers Indemnity, et cetera.  And it seems to me they make absolutely clear that once a litigant, you and the others, have had an opportunity to raise a matter and now the case is over, done, but for an injunction that stays in, all those issues that they previously raised or could have raised are gone; that the only question left is whether the government has complied with the injunction.  So I read the injunction.  The injunction says the government is enjoined from permitting the display of the Latin cross, period.  Once this law takes effect and you follow it, you are violating that injunction.  You don't need nine proceedings to see that.  You are violating it.  Now, if you don't like the injunction because you think the statute has so changed the circumstances there is no need for it, there is a remedy.  You go back to the district court and you say: Judge, change the injunction.  But you haven't done that.  And therefore, the only question before us is whether the Ninth Circuit is right in saying when you carry the statute into effect, you are violating this injunction, which I think no one could say you aren't.  Now, now, that -- that's a very technical boring issue.  I don't know why we heard this issue, but I don't see how we could reach any other issue in this case.   Stephen G. Breyer  But that's not what I'm talking about.   Stephen G. Breyer  We are talking about the first.  We are talking about the first injunction.  The first injunction says that the government may not permit display.  You've covered it up, so you are not permitting display.  You are in compliance.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what the plaintiff here said is that when you comply with this statute, you will not be in compliance, because you will turn it over to the VFW that will uncover it, so you will have permitted it to be displayed.  Now, that I can see is an issue before us.  But I don't see any other issue before us.   Stephen G. Breyer  But just I want to just get this clear procedurally.  I'm sorry.  It'll take one more second.  As I read this, there is no modification of any injunction.  What the -- what the Respondent asked for, he said: Judge, either hold that the transfer violates the current injunction, or modify the injunction.  Then what the district court did do is he said the proposed transfer violates the permanent injunction.  The permanent injunction is in the, like, the third paragraph of the July 24th order, and it says, you are permanently enjoined from permitting the display of the Latin cross.  Therefore, he rejected the need to modify it, and held that--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --this violates the injunction as written, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed that.  So is there any question in this case of modifying?  Is there any question other than the one that I think Justice Scalia was taking a good argument about, whether the proposed statute violates the July 24th injunction?  That's what the case is about.  Or why am I wrong?   Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.   ",08-472X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I see what the judge did.  He said: The motion to enforce the July 24th injunction is granted.  He said: Buono's motion to amend it is denied.  Then he did two other things, which he listed some people and he said they are enjoined from implementing the law.  Now, I take it that those paragraphs 3 and 4 are an implementation of the July 24 injunction which he granted, not a new injunction.   Stephen G. Breyer  So that's the issue here that we were just possibly debating.  The issue in the case is whether the district judge might lawfully enforce an old injunction in the manner he did, which was to add paragraphs 3 and 4.  That question you concede is here.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But aren't there things here that are a little extreme?  I mean, if she's to be believed, then she was really naked, and the two administrators deny that, but you have to take her side of the facts.  So taking her side of the facts, why couldn't the school administrators just do what they said they did?  That is, you leave her in her underwear, tell her: Go shake her underwear.  No reason to do any more than that.  Or if she is really embarrassed about that, say: Go put on a swimming suit, you know.  Shake the swimming suit, no problem.  People see you at the beach all the time.  Or call your mother.  I mean, you know, we can think of another -- a number of things that seem a lot less restrictive than her version of what went on here.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know, but I mean, here she is embarrassed if -- if what she says happened happened.  There seems no reason for that, and it seems so easy.  Put on your gym clothes, okay?  I mean, she does that every day.  It is just such obvious alternatives to having her be really naked.   Stephen G. Breyer  So that's what I -- I don't see any basis for saying to the school administrator, you know, you can do that.  You can just turn her naked.  I mean, it just embarrasses her.  What's the need for it?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know, but she says in the record that they went further and required her to be partly naked beyond just her underwear.  They say--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Okay.  So that was my question.  My question was: Why wasn't it?  I wasn't asking about the law.  I was asking: Why didn't they choose one of these alternatives?   Stephen G. Breyer  --putting things in their underwear.   ",08-479X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, I think there's a dispute in the record about that.  So -- so we have, I mean you would have the right to prove your version, obviously.  But suppose you fail to prove that and that the jury or judge, or whoever is deciding this fact, concludes the school board's right on that; all they did was ask her to strip to her underwear, period.  Nobody saw anything else.  Now, what's your view of that one?  I mean, let's also imagine that this is sufficient to prove -- to -- what happened was Marissa opens a planner, and in the planner there's some small knives, a cigarette lighter, and a cigarette.  And who gave you the planner?  Well, Savana gave it to me.  And they find some pills.  Let's imagine those pills are cocaine or something like meth or something.  And she says well, where did you get those?  Savana gave them to me.  Okay.  That seems to be possibly reasonable suspicion to think Savana has some of these pills.  And they're going to distribute them at lunchtime.  At that point they go look, whatever they did here.  But then they bring Savana in to the nurse and the nurse and the female official say: All right, Savana, strip to your underclothes and shake your underclothes.  That's what happens, period.  Now, is that latter part a violation of the Fourth Amendment?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But it would be okay to say, change into a swimming suit or your gym clothes?  Hey, your gym clothes are in the locker, they're about the same size, shape; go do that.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, they didn't -- she didn't reveal her body beyond her underclothes.  She -- that's the hypothetical that I'm trying to work out here, because I'm not certain.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm trying to work out why is this a major thing to say strip down to your underclothes, which children do when they change for gym, they do fairly frequently, not to -- you know, and there are only two women there.  Is -- how bad is this, underclothes?  That's what I'm trying to get at.  I'm asking because I don't know.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I thought there was, because I thought on page 135 of the record the official said they didn't see her naked, and so I thought that there was--   Stephen G. Breyer  --My question -- my question has to do with accepting--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What they said on page 135 of the record, and this is a genuine problem I'm having.  I'm trying to figure out, if that's so, and to repeat it -- you heard what I said, there's no reason to repeat it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  I want to know why that search, if that's what happened, would violate the Fourth Amendment, assuming reasonable suspicion to think she possessed meth or cocaine at that time.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe the psychologists -- ""strip search"" has a lot of meanings.  And do the psychologists focus on the situation with the child involved, you know, this is an -- my hypothetical, is that what they're talking about?   Stephen G. Breyer  It's not like you have any studies on this.  But I mean, I hate to tell you, but it seems to me like a logical thing when an adolescent child has some pills or something, they know people are looking for them, they will stick them in their underwear.  I'm not saying everyone would, but I mean, somebody who thinks that that's a fairly normal idea for some adolescent with some illegal drugs to think of, I don't think he's totally out to lunch, is he?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you have any studies on this?  I doubt it.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what am I supposed to do?  In my experience when I was 8 or 10 or 12 years old, you know, we did take our clothes off once a day, we changed for gym, okay?  And in my experience, too, people did sometimes stick things in my underwear ----  [Laughter]  Or not my underwear.  Whatever.  I was the one who did it?  I don't know.  I mean, I don't think it's beyond human experience, not beyond human experience.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what are they supposed to do?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, but it's supposed to be what's reasonable.   Stephen G. Breyer  And a teacher is there thinking what's reasonable?  And I've already got the thing sort of away from -- I see your point.  I'm not quite talking about that.  I'm worried about what to write in this as a general standard.  And so am I supposed to say, look, school -- school officials who think that children could hide things in their underwear when they know they're not supposed to have them, is that school official really unreasonable except in a special case?  That's what's bothering me.     ",08-479X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  In that case -- in that case, I guess there wouldn't be a -- a lawsuit.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, in that case, the debtor is never going to object.  So we're never going to have that one.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  I mean, you sit down with the creditors, and you look at the list and you try to work things out.  That meeting goes on as long as you want.  And if it appears there's an argument about valuation, you file an objection.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If it appears everybody can work everything out, fine.  What's the problem?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The rule is -- and that's what it's about -- the rule is about where you object, the trustee objects to the list.  The list.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's called Schedule C.  If you have an objection to the list, then it says: Here's what you do, trustee.  Meet with the creditors, try to work it out.  And if in fact 30 days thereafter and you don't need any more time, so you don't ask the judge for more time, file an objection.   Stephen G. Breyer  What's the problem?   Stephen G. Breyer  That sounds very complicated.  I -- I mean, the thing that sort of persuaded me so far on this is this is what Collier says, the other side -- it's what all the bankruptcy judges.  Ambro is a bankruptcy judge.  This is a simpler thing.     INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Look at the procedural rule.  It's just what I've said.  It says: If you have an objection to the list of property -- the list of property is C, okay?  So here's what you do, trustee: Sit down with the creditors.  See if there's really an argument.  Now, if there's no argument, fine; they'll let you do what you want.  If there is an argument and it has to do with that list, C, particularly valuation, which is what these things are all about, then file your objection.  That's so simple.  And it seems in most places they do it.  So why do we want to run around Robin's barn or something to get somewhere we can get to much simpler?     Stephen G. Breyer  But Rule 403 doesn't say that.  My Rule 403 says:  ""A party in interest may file an objection to the list of property claimed as -- as exempt within 30 days after the meeting. ""  Okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  It says ""the list"".  So that's where I think you're becoming awfully legalistic, to try to distinguish between the list and the property in A and B.  I mean, what do you -- these are about valuation, says Collier.  That's all we're interested in.   ",08-538X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Do you have any sense of how it works in practice?  I'm a little worried by Justice Kennedy's question, because the government says in practice what's been happening is that in most places, trustees don't -- they don't object to these kinds of valuations problems, and now suddenly when the rule has changed in some circuit, they do object as a matter of form, which is unnecessary paperwork.  The impression I had from reading Collier, and it was -- the opposite was so, that normally when you have the creditors' meeting, things would appear, what was a problem or what wasn't, and the creditor would then file an -- or the trustee would then file an objection.  Well, what is the case?  How does the practice work?  I'm -- I'm pretty uncertain.  I'm not a bankruptcy expert.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but how did it work normally for years and years?  You'd go into a committee meeting of creditors.  They'd get into an argument about the valuation.  I'm sure that happened.   Stephen G. Breyer  And when that happened, did trustees file objections within 30 days or didn't they?   Stephen G. Breyer  How do we know that?  I mean, I was impressed by Ambro.  Isn't he the judge here?   Stephen G. Breyer  He had been a bankruptcy judge, so maybe he knows.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I don't know who knows, because I'm worried the government has looked into this, and somebody's telling them who knows it's the opposite.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm very confused because of your answer to Justice Sotomayor.  I thought what you were saying -- she said, well, you only have 30 days; you get all this value.  That doesn't say very much.  You said, well -- you -- you said less.  Okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  You said less time.  Which isn't much of an answer, but it's something.  Now, I would have thought you were going to say but it's 30 days from the creditors' meeting ending, and that's a movable feast that could last 5 years.  You could keep postponing it.  You can go to the judge and say, Judge, give me an extension, which he'll do.  So there's no problem here.  But you didn't say that.  So the fact that you didn't say that suggests to me you're not certain about what this practical impact is.   Stephen G. Breyer  You are certain?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  How long do these creditors' meetings last?  How easy are they to postpone?  How -- how easy is it for the trustee to get this information together during the creditors' meeting, et cetera, et cetera?  Where do I look to find out the answer to that question?

Breyer  Yeah, so wouldn't that be a normal question to ask?   Stephen G.

[Laughter]  I have laryngitis; I don't speak accurately.

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, so what's the problem then with saying that in the opinion?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it's pretty unusual that it won't be, and I think certainly you have in the case in front of us a case where it would be relevant.  You may have an answer to the question.  There may be a perfectly good answer, so let's listen to it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The answer dispositive?  Well, I don't see it should be dispositive, maybe the answers would be quite different.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So -- but you no objection, then I'm not sure there is much of an issue.  There might -- I mean, maybe there is some.  That's the only issue, whether this should be dispositive always, or whether it should be a factor to take into account where relevant?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you have no objection to send it back and say look, of course this is relevant, perhaps quite often relevant; why don't you look at it?   Stephen G. Breyer  What do we do about Gartenberg?  That is to say, the key sentence you can read either way.  The key sentence could mean -- it just depends on tone of voice.  You must charge a fee that is not so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not -- could not have been the product of arms-length bargaining.  Or you could say, look, it's unlawful where it's so large -- it doesn't -- where there is no reasonable relationship.  And if there is no reasonable relationship, how could it have been the product of arm's-length bargaining?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You object if we turn them upside down?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I'm saying the tone, be a little careful here.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So we can say the substance is -- I'm just trying this out -- the substance is to look and see if it's reasonable, and if it's reasonable it certainly is the product of arm-length bargaining, if it's not reasonable, how could it be?

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I understand the argument that the issues are not quite the same, that the Atkins issue of mental retardation is not quite the same as the issue that was litigated.  Let's try and get that out of the case.  I think that's where Justice Kennedy was going.  Suppose it was a gun case and the Supreme Court originally thought you could convict people who sell drugs of simple possession of a gun.  There's a finding, because it's a bench trial, that he simply possessed but did not otherwise use the gun.  Then the Supreme Court holds that that isn't enough under the statute.  So now the State wants to argue, because the proceeding on appeal or whatever is still going on, we want a second shot at this; we want to show he did more than simply possess.  Is the State bound by what it previously lost on or can the State -- can he get a second shot?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not -- I'm not going to go into double jeopardy.  I don't think necessarily that it's double jeopardy that -- that is relevant here.  But I have a -- have you run into this in a different context?  They wouldn't use the word ""double jeopardy"".  It would be some kind of due process problem.  Maybe there isn't a problem.  Have you run in your research to anything like what I described?   ",08-598X

He appeals.  He says they made a mistake.  And the normal remedy is you give him a new trial.  Does it matter that it's a collateral proceeding?  I don't think so.  They go to the Federal court: Judge, they made a mistake at my trial.  You give him a new trial.  Everything's up for grabs normally at the new trial.  I can't think of an instance where it isn't.  Here, they are saying: Judge, they made a mistake.  They should have applied the mental retardation rule of Atkins.  So give him a new trial.

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I want a case even vaguely like that.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Your argument, then -- we're getting somewhere maybe.   Stephen G. Breyer  You're saying to me, think of Jackson and Denno, If you're in a collateral proceeding and the Federal judge said there wasn't enough evidence to convict him under the Constitution, like the Shuffling Sam case, there isn't enough evidence; it isn't that he gets a new trial.  The Constitution entitles him to acquittal, and therefore there is no new trial because of the Double Jeopardy Clause, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So you're saying here, the evidence the first time was such that they couldn't give him the death penalty under the Constitution as later interpreted.  So if that's what you discover on the collateral appeal, a similar reasoning would somehow lead you to the similar result.  Is that the argument?   INTERRUPTING ",08-598X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  It's the same argument -- it's the same argument, as if you had an APA case, and the words in the APA are  ""arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion. ""  so somebody who has an unfair procedure says it violates those words.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I don't really see that it's any different, except we normally go to those words before we would decide a due process question.  It's the similar kind of question.  Why wouldn't we do the same thing here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can you -- could you go back for a minute?  I mean, this reads as if it's very complicated, but for me, I read the AFL-CIO brief and that's what I am thinking of and it seems this is not such a hard case.  Basically, there is a statute filled with words of procedure, and it isn't too difficult to interpret that statute as meaning that the board should have fair procedure, not unfair procedure.  Now, if you are willing to make that giant step, the remaining issue in the case is whether the procedure here was fair or unfair.  And the Seventh Circuit is filled with pages of opinion that explains why it was unfair.  And the reason basically it was unfair is because no one in his right mind previous to this case would have thought that you should fill up your brief with a lot of facts that nobody's going to contest.  And after this case, the board said: By the way, you have to put in a whole lot of jurisdictional facts even if nobody is going to contest them, and since you didn't do it, you are out, and we won't even give you a chance to do it now.  Okay?  So I read that.  I thought, is there something wrong with that?  And then I thought I'd ask you, because you would know.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It must be what they think of as an interpretation of the rule and the statute that they already had promulgated.  The rule and the statutes say, the rule says you have to include all known relevant argumentative facts.  So if the circular says we mean it, we mean the facts that people are having an argument about.  And then the statute says, a full statement of the facts bearing upon the dispute.  And the circular and then this document say we mean a full statement of facts that somebody might think have something to do with an argument that people are having.  And, so, only after this case did the board say, oh, no, you have to include some disputes that nobody is disputing, some facts that nobody has ever disputed or seems to.  Now, what's -- what's the response to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm right in stating what they did?  Is my statement of what they did, which was meant to be as pejorative as I could possibly make it--  [Laughter]  --and you are going to say, that's right, that's the correct statement of what happened?   INTERRUPTING ",08-604X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I take it your point is that there is a rule?  It's called 29 CFR 301.7(b).  If that rule happened to say, you must show up by 11, that would be a fair inference you don't have to show up by 10.  And that rule says you have to submit the argumentative facts, so there is a fair inference you don't have to submit the facts that are not argumentative.  I take it that that -- suppose -- suppose that you are wrong on that.  I think maybe you are right, but suppose you are wrong.  Suppose they have loads of authority to make rules.  Again, you have a strong argument they don't, but suppose they did.  In your research -- and the same question is really addressed to your fellow counsel.  In your research on this, did you find any instance in which either a court or an agency does change a rule, and says: Now you have to say the date right underneath the caption, whereas previously it was stamped by the clerk.  Okay?  They changed the rule.  And they have every good reason in the world for doing it.  And then they apply it to the case in front of them, which didn't know about it, and then they won't let them change it.  Now, is there any case at all which said that that was lawful?  I can think of lots of cases that say you cannot apply rules retroactively where it is unfair to do it, even if you had have all the power in the world to make the rules.  I have lots of cases like that.  What I wondered is if anybody found a case along the lines that I just said.   Stephen G. Breyer  And because -- I mean, in the normal--   ",08-604X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  If that's so, imagine a well-educated American woman marries a man from a foreign country X.  They have a divorce.  The judge says, the man is completely at fault here, a real rotter.  The woman is 100 percent entitled to every possible bit of custody, and the man can see the child twice a year on Christmas Day at 4:00 in the morning.  That's it.  Now, there's a law like Chile's that says you can't take the child out of the country without the permission of the father too, this person who gets to see the child twice a year.  And you're saying that that's custody.  It's custody, and -- and what is the woman supposed to do?  She can't get a decent job worthy of her education.  The -- the -- all the courts said that she's entitled to the child.  She has to choose between her life and her child.  And -- and is that what this -- this convention is aimed at?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now -- now, of course, what I'm asking you with my example--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Is why interpret it that way, where all that you have is a rule of law that applies to everybody, even in the case I've tried to imagine, where to say it's a right of custody would ruin the life of the woman, would give the husband something which he should -- certainly shouldn't have in any moral term, it would seem, and she comes back to the United States and is forced to give her child back to whatever this country is.  I have called it X.  Now, why give that kind of interpretation to this statute, which seems to have a purpose that's looking after women and children?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's your conclusion.  I'm just trying to get -- to see if there is any humane purpose underlying the interpretation that you have advocated, and certainly there are two interpretations here.  Your opponents will soon present us with a different one.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That isn't my question.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm trying to get at what the humane purpose would be, given your interpretation of the law in this kind of situation?   Stephen G. Breyer  What's the law -- what is the law if a mother and a child -- sorry.  What's the law if a couple living in a foreign country has a decree of the court, and the decree of the court grants certain visiting rights to the father, and the father, violating those rights, takes the child to a different country.  Can the mother get it back?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's the normal law where you have a couple -- they're supposed to leave the child in the country, but it doesn't say that.  There's no ne exeat thing.  They've just agreed to certain visiting rights.   Stephen G. Breyer  And in violation of those rights, the father, say, takes the child to another country in violation of the divorce decree of the first country.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, you are not understanding my question.   Stephen G. Breyer  My question is, outside this convention--   Stephen G. Breyer  --If -- forget the convention.  Suppose there's just a divorce decree.   Stephen G. Breyer  And suppose a parent, violating the decree, takes the child to another country in violation of an ordinary divorce decree.  Does the injured parent have a way of getting the child back?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm sure there isn't, but under the law--   Stephen G. Breyer  --You would go and take the court's order to a court in the United States and try to enforce it?   Stephen G. Breyer  And the American court would be under obligation, I guess, to enforce it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, all right.  So our question here is which of the two mechanisms should we use?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know you think that, but I'm still worried about my mother in the case that -- that you gave me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I've read through that, and I'll tell you that, on the basis of my reading through all that stuff, my mind is in equipoise.  I find some one way, some the other.  I think maybe each side does a little overstating here, but -- but I -- I am in equipoise, having looked at that quickly.  So I know -- I know the stuff, you can -- but that's why I am trying to get to the underlying humane idea that's supposed to underlie that, and see if it applies here.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What they seem to be thinking of -- this is -- maybe you can get at what is bothering me.  I'm perhaps not articulating it very well.  But the -- where there's any kind of a custody right, I normally think there was a human being called a family law judge who has a very tough job, and he has looked at the situation of these two people here and the child.  And he said, at least: Smith and Mrs. Smith, you are each going to have a little bit, at least.  Now, but in a situation where he says to Mr. Smith, nothing, I want to give you nothing -- he thinks this is Frankenstein's monster; he does not want to give him a single thing -- that, on your interpretation of this statute, that doesn't matter.  Just because Chile has a general law that says you can't take anybody out of the country without permission, just because of that, even Frankenstein's monster is considered to have custody for the purposes of this, though the human being who looked at this, called the family law judge, said: Don't let him near that child.  All right?  Now, that's -- don't pick up on my errors in that I know I haven't stated it quite right, but look at what I'm driving at.  And that's what's bothering me.   Ginger D. Anders  Well, I think Chile could have made a determination as a matter of its domestic law, that it would be in the child's interest--   Stephen G. Breyer  I know there are ways out, but why should we include custody to be a situation where the human being who looked at this couple thought that that individual, the husband, should have nothing but visit him occasionally on Christmas?  Why should we interpret the word ""custody"" in this treaty to include even that situation, which turns the treaty into a general ""return the child"" no matter what?   Ginger D. Anders  --Well, I think the convention's fundamental principles actually are in line with your concerns, because what the convention says is that anytime that the child has been abducted in violation of a decision-making right that the -- that one or the other parent has, then the child should be returned.  But the return remedy is not a determination that the child should live with the left-behind parent or that he should live out the rest of his life in Chile.  It's simply a determination that the courts of the country of habitual residence should decide what should happen with the child going forward.  That's the fundamental premise in it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, could we interpret the words ""great psychological harm"" to include, for example, a situation where an educated woman with an advanced degree is unable to get work in the country where her child lives and has to live under conditions that are -- that are really -- we would say are fairly primitive because of her inability to find an appropriate employment?  Can you include that under great psychological harm, so that the child wouldn't have to go back?   Ginger D. Anders  Well, I -- I presume that you could, in an individual case, offer evidence that might include things like--   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, has there ever been -- would you advocate that kind of very broad standard of great psychological -- and what would be your position, or what's the government's position on that?   Ginger D. Anders  --It's that the defense would be more narrow than that.  But that's because, first, the convention is based on the idea that -- that the courts of the country of habitual residence can make this determination in the child's best interest, and that they should be the ones to do that -- we shouldn't allow forum-shopping -- and also because the return remedy is not a determination that the child will have to stay in the country for the rest of his life or even that the mother would necessarily have to return with him.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can we read that exception there to say -- ""grave injury"" and so forth -- can we read it as in essence saying, look, do what's best for the child?   ",08-645X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So if I -- if I think, as Justice Alito was starting out, that if the -- a court order in the divorce case says the father and mother will jointly decide what house to live in, that the father has a custody right, if it jointly says the father and the mother will decide what State to live in, that that's a custody right.  That it says that the father and mother will decide what city, same.  The father and mother will jointly what country to live in, same.  But suppose that there is no such decree; rather, the jurisdictional statutes of the nation, without considering this family, have a rule that says they have to live in Chile without Court permission.  Is there any way I can draw a line, in terms of this statute, between the two situations, the one being where the divorce judge actually focused on the needs and circumstances of a family, the other being where there was no more than a jurisdictional law in a nation that tried to protect the jurisdiction of its courts?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I understand that, but what I'm wondering is if -- if -- I thought you would agree with me about that, and since I thought you would agree with me about that, you would explain to me how I could reach that result, consistent with the language of this convention, which talks about custody rights granted by operation of law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Who's against it?  I -- as I read their brief, France is not on their side.  It's split.   Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why -- why do you have a rule?  I mean, I thought -- I looked up six cases, and they all say, Strickland cases in this Court, that you look at all the circumstances.  Now, what I think is radical on your part, but tell me it isn't, is not what the rule is, but that you want one.  I thought the government's view normally was the same as we -- what's the exact words -- did the conduct of the lawyer meet professional -- prevailing professional norms?  And then we look to see, if it did not, whether that led to a situation where he would not have pleaded guilty but for the failure.  Okay?  Now, the world is filled with 42 billion circumstances.  If we agree with you, we will have set in motion the great legal rule machine.  And there's nothing better than lawyers spitting off rules.  And we will be here from now until -- good, we won't have any docket problem, because what we'll be doing is reviewing rule after rule after rule after rule.  So why has the government, I think for the first time, maybe not, told us to abandon Strickland's approach and start spinning off rules?   Michael R. Dreeben  Justice Breyer, we have not abandoned Strickland's approach.  What we have focused on is, what is the Sixth Amendment right in the first place?  The Sixth Amendment right is not a right to have a State-provided lawyer who will advise you about child custody or about deportation or about--   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  But it's easy -- I mean, you know, one thing we are very good at here is making up hypotheticals.  So I imagine it wouldn't be that tough for me to think of a hypothetical where everyone knows this 90-year-old individual who has actually never set foot in the country that he came from, and everyone knows that if he pleads guilty to this chewing gum offense where they have virtually no evidence, he will be sent back, at age 90, to that country.  I would say any lawyer would say, be careful, because if we plead guilty, back you go, on the stretcher since you can no longer walk.  See, all I did was spin out a hypothetical.  And the reason I can spin those out and why we have the Strickland rule is pretty clearly that you shouldn't have sub rules here because life is more complicated than rules tell us.  Just look to see prevailing norm and did it cause the harm.  And that's why I am back to my question: Isn't this the first time the government has asked us to adopt rules under Strickland rather than what it says--   Michael R. Dreeben  --I think, Justice Breyer--   Stephen G. Breyer  --which is ""case by case"", underlined, italics, repeated in the cases?   Michael R. Dreeben  --Justice Breyer, I think that the fundamental point is that this is the first time that the Court has been asked to adopt a rule under Strickland that would require a lawyer pursuant to Sixth Amendment norms to give advice that pertains--   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, they are not asking us to have a rule.  What he is saying is, look to the individual case and ask in this case, did the -- at least that's what I heard him; he's in charge of his own case.  But I heard him say, look to this case, and in this case it falls below prevailing norms for a lot of reasons.   Michael R. Dreeben  --Well, Justice Breyer, the -- the lower courts that have looked at this I think have correctly recognized that there is a distinction between saying that Strickland is a case-by-case inquiry into lawyer competence and saying that Strickland requires the lawyer to provide advice about collateral consequences that are not the criminal--   ",08-651X

You are a criminal lawyer and you learn the facts of the case, and it turns out that, after listening to the facts, you think he is being charged with a fairly minor offense, a year maybe max, and he tells you: You know, I have a family here, I've -- I've -- you know, he tells you this story where it is quite apparent to you that if he pleads guilty back he goes, where he might be killed and so might his family.  Just sit there and say nothing?  What would you do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What would you do?  I'm asking you, would you tell him?  He doesn't know about the immigration law.  He thinks it's just a year.  You yourself have learned that he probably will be killed, as will his family, if he pleads guilty.  Would you tell him that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course you would.  And do you think of any -- can you think of any decent lawyer who wouldn't?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Okay.  Then why have you -- in this case, if they didn't tell him, why has not such a lawyer failed to meet prevailing professional norms in my hypothetical?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not saying whether -- you just told me that any lawyer worth his salt in my example of course would tell the client, and -- in my case.  And so I just asked, then has a lawyer who has failed to do so not met the prevailing professional norm?  That has nothing to do with ethics or not ethics; it's how lawyers behave.  I don't see how you avoid answering that question yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You just told me everyone would do it, everybody'd do it.  I don't know what a norm is otherwise.

I'm asking a question.  And I just heard you say that you want, for example, were it -- you want the Patriots to sell T-shirts in competition with the Saints, or whoever.  The Red Sox.  All right.  You see the point?  The Red Sox -- I know baseball better.  You want the Red Sox to compete in selling T-shirts with the Yankees; is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Okay.  I don't know a Red Sox fan who would take a Yankees sweatshirt if you gave it away.  I mean, I don't know where you are going to get your expert from who's going to say there is competition between those two products.  I think they would rather -- they would rather wear a baseball, a football, a hockey shirt.   Stephen G. Breyer  But you are going to go back and prove that actually there is competition between the--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.  Is that what this case is about?   Stephen G.

I'm not -- you have a right, but that's what you were going to try to have to prove: That they're--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But I'm trying to look -- what I'm trying to get in my mind is what specific restraint you are focusing on.  You listed three or four, and one of them is you want, in effect -- I'm joking about it, but it's true -- you are arguing that the Yankees should compete with the Red Sox in selling shirts.  Another thing you are complaining about, which is the one I understand less, is that these teams got together and they agreed that they would just have one person sell all this stuff together.  And what you think is that they individually should have decided whether to choose that one person, or maybe to choose two people, or three; is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  I find--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I find it easier--   Stephen G. Breyer  --to think about the case if I know what's going on.  And I'm not certain this is irrelevant, but given Justice Scalia's persuasive remark, I will withdraw my question.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  And then the question I have -- I now understand this much better in light of that.  And -- but I don't -- and -- and I see your point.  What I'm not certain about is: Is it better to characterize it as a single entity, in which case we get into the kind of confusion that I think exists in this case?  Or just say: Look, it's a joint venture.  If Panagra creates a joint venture, of course they are going to buy things like office space and employees, so it's reasonable by definition.  We don't even look into it.  Those things that are close enough.  See, take your criteria from 17, page 17, which are excellent criteria in my mind, and you say these are the criteria by which we decide whether those ancillary parts of a joint venture that is itself reasonable are also reasonable.   Malcolm L. Stewart  --I guess we would say two things.  The first is, up until now there has been no such thing in the law as concerted action that is per se legal, or per se reasonable.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, we wouldn't say per se.  We are saying that the justification here: They are reasonable.  Why are they reasonable?  Because there is a legitimate joint venture, and this is an ancillary part of that legitimate joint venture.  People can attack it, but it's going to be no easier to attack than if they tried to attack what you call a single entity.   Malcolm L. Stewart  I guess my point is that if, for instance, a disappointed bidder for the paper supply conduct -- contract challenged this as a Section 1 violation and said the commissioner's decision to go to Staples rather than Office Depot was unreasonable because Office Depot was offering a better product at a lower price -- there are certainly decisions that the commissioner could make with respect to procurement of supplies or the setting of wage levels that would be unreasonable in a business judgment sense, in that they wouldn't effectively carry on the mission of the organization, but they wouldn't be unreasonable in the -- the Section 1 sense.  And the other thing I would say is that line of argument could have been made in Copperweld; that is, the Court could have concluded that--   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, look, your second criteria opens it up to attack in precisely the same way that my use of rule of reason does, because they are going to have to show it doesn't significantly affect actual or potential competition.  Therefore, they file their claim, they say they win under the second criteria, and it's precisely the same as a person filing his claim and saying it's unreasonable.  We are only talking terminology, but what worries me about this is the terminology, because I think that the lower courts have taken Copperweld terminology and transferred it to a place where it does, I think, perhaps not belong.   Malcolm L. Stewart  --Well -- well, in Dagher, for instance, the Court was dealing with a situation that's in some ways analogous to the one that you have here; that is, a joint venture in which entities that were economic competitors in some aspects of their businesses joined forces with respect to other aspects.  And the Court in Dagher didn't squarely resolve these questions, whether Section 1 applied, but it said that in pricing its products, Equilon, the joint venture, was acting as a single firm, a single entity.  The other point I would like to make about my -- my paper and employee example is that, in our view, the NFL commissioner, when carrying out those functions on behalf of the League, would be acting as a single entity, even though his power was derived from the consent of the teams.  But if the Jets and the Giants agreed among themselves as to what wages they would pay their secretaries or from whom they would buy paper, that would be an entirely different thing.  The fact that those teams are for some purposes part of a--   ",08-661X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The problem, as I see, for you in this case is that the basic conclusion is in the court of appeals, where it says:  ""Viewed in this light, the NFL teams are best described as a single source of economic power when promoting NFL football through licensing. ""  Well, how do we know that?  Their allegation is that that isn't true.  And I have -- and Copperweld just seems to me to be very confusing on this, since -- since my hornbook knowledge of it was, we have Copperweld to deal with the case that we don't make booths in department stores compete in price against each other.  All right?  Normally, however, we say independent vendors can't get together and say they fix prices.  That's per se.  And joint ventures are in the middle, so we apply a rule of reason.  Now, very simple, I thought that has been the law since Panagra.  I don't know what, in fact, Copperweld has to do with it.  And they are saying that this basic joint venture for promoting is not a reasonable agreement.  So why shouldn't they have their shot?  You might well win, but they want to make that claim.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine, but that's the conclusion here.  That's not the -- that's the conclusion.  You're -- the question is: Should they be permitted to join their centers of economic power into one when they promote and sell their T-shirts, sweatshirts, et cetera?  Now, you can't answer that question by announcing the conclusion.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, can't it ask someone to do that.  Oh.  Oh, you are saying the game.   Stephen G. Breyer  What does the game have to do with this?  I thought we were talking about T-shirts and helmets, and I -- I thought it's the simplest thing in the world.  You pick up the phone and say:  ""Hello, Shanghai, do you have a helmet? ""  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Was this a summary judgment motion?   Stephen G. Breyer  But now the question is: Are you basing that on economic-related data about the pros and the cons of, you know, the economic harms of stopping them from competing, versus the economic benefits of allowing them to act as a separate -- as a single entity?  Or are you basing it on a pure legal word called ""single entity""?  And what worried -- I thought when I read the opinion, first, of the district court, that he's just following what I think started in the Seventh Circuit, unfortunately, of taking this word ""single entity"" and throwing around -- throwing it around all over the place and stopping the economic analysis.  But then when I read the last paragraphs of his opinion, he seems to be saying that when I go back to the record, which you want me to do, I will discover that there is lots of information showing economic benefit to this venture of promoting together.  There's nothing to suggest they could compete, and so it's clear, to the point where they don't get to trial, that this is a reasonable agreement.  All right.  Now, is -- have I -- am I right in thinking what you are thinking?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Good.  Then I want to know what your position is.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, I wouldn't read -- can you read Copperweld as follows?  Copperweld is ratifying a decision by an entrepreneur or several to organize his entrepreneurial entity as one where there are obvious efficiencies in doing that, such as it would obviously be inefficient to have the sales people behind counters in a single department store competing with each other in price.  A joint venture is a situation where it's debatable whether or not there is that kind of efficiency in organization, and therefore, we apply a rule of reason.  That's Panagra.  I don't see anything in Copperweld that is intended to overrule Panagra.  And as long as Panagra is not overruled, we would apply, at least to major decisions by joint ventures, a rule of reason.  Now, what is wrong with -- and you might still win on the rule of reason.  But why isn't that analysis correct?  I am putting it forward as a hypothesis for you to discuss.   Stephen G. Breyer  There is a -- very definitely a joint venture here to play football, but there isn't a joint venture to build houses and there isn't a joint venture obviously in sight to promote.  So they are saying that this is such a different activity, the playing of football versus the promotion of a logo, that we ought to go and look under a rule of reason as to whether a joint venture in promoting a logo is justified in terms of competition's harms and economic benefits.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it would be if they tried to do it, but there, they would be attacked on the ground that under the rule of reason, they do not have the justification such that the antitrust law would allow them to do it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And they are saying: And promoting is precisely the same.  That's why it seems to me to be something that you can't decide in theory.  It's a matter of going back to economic facts with witnesses and so forth.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So let's call it an NFL supermarket.  Red Sox supermarket, Patriots automobile shop, Patriots tractor store, everything becomes Patriots.  Everything -- no competition anywhere.  Now, you say that's ridiculous, and once you say that's ridiculous, you are now into the business of deciding whether this aspect of the undeniable legal joint venture to play baseball or football, whether this aspect is properly the subject of merger.  And once you are into that, you are into your $7 million, and I can't really think of anything that's going to help you there.  And the SG in its brief, you see on that key, 16 and 17, seem to me, simply reproduces in precisely somewhat different language, but precisely the argument you are now having, is this the kind of thing that should be merged?  We know by applying the rule of reason.  And second, if it is merged, is this particular aspect of it something where there could be competition, and there isn't much justification, that's their rule, too.  Again, we are back to the rule of reason.  So how do I save you the $7 million?   Stephen G. Breyer  So we don't even ask the question whether under the rule of reason such a thing is reasonable or justified?   INTERRUPTING ",08-661X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why do you think that your -- that this privilege -- or is it -- more important than any other privilege?  I mean, Justice Scalia's question and your answer convinced me that you can protect this the same as you can any other trade secret -- any trade secret.  Of course, you do disclose it to the opposing party, but that is also true of any breach of any privilege, so husband-wife, priest-penitent, psychiatrist and patient.  I take all of those are privileged.  Do we allow collateral appeals there?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if we don't allow collateral appeals with the husband and wife, with the priest and -- and someone in -- you know, confession or something, I don't -- with a priest, or with a psychiatrist who is dealing with a patient, why would we allow collateral appeal here?   Stephen G. Breyer  But then if we grant your collateral appeal, don't we have to, perhaps, equally grant it in every situation, where a judge arguably makes an erroneous ruling on a question of privilege?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's the lawyer.   Stephen G. Breyer  So it's -- in your opinion, it's more important to protect the lawyers, who talk to clients, from erroneous rulings, than protect the priest or protect the wife or husband or protect the psychiatrist who is dealing with a patient?

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  It's an obvious question, I guess.  I'd just like to hear your answer directly.  Case 1, count 1, selling drugs; count 2, using the telephone to sell the drugs.  All right?  The jury acquits of the first, convicts of the second.  Logically impossible, but permitted under the law, right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Case 2--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Absolutely illogical.  Case 2, there is no count 1.  Case 2, telephone count, hung jury.  We retry it.  Permitted, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  All that happened was that they hung.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Okay.  Case 2, hung jury, telephone count.  We retry it.  All right.  So now, why is it, when we put them together and -- case 3, count 1, substantive drugs, acquitted; count 2, telephone, hung jury.  Well, in case 2, we could get a retrial of the telephone count.  Why can't we get a retrial of the telephone count now?   Stephen G. Breyer  All that happened is they are retrying it just as they did in case 2.  Why does the presence of count 1 there mean that they can't retry it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I'm going too fast because you didn't take the cases in.  Do you want me to repeat them?  Maybe it's too complicated.  I'm just saying case 1, count 1, the substantive count, conviction.  On count 2, telephone count, acquittal.  Everybody agrees that's permissible.  Case 2 is only the telephone.  That's all they indicted him for.  And if they have a hung jury, you can, can't you, retry him?   Stephen G. Breyer  So, now, when we have case 3, which is the same as case 1 except that, instead of convicting him, they had a hung jury, why can't you retry him, just as you could in case 2?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, everybody agrees it resolves nothing, and that's why you could retry him in -- that's why you could retry him in case 2, because it resolves nothing.  So if you could retry him in case 2, why can't you retry him in case 3?  What does the presence of this other substantive count have to do with it?  Since it never would have blocked the conviction on count 2, why does it stop you from retrying count 2?  It would never have blocked the conviction of count 2.  Why does it stop you from retrying it?  Do you see -- do you see my--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That's the logical point I thought the other side was making, and maybe they're not because it seems to be striking you as surprising or maybe I'm not making it in a clear way.  But what I wanted was a clear answer to it.   ",08-67XX
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  And why not?  Because the answer to my question was exactly what Justice Stevens said.  Why is it that -- that if you could have inconsistent verdicts in Powell, well, then, why can't, since they hung, couldn't you try him again on the hung count?  And the answer is, because you're trying him again.  And that's why we have all the briefs that we have, because the only way to answer this is and look and see if the policies that underlie the collateral estoppel part of double jeopardy apply here.  And I can't think of one that doesn't.  I can't think of one single one that wouldn't apply.  Maybe there are some.  And I can't think of any reason for allowing the government to have a second bite at this apple.  What is the reason?   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course, they don't.  Suppose that they never brought up that hung count.  Then you wouldn't even have the first bite at the apple.  So you would think it would be a fortiori you could go ahead.  But that's the case; you clearly can't go ahead.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't think it had anything to do with integrity of anything.  I thought what it had to do with is that they are being tried at the same time.  And to test that out in my mind, I imagine this: In February, we try the individual for the drug count; he's acquitted.  In June, we bring a telephone count.  Absolutely forbidden, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So why should the government be one whit better off because, in addition to doing that, they happened to bring a telephone count in January along with the other?   Stephen G. Breyer  Start the other side, which I think Justice Stevens was suggesting.  Assume that there was only one trial on the substantive count in January.  Now you decide -- he's acquitted.  Now you decide to indict him in July on the telephone count.  You argue to the judge: Judge, there shouldn't be double jeopardy here because maybe the jury just acquitted him the first time because they were lenient.  Maybe they liked his looks.  Maybe they were distracted by a fly.  Maybe they were, maybe they were -- and we didn't even get an appeal.  Are you going to win that case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, not even a close.  Okay.  Not even close.  Now, since you're going to lose that case, I grant you there's thousands of cases talking about your ability to bring more cases if you have a hung jury.  I concede all those.  None of them talks about double jeopardy, to my knowledge.  So we're back to the hypothetical.  You've lost your case.  Now, all that you did to turn that case into a winning case was you also indicted him on the telephone count in January.  Now, that was my question the first time, and you began to have two answers.  I just didn't see why the government should be any better off because they also indicted him in January.  Given the language ""double jeopardy"", you might think the government, if anything, should be worse off, but let's keep them neutral.  So what is the reason that the government should be worse off because they indicted him in January on the telephone count as well as in June?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no -- better.  I misspoke.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I know that you're going to go into the question of how we shape a rule, and I would like you, and perhaps on rebuttal your other counsel, to comment on the following: I don't see -- as Justice Kennedy had a problem, so do I have a problem with anything that just says break in custody, and taking time seems fairly arbitrary.  Suppose you -- could you try to shape a rule on the civil situation, the codes of ethics, where you are not supposed to talk to a client who is represented by a lawyer?  That's where my mind is going.  And the best I could do at the moment is you would say: When, due to a breach in custody and the passage of time, the questioner did not and would not reasonably believe that the suspect was looking for or was represented by counsel?  What I've tried to do is take the purpose of the civil rule, the ordinary ethical rule, and then use it to shape a standard.  So I would appreciate any comments on that thought.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Quite a lot of what I read was about the problems of counsel.  Counsel has nothing to do with this, nothing at all?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If -- are we interested in counsel or not?  If we are interested in whether he's represented by counsel, and Miranda covers both, then I would repeat my question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If we are not interested in representation by counsel, then I would withdraw my question and you don't have to answer it.   Stephen G. Breyer  My thought is, can you use the rule for lawyers, which has worked, to help shape a rule that would work here?   INTERRUPTING ",08-680X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Just in case -- just in case we don't -- we want to put a time limit on it, which I know you don't want us to do.  I'm now thinking and I would like your comment, if you want, of a combination of what Justice Alito said and what I said, that is, that there are two parts to the Edwards thing.  One is the lawyer part, and the other is the incriminating self part.  Now the lawyer part would be handled by shaping a rule based on the rules of evidence, along the lines I suggested.  And that would give you a time.  And then the Miranda part could be handled by saying: but the suspect retains the right to show that this questioning is badgering without the question marks.  In other words what they are really up to is to try to get him to change his mind.  Now would that work?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if you're -- if you are going to use the Edwards, which I think is a good idea, as counsel part, which I think is a good starting place, you and every other member of the bar deals with this problem every day of the week.  Not every day of the week, but very often.  You know somebody's represented in a case, and you know you are supposed to talk to the lawyer.  But eventually time passes, and then you are probably free to talk to him, because the whole thing's gone away.  Now that's a pretty vague rule.  You could make it more specific, but the -- the bar has lived with that kind of situation, I guess for years.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So why can't we here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, that's not what I mean.  I mean that the obligation to deal with counsel, you don't have, after enough time passes, that it's no longer reasonable to think that that individual either has or wants counsel.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  On that particular point, just specifically -- this is awfully complicated and you've had to go into it pretty quickly, and so have I.  All right.  So it seemed to me, looking at these three sections, as soon as you get to (a)(2), it says certain matters are not subject to judicial review, and it includes 1225(b)(1), which I take it is the case where somebody comes in, knocks at our door, and the immigration judge says goodbye, and he says, no, no, I'm entitled to be a refugee or asylum.  Okay.  Now, we look at that.  It says in there it's -- subsection (e) gives you judicial review of that.  Now we look at the thing you cited which is (5), which is (a)(5), and you read it completely correctly, but you left out these words  ""except as provided in subsection (e). ""  So now we go to subsection (e).  And lo and behold, what is subsection (e) talking about, but just the case I mentioned.  It talks about -- it talks about judicial review for orders under 1225(b)(1).  Now, those are the people who knock at the door and they want asylum.  And there are some procedures for them.  So, now we look at (e) to see what are the procedures for them.  And lo and behold, right there in (2), is -- it says you can have a habeas corpus procedure as to certain matters, whether he's an alien, whether he's admitted, admitted as a refugee, et cetera.  So it says there are some you can have habeas corpus.  So I imagine a person who has been ordered removed under (e).  Now it says you can have a habeas corpus and now the judge says goodbye.  And they go to a reviewing court, which is going to be a habeas corpus court, and that court decides, the alien is right.  I'm going to issue an injunction.  Now, just in case he's thinking that, in the very next section (f), what we have are two provisions, (f)(1) that says if his case is a case involving mass action against the whole thing, you can't enter an injunction.  And then we look at (2), and it says if his is just a normal case, you can't enter an injunction unless it meets this specific standard.  So I looked at that.  I admit this is pretty quick.  And I thought it's (e) and it's (f), and (f) is dealing with (e), (f)(2).  And it makes perfect sense.  They don't want a habeas corpus judge telling that immigration judge what to do with the guy knocking on the door and saying, I need asylum, unless they meet clear and present danger -- clear and -- whatever it is.  Clear and present, yes.  Now, I admit I read that quickly.  And therefore, I'm probably missing something.  And I don't expect you necessarily to be an expert, but can you do your best to tell me what I'm missing or if you think I might be right?   Stephen G. Breyer  What it says here specifically is it says habeas proceedings.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's good.  Let me add one other thing, because all I'm trying to do is find some work for this section (f)(2) to do.  And now I seem to have found some.  And I think what you say was, wait a minute, we agree it's like habeas.  But and I think it would be like an exclusion order rather than a removal order.  And I did notice previously when it talks about 1225, sometimes it uses the word ""exclusion"" and sometimes it says ""removal"".   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you were that district habeas judge and you get a thing saying removal, you don't really vacate it.  I think what you do is order an injunction against its enforcement.  Here, I don't know.  Do you think--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --What are we supposed to do?  What would you do?  Suppose you're a district court judge and at 2:00 in the afternoon on Friday a petition comes in and it's from someone who says, I'm going to be on the 5 o'clock airplane to Hong Kong and I have a real case here.  I think I'm right.  And he has eight pages attached, and you read through that.  And you say, he has a point.  Now, how good this point is I don't know.  So I'd like to put this -- I'd like to have everybody in here on Monday, and then I could figure it out.  Now, that probably happens.  Now, what's worrying me about your position on this -- which, almost -- I think every circuit is against you on this, except for this one.   Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and it seems to me it would make it impossible for the district judge to do, because the district judge cannot honestly say that it's clear and convincing that this man is going to win.  All he knows is he has a point, he would like to hear more about it, and he doesn't want him on the airplane 3 hours from now from Hong Kong.  So I -- so how is this supposed to work?   Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What would you have done?  I mean, I'm -- I'm not experienced in this.  But I mean, I have heard the other side and I have read the argument.  And it makes sense logically to say he has the worst defendant he has ever seen.  He's murdered lots of people in cold blood.  He gets up on the stand and says: I'm going to kill a lot more.  He sounds totally bonkers.  And -- and he says to the jury, I can't tell you that what he did was not aggravating; it was terrible.  I can't tell you that there's anything here that should make you feel better about him; there is nothing.  But we are a nation of people who are humane and our law says don't put a person to death when he fills with his nuttiness that third prong, which is a lower standard of insanity than I had to meet.  But it's clearly met and here are the experts; I point to their testimony, and that's what they said.  So be humane.  Now, you think he should have said something else.  What?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, he -- he said why.  He said.  He said: We don't execute people who are crazy and this guy is crazy.  He might not be crazy enough to meet the standard of not guilty by reason of insanity.  He's not crazy enough to meet the standard of incompetency, but you just heard three experts tell you that he's seriously crazy.  And if you don't -- if you doubt them, don't doubt your own eyes.  I don't see -- how can I sit -- and we have courts, two courts who said, yeah, that was okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or we had at least one State court that found it okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But I agree with all that you are saying.  What I am saying my hard time is here is why wasn't this advocacy, when indeed a reasonable decision as to what constituted advocacy in those really rare circumstances where it was the worst kind of defendant he had ever seen in his life who deserved no sympathy?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, he talked about nothing else.  And I understand -- look, I am not an expert.  I haven't argued these things to juries, and I recognize some lawyers tell me, okay, this was very rambling.  I didn't think it was rambling.  I thought he was trying to spend a lot of time explaining away to the jury some prosecutorial remark, that you shouldn't pay attention to the expert because you, yourself, the lawyer, didn't talk to them enough.  And so you describe that for a couple of pages and why it was irrelevant, and the reason he talked about the -- I thought, the reason he talked about the -- how you will feel when you go out of here, is because he recognizes this is the most sensational case in this community, ever, and all your neighbors are going to congratulate you.  But what you are doing here is you are applying a standard, and you are proud to be an American, and that standard, as an American, is a humane standard that requires you to not give the death penalty when the man's insane.  Now, I agree that he repeated that 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 times, but it was the same point over and over.  And how can I -- since there is a lower court that seemed to find this adequate, how can I sit here and say it wasn't?   Stephen G. Breyer  Didn't -- didn't they cite Strickland?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I guess then they concede the argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why do we have no idea then?  If they cited Strickland, why do we have no idea what they--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --How -- how does that work?  Certainly, it's a fairly common thing, that the defendant will make -- let's say, 20 arguments, maybe he would even number them.  And it's fairly common to find a court of appeals in a state that says, as to argument number 17, and then they characterize it, we reject that argument.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, that -- that happens all the time.   Stephen G. Breyer  And, now, it's very, very common that, in making that argument, there could be some good grounds for rejecting it, and there could be some bad grounds for rejecting it.  So would we send -- do we send every case like that back, to say, I want to know if you rejected it for a good reason or a bad reason?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What we do is we assume they did it for a bad reason?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any authority for that?  Because, I mean, I'm not positive of this one, but I -- I do think hearing it that suddenly habeas opinions and district court opinions would grow by an order of magnitude, because it's very common to see arguments rejected summarily.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, is there any authority for the proposition that if they reject it summarily, that then we don't assume they are right, but rather we assume they are wrong?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why wouldn't you do that as well, then, even a fortiori, where I'm just an appeals court judge and I get a district court opinion?  Most common thing in the world, summary judgment denied, motion denied, this denied, denied, denied.  And if I'm going to start doing this for State cases, wouldn't I also have to do it for Federal cases whenever a Federal judge doesn't give all his reasons, which is the most common thing in the world?   Stephen G. Breyer  We did?  I mean, I've reviewed thousands and thousands of them and I've always thought that a trial judge doesn't have to spell out all his reasons.  And the question is really, given the circumstance, can we say that he acted contrary to law?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If it's trial-based, you look at what the facts are that he might have taken.   Stephen G. Breyer  So you are saying -- I mean, this is very helpful to me for a variety of reasons, but is -- in your view, the correct role of the habeas judge vis-à-vis the State judge there is the same as the Federal appellate judge vis-à-vis the district judge?  That is, I'm thinking of a district judge makes a finding, doesn't fully explain it.  Now, I would think it would be unlawful if it's an unreasonable application of a Supreme Court case.  And I know how to review that.  I mean, I -- I know how to review it, I think.  Okay.  So you are saying however I do that, I should do the same thing and the -- but you don't -- you don't think there is a more relaxed standard than that?  You think that's basically the standard?

You take these words, which are a little vague, some of them,  ""serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value. ""  and you say that's a standard that a judge or prosecutor will apply.  And people have to understand it because they have to know what to do to avoid the risk of being prosecuted.  Now, as I have gotten out of these briefs, you then require people to apply that standard, not simply to the crush videos or to the dogfighting, but also to, as Justice Scalia pointed out, bullfighting, sheep hunting, bear hunting, deer hunting, fox hunting, humane slaughter, and for, I think somewhere I found, the stuffing geese for pate de fois gras.  All right, so there is a whole long -- quail hunting.  There's a whole long list in here of things that people might want to do.  They won't know if it falls within this exemption.  Nobody in every State wants to forbid these things.  Sometimes they are, sometimes they are not.  They won't know whether or not they can make this particular film, picture, or other.  That's the overbreadth argument.  And I would like to hear your response.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you want to say ""cruelly kill""?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, ""cruelly kill"" is not exactly crystal clear.  And therefore my question is why, given the need for you to save this statute to read so many words that are so general, those contained here that I've read, cruelly kill, cruelly wound as opposed to just wound or kill.  You are doing that in order to prevent chilling people who are engaging in activities that aren't intended to be covered by this statute.  Why not do a simpler thing?  Rather than let the public guess as to what these words mean, ask Congress to write a statute that actually aims at those frightful things that it was trying to prohibit.  Now, that can be done.  I don't know why they couldn't do it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  You say a crush video, my description that I read of it, you would have a strong case.  I'm not saying you would win, I don't have to decide that.  But you have a very strong case.  So you say to Congress, write a statute that focuses on that.  You are worried about dog fighting, write a statute that focuses on that, and moreover, talks about something unlawful in every state.  I am not giving Congress advice, though I seem to be.

Breyer  But the point -- the point I guess is when you say yes to this, what you are thinking is that, just as real obscenity when depicted does nothing communicative but rather appeals to the instinct of lust, so Congress could find a category of things that do not communicate, but appeal to the instinct of sadism; and that is true when other creatures are killed for the pleasure of the people who want to see them killed.  Now, that's what you are saying.  Now -- and I think maybe that's true.  We don't have to decide that, perhaps.  But the government says that is this statute, that is this statute read in light of its basic intent, and it is up to the Court to interpret it so as it achieves that objective.  And you say that's not possible.  Why not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I think what -- I think what's going on is -- is not -- your conflating two things.  One is you are trying to produce education about something that has no communicative value.  In so far as you are trying to make an argument or educate, of course, it is protected, but the government, here, is saying I think the statute is intended to forbid a different thing entirely, and it's hard to draw a line.  Maybe it's impossible; but promoting a thing which communicates nothing, but appeals to people's worst instinct, that is not to advocate it or not to advocate it.  It is to try to make money out of it, and that's what they think, I believe, the statute is aimed at.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So that's why they have the journalistic exception.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the SG says that isn't trust law.  The SG says that trust law -- when you make a mistake and you send it back, that the district judge has a choice here, which would make sense.  The district judge, if he thinks he's going to get something out of the trust -- the administrator, listens to him.  I mean, it sounds like common sense would be: Listen to the administrator, but you don't have to do it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because it's very complicated.  He may understand it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, is she wrong?  You're saying if I look at those cases, I'll find--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --It's not -- it's not a standard of review.  It's -- he's trying to figure out what the word ""duplicative"" means, okay?  And the -- and the administrator did his best.  He says it means what it meant before, which is, like, 14 pages of who-could-understand-it.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then it turns out that that isn't what it means, and the district judge says: That's affirmed.  So now he says: Give me another shot.  If it were me, I'd listen, but if I thought this isn't really that great, I would try to figure out something else.  And then if I were a court of appeals judge, I'd say it's up to the district court.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, luckily, the SG says that is the law.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Says it isn't the law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about just that?  He came back, the administrator, I think, the second time, with something that very closely resembled the first time.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And what about that for a reason thinking he's not in that good of faith?  Go ahead.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's -- it struck me if -- it's hard.  I don't necessarily follow it at all, but the -- you had this original plan where, basically, you were trying to figure out how much money they took away, and you compared it with what it would have made if you had invested it in certain funds.  So now we have a new word, which is called ""duplicative""; you can't be duplicative, something like that.  And then the Second Circuit says that new word called ""duplicative"" for new plans doesn't really pick up this old phantom system; at least, it doesn't give notice.  Now he sends it back, and the poor district judge, since he thought that was perfectly sensible to say it did pick that up, says: Well, they told me it didn't, so I'll ask the administrator what do you think we do now?  The administrator says: I have a great idea; the plain vanilla system.  The plain vanilla system happens to be very much like the old system, except in following your own funds, you're not doing it; you're following the -- the insurance industry's funds.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, I mean, that's -- it's what they'll pay for an annuity.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's called -- that's called their funds.  That's called what they think they'll earn.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Correct, and the question is: What is attributable to?  And they struck down your phantom system for doing it, and then the administrator comes back with a new system, which new system is going to take the judgment of the insurance companies about what was accrued.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right, fine.  And then what he's thinking is that's awfully similar.  We just substituted different people here--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --It's similar in a sense, and it's different in a sense.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But the -- the more you hypothetically grow it, the less chance they'll get the floor.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And so they'd like it to get the floor, and so they'd like it to be--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Up until this time?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's a pretty big windfall for people.  You're working at Xerox, and your plan is about approaching the minimum level -- let's quit and then go invest it, and then come back 3 days before you're bound to retire, and then you're going get whatever the plan grew, and you'll also get your minimum.   Matthew D. Roberts  I don't think it's a windfall, Your Honor, because it depends on what the employees were promised when they were deciding whether to come back--   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why would anyone promise them that kind of a deal?   Matthew D. Roberts  --Well -- first of all, when you've got a defined benefit plan and defined contribution plan, there's no requirement in ERISA, and employers frequently -- or at least, sometimes, would not offset the defined contribution benefits from the defined benefit plan, and even in a flooroffset arrangement, where they would, an employer could provide less than the full amount--   Stephen G. Breyer  What about -- a bit more serious question -- I mean, that is a serious question, but the more general question, what about something that is analogous to Skidmore deference?   Matthew D. Roberts  --Oh, God.   Stephen G. Breyer  So you say--  [Laughter]  You say -- you take the -- the district judge here can take -- takes the administrator's opinion for what it's worth.   Matthew D. Roberts  Well--   Stephen G. Breyer  He has to listen to it.   Stephen G. Breyer  That is essentially the principle, I thought.   Matthew D. Roberts  --The court's not required to apply its use of discretion and--   Stephen G. Breyer  But he does have to read it.  He has to read it--   Matthew D. Roberts  --review again.   Stephen G. Breyer  --Read it, and take it for what it's worth.   Stephen G. Breyer  You don't think they would -- you think they would do that?   Matthew D. Roberts  They would do that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Okay.   Matthew D. Roberts  Of course.   ",08-810X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why -- why -- as I understand it -- which big if -- you and I are both working at Xerox, and in year 1 -- and we each have 500,000 in our contribution account, and you leave, and you take the 500,000.  I stay, and I don't.  Okay?  Now, my 500,000 over the next 10 years is going to grow somewhat -- as long as it wasn't 2007.  But it--  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  I might spend it, but if I leave it there, it would grow, okay.  But some -- some people leave it there, they grow.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, when figuring the floor, what Xerox does is look to see how much it grew.  They look at the whole thing, now, 10 years later, and they say, you're up above the floor, good-bye, we will give you this, not the floor, okay.  Now, you are in the same position, and you happen to come back to Xerox, and all they want to do is say, you know, we'd like to assume yours grew, too, I mean, not -- a little, anyway, and the first thing they wanted to do is to say it should have grown the same way we treat our own guys, as it having grown.  And the court of appeals says that's wrong because you left the words out, but send it back to see it's fair.  So then the expert comes in, and the expert says, well, they didn't want to give us that way to grow it; here is how -- we will assume it grew like an insurance company, the most incredibly conservative people in the world, how -- how they would have treated it as growing, if you bought an annuity right then, and that just gives us even a lower number.  And -- and they want to say, why didn't you at least listen to that, instead of coming to the fact which is very, very unusual, it didn't grow at all, in which case, you are eligible for the floor.   Stephen G. Breyer  So I think that's why they think it's either an abuse of discretion or you should have listened more to the -- to the expert -- should have done something else.

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or what?   Stephen G. Breyer  And the commission can't change the sanctions?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And it can't -- it can't pass a rule saying, we don't want you to do that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So as far as -- if the company was ever certain it was right and that the Accounting Board was out of control, completely wrong, the company would just say: I'm not complying--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --fine, do what you want.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then at that moment, the group that would decide whether they were right or the board was right would be the commission; is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It says you don't -- you can get it even without a subpoena?   Stephen G. Breyer  Where does it say that?  Or I'll take your word for it.  I'll look it up.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't want to delay you, so forget it.  I'll look it up later.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I've got one thing on my list.  I'm looking to what they control, can't control -- the commission.  And so far I've written that in your view the commission can investigate people without subpoenas, and the commission can do nothing about it, okay?  That's one.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what's two?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So we only have one on our list.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not saying it's good or bad.  I just want to be sure I have a complete list.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if you have a statute that says each Department -- Commerce, Justice -- the Attorney General of the United States or the secretary shall appoint an inspector general who will in fact inspect and find ethics violations and that office -- he cannot be removed from that office without cause.  In your view, that's all -- and it would be unconstitutional.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Well, why?  What's the difference?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you are saying that the -- the chairman of the SEC does not under the Constitution have the authority or the SEC does not have the authority to appoint individuals who cannot be removed without cause?   Stephen G. Breyer  Or -- or you might be saying they do not have the authority to appoint inferior officers of the United States.  I don't know why they wouldn't have that authority if the Secretary of the Interior has that authority.   Stephen G. Breyer  What's an independent agency?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what is an independent agency?   Stephen G. Breyer  But why isn't -- so why aren't they subject to the President's plenary control?   Stephen G. Breyer  The SEC.  What -- what restrictions?  Because, interestingly enough, my law clerks have been unable to find any statutory provision that says that the President of the United States can remove an SEC commissioner only for cause.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's silent.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then, in other words--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But that was not what I have asked.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know.  I'm not interested in that.  I'm interested in an answer to my question.   Stephen G. Breyer  And the answer to my -- my question was--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --is there anything in the law, as far as you know, any statute, that says that the President cannot remove a commissioner or the chairman of the SEC but for cause?   Stephen G. Breyer  The answer is there is something?   Stephen G. Breyer  Where -- where is that?  Would you refer me to that citation?  Because we couldn't find it.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't agree with that, but I mean, you do agree.  I thought an independent agency is a function of a number of different things: where it is on the chart, what people's customs have grown up to, expectations about it--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --what the President might expect he can do or not.  But all those things are not what I'd call hard law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well but if it's not hard law, then I wonder.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, that's why I asked the question.  It's not what I have the answer to.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  In Humphrey's Executor there was no provision that said--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --There was a provision, which we know, that said the President cannot remove an FTC commissioner but for cause.  Have I been wrong on that all those years?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It would render the board unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If an executive appointee who is a superior officer of the United States appoints an inferior officer, which inferior officer can be removed only for cause -- I mean, my goodness -- I can -- there are lots of shapes and sizes.  I can't imagine what would be unconstitutional about that.  What?   Stephen G. Breyer  Does the chairman serve as a chairman for a fixed term?   Stephen G. Breyer  No?  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, therefore, what you had said before would not apply to the chairman, that is to say: The President can remove him at will--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --There is no statute to the contrary; he does not serve for a fixed term, and so you cannot imply that.  Since the chairman cannot--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --can remove him at will -- you do not have what you would call the gearing into play, this somewhat mechanical jurisprudence, of what's an independent agency.   Stephen G. Breyer  So you are saying that the chairman, not the commissioner, is the person who does the appointing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING ",08-861X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what do -- what do you say in response to their formal argument that heads of departments are those people whom the President has at-will control over, like the Secretary of Defense, and Freytag is support for that.  And these aren't those people, so the SEC's members must be inferior officers, and the Constitution says nothing about and implicitly forbids inferior officers from appointing other inferior officers beneath them.  All right, that's a formal argument, but I got that out of their briefs, and I want to know what you respond to it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  So I -- so we have to take the dissent there as opposed to taking the majority?   Stephen G. Breyer  I see.   ",08-861X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Before you -- do you -- does the government feel that it hasn't had an adequate opportunity to brief the constitutionality of the statute?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Might this come up in the Skilling case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So we have to say, in your view -- no, I'm just -- I'm cutting into you because I don't -- you answered it once you said that.  The -- the -- what I wonder is, does the government feel, in order to have a full opportunity to brief constitutionality, that we should issue an order saying: Please brief the constitutionality?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So we should say that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, as I hear that -- I am exaggerating, possibly, but I think every agent has a duty of loyalty to provide loyal and honest services to the master, master agent.  Every worker is an agent of his master, the employer.  So every instance in which a worker does not provide honest services to the employer, he has met your test.  I think there are 300 -- perhaps there are 150 million workers in the United States.  I think possibly 140 of them would flunk your test.  [Laughter]  I mean, that's what worrying me.  Now, why?  Because -- I -- ""Do you like my hat""?  Says the boss.  ""Oh, I love your hat. ""  says the worker.  Why?  So the boss will leave the room so that the worker can continue to read the racing form.  Deception?  Designed to work at reading the racing form instead of doing your honest work and, therefore, violation?  Now, explain to me how your test does not -- and I think you can probably do it; I just don't understand it at the moment.  Explain it to me, how your test does not make this statute potentially criminalizing 100 million workers in the United States, or some tens of millions?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now this -- I'm just getting a label, and as I hear you talk, I think it's not what you necessarily -- I found in the brief, or didn't understand it from the brief -- but I found precisely what you said, it seems to me in what I have labeled Altshuler alternative B, does that ring a bell?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, yes.  You've read the briefs -- you've read the briefs.  He has alternative A and alternative B.  And alternative A he says kickbacks, and it could be limited to bribery or kickbacks.  In alternative B he adds bribery, kickbacks and undisclosed self-dealing capable of causing economic harm.  That's what I got out of the brief.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now I just heard what you said and it sounded like the same thing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It is not causing economic harm.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what about my racing form?  He is acting for himself and not his employer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Different matter.  The foolish to prosecute, jury defined, worries me for the reason that what's in the back of my mind -- and you will see what -- I am disclosing to you what is in the back of my mind.  [Laughter]  When the criminal code was reenacted and never was, one kind of joke was that it there it would be -- there would one law, the law would be read as a crime to do wrong, okay?  ""It is a crime to do wrong. ""  Sometimes adding,  ""in the opinion of the Attorney General. ""  All right.  Now you see the problem?  It may be you would never prosecute it.  It may be a jury would never convict.  But that isn't the basis for having a statute that picks up 80 or 100 million people.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That -- that is Altshuler B, which I -- that seems to work, but then you want to go beyond that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I think in going beyond that is the paradigm case of -- of moonlighting?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, because--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --No, no, no, no.  I'm trying to get -- encapsulate your test in my mind.  I'm just trying to find a way, so as I listen to you, I think what you are driving at -- a paradigm case of what you are driving at would be moonlighting.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes -- no -- yes.  He takes a day -- he leaves an hour early because he is selling real estate.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You have to have all those elements?  One -- I mean, everybody is working for the company.  Everybody has loyalty to the company owner.  And, now, you are saying everybody has competing things that they sort of like to do, which would deprive the owner of the honest services, but you are saying, in addition to that, he has to have his own company?   Stephen G. Breyer  In addition to that, what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I thought materiality just has to do with whether a false statement you make, in fact, causes the effect, or is likely to, that is the harmful effect.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's always there.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, and the -- and the reason I say with -- maybe I have the example that I mean now.  In the cases you just mention, the bribe case?  Right, the legislature is not going to gain.  The legislator or the briber might, but somebody will.  And the object of those bribes was that there would be economic gain, and that was what -- when I went through all those McNally cases, I thought I could fit them into this alternative Altshuler thing, but now, you -- you worry me that you have a different test that will bring in like any failure to fill out a disclosure form.  A deliberate failure to answer a box, one out of 1,000, for every government employee, would immediately -- 20 years in jail.   ",08-876X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  --with that particular period.  The trouble that I have with that particular period is August 1, 2003, to June 14, 2004, isn't that right?  That is Donaldson -- or that's Moore?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Donaldson was the first one?   Stephen G. Breyer  Go ahead.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, there -- as I understand it, that that first year the Vermont Supreme Court agrees with you.   Stephen G. Breyer  They said, we're not counting any of that against you.  Now we go into the second year, and the second year had to do with Mr. Donaldson, a lot of it.  And it turns out that Mr. Donaldson actually had left the office within a few days of his having been appointed to do this and then he never did anything.  So the Supreme Court of Vermont says, as far as Mr. Donaldson is concerned, we do hold that against the State for the reason that it is the equivalent of not giving him anybody.  The guy they gave him wasn't even a public defender, he never did a thing.  All right.  Now we go to the third group.  The third group, the State agreed they should be charged.  That's Mr. Sleigh.  The third one they agreed with it.  They said lightly, but they agreed with it.  And as to the final group, Mrs. Moore, well, it looks like from the record as if the reason that was held against the State had nothing to do with her performance.  It had to do with the fact that the State didn't give certain records to her, which everybody would agree, if it's true, should be chargeable to the prosecution, which is the State.  So we have four periods.  In one of them you won; in the second one he had no lawyer at all, according to the court; in the third one you agree it should be chargeable to you; and in the fourth one it has to do possibly with prosecution errors, not defense errors.  Now, what are we supposed to decide?  Are we supposed to decide whether my statement is, in fact, a correct statement?  If so, why isn't it?  I guess we have to read the record.  But what else is there to decide?   Stephen G. Breyer  And you won that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that point in the case?  Where -- where is that in this case?  I don't know who -- I didn't see anywhere where the Vermont Supreme Court said anything, said that, except in the instance where you agreed with them.  Where is it in their -- where is it -- who are they are referring to when they said that?  Is that Donaldson?  Because I thought the claim with Donaldson was it -- it was not his attribution, nothing he did was attributed.  Rather, it was the State's failure to appoint anyone, because to appoint Donaldson was to appoint no one since he had left the office and since he did nothing.  Now, is that what we're supposed to decide: When a State appoints a person who has already left the office and does nothing, under those circumstances is it correct to attribute to the State their failure to appoint anybody?   ",08-88XX
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What about Donaldson and Moore, those two periods?  Those two periods, the Donaldson period and the Moore period, seem, as far as I can tell, which isn't that far, they seem to be periods when the State -- when the court below was saying that all that happened here was that the lawyers who were appointed, did a very bad job.  You can't say they weren't appointed.  It isn't that he didn't have counsel.  He had counsel, and they just didn't do very much.  Now, why should that be accounted against the stayer?  Is Moore special?  Was there really a problem of prosecutorial behavior?  Is Donaldson the same as Sleigh?  I don't know.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But the -- I take it the point of general principle, as opposed to this case, is I take it you will concede the following: Let's imagine on January 1 some investors look out and there are not only storm clouds, thunder, whatever you want, lots to put them on notice.  So then the statute begins to run.  But it could be the case that once they start to investigate, there is a key element, say scienter, the only evidence for which would take them an extra six months to find, because it's in the hands of a person who is in jail in Burma.  All right?  [Laughter]  So, you are prepared to say in that situation the statute does not begin to run on January 1; it begins to run on July 1, if they really look into it.  But if they don't really look into it, then it's January 1.  That's I think the basic difference, as I gather, between the sides, or one major difference in this case.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, if that's correct, why?  That is to say, it seems to me that, in treating these differently, you have proposed a real morass for courts to get into.  Did they really investigate on January 1?  Was it an inadequate investigation?  Was it a thorough investigation?  Along with the difficulty of drawing a distinction between why it should be that that difference should exist, why not just apply the same rule to the investors whether they really do investigate or whether they don't and in both cases the statute begins to run on July 1, not January 1?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then he would have to file a complaint possibly before he has enough evidence to even bring a case.  That is, suppose my guy in Burma is going to be in jail for 3 years; he can't get to him for 3 years.  Now, he's going to have to file his complaint before he could have the evidence that there was scienter.  Now, that doesn't make sense to me.   INTERRUPTING ",08-905X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So, is there a difference -- I'm trying to get these terminological differences clear in my mind, and I'm not quite certain of the difference between you and the government.  If you go back to my -- my Burma example, I think both you and the government agree that the statute doesn't begin to run until you find this person in Burma.  But now, I'm not sure you disagree about -- whether you agree or disagree about this.  So I think -- you find the person in Burma.  That's 6 months after you had all the other indications.  Now, both of you say the statute begins to run.  You would say, when you find that person in Burma, you have to get, through him, enough information to be able to file your complaint now in respect to scienter.  But the government would say, when you get that person in Burma, he has to be able to give you enough storm clouds, in respect to -- to scienter.  Is that what the -- is there that difference?  I think--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Is there no difference, then, between the two of you, or what?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So do you think -- you think the standard should be -- and I can find out from the government, and I will, I guess -- that it should be -- that you have to -- a reasonable person having talked to the guy in Burma would walk away thinking, Fraud.  That's the standard; you think they're both there -- but both of you agree you have to find the guy in Burma, though it could turn out that other features of the case, 6 months earlier, would put a reasonable person on notice to begin looking for somebody in Burma?   Stephen G. Breyer  So you both agree about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  So -- so you want to say, you ought to get enough information from that or in all the other things the same, so that you have -- are able to file the complaint.  They want to say you have to get enough so a reasonable person would believe a fraud had occurred.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not saying -- I'm not so worried about that.  I know there's a lot less, but -- or more, whatever -- but I am--   Stephen G. Breyer  So how -- how -- what's the right phrasing?  Because I -- I understood that inquiry notice has somehow made an appearance, and it seems to confuse me.  So you say the statute begins to run when a reasonable person would have found facts sufficient to show a violation or sufficient to permit him to file a complaint that alleges a violation?  How -- does that come in any way?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How do I say that here?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you are basically in agreement.  And then the way that the -- the -- then the way that this inquiry thing comes in is that sometimes, perhaps quite often, a reasonable person, given certain facts, would begin to inquire.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if it happened to be a case where inquiry played no role, then it wouldn't.  It's all a question of what a reasonable person would do.   INTERRUPTING ",08-905X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So, in fact, if -- what we have is a motion in the category of grace, except for asylum, saying, of course, the Justice Department makes a decision that can't be reviewed.  But then the department, let's imagine, has a regulation, and it says: Anyone can ask the department for rehearing in such a matter, and we'll decide as a matter of grace whether to give you one.  Now, you're saying that would be reviewed?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why wouldn't it be reviewed?  You just said it was.  You said every procedural decision is reviewed, which to me, makes no sense to begin with, because I can't imagine that Congress, while they don't want them to review the substance at all, is perfectly happy to have the courts review every detailed matter of extra time to file a brief, extra time to have an oral argument.  All those matters would be reviewable, I guess, in your view.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly the same is true of the substantive decision.  I mean, that has nothing to do with it.  I want to know -- look, this is where I'm going.  I don't think your -- I can't find a reading of this statute that makes sense, except for one which I am trying on, and I'm sure there is a lot wrong with it, that what Congress meant to do here is to take all the procedural decisions including reopening ones, and treat them the same way that they are treating the substantive decisions.  So that in his case, he wins.  Because he gets review of the substance, he should get review of a reopening.  It's the same thing.  And in some other case, they'd lose, because if you don't get review of the substance, you shouldn't get review of the reopening.  Both are the same thing.  They are just filed at different times.  So that, to me, is the only reading of this statute that I have yet found that made sense.  But since no one argues for it, I'm sure I must be making some huge mistake.  But that's what you can tell me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but you are on the wrong side, if you agree with it, because -- no, you are on the right side, because he wins.  No, you're on the right side.  He wins.  I take that back.  I'm sorry.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, but -- well, new things have happened.  He doesn't just want to relitigate it.  New things have happened; that's why he wants it reopened.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, he's not, but his motion to reopen is -- it's my hypothetical; I want to deal with it; I accept yours.  My hypothetical is, something new came up.  That's why he wants it reopened.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Something new came up.  That's why he -- I think, isn't it true, often people want it reopened because something new came up?   Stephen G. Breyer  And I'm asking you, what possible sense could it make?   Stephen G. Breyer  Look, we're -- two issues.  One is grace in respect to -- let's call it fraud, and he loses.  Something new comes up, and what does he want?  Grace in respect of fraud in light of this new fact.  Now, my question would be: What possible sense does it make to say the courts cannot review the first, but they could review the second?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, by the way, this reopening is done by regulation, not done by statute.  That's where I get to the problem.  You are trying to distinguish between whether it's done by regulation or done by statute.  And I'm trying to distinguish on a very different context.  Treat the motion to reopen the same as you treat the initial motion, whether it's done by regulation or whether it's done by statute.   INTERRUPTING ",08-911X

Breyer  And, if you put people in front of railroad trains and half survive, then it's speculative?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Before you get to Anza, this might be a good time to ask because I don't think we focused on this in Pasquantino.  But if in fact the failure of a State to collect a tax is property, then why isn't every corporation that files an income tax return and makes two false statements automatically liable for RICO?  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, that would mean the States have a new method, which I don't think they use, a new method of collecting treble taxes from anyone who makes two false statements or a false statement in two income tax returns, and it would seem to me that would have vast repercussions.  I mean, it might be very beneficial; the States are having a deficit crisis; but--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --How, how -- why would it not be--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --But they left -- they don't have the RICO predicate, not paying your State taxes.  But in effect you would read into the RICO predicate protecting States.   Stephen G. Breyer  That may be, but nobody focused on this issue.  So -- so that's what's bothering me.  What is the -- what is the stopping place?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or is there one?  And if there is none, how do we reconcile this view of -- they're suggesting a stopping place, Anza and Pasquantino to the contrary.  Right.  But they're suggesting a stopping place on a matter that hasn't come up.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or focused on.  It's come up but not focused on.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So in your view California--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --which has a $10 billion deficit, could go through, find every instance where a corporation made two false statements in two tax returns, one in each, and collect treble what they're owed.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't say systematic understatement.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It says two--   Stephen G. Breyer  --predicate acts.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the predicate acts are a deliberate false statement.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If they did, then why didn't they put in not paying your State tax returns as a predicate act?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, well, that cuts against you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because if they put in one, your theory -- they don't even need, whether they need that or not.  Your theory applies to every tax, every tax.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, but go back to my question.   Stephen G. Breyer  My question is, forget the cigarette taxes.  If I accept your argument, am I then saying that California, New York, and every other State that's owed money by corporations in their taxes can go through, look for two tax returns that have a false statement in them that were mailed in, and thereby collect RICO damages?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's a pretty far-reaching--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Do you know anybody, any court that has ever said that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why would--   Stephen G. Breyer  --If Congress wanted that result, why didn't they put in as a predicate act not paying your income tax or not paying your State tax?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So I think that their response to the mail and fraud is, you're right, it is all mail -- it is all mail fraud.  All these tax violations, in fact every one, you mail in your tax return normally.   Stephen G. Breyer  So all of these would be mail fraud.  But mail fraud is not a treble damages statute.  And therefore the question is who will prosecute, State or Federal?  So normally it's State if it's a State tax.  But it's one thing to say Congress didn't care about that and quite another thing to say that Congress didn't care if the States were going to use this in order to collect three times what the taxes are owed.  And so they're looking for a way to cut off this tax liability for ordinary, simpleminded tax -- failure to pay your State taxes.  And that's why they've hit on this idea of the antitrust.  I don't know if that's a satisfactory idea.  I don't see the solution.  I think I see the problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why is it that you haven't argued -- why haven't you--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Why is that relevant as far as cause is concerned?   ",08-969X

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is the overhead?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is the overhead?  I mean, that's something that I find interesting and important, and I can't find it anywhere.  The numbers began to bother me in the same way they did with Justice Alito.  I'm thinking: There are 30,000 hours.  They got 10.5 million.  That translates into, what is it, $350 an hour.  Now, if the lawyer works for 2,000 hours of the year, which is a little high, he is being compensated at $700,000 on average in this case.  But he has to pay overhead.  So what's that?  40 percent?  30?  20?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean, if you have any rough idea at all, because I think if it's anywhere near $700,000 on average, you say to a taxpayer: You are going to pay this, and that's more money than 99 percent of the taxpayers hope to see in their lives, and suddenly they are paying that money to somebody, which is -- I could say: Okay, pay them 400,000.  That's what he would get as the average fee for the toppest, most top lawyer.  And that's, you know, pretty high.  And -- but $700,000 a year for a lawyer.  Wow.  And that's what this judge paid.  Now, what is it that came out of that?  That's what I want to know before I make up my mind, frankly.  And I'm going to try to look it up, but I'm trying -- I'm trying to get a rough idea here.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, I know, but--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that doesn't help me, and the reason it doesn't help me is because if it's a very, very high number in dollars per year, then I am tempted to think: Well, very high is enough.  You don't need very, very, very high.  You see my point?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  I would be saying: Be satisfied forever with very, very high, the most top pay that any top lawyer gets; do not want even more than that.  And if in fact I doubt that I have really made a difference to incentives on that one, for the reason that the Solicitor General said -- and my goodness, how do we explain this to the average person?  That -- those are the questions that are genuinely going through my mind.  I haven't made up my mind how I will come out in this case.  So it's not a kind of putting this to you.  I don't know.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Should I -- should I look at the fact that, in the early 1970s, when this was done, legal fees were not quite so high?  And perhaps, comparatively so, they weren't quite so high, either.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not just inflation.  I think the discrepancy between these top legal fees and the fee of the average person -- or the work of the average person, the average wage for a family of four has changed quite a lot.

Because the statute says that the established -- the -- it's established -- namely, the unlawful employment practice -- it's established only if, and certainly if, the respondent uses--   Stephen G. Breyer  --a particular employment practice that has a disparate impact.  That refers back to (a)(2).  So back in that period, on a certain date, he used that limiting practice, and, therefore, on that particular date, he established the unlawful employment practice by using a test that limited, et cetera.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is my impression -- is there anything else in that (k)?  You see, it lists about 10 things, let's say 10 -- imagine.  One of those things is that it was used.

But in this case, the district court said it's discretionary.  So insofar as there are two rules -- or were at the time, your client got the benefit of the most liberal, and, therefore, insofar as there is a difference, it made no difference.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How would you fill in this sentence?  I'm beginning where the Chief Justice did.  Say everybody said: Look, this opinion is at least unclear.  It's -- everybody agrees that the simple existence of discretion does not make a State ground inadequate, so we send it back for you now.  And you will have some good arguments, I guarantee each side will have some good arguments, as to whether they were being consistent or not, whether there was a consistent rule or not.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, next sentence, which maybe would never be written: This is not to say that discretion automatically means it's adequate, for it could be applied inconsistently.  Now, there could be another sentence, because that other sentence would have to go on to the fact that any discretionary rule will never be applied with perfect consistency or anywhere near it.  That would be true if you give a trial judge the choice in his discretion to waive a -- a time limit ruling.  Some will do it with one.  Some will do it in the other.  You can't do it perfectly.  So is there any sentence we could put in there?  So you hedged on there, and probably they will, too, because it's very hard to find the right sentence.  You don't want the simple application of discretion, you say -- which inevitably means some inconsistency, to make a State rule inadequate.  On the other hand, they can't go too far.  So what is too far?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Are we supposed to still pay some attention to what we think Congress would have intended?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And if the answer is ""certainly"", how likely do you think it is that Congress would have intended its statutes, in an ordinary case where two big businesses are suing each other and they have already had a day in court and now one of them wants to appeal and Congress writes in, if you miss the deadline, you can have it extended through excusable neglect, and you can even have it extended much later if nobody got a notice.  That's with two big businesses.  But if you have someone who served his country and was wounded and has post-traumatic stress syndrome or schizophrenia, to that person, you say -- who has never had a day in court:  ""If you don't meet the deadline, you're out, no matter how excusable it is. ""  How -- who in Congress would have likely thought such a thing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is the relevance of that, if the veterans win?  I mean, perhaps they are entitled to win.  Is the idea that you would cut off their right to appeal because you are afraid they'd win?   Stephen G. Breyer  What do you mean, ""right""?  I thought within -- first of all, a donut costs a dollar, so I don't see much appeal there.  [Laughter]  But -- but don't we, throughout the statute books, try to work out from context, language, and objective purpose what a reasonable member of Congress would have intended, whether they thought about it or whether they did think about it, which would require X-rays into the brain that have not yet been invented?   Stephen G. Breyer  Bowles itself made -- made a major point, which I thought was relevant.  Though I didn't join it, I thought it was relevant.  And that is: We look at the statute, if you are looking at statute, and notice that there are exceptions written into it.  And the fact that there are exceptions written into it lends some support to the notion that we, as a court, should not read other exceptions into it that weren't mentioned.  That's something the Court seemed to emphasize.  And here, when I looked at this statute, I noticed there are no exceptions written into it.  And therefore, following Bowles rather than rejecting Bowles, it would seem that Bowles would support the reading of this statute to allow courts to read into it, because they don't mention anything themselves.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's the main thing.  Leaving that out for a second, if you -- if you thought there can't be a rule that governs all of the thousands of different, or many different statutes, you should look at the context.  So sometimes you will see that Congress, given the context, probably did want to give the court some leeway to make exceptions -- where, for example, it is no fault of the litigant -- and in other instances, they didn't.  Now you have listed -- and Bowles, I thought, left that open.  But -- but if it does leave it open, and I'm looking to those factors.  You have mentioned one: That this is a long period of time, 120 days.  You are right about that.  Is there anything else?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And what they found, one thing in the text, was that there were exceptions written in.  That cuts against you.  One thing cuts for you; that's the length of time.  Is there anything else that cuts for you?  I just want to be sure I have all of the factors that you are weighing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is supposed to happen -- and I've probably seen this on page 16 of the Federal circuit bar's amicus brief.  They list about 30 or 40 cases where the veteran perhaps was not represented, and maybe had some stress syndrome, whatever it is.  He just filed the paper in the wrong court or the wrong agency, and that agency didn't get around to returning it to him in time so he could have met this deadline.  What, in your opinion, is supposed to happen in those circumstances?  Just say, too bad, you are out of luck; here we are, you got the wrong address; no recovery?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All these cases, actually, that they have raised in the brief, the veteran does get his appeal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So they could do it again.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's good.   Stephen G. Breyer  These people in footnote 3, did they get their appeal or didn't they?   Stephen G. Breyer  They did not?  Okay.  There's a problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  So if we are in a void and the language doesn't have the exceptions -- and I think you can distinguish it from these other cases, and you have older cases that says unless Congress is clear, read it as non-jurisdictional, and nobody could say it was inequitable -- or rather to the contrary, nobody could say it was equitable to follow your position here, why isn't there a simple remedy?  We take the opposite position?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Except that for purposes of this, it governs.  I'm just looking at the parts of it that did, in fact, make clear a special nature of the particular provision at issue in that case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All these agency matters are matters where there has never been judicial input.  This is review of an agency action.  The agency takes an action.  No judge has looked at this.  And the first time that you look at the rulemaking by the agency under the Hobbs Act, I guess, is when you go file it in the -- in the court.  So if a -- if a ruling against you here were to encompass a ruling under most review of agency action, would that be such a terribly unworkable thing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

I mean, if their holding is that in the -- in your habeas hearing in State court, the evidence presented in State court at that hearing was sufficient and was required -- required that State court to find that you win on this issue, the State court in holding to the contrary is objectively unreasonable, then you win.  And why are we all here?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mention it not because it wouldn't.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's -- again, it would be helpful -- maybe you can't do this from the top of your head, but when I looked at the Ninth Circuit en banc decision, I found a long discussion on page 79 following by Chief Judge Kozinski in dissent, from which I got the impression that the majority was not saying: We think the State court decision here was unreasonable or violated clearly established law, based on the record before the State court on habeas, State habeas.  Now, you've just told me in the 70-page opinion by Judge Smith, there is a paragraph or something that says: Even were all this issue out of it, the extra evidence, we still think that looking just at the evidence before the State court, habeas, and just at their decision, we think in light of all these things you now are bringing up that that was a -- was an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, or at least was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts; in other words, satisfied (d).

Justice Scalia read the sentence on page 35.  I read the heading from what Judge Kozinski says,  ""Our Review is Limited to the Record Presented in the State Habeas Petition: That's what he said. ""  ""All right.

Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  But that's not what it said.  It said exactly what Justice Scalia said it said, so -- which is talking about the evidence coming in under (e)(2) or something.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  This is the same kind of question, but suppose I don't really know how drug companies operate.  I suspect, but I don't know, that where you have a serious drug, people are hurt all the time and they blame the drug.  So probably drug companies operate in an environment where they get all kinds of complaints and some are valid, some are not; who knows?  People are frightened.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, I don't know that.  But you say at the beginning your client says: Look, we get complaints all the time; you know, just put up with it if you buy our stock.  Now, I don't know to what extent that's true.  I don't know how that fits in.  I don't know whether their complaint is unusual or not unusual or general.  Who is supposed to decide that?  The judge at the complaint stage?  Or the judge after you get some evidence on it?  Or the jury?  And the same is true of scienter, after all, because the scienter -- and you have to plead that with particularity.  What's your answer?  What's -- I mean, Justice Kagan had an interesting view of this, and it could be that she's putting forward and others might have a different view.  Who is to decide this?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, we don't know.  You see, what they're saying is we have one respectable doctor, studier, at, you know, in Colorado.  He, by the way has an abstract, which isn't in the complaint, which says that they do allege that it's zinc that's the problem, a free zinc ion.  And they say we also have 25 people who were hurt and some burning sensations in people that didn't rise to that level.  You know, I don't know.  I don't know if that's within the range of expectation of drug companies as part of the normal course of business which investors should know about, and I suspect a district judge doesn't know, either.  So how does it work where we in fact just don't know whether this does or not arise above the background noise of a drug company?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, no, it can't be.  I'm sorry, I don't mean to take a position yet.  But, look, Albert Einstein had the theory of relativity without any empirical evidence, okay?  So we could get the greatest doctor in the world and he has dozens of theories, and the theories are very sound and all that fits in here is an allegation he now has learned that it's the free zinc ion that counts.  And that could be devastating to a drug even though there isn't one person yet who has been hurt.  So I can't see how we can say this statistical evidence always works or always doesn't work.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They did.  They said -- they said the free zinc ion was -- that word on this was told to your client by a person who knows a lot about it, is apparently reputable, and was told to a person who also knows a lot about it.  I think they're saying you ought to have been very nervous at that point.  That isn't just the usual background noise, okay?  So I'm back to my question, which is -- you can answer the other one too if you like.  But my question is: Who is supposed to decide, how?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know, and we are back to my question--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --The question is, the facts that are pleaded is -- I think it's assumed that this is above the normal background noise; they certainly argue that at length -- that there was this free zinc ion conversation, that there are 25 people who were hurt, and there is a lot of burning sensation going on, even though it doesn't rise to the level of people being hurt, and that's supported by some of the zinc sulfate studies in the fish--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Breyer  --Well, then what--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  How would you write -- look, I'm asking how do you write this, because what -- where I think where the other side has a point, is if -- with these -- this is a big class of these kinds of things, you know, vitamins, all kinds of things like that -- and if we say that they have to disclose too much, what will happen is people won't pay attention to it, you know.  And if -- if you have, you know, 4,000 pages of small print saying everything that was ever reported, what really happens in -- in such instances is the public pays no attention, and they think -- and it will hide things that are actually important.  So how would you write some words -- assuming that you're right, that their test is wrong -- but how would you write some words that will put a disclosure obligation such that it's not going to be overkill and it is going to get incidents that rise above the background noise, and those are the incidents that are -- that would be significant for a reasonable investor?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, I'll go back and read what you've just said, and -- I will, because it will be in the transcript, and -- and the -- I -- this case, you are very good, your clients, and the lawyers at writing complaints.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right?  So they've alleged in this complaint everything they can show, and I -- I suspect -- and during the class period.  And what it doesn't say is that very helpful chart that you put in the brief, in the pocket.  It doesn't say they ever showed that to the company.  All it says is there was a phone call and this individual from -- from Colorado said something, which it doesn't specify, about zinc and the -- and the number of deaths.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  I get that.  Can I just ask you one question in response to -- just picking up on the last, what about the need for a, quote, ""strong inference of scienter"", end quote, and does this complaint show more than a borderline situation where it doesn't strongly infer that the person intended to mislead the defendant?  What about that argument?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, page 49 of their brief -- they have two pages on it -- it does not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, I mean -- I just want to know why, if their inference on materiality is enough to survive the background noise reply, is it enough to show a strong inference that they did do this intending to mislead, a strong inference of scienter?

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, though--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, that's where I exactly am.  I mean, the -- the brief that I found very, very interesting is that filed by the Association of American Universities and the Advancement For Science and the Council on Education, and they seem to take the line that you are -- I don't know how far you want to pursue it.  They say the strongest analogy is with government employees, and if you look at government employees the basic rule is, the Federal Government paid for it, they should have the invention.  And the way they do it is not to deny the employee the right to have the invention, but they insist upon an assignment, assignment of an exclusive license.  And there are cases which are cited here that suggest that, even if the employee tries to run his way around that and simply goes and before the government can get it assigns the interest to a third party, that that third party assignment is void as a matter of public policy; and that the assignment to the government of the exclusive right is valid as a matter of law, a legal implication from the executive order in the circumstance.  That brings me back to where Justice Ginsburg was, and Justice Kennedy.  The analogy is so strong.  The government has paid for it.  There is a statute here that really seems to assume, though not explicitly say, that the universities will have title -- that we simply copy what happened in this other area and say that an effort to assign by the employee in contravention of what this statute takes as its basic assumption, and a contract, is void as a matter of public policy, because the exclusive license is assumed to be assumed -- to be assigned to the university, though I don't need the second part; for this case, the first part suffices.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that before the executive order or after?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I understand that.   Stephen G. Breyer  And if the employee seeks to assign to a third party in contravention of his agreement, rules and regulations, et cetera, what happens to that assignment?   Stephen G. Breyer  The facts are that he was supposed to give it to--   Stephen G. Breyer  --No, there's no -- what there is, is an agreement with the government that says any invention you will assign to the government.  That's the agreement.   Stephen G. Breyer  And now, in violation of that agreement, he assigns it to a third party.  What happens to that assignment?   Stephen G. Breyer  And what the Court said -- my reading of it, must be yours -- is in the cases they cite, that assignment to the third party is void as a matter of law because it's contrary to public policy.  That was my reading of it, and I'm questioning you about that because I might not have read it correctly.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you have -- you have here L-I v. Montgomery, Li v. Montgomery--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, am I right or not in your opinion.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, and then your clients would be out there arguing, oh, but you, see you can't assign a future interests in the fruits from black acre; I mean, you can promise to do it, but black acre isn't even around yet.  And so when somebody ran in and got those fruits, well, then now we have a fight; and in law the second person wins, and in equity maybe the first person can get an injunction.  I don't know.  But I guess people would raise that kind of argument, wouldn't they?   Stephen G. Breyer  So if fact--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --The reason it's relevant you to, of course, if that's so, Senator Bayh and Senator Dole passed a law which could so easily be subverted by individual inventions and third-party companies that there might be a large class of cases where neither the university nor the government would actually get much of a benefit from research that the taxpayer had funded.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because most people perhaps thought that they had made a valid assignment.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But it's also remarkable the other way, that here we have many statutes that took the principle that when the government pays for an invention, the invention vests in the government.  Now, there's that statute, that background.  Not all of them, but some.  NASA, various others.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right, that's fine.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, I know that; I know that; that isn't my point.   Stephen G. Breyer  My point is that it's somewhat remarkable because of this new statute, now that happens to only to inventions in those areas that are inventions of the contractor who, by the way, invents nothing.  Human beings invent things, not entities like universities.   Stephen G. Breyer  And on your view what that means is it applies to nothing.  It only applies to those things that the contractor freely or not freely decides to get from his employee -- if he uses the right words and so forth.  That also seems a little surprising, that there could be such a hole in what used to be public ownership of such matters.  I'm not -- I don't mean to be -- I started off sounding a little sarcastic.  I didn't mean to be.  I mean to be -- serious question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Your answer is not as bad as I think.   Stephen G. Breyer  And -- okay.  Now.  [Laughter]  What about -- what about the provision that says there shall be -- this is a provision of the law, that the universities are supposed to enter into contracts, funding contracts with the government to make this thing effective.  Hmm -- effective.  Effective for what?  Effective just to apply to some of the things that universities got money to pay for?  Or to a lot of them, to all of them?   ",09-1159
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Actually, there is.  I mean, I -- it seemed to me when I read this, it sounded a little familiar, and I think whoever wrote it in Arizona copied it out of the Administrative Procedure Act.  I mean, you read the definition of ""license"" in the Administrative Procedure Act and this is awfully close.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's right.  It might have meant something different; Congress might have.  But what is, then -- I read the SCIU brief.  I thought that was pretty interesting.  Is that something you adopt as what the Congress did mean?  I mean, what do you think Congress did mean, and what evidence is there?  If it didn't mean the APA definition, what evidence is there for that?   INTERRUPTING ",09-115X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The main -- the main anomaly it seemed to me to be this, that in the Federal Act, as -- that was the first point that the Chamber made, that it's a fairly careful balance.  There are a group of people in Arizona, they may look as if they come from Mexico or speak with an Hispanic accent, and you are not certain whether they in fact are illegals or that they are legal.  Now, think of that category.  Congress has passed a statute that gives the employer just as much incentive to verify, so there is no discrimination, as to dismiss, so there is no illegal hiring.  It's absolutely balanced.  A $1,000 fine for the one, a $1,000 fine for the other.  So Arizona comes along and says: I'll tell you what, if you discriminate, you know what happens to you, nothing?  But if you hire an illegal immigrant, your business is dead.  That's just one thing they do.  Now, how can you reconcile that intent to prevent discrimination against people because of their appearance or accent -- how do you reconcile that with Arizona's law?  If you are a businessman, every incentive under that law is to call close questions against hiring this person.  Under the Federal law every incentive is to look at it carefully.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is the I-9 -- I do have a question on the I-9.  I'm not certain.  I thought under Federal law that if the employee -- the employer isn't certain, but the employee says, here's my Social Security card, here's the driver's license.  The employer looks at that, he's home free, is that right?  But under Federal -- under your law, under Arizona law, he's not home free, and, moreover -- because he -- it may -- he's not home free, he still could be prosecuted.  Is that right or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  So if shows the driver's license under -- under Arizona law, if the -- if he shows a driver's license and Social Security card, the worker, the employer looks at it, the employer cannot be prosecuted?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes or no?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So -- I thought in reading it that it creates some kind of presumption, but he's not home free?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But under Federal law he is home free.   Stephen G. Breyer  So then he's home free?  Look, I don't -- I'm trying to understand.  Maybe there is not enough time to explain it, but I thought Federal law requires this E-9 business or whatever that E review is.  And I was worried about the E review which it seemed to require because it seemed to me in 20 percent of the cases where the notice is, this guy is not authorized; we don't have any record that he is authorized to work -- 20 percent of those are wrong and he is authorized to work.  So the employer who follows that is really going to fire 20 percent of the people who will be absolutely entitled to work.  And so I would just like to you address those points, as you wish.   Stephen G. Breyer  If they fail to do it, then they cannot receive any, quote,  ""grant, loan, or performance-based incentive. ""  end quote, from the State.  That's what the law says, isn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  I would think that the answer to Justice Scalia's question is, yes, there is that penalty.  It isn't simply hortatory.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You don't go to jail.  What you do is you lose any grant, loan, or performance-based incentive.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what I was looking at specifically is ""Federal law says"".  If you look at the driver's license and Social Security card, those are I-9 docs.  Then the employer has established an affirmative defense and has not violated the law.  That's what it says at cite 27A, okay?  That is the Federal law.  Arizona law that I was reading -- maybe there's another place I should read -- is it says, in determining whether there is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider the Federal government's determination.  It creates a rebuttable presumption.  That means it might be rebutted.  Okay.  So I see a difference there.  And the reason that that's relevant is because of my first question.  If you are an employer, prior to your law, it's 50/50.  I better verify because if I am discriminating, you know, da, da, da, and it's not that hard.  I just look at the drivers' license and I look at -- and I'm home free, and the Social Security card, and if I hire an illegal immigrant, the same thing, da, da, da.  Okay?  So same both ways.  So, your law.  Employer, look at the driver's license and Social Security, you are not home free.  Employer, if it turns out that you have been hiring this illegal immigrant and he's not an American, your business is finished.  But what happens if I discriminate, under our law?  Nothing.  Now, that is the original point they made.  That's why I brought up this question of difference in standards.  And I want to be absolutely clear what your answer to that is.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, where?  Where is it in the statute, then?  Because what I read were the words ""rebuttable presumption"", and I might be reading the wrong words.  So tell me where it is.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, thank you.  I see that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But the main point -- I will check that.  But I think maybe I was mistaken, perhaps, and that I was looking at the other section.   Stephen G. Breyer  But then we are still stuck with this enormous discrepancy in penalty.  I mean, I'm characterizing it as enormous, but it seems like, you know, it's even on discrimination versus under the Federal law.  It's not even, your business is out to lunch, gone and on the other side it has nothing.  What about that one?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The savings clause itself, the word licensing, not everyone looks at this, but I did look at the legislative history and when you look at that paragraph on page 39 of the red brief, it seems to me that that paragraph says what it means.  It says precisely what it is.  It says -- the first thing it says is that, look, if you are found to have violated this.  Where is it?  It's page, there it is.  Suppose somebody's been found to have violated the sanctions provision in the Federal legislation.  He has been found by the Federal Government, then what the State does, it can revoke his license.  Okay.  That's one thing.  And the second thing it says, it doesn't want to preempt fitness to do business laws, such as State farm labor contracting laws or forestry laws.  In other words, its thinking of some precise set of licenses.  And that's why this licensing thing was there and the very next participant of this Federal law are conforming amendments and those conforming amendments apply.  The departments of government that were concerned with maintaining State farm labor contractual laws.  Now, I grant you, you have to go beyond the text, but some of us do because we get enlightenment.  And going beyond that text, it seems to me we should go follow what that house report says.  Now, what is your response to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I said yes, I got broad licensing -- but let's deal with the part where you look at their explanation as to why they put those words there.   INTERRUPTING ",09-115X

Breyer  I mean, if Crooker was interpreting section 2, that was the interpretation.  If everyone had followed it, every court, nobody disagreed.  All your four arguments Judge Edwards went into thoroughly.  Everyone but Judge Wilkie approved it.  And so Congress reads that, and they make it specific in 7 but they say nothing about 2.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How do you know, what we have is 7 E in front of us?  7 E says we want to be sure something like Crooker's interpretation of 2 applies for law enforcement.  It's simply a case -- so they apply it with law enforcement.  Absolutely now it's guaranteed.  Crooker is not guaranteed because it could be overturned.  You never know what will happen.  But what in that suggests they don't want Crooker to apply to the Fed for example, or to the Navy, which is here storing -- it's here storing explosives.  Why would -- I can't get anything one way or the other from the fact they passed 7.  Why should I get one rather than the other?  For every argument you make, I can see an argument on the other side that they make.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's your answer to that?  It was a question, really.   Stephen G. Breyer  What do you want to know?  How wide the corridors are in some Federal buildings, and terrorists could use that to bad purpose, but we want to give it to the firemen because they will use it for a good purpose.  We want the policemen to know, we want different civic groups sometimes to know, but we want to keep a limitation.  We want it restricted, restricted to minimize the chance it will get into the wrong hands.  I don't see anything illogical about that.  What's illogical about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's a different argument.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, your four arguments seem to me to be the same arguments that Judge Edwards in the D.C. Circuit considered, and they are excellent arguments, and there are arguments on both sides, and then they considered it and came to a conclusion.  But this is a different argument you are making here and I was addressing that.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, it's only addressed from law enforcement.  It's -- there are many dangerous -- for example, this isn't law enforcement; this is munitions.  The Navy thinks, rightly or wrongly, I guess you can -- that they don't want these maps circulated because they think it would make it easier to blow up the munitions.  They want the firemen to have them, they want the civil defense workers to have them, but they don't want people who might blow them up to have them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's -- that's their reasoning.  Now, that isn't addressed, it seems to me, in 7, because 7 deals with law enforcement.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How is it -- how is it broader?  I looked for the words.  I just missed them, and you can point them out.  When I read about the circumvention, what Crooker says is:  ""We hold that since the document for which disclosure is sought meets the test of predominant internality and since its disclosure significantly risks circumvention of Federal statutes or regulations, it is exempt. ""  It didn't say anything about circumvention because there is a regulated entity and it is that regulated entity that we'll circumvent.  It just spoke of circumvention, as far as I saw.  But maybe there's another place where it talks about regulated entity.  Is there?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's correct, and I didn't find anything in Crooker that said -- and I don't know why you would have such a theory.  I don't know what the point of the theory would be, that you would care whether blowing up took place by somebody who technically was regulated by the Navy or blowing up took place by some other person, whom they are worried about.

And now you want to show that to the firemen but you don't want it to be in the newspaper.  Right?  And the firemen don't have classifications and they were not cleared.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I guess in order to see it they would have to be cleared.   Stephen G. Breyer  How long does it take, approximately, roughly, to clear a fireman so that he could, in fact, see the evacuation manual from the Federal building.   Stephen G. Breyer  Could you give me a rough idea?   Stephen G. Breyer  You couldn't return to Congress if you had to classify documents falling into the category that you previously thought, dealt with in Crooker.  How long would that take?  How many documents would you guess there were in the Federal government?  Millions?  Thousands?   Stephen G. Breyer  That wasn't my question.  My question did not concern those documents that were requested.  It concerns the documents that might be requested, which is every document that might be requested.

He can go to the judge and say: Judge, I want you to reconsider your procedural ruling in light of the fact I'm here.  How does the situation I have just sketched differ from this one?  I mean, you have a client who's coming to the litigation late.  He's separate from the litigation, I know, but he could send a representative to the judge and say: Judge, I want you to reconsider in light of the fact I'm joining.  Now, I know I'm not joining; in fact, I'm bringing a different case.  But I'm thinking of the -- of the Chief Justice's hypo here and I'm -- and I'm trying to apply it.

He has about two paragraphs and as you read that two paragraphs, it sounds as if overcrowding is a big, big cause of this problem, which is horrendous, which if you think it's accurately described in the mental case in the first page, two paragraphs, if that's a fair description from the record, it's a horrendous problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What the receiver says is overcrowding is a big cause of it and then he says, “I think we have discovered you actually can provide care, and certainly our plan and turnaround plan believes we can provide constitutional levels of care, no matter what the population is.”  So then you look to the care and turnaround plan and it says, “spend $8 billion building more buildings and then the legislature rejected it.”  Okay?  Now, there we are.  More time, what's supposed to happen?   Stephen G. Breyer  That was 2.31 or something like that.   Stephen G. Breyer  And did they approve the 2.3?  Is that in place, 2.35?  Did they approve that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  So he said, “we need eight, we need eight and they approved 2.35.”   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

However, that is not equivalent to a conclusion that that current compromise will result in sustainable constitutional healthcare at current population density levels.  That's what he said about it.  So we have his views and I'm back to my question, what else is supposed to happen, which was your question initially?   Stephen G. Breyer  Where do I look at to find this?  It's a big record.  What I did was I -- it refers to on-line evidence and I went and looked at the pictures, and the pictures are pretty horrendous to me and I would say page 10 of the religious group's brief, for example, shows you one of them and what they are saying is, it's -- it's obvious, just look at it.  You cannot have mental health facilities that will stop people from killing themselves and you cannot have medical facilities that will stop staph and tubercular infection in conditions like this and then you look at them and you've looked at them.  I have looked at them and what is the answer to that?  There is nothing in here that -- the special master said $8 billion is the answer, and they haven't come close.  So how can I or you if you were in my position, what would you say in an opinion that says that these three judges who have 200 pages of findings, what would you say to, to -- as an answer to what I just said?

Breyer  35,000, and this could be done safely.   Stephen G. Breyer  Preceding page, whatever that was, 253.   Stephen G. Breyer  There are about six pages where they summarize evidence from all kinds of criminologists that say, for example, there are 17,000 technical parole violators that are being sent to prison who haven't committed additional crimes and they could perhaps be released from some of the time that they're spending in prison.  Then they go on to this good time, which would, I guess, lead to people who are 50 years old or 60 years old who have been in prison for 40 years would be released at age 55 instead of age 75, I guess there is some category there.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then they had several other things.  Okay, now what are some facts about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any –   Stephen G.

Okay, that seems to be the gamut.  Is there any evidence, statistically or otherwise because it used to be that States did rely on halfway houses, it relied upon, they relied upon -- they relied upon certain camps -- prison camps, for example -- and some of them were pretty tough and there were a whole range of what used to be called intermediate punishments.

Breyer  Well, the police say, oh, I don't want to get a warrant.  It's such a bore.  We have other things to do.  I have a great idea; let's knock at the door, and then as soon as he starts moving around, I know what he's going to the -- going into the bathroom means, and we'll hear that, and we'll be able to get in.  Hey, great idea.  Okay.  Now suppose that's the record.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I mean to add: And in fact, there's probable cause.   Stephen G. Breyer  In addition, he smelled the marijuana.  I just was trying to stick to the relevant points.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  I add that to the hypothetical.   Stephen G. Breyer  Correct.  That's what I mean, and I don't always spell it out.   ",09-1272
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So you agree that -- that the court below is wrong because what they say as I read it is irrespective of how reasonably the police behave, if it is reasonably foreseeable that their tactic will create exigent circumstances -- and I would think it's reasonably foreseeable when you knock on the door very politely and say ""the police"" that somebody might shout out ""hide the pot"", all right?  That if that's reasonable foreseeable, says the court, then that violates the Fourth Amendment.  But we have the Second Circuit that says as long as the police behaved unlawfully -- it -- lawfully, lawfully, it does not violate the Fourth Amendment; and we have the First Circuit that has some kind of bad faith test plus an unreasonable or improper test; and we have the Fourth and Eighth circuits that yet have some different kind of test.  And one of the things I would be interested in hearing your view on at some point is just what the Chief Justice said; that assuming from your point of view this is a hypothetical case, nonetheless we would like your view on which of those tests or some other test is the appropriate test and why.  That was the question he started with, and Justice Kennedy started with, and I also would be interested in your view on that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you said -- just add on to that.  Look, the question presented that they raised which of the five tests currently being used by the U.S. court of appeals is proper?  Now, you've said something about your view on that, but I would like you to say anything else you would like to say about that: Which of the five tests or some sixth test if you like, and you tell me the words that you like us to use when we answer that question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Which is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no.  But the test you're using there, the key word there is unreasonable.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, and the reason you choose the word ""unreasonable"" rather than the Second Circuit's test of ""unlawful"" is?   Stephen G. Breyer  Your test, it's -- it's not wild.  It just says unreasonable in the Fourth Amendment.  Probably when they act lawfully, they are acting reasonably and not unreasonably, but it could be sometimes they're not.  That's your view?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No test.  All right.   ",09-1272

So what are they supposed to do if they're right?  How do they get the money?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm interested in procedurally what are they supposed to do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Breyer  Why can't they -- can they, for example, file a claim with the -- with the Secretary and say: We would like the Secretary to order them to give us the money; they're violating this?  They go to an administrative law judge.  Is there an administrative remedy of some kind that would be reviewable in the courts for reasonableness?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So why is it reasonable, then, to think that the Secretary would have entered into a contract which is going to benefit them and there's no remedy?   Stephen G. Breyer  But normally under the law from Marbury v. Madison onward, where there's a wrong, there's a remedy.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the remedy could be administrative, could be judicial, et cetera.  But you're saying there's none?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But in such cases, there very often is an administrative remedy--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and the person always -- any individual in the United States can go ask any agency to do anything, and there is even review in instances of a refusal to withhold -- a withholding of action.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there here?  You said there was.   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose that the State of California says we would like our counties to be able to enforce this.  Then what happens?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, suppose that California -- if California wants to say, we could bring this suit like Massachusetts did, you agree, they could.  And then they say, all right, but we don't have the time; we want the counties to do it.  Couldn't they do that?   Stephen G. Breyer  What's the difference between a State doing its itself through its attorney general and the State saying we would like the county to do it through its county attorney?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  California comes to you tomorrow and says, the attorney general says, you know, this is a problem, you don't have time to enforce this, there should be some enforcement and we want to enforce it, and, moreover, we would like each county affected to enforce it.  Do you have the authority?  Is there any reason you wouldn't say go ahead?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm trying to analogize it to the Massachusetts one.  You say they can just go ahead and do it, and they say: You know, Santa Clara County is just as big as Rhode Island.  And you say the AG of Rhode Island can bring the suit, am I right?  And so why can't the -- why can't Santa Clara do it?   INTERRUPTING ",09-1273

Pretty unlikely that they intend the consumers who are intended to benefit to be able to have a lawsuit.  And I think, well, gee, I don't know.  What the Government is arguing is, sure, the point you make favors you.  They say there are two major points here that favor them about background.  I want to hear what your reply is.  One of them is Congress, in the statute it incorporated here, didn't want a private person to be able to enforce it.  And the second one is it is going to create a mess.  All right?  So they say those are two background features here that favor them.  So what's your response?   Stephen G. Breyer  What do you think about -- is the -- I'm not sure I'm right at all here, but as I understand the development of this argument today, it is open to you and the other 57 counties to go to the State AG, and you say, you bring the lawsuit, okay?

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Are there any examples that you have?  That is, in the last 35 years have there been any instance where the Justice Department or some other law enforcement agency compiled a file for law enforcement purposes, that in that file there were, for whatever reasons, a bunch of conversations about the organization's strategy, and it did not interfere to release it with -- with anybody's personal privacy, but it might interfere with that organization's strategy, so the organization, whatever it was, the NRDC or something, was very upset about it?  Did you find a single example or a thousand examples?  Or how many examples did you find of that happening?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, one reason might be that this has really never been a problem because all the legitimate -- or most of them, anyway -- that these organizations that have interests in privacy are actually taken care of by the other 17 exemptions here.   Stephen G. Breyer  This may be the first.  That's why I want to know, is there -- one of the things you would have looked for is an example of a real problem of the kind you're talking about.  I'm not saying you don't have one.  I would just like to know if you found any, and what they are, so I could read them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  One possible reason you don't find them is because it is very rare that a law enforcement agency is going to try to subpoena the top strategy of the -- of the NRDC, confidential strategy.  There might not be too many such records.  It -- another reason might be that they don't really care.  Another reason might be -- I don't know.  But if you haven't found any examples, what we're back to -- or -- and maybe there are actual examples of that -- of what you said to Justice Ginsburg of the other instance, where the -- what was that first one?

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The two questions I would have is, first of all -- Justice Sotomayor, sorry; I didn't -- I did have her question, because what that suggests is in this case it's not unfair to hold your client in this case, and you just read the two Circuit Court opinions here and you think this is a defense coming out of long in the past that doesn't have much substance to it.  That was her question, I think, as I understood it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, it's not unfair.  But let me give you the other question because some time in your argument I would like you to get to that.  And that is, if we accept as a principle of law what was said in Reynolds, a criminal case or whatever, and apply it to government contracting, where sophisticated contractors are perfectly capable of negotiating their own contract, we are not just throwing a monkey wrench into the gears of government contracting; we're throwing the whole monkey.  That's my second question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  One, this isn't a case that calls for it; and, two, the threat to government contracting by changing from Reynolds to here is overwhelming.  Now, I would like your views on both of those.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's exactly my problem, because when I looked at Reynolds, Reynolds doesn't hold anything in your favor.  It holds the opposite way.  It says to you, in a criminal case, we said it was unconscionable for the government both to prosecute and not to -- not to tell them a secret, okay?  And it says such a rationale has no application in a civil forum where the government is not the moving party.  It doesn't say anything about where the government is the moving party.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And Exhibit A that it is not unconscionable here consists of the two opinions of the Federal Circuit.  I mean, now, what do you want me to read to get over that impression?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It didn't limit it.  It said the rationale is unconscionable.  Now, I don't even have to go that far.  I can go to ""fundamentally unfair"".  All I want to know is what should I read to get over my unfortunate impression, which I got out of the two opinions that I did read, that there was nothing unfair?  Okay?  What do you want me to read to get over that impression--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --which I think you do want me to read something.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So it isn't -- isn't a big practical problem.  Let me ask, then I was -- misimpression.  Would you go back to Justice Kennedy's question for a minute.  I'm -- I -- I don't quite see, if you would discuss it a little bit, how you do this as a matter of constitutional law, because the Due Process Clause is tied to fundamental unfairness, and I think the answer has to be in this kind of circumstance secret bloc or not, it depends, it depends on many things.  So, would you write this as a matter of constitutional law?  Would it -- shouldn't it be written as a matter of Federal common law of contracts?  Shouldn't it be written as an exposition of the superior knowledge doctrine, which seems totally open to it?  And -- or shouldn't it be written as a matter of discovery law, which is what the district judge who ended up thinking -- the Court of Claims judge says, gee, I don't really know.  I mean, that's how I read it.  How would you -- would you speak about this for a minute?   ",09-1298

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can I -- I'm trying this question out.  Try to give me your best answer.  If I don't have it clear enough, just forgive it and go on to another.  As I'm understanding this case with Basic, the idea is there is a presumption.  Somebody lies and says there's an oil well I found oil in.  A lot of people buy on the stock market.  It turns out there was no oil, and a lot of people say they lost money.  All right.  The point of the stock market presumption is to say: Smith, you're a typical plaintiff and this presumption is going to help you by the following.  We're going to say what happened to the typical person on the stock market during that period happened to you, and there are a lot of people who bought and sold on the stork market.  And that's why efficient markets is needed to show at the certification stage, because if there weren't certification -- if that isn't shown, the whole thing falls apart.  But what you're just saying on terms of whether the revelation lowered the price has nothing to do with the question of what happened to the typical person, Smith, happened to you, nothing to do with it.  It has to do with whether anybody was hurt.  Now, that has nothing to do with the certification stage.  That's the win or lose stage.  Now, that's how I'm understanding it at the moment.  So what's wrong with the way I understand it?   ",09-1403
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is -- is it right that the Rules Committee then changed it, and it basically said the way the defendant here thinks it should be is that's what it should be?  Isn't that what happened?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay -- now--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --The Rules Committee said count calendar days.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They changed the rule.   Stephen G. Breyer  And now you think that the Federal courts are right in saying, judge, when you have a Speedy Trial Act case, look to Rule 45; you think that's right to do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So why shouldn't this defendant whose case was on appeal get the advantage of that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know it was under a different rule.  But where -- normally with cases where you have a new rule come in, it does apply to the advantage of the people who were then on appeal.  Is there something special about this, that Federal rules don't, or you just -- too bad, we thought it was a really erroneous thing that they had, we used to have, and we've corrected it, but just -- he's still on appeal, it doesn't apply to him?  Is there some law on that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I understand.  I understand they followed the rule at the time.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They've changed the rule.  His case is still on appeal.  Why shouldn't he get the advantage of the new rule?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It wasn't anybody's fault.  Why shouldn't we go back and say do it again, and now, let's -- since his case is still on appeal, it's the same question.  What's the argument against doing that?  Why can't we?  I'm sure there's some rule out there that says we can't do this, but I want to know what it is because it seems fair.   Stephen G. Breyer  Any other reason?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, I'm thinking that we normally -- although all this is quite true, what Justice Scalia says, normally we do apply new rules to those who are on appeal at the time.   ",09-1498
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  It matters because the trial judges have to know what to do, and while your reading might fit the language in ordinary English better, I think it does.  It's also possible to read those words ""delay resulting from"" as simply referring to a period of time; and the statute is saying these periods of time are excluded from accounting.  Now, the virtue of that is just what Justice Ginsburg started with; all the trial judges know how to do it; the lawyers don't get mixed up; and the problem with what you're arguing for, in my mind -- if you want to say anything more about it, do -- is that it seems very unworkable to strike trying to figure out what causes what.   ",09-1498
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What do you mean?  How could it possibly be admissible.  First, there has to be a degree of formality, as the Court held in Hammon, sitting in the kitchen; and second, it has to satisfy State hearsay tests.  So unless it's an exception to the hearsay rule, it is not admissible.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, of course there are exceptions.  There could, in fact, there could be a coconspirator exception.  There could be a dying declaration exception, but what we are talking about is whether the Constitution keeps it out, even though State law -- because, say it's a coconspirator exception -- would permit it in.  So the answer is no, it's not the case that whenever you come across a victim of a crime and ask him questions, it's going to be admissible.  It depends.  The State hears the law, the exception, and whether there is a degree of formality, as there would in Hammon.   Stephen G. Breyer  It would not apply?  There are -- there isn't a Federal hearsay rule?  And there are not exceptions that you have to satisfy?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I thought there were, in my copy of the Federal Rules of Evidence.   ",09-150X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  If -- what keeps that out?  I mean, assuming that a State law or Federal Rules of Evidence admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule, why should the Confrontation Clause bar it?  There is not great likelihood that like Sir Walter Raleigh or Cobham's affidavit is going to be introduced, per se, into the trial as a form of evidence that there was -- why would we want to keep it out?  That is the part that I do not understand.   Stephen G. Breyer  Under the Federal Constitution?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose I think he did it.   Stephen G. Breyer  I would like to hear your answer because I don't think we decided it in Crawford.   Stephen G. Breyer  Does it mean, does it mean that the individual is thinking this may be used -- there is a certain formality of the situation, it may be used at trial or it may just happen to turn out?  What is the relevance of the formality of the situation?  When I looked into history I thought -- I'm not an expert in history -- and I'm also understand that have been situations where the Court's gone back to prior cases and looked at footnotes and said it doesn't express things precisely clearly and changed it a little bit.  I think that that all could be open to us.  So I want to know what the basic reason is that would justify keeping out, let's say an investigation.  There is an investigation of a crime, and a policeman comes across a confederate who makes some statements just generally that help the investigation, therefore it would come in as co-conspiracy, okay?  What in the Constitution, what functional principle is there that says we should keep that out of Court?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is it all hearsay?  Now all hearsay evidence, despite State or Federal rule makers saying there are exceptions where the trustworthiness is sufficient, such as co-confederates -- confederates, all of that is wiped out by Crawford?   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course what I'm looking for now is whether there is any sense to that?  What is the constitutional rationale?  I agree on joining Crawford, but I have to admit to you I have had many second thoughts when I've seen how far it has extended as I have written it.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's the value of just what I'm looking for.  What I'm looking for is I can go into Blackstone a little bit and look back and see what this was after, was the problem of Sir Walter Raleigh's trial and the Marion judges, and now what I need is a line.  Because if I can't find a line, then what we've done would seem just as wrong to me, is suddenly bar virtually all hearsay exception evidence of which for 400 years, or 200 years anyway, there has been quite a lot in the courts.   Stephen G. Breyer  What, in your view, is the correct line and why, most importantly why?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any -- I'll try to -- I think you're just -- you don't like my -- where I'm coming from, and so you might not have an answer to this.  But -- but in my mind, I see a line, and that line is dividing what I think of as the Confrontation Clause, Sir Walter Raleigh situation, which I have in my mind as people going into a room and saying, ""now write out your testimony"", and they write it out in the form of an affidavit, or they send in a letter, and they say ""bye"", and then they walk next door to the trial and introduce it.  I mean, that's Walter Raleigh, in my mind.  And then on the other side of the line is an evidentiary rules that are basically in State cases run by the State.  And they sometimes let hearsay in and they sometimes don't, and they make reliability et cetera judgments in developing their -- their decision as to how hearsay exceptions will work.  Okay?  Now why don't I like emergency to draw that?  The reason I don't like the word emergency is I think police do lots of things other than handle emergency and develop testimony.  There is a range of things that you would describe as investigating the circumstance.  There is no danger.  There have been a string of robberies.  They go around and ask the grocery store people and everything what happened.  Now I don't know why we should keep out evidence that say, is given in that situation by a confederate.  It turns out he was the assistant -- why?  And if I don't like that, I don't like the emergency rule as doing the -- as doing the work there, and I'm looking for something else.  Now you have my whole train of thought.  If you want to say Judge, there is nothing but the emergency rule, you are perfectly free to say it.   Stephen G. Breyer  They're not.  They are just asking -- all right.  Yes.  Go ahead.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, just -- but in the past that situation you are describing arose only where there was a hearsay exception.  I would imagine most likely it would be the case of a confederate, someone who was part of the conspiracy.  So if I think if that is going to be the case, it probably will be admissible where this has bite.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And there be some others, excited utterances may be another.  Dying declarations are probably few and far between.  Baptismal certificates?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know they did.  And what I'm saying is I'm finding that -- it seems to me that line if taken literally would keep out exceptions to hearsay testimony, which have been well established in the United States for 200 years.  Baptismal certificates, statements of birth.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Confederates is the one I come back to.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, okay.  I forgot.   Stephen G. Breyer  Many -- I mean, like many cases there is language that can take us far afield from the subject matter before us.  And I will admit that I did not foresee the scope of Crawford.  So I'm really asking about that scope, and in particular, whether looking to the past or to reason, or to whatever you want, there is a good reason for keeping out the testimony of say a coconfederate, a coconspirator -- where it was elicited, not with intent to introduce it into the courtroom, but it was elicited in the course of an ordinary investigation of a crime.

That's all we can look at.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's her point.  You can respond to that if you want.   Stephen G. Breyer  She says there is a reason.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  It's my understanding here that -- that the problem in this case -- tell me if I'm wrong -- is because cocaine can become -- can be a salt.  People sniff it often, I guess, if it's a salt.  And that's bad.  And then there's a kind that's worse, that's freebase or crack, and that isn't a salt and it isn't a poodle and it isn't an acid.  It takes a base form, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  And so that's why they have a higher punishment.  Then the odd problem is that maybe a cocaine leaf, but certainly cocaine paste, which are more primitive forms, also have a chemical-based solution, they too.  So they've written this statute that sounds like -- that sounds like  ""Who's your father's son who's not your brother? ""  It takes a long time to figure it out.  All right.  So would you have an objection -- and I wonder if the other side would have an objection -- if what we said this word (iii) means is that it is cocaine in the chemical form of a base after it has been processed beyond the stage of coca paste?  And that's how we read it.  That would seem to exempt the things they're most worried about, the paste and the leaves.  And I'm not going to repeat the same stupid joke, poodles and fruits, but you see the point.  Is there any objection from the point of the government to define it in that way, or the other side?  And why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I don't care how it was made.  All we do is test it.  Now, all we have to do is test it, and then we look to see if it's a leaf.  That isn't tough, I don't think.  And then we have to look and see if it's this yellow stuff that looks like paste, and I guess that isn't too tough, either.  So those are the only things you have to do.  You have to test it, look and see if it's a leaf, look and see if it's a paste.  Now, even the -- I mean, I say ""even"".  I mean, certainly the DEA could do that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Certainly they could, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, that's what I want to know.   Stephen G. Breyer  We got that part.  Right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's fine.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can you make it in--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But you define it in your brief, and this is very interesting to me -- you talk about it being a yellow substance that came directly from grinding up leaves, something like that.  You have the definition there.  It's written.  Take that definition that you wrote, and what you've said that's very interesting to me that I would like to know, is that, that substance, in some significant amount of time is actually more addictive, more dangerous than the salt, which is ordinarily sniffed?  Now, is that what you're saying, because I received from this material the contrary impression.  I had the impression that the yellow paste that comes from the leaf directly is, if anything, less addictive and less harmful, if anything, than the salt which you sniff.  Now, which is it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or if--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Go ahead.   Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Before you get into that, I have a question that there may be an obvious answer to, but I haven't found it.  My understanding is -- it's a standing question.  My understanding is that they are asking as relief, and the only relief they ask for, is to raise the taxes of a competitor.  Am I right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  If that's correct, I have found no case that -- I haven't looked that hard, but certainly no case in this Court -- that said there is standing for a firm to challenge the taxes of a competitor where the remedy is: Raise his taxes.  If there were standing for such a thing, it would -- I'm surprised that there aren't competitors all over the country doing business out of State bringing diversity cases in Federal court, saying: My competitor's taxes should increase; it's all very complicated, but the Commissioner didn't properly follow State law.  Now, I have found no case, certainly not in this Court, which said: Where all you want is to raise the tax of a competitor, you have standing.  So perhaps this is well-settled that you can do it, but I thought I would raise that for both of you at the beginning in case there is something you want to say about it, which might save me a little time looking it all up.   Stephen G. Breyer  I have no doubt, and the standing rule I think is clear, that if we're saying because I am injured, and they have injury, you can't -- you must give me reduction in my tax.  That's what those cases say.  I have no problem with that.  Absolutely clear.  You can do it.  But where all you want is to raise somebody else's taxes, that I had thought -- and probably wrongly, but I had thought there is a prudential standing rule that says you cannot bring such a lawsuit.  And I don't see why you should be able to.  It seems to me it would be a nightmare if you could, which doesn't surprise.  So there we are.  That's the question.  And you will tell me: No, it's all clear; they can do it.  And I would like some citation or something and explain why they should be able to do it.  But you don't want to, anyway.  It's really for them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there anything -- I see in their complaint, they ask for  ""such other relief to which plaintiffs are entitled. ""  and therefore the judge, despite what they say, might just say: Well what you are entitled to is you are entitled to pay fewer taxes.  Is that a plausible thing, in which case it would interfere with the revenue collection of the State.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is -- what's your -- you better give me your accurate assessment, not just agree with me, because I would like to know what you -- I want to know both sides.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But I have no idea -- why I am asking the question is I have no idea or little idea of the underlying State law merits.  And my suspicion is in about 10 or 15 minutes I will hear that the State law merits are such that it's virtually impossible that they are going to say to us: Pay fewer taxes.  Rather they will say to our competitors: Pay more taxes.  So now is your chance to reply to that hypothetical argument just in case they make it.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING ",09-223X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's all right.  It's in the jurisdictional amount.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They might want to -- in all the Court's cases, the challenger wanted -- he said: I don't care; either make them pay or give me my money back.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So that -- that should be your case, I would have thought.  But you're not saying it so you can get into Federal court.  Now, that's how I read it.  And that seems -- that's worrying to me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The Establishment Clause, I would add, there is a lot of reason for thinking it's special in respect to standing, because there is no other way to challenge the Establishment Clause.  And that is a long-festering disagreement within this Court, but I'm not sure you can apply these rules to everything else.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you see what is worrying me.  What's worrying me is, is there are businesses all over the country and there's Federal tax law, too.  And suddenly people begin to think: Hey, this is a terrific idea; I am going to go through my competitor's tax returns and I will discover taxes they should have paid but didn't, and all of a sudden we will face a lot of lawsuits challenging other people's taxes.  That's what is worrying.   Stephen G. Breyer  And this is not true of the other cases.  What do you think of the other half of their argument?  I'll have to think about the standing thing to see if I want to press it or not.  But the other half is: Look at your case.  Your case would just be like -- just like the other cases, if you just said: Give us a refund, as they did in the other cases.  But you haven't said that, because that would run afoul of the Tax Injunction Act.  Rather, what you have said is: Raise their taxes.  So the point of the State is: Now, wait a minute.  Leaving all of the things aside, you asked for other appropriate relief, and it's highly probable in such situations that a Court could -- would say: Give them the exemption.  And if it's going to say, give them the exemption, hey, this is now not within Hibbs.  So what's your response to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  There's a lot of things they could say--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Of course.  Of course.  Absolutely right.  That's what worrying me.  That isn't the answer.  That's the question.  And -- and the -- it's what Justice Kennedy said in respect to discrimination problems.  Usually, either remedy is at issue.  You can't control the remedy because you asked for all other appropriate relief.  Ergo, it falls afoul of the Tax Injunction Act.  What's your response to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You didn't ask only for the other relief.  You asked for such other relief to which plaintiffs are entitled.  And what they say -- now I repeat the argument.  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  So then, in your opinion, your next-door law firm, next to you, brings a case and says: Mr. Fitch should pay $1,000 more taxes next year because he deducted $2,000 that was illegal.  You see that?  You see?  Now I'm trying to bring it home.  There is something wrong with this picture, and I can't quite put my finger on it.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, your next-door neighbor in your business, which would be a competing law firm.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But they don't actually bring you into the case.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or why isn't this a Hibbs?  You read the -- clearly the other side says to read the footnote, not as destroying the comity principle.  You know, this is right on the merits.  It still exists, comity.  And you say a strong case for withholding the -- the Federal court's jurisdiction on grounds of comity or withhold -- not hearing the case, is the natural remedy -- which is to give you a refund -- is available in State court.  Go apply for a refund.  No problem.  And that -- and the answer, you know, and then you don't get into all the problem of trying to assess somebody else's liability, et cetera.  What is wrong with that, precisely?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  So not give it -- up to the State?  You could say give us a refund or raise their taxes, one or the other.  What's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If doesn't solve the problem for you if you get a refund?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, no, no, you have it, too -- they -- they work it out, so it equally applies to everybody including your clients, so you are all on the same footing.

Breyer  Have you ever driven a car where your wife has said turn left and you've turned right?  [Laughter]  Has that ever happened to you?   Stephen G. Breyer  Was there anything you didn't know?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm asking about this question, my hypothetical.   Stephen G. Breyer  Was there anything you didn't know?   Stephen G. Breyer  Correct.  Did you do it by mistake?  Yes, of course, you did.  It's happened to every human being.  There are millions of instances in which people do things by mistake where, in fact--   Stephen G. Breyer  --No, my wife does not make mistakes.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I make mistakes, and sometimes I make mistakes knowing all the facts, and so do you and so does everybody else.  So I never heard of this thing that you can't make a mistake knowing all the facts.  But anyway, here we have a person who didn't know all the facts.  What the judge says is he should have known all the facts.  Where in the record does he say he did know all the facts?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's a different matter.  My wife told me to turn left and I turned right, okay?  But I didn't take it in.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So that's a different matter.  Where does it say that he did know the facts as opposed to he should have known the facts?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I just want the citations to the page.  I wasn't challenging you.  I just wanted the citations to the page--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --where there's a finding that, in fact, he knew that this company called ""Costa Cruise"" in Italian is the same as the company called ""Costa Cruise"" in English?  I take it ""Crociere"" means ""cruise"".   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, yes.  One is called ""Costa Cruise"" in Italian and one is called ""Costa Cruise"" in English.  And I just want to know where it says in the record that the client or he, the lawyer, actually knew, actually knew that he should have sued the one that spells its name in Italian?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't ask you that question.  I'm asking for a record citation as to where there is a finding that this particular plaintiff knew that the Italian company called ""Costa Cruise"" was in fact the one he should have sued?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'll write them down and look at them later.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I thought what the district court said was ""impute"" the knowledge.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where does it say that?  Where does it say that on 19a?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I -- I know.  I would say in reading this, that both courts have made the most elementary mistake of the English language in thinking that when a person doesn't know something but should have known it, that that's inconsistent with a mistake.  That's the very definition of a mistake.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, all I want is some citation from you that shows that isn't what they thought.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's the conclusion, and when I read two sentences down, it said they may have had constructive knowledge.  The word ""constructive"" to me, when I hear I want to run out the door, because what the word ""constructive"" to me means is not knowledge.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm on page 19a.   Stephen G. Breyer  Constructive notice.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Then what is -- where is the page that it says that the plaintiff had actual, as opposed to imputed, knowledge?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I don't understand what the lawyer reading the ticket has to do with this question.   Stephen G. Breyer  That isn't true, is it?  In the English language, it's not true?  I mean, that's why I was giving you some examples.  I don't know; maybe there's some special legal language somewhere written in Blackstone, or maybe it's Lord Coke, I don't know, that says when you use the word ""mistake"" don't use it in English, use -- use it in Italian.  0 [laugshter.]  But I mean, if we're going to use it in English, there -- it's not hard to find instances where a person would know, but he'd still make a mistake.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And there's even a fortiori--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --if he doesn't know, even if he should.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Isn't that true?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What possible reason is there that somebody who is hurt on a ship and has a lawyer, and she has a broken leg, and she'd like to get recovery, would deliberately sue the wrong person?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there such a reason?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I'm just saying, did he do it by mistake?  If you were representing this person, would you want to sue the company that could give you some money if they are liable?  Or would you rather sue the Bank of America that has nothing to do with it?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I want to ask you about that, because in your brief you refer in your footnote on page 6 to requirements of the Federal Government 44101-44103.  So I looked those up.  I discovered that 44103 says that it is a requirement, and you say you follow these requirements, that you shall establish under regulations of the FMC financial responsibility.  And those regulations tell you that, at least as best I could read them, that you must furnish a written designation of a person in the United States as a legal agent for service of process, and they are referring to instances in which somebody on a ship suffered an accident.  So since you say that you are complying with that, I would like to know the name and address of that person in the United States for whom you must send legal process, because if obviously that had been on the ticket, that is precisely the man to whom this plaintiff would have sent the notice.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well then, were you correct when you said in your -- in your brief that this company which you represent does comply with 44103?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It is relevant, I think, because it adds to the confusion if they are under a legal requirement to have a service -- an agent to receive service, and then they not only don't do it, but they don't have it printed on the ticket.  And they get everybody mixed up by having the same name in English, or a very similar one, and announcing someone you're supposed to serve, and then it turns out to be not that person you're supposed to serve.  It's a mysterious person that you can't find.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It seems odd.  I'd like to know what the explanation is of this.   ",09-337X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  There are thousands and thousands of mistrials every year and hung juries are not all that unusual.  So in this case we have testimony going on for 4 days, 10 hours total.  And we have jury deliberation of 4-1/2 hours, and we have really very little -- I think you can argue it both ways that the jury was deadlocked.  There are some things for, some against, only a couple.  And he doesn't consult with the lawyer, all right.  Now, in these thousands and thousands of cases that must be there over the decades, you probably looked through a few or at least talked to your fellow bar members.  How many have you found where you would say that a mistrial was declared despite facts that are on your side?  In other words, there are going to be millions of cases, not millions but thousands; many of them will support the defense.  Maybe many support you.  But I haven't seen any here that say they support you.  So how many do?  And what do you want me to read to see that this is not an extreme case that counts as an abuse of the judge's discretion?  How many did you find which will prove to me this is not, this is closer to the norm?   Stephen G. Breyer  Correct.  That's why I am asking the question.  What they've said is, is it an abuse of discretion?  And they've also said the judge has to be careful.  Okay, so we have like an abuse of discretion scale and this is pretty far over on the abuse of discretion side.  I think anyone would admit.  But what cases will show to me that it's on your side, not quite an abuse of discretion?  Or is this the most extreme case in history?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know you don't believe it.  All I want you to do is to give me some evidence, like refer me to some other cases or explain to me how you have come to that conclusion, not on the facts of this case, but looking on the scale.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't want you to look at this Court.  We don't have a case where we said what was an abuse of discretion.  I want you to tell me -- and I've already said this twice, but I am judging from your answer you found no case supporting it.  You have found no case in the history of the United States that was more extreme than this--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --where they said it wasn't an abuse of discretion.  That's what I'm judging from your answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  There is no note indicating.  There are five, six notes they sent out, and at 9:30 in the morning they said: Judge, we have a concern about our voice levels, disturbing.  That's what they said.  Then they asked to see the evidence and they said: Explain Count 2.  Then they said: Are we allowed to break?  And then they said: What if we can't agree?  Mistrial, retrial, what?  And at 12:27, the same time, they said: What about lunch?  Then he brought them out and he says to the juror: All right, do you believe it's hopelessly deadlocked?  And the foreperson said: The majority of us don't believe that.  And he said: Don't say what you're going to say.  And then he doesn't have the lawyer there.  Okay, that's fairly extreme.  So that's why I ask the question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly but I'm drawing some conclusions from your silence.  You haven't found a case supporting it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And those are the ones -- so as I'm seeing this case, it isn't that complicated.  You know, it's pretty clear what the standard is.  The standard is, was the decision of the -- of the State court reasonable in deciding that there was a sound -- sound -- the words come from nine wheat, that's -- that's, you know, like 100 years ago or something.   Stephen G. Breyer  186 years ago when it was something like  ""sound, careful, exercise patience. ""  --or whatever,  ""the sound, careful exercise of discretion. ""  They said there was.  And the question for us is, was that reasonable?  Okay?  I guess if the judge had said,  ""Hey, we have only been deliberating half an hour and the game starts in five minutes, I've got to get there -- dismissed. ""  that would be unreasonable.  [Laughter]  Objectively unreasonable.  So come as close as you can to that, where they held reasonable, and what case is it?   INTERRUPTING ",09-338X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So can -- what -- what is -- looking at -- can you take the converse of the question I asked your colleague on the other side, if you can remember it?  I'll -- do you see what I'm -- on the scale.  I mean, this is a fairly simple case.   Stephen G. Breyer  What is wonderful about this case is there is no disagreement about the facts.  We could write them in under two pages, just quoting exactly the notes and exactly what the colloquy was and note that the lawyer wasn't there.  So there we are.  Now, imagine that in front of you.  You -- it's easier for you to look up the cases than it is for him, because you want to find reversals, and all you have to do is you look and you try to see when the State courts, Federal courts have said there was not manifest necessity.  So I have some time.  I will read some cases.  Which ones do you want me to read?  And I don't need to read the standard.  I have the standard.  And I don't have to worry about -- I agree with the quotation of the statute; you have the burden.  And the question is we have a record of those two pages, and does it clearly show that he abused his discretion when he said there was manifest necessity?  Now, I will read -- whatever cases you tell me to read, I will read.  But I want to find facts and I'm not sure you found some, either.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How could it be that there are no cases?  I mean really, thousands and thousands of mistrials?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How can it be that there are no cases?  Are reversals very, very rare for manifest necessity?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, that's good.  Now, tell me then what did you find?  When you say ""remotely as bad"", then you perhaps found some where contention was rejected, or where contention -- what did you find?  What did you find by way of cases where they said on facts as bad as this, or not quite as bad as this, there was no manifest necessity?   ",09-338X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is the answer to Justice Alito's question?  The -- a clerk doesn't give a license to someone he should.  Right?  Now, you bring -- that person brings a lawsuit against the city.  Now, if Monell applies, in order to win he has to show that it was the city's policy to deny it, or maybe all he has to show is the city's policy was to leave it up to the clerk.  And if he finds it's the city's policy to grant it, he's going to lose, which he should, because there was no such policy.  The clerk was wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  What's the harm in that?  Now, the next question would be: If we show the third, is there any ground for injunction against the city?  And on that one, I don't know.  Maybe there is.  Maybe conditions have changed.  I don't know.  But what's the harm to anybody in doing -- requiring that in order -- just what I said?  What's the harm?   Stephen G. Breyer  There are two possibilities -- three possibilities.  The clerk denied the license.  A, there is a city policy which requires him to do it; B, there is a city policy that permits him to do it; C, there is a city policy that forbids him to do it.  All right.  Now, those are the only three I can think of.  And it seems to me in A or B, you could recover against the city, and in C you couldn't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So -- so -- so, why--   Stephen G. Breyer  --If there is no city policy, then the city hasn't done anything wrong under Monell.  Now, is that what you're arguing?  That the city should, even though it has no policy, nonetheless have to have attorney's fees, is open to suit, et cetera, and forget about Monell?  Is that your argument?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you are right about that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  If you are right about that, there is no problem for you, because you are saying: Yes, you need a city policy, and this counts as a policy.   Stephen G. Breyer  But the Ninth Circuit didn't.

And either they had the power to do it under State law or they didn't.  If they did have a power to do it then you probably will show a practice.  If they didn't have the power to do it, why should they do anything against them.  You should tell the State, go do it.   Stephen G. Breyer  What is wrong with that?   Stephen G.

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So how is this different?   Stephen G. Breyer  I understand that point.  I'm just asking what's a relevant difference?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why couldn't he?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You just read us the provision.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The judge enters a -- an order, a final order.  And that final judgment, as was true here, says: I haven't decided restitution yet.  He can appeal.  Then what it says is when you get around to the restitution, then enter another judgment, and you'll appeal that, as happens precisely in the case of the 60 days -- you know, that extra stuff that Justice Scalia was referring to.  That's a possible interpretation of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.  I don't see, you know, the appeals thing.  I don't see anything -- I don't have in front of me the language on filing an appeal, but I can't think of anything that's contrary.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's a final judgment, and because there is another provision that says an order of restitution is itself a final judgment.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You read it to us.  I mean the one you read to us.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, the same problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I see.   Stephen G. Breyer  Where does it say that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, this is a court-made rule of what counts as a final judgment.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Is there anything in the decisions of this Court interpreting that rule?  I mean, you could have collateral orders.  You could have all kinds of things.  And doesn't it boil down to the same question?  I mean, I agree with you that if Congress wanted to make a 90-day deadline, you really have to do it, and you can't restitute thereafter.  That's one thing.  But if they didn't, why didn't they equally intend the judgment without the restitution order to be a final judgment?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then later on, just as in (o), if the judge does impose an order of restitution, then of course, that's appealable, and that's a different judgment.  Is there -- what in the law prevents the -- that interpretation?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  So you have precedent.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Well, what about that as a possible answer?  If we accept -- the -- the judge, of course, could say to the defendant: I'm not going to sentence you; I'm not going to put that sentence -- I'm not going to sentence you at all--   Stephen G. Breyer  --for 100 days.   Stephen G. Breyer  And your remedy, then, might be to ask for mandamus, if that was too long a period?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and -- so why wouldn't that be similar here?  If the judge is going to go after the 90 days, he'd have the power to do it, but it would be like a continuance, and he'd have to exercise that reasonably.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I know.  You're interpreting it literally, and--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and that's--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --But I mean, if I thought, for argument's sake--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --that Congress doesn't care about whether it's after 90 days -- it was just to sort of speed things up -- on that assumption, wouldn't you still have a remedy, because it would be like the unreasonable continuance?   Stephen G. Breyer  That is correct?  I've got it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I'm thinking of--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm thinking of the general problems--   Stephen G.

The sentencing is over.  They got the presentence report, and the judge enters -- suppose he entered a judgment but didn't say anything about restitution, because he says: I'd like to give you a chance to appeal this.  And I'm not going to deal with restitution for a month when the victim recovers -- all within the 90 days.  Can the defendant appeal that piece of paper?   Stephen G. Breyer  The answer is because of this provision?   Stephen G. Breyer  Whoa, whoa.  What about what the -- what -- what you just heard quoted, forgetting this particular sentence in the code, was that a judgment isn't final -- you can only appeal a final judgment until all the parts that are there, and the restitution is part of it.  And so until it's final, you can't appeal it.  That's what -- that's what the case Parr, which it quoted.  What is -- what is your response to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I suppose it's no -- no imprisonment; it's supervised release.  Now what happens?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but I mean, what's bothering me about this, and I'm not aware -- but you're quoting a sentence that wasn't in your brief and what I hadn't taken in at all is the extent to which this is inextricably mixed up with the rules of appeals, which are very important.  So unless I have in my own mind how -- how this all fits together, I -- I don't know how to decide this case.  I don't want to say something in here that's going to muck up the -- the rules of appealing from a criminal case.  Now, what you've told me is I'm supposed to say that within 14 days of a -- of a judgment imposing imprisonment, he has to appeal, but of course if it's supervised release, he doesn't, or I'm not sure.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but if -- but I have to be able to write my reasons, and in doing that I have to respond to the argument of the other side, which is that the strongest reason for thinking Congress intended this to be final and not beyond 90 days is that if you don't do that, you muck up the rules of appeal.  Now, explain to me why that isn't so.   Stephen G. Breyer  Which is just what you say he has to do if the sentence is supervised release.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why don't we go back to my hypothetical--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and just substitute the word ""fine"" for ""supervised release"".   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not -- I'm not an expert in this area, as you can see.  And -- and I need to have a place to go to look so that I can see that these things, in your view, all work out, and you're not creating some odd appellate system.  Do you have any suggestions for me as to what I could go and read and look at that would help me?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can the (o) -- you remember -- you know what I'm referring to by (o)?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Can that be read to refer to initial -- an initial judgment of restitution as well as an amended judgment?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Look, you straightened me out, from your point of view.  But now you've mixed me up again.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Because I think you said that the defendant is just out of luck.  But, previously, you had said that (o) applies, so I thought what you were saying was that the sentence of imprisonment is immediately appealable and must be appealed within 14 days because of that 3582.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then you said (o) applies, and (o) says that a sentence that imposes an order of restitution is a final judgment.  So if (o) applies, when, 8 months later or 20 months later, that restitution is made final and embodied in another judgment, that is a final judgment which can't be appealed.  So if you're right about (o) applying, then the answer to the question is, no, he is not out of luck.  Now, don't just agree with me because I seem to be on your side in this question.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I've got to figure this out.   ",09-367X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why is this so complicated?  I'm probably missing something.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But the thing -- but it doesn't help you, I don't think, if it isn't complicated.  That is, because of Burlington we are only talking about a certain number of employees who could make an employer responsible.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  So those are supervisory people, we'll call them.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, why don't we just stop there and just say, we have a statute, the statute says that if -- if a bad motive was a motivating -- had to be a motivating factor, discriminatory -- discriminatory motivating factor in the dismissal, then, unless you can prove an affirmative defense, you lose.  Why do we have to have something special if one of these small group of employees happens to be the person who said the last words or happens to be somebody who told somebody who said the last words or happens to be somebody who told the somebody the something-or-other?  You are just looking for one thing.  And there could be five zillion fact situations.  So why something special?  Why did the Seventh Circuit say where it's not the guy who said the last words you have to show, quote, ""singular influence""?  Why singular influence?  Why not just what the statute says, that it was -- that it led to the -- what she said led to the discriminatory motive being a motivating factor, period, end of the matter.  No special ""cat's paw"" rule, no special anything rule.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, no.  Of course you have to show proximate cause.  You have to show cause.  You always do.  I'm just saying, why have a special rule?  Why not have a special rule if somebody was on the second floor?  You wouldn't think of that.  So if you were not going to do it because the person's on the second floor, why do it because they happen to be somebody who told somebody rather than somebody who was the person who was told?   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  You are perfectly entitled to say that.  But what I don't see that you are entitled to say are the words that the Seventh Circuit used, which is: You have to show jury that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding of singular influence.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That doesn't just sound like it was a motivating cause.  That sounds like something really special.   Stephen G. Breyer  Ah, okay.  So why don't we say: Seventh Circuit, if that's your way of saying it is just a normal thing like cause, we accept that, but please don't use those words.  And because you might have used -- you might have used them meaning something else, we will send this back so we are certain that what you are doing is applying the same test to everything.  In other words, was it a motivating factor?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  That seems like a good resolution of this case to me.  I don't know if it does to them.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then you can't agree with me, because my question was why would that be?  You have two people, A and B, they are both supervisors; in the one case B fires the employee because he is in the Army, and he says it: Ha, ha, that's why I'm doing it.  In the second case he fires the employee because he thought the employee was, in one of Justice Sotomayor's hypotheticals or anyone else, he fires him for a perfectly good reason, but A has lied about it.  And the reason A lied about it was because she wanted to tell him a lie so B would fire the employee, and her reason is because he's in the Army.  Those two situations, the second seems to me one of 80 -- 80 million situations, fact-related, that could arise, and I don't know why we want a special standard for such a situation.  Why not just ask the overall question, was this action an action that was -- in which the bad motive was a motivating factor.  Forget psychoanalysis of A.  B is good enough -- or vice versa.  That was my question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because together they dismissed the employee.   Stephen G. Breyer  One by supplying the false statement, the other by acting on it.   Stephen G. Breyer  They are both agents.  That's why I made them both Burlington people.  I wanted to get them in the group.  They both have the same Burlington status, so we get that issue out of it.  And together they fire this individual.  In the absence of either the one or the other, he wouldn't have been fired.   Stephen G. Breyer  I feel I'm going to get nowhere pursuing this hypothetical further.  So I will drop it and say--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Answer it as you wish or as you understand it.   ",09-400X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Take the case, though -- just take the -- what is the government's position?  The ERISA plaintiff wants $5 million.  They get denied everything.  The -- the court says: I noticed here there was a 30-day deadline that you had, and he only gave you 28 days, so I'm sending it back, but I'll tell you your claim that there was enough evidence is absurd; you're never going to win it.  And then he goes back, and he loses it.  Okay?  He has had a procedural victory.  Does he get attorney's fees?  Not -- not a chance that he's going to win this claim, and, indeed, he loses it.  He doesn't get a penny.  Does he get attorney's fees, because on a technicality he won a new hearing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  My question is--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --does the statute, in the view of the government, permit attorney's fees in the case I just mentioned?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Your answer is, yes--   Stephen G. Breyer  --it does permit?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  You're just saying it won't be a problem because the district court judges are all reasonable, and I know they think that.  [Laughter]   ",09-448X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the judgment is, send it back.  That's what it says: Send it back.  And the reason for sending it back is this woman was undergoing terrible pain, that the Social Security Administration says she's completely disabled, that she's entitled in the -- on the evidence shown.  There's no substantial evidence to the contrary.  But you, the company, want to take money from her instead of giving her the money.  Now, I've read the record.  It doesn't support anything contrary to what I've said.  So now you send it back.  Now, what is that but a big victory for the other side?  Which then leaves the company to say: They're right; pay them.  Now, if that isn't -- I mean, what words of English -- if you're -- we're talking about partial success.  Partial success, or not total defeat.  That is the language from Ruckelshaus.  Not ""total success"".  You still get it.  Okay.  What in the English language can we read in a case or a statute that would say you shouldn't reach that commonsense result?  Now, of course, I'm characterizing it a little bit, but it does seem like a commonsense result.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If someone wants a remand, it's a remand, but on limited grounds; that is, a holding of the district court.  The ERISA administrator was -- it's an abuse of his discretion to refuse to give this woman nothing.  In my opinion, she's entitled at least to $30,000, but whether it's 30 or 35, I don't know.  So I remand it to the ERISA administrator so he can decide to act within -- within his discretion, give her either 30, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.  Now, in your view, attorney's fees -- all the statute says is the court, in its discretion, may allow a reasonable attorney's fee.  Nothing more.  Now, what would stop an attorney's fee in that situation?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If that's what you think.   Stephen G. Breyer  You distinguish between him saying you have to give her at least 30 and his saying the evidence that supports giving her less than 30 is -- insufficient, is substantially -- is -- what's the word?  Yes, worthless.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's the line you draw?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That may be, but why can't they do this?  What would be wrong with this heretical idea, that as long as the plaintiff wins something out of the court, the district judge -- that group of people we were talking about -- has discretion to decide whether ultimately they got something significant of what they wanted, and as long as that judgment helped them get them something significantly of what they wanted, attorney's fees are fine; and we leave it all up to the district judge as long as the district judge doesn't abuse the discretion that that standard gives him?  What would -- I mean, would the Earth come to an end?  What would happen that would be so terrible if we said something like that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It didn't say anything against the catalyst theory.  It said you have to remember this is an American country, we follow the American rule, and there has to be something special in the situation.  And what would be special in this situation is that the judge has to decide that as a result of the favorable ruling, the plaintiff really did get something significantly of what she wanted.   INTERRUPTING ",09-448X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not sure that that's right.  I think that this may well apply to the crime that is being -- that is being prosecuted where the crime is defined as a real offense in the world, with the limitations put on that term by the guidelines.  I would think that would be a natural reading, in which case you would look to the conduct of the person.  And if the conduct of the person is such that it calls for a mandatory minimum of a certain kind, there we are.  If that exceeds this amount, there we are.  You can't apply it.  And if it doesn't, you do apply it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Have you looked into that?  I mean, that was my reading of it as -- in the most natural way.  The word ""crime"" is ambiguous.  Sometimes it means words in a statute.  Sometimes it means an affair in the world.  And I thought this one probably meant the affair in the world.   Stephen G. Breyer  If that's so, then this gives tremendous power to the prosecutor to decide what the sentence will be in terms of how he manipulates the charge.  And I thought that probably this, read with the guidelines, is designed not to -- not to permit that.  It's to minimize the discretion, not to maximize.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, I don't know if it makes any difference.  I mean, has there ever been such a case, where the prosecutor worked this in such a way that he would produce this?  Are you aware if any such case ever happened?   ",09-479X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So there are two possible readings now of the ""except"" clause where it says -- the words are the subsection doesn't apply where a mandatory -- where any other provision of law sets forth a higher mandatory.  Now, one possible reading, which is yours, is what this means is that, judge, where you are operating under that provision you just mentioned, and the guy has committed two serious 924(c) things, and so he is entitled to life -- this is just what the Chief Justice said -- this is done to remind the judge don't give him life plus 25 years, because it would be 25 years under this statute, not 5.  That is one possibly reading.  The other possible reading is, judge, where, in fact, you have the underlying drug offense, that's going to get you up into the 30s in the guidelines, it's going to be probably 10, 5 years, or whatever it is.  You have a pretty high drug offense already.  And now we give him 5 extra years, say, for having a gun under this, unless he's already gotten, say, a mandatory minimum of 7 years.  And if he's already gotten the mandatory minimum of 7 years, here's what's happened: Judge, turn to the guidelines and the guidelines will tell you to add 3 or 4 extra years.  So in one -- those are the two possible readings.  Now, the first reading to me makes very little sense.  The second reading to me says, yeah, this is serving a purpose.  It's once you are sure this guy has to go to jail for 5, 6, 7, maybe 10 or 20 years for sure, extra amounts are controlled by the guidelines, which is administered by a judge.  Now, if you just came across that for the first time, which would you think was most probable?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  When -- when did Congress pass the statute that they amended in 1998?  The one you are saying -- I mean, it's a good point, you have a point, that this would make it more lenient, the interpretation.  But the ""it"" was passed when?   Stephen G. Breyer  So that's way before the guidelines.  So what they are trying to do now, in 1998, is they are trying to -- see, in 1998 what they are trying to do is take some of these old provisions and reconcile them with this new system that has come along.  So I agree you have a point there.  But it -- it does make a certain amount of sense, because what it is saying is, in these cases where you have a WAPPO mandatory minimum anyway, so you are sure he has got it, now the additional amount will be controlled by the guidelines, which are subject to not much discretion.  They are pretty close to mandatory minimums, but there is a little wiggle room.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's not strongly.  The -- what is it an example?  You're saying this thing also serves the purpose that perhaps someday Congress will pass a new statute, a totally different one, and a busy district judge might think that he should add the 5 or 25 years from this provision on to whatever sentence this hypothetical new statute provides, but this will tell him not to do so.  Did you have anything in mind?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I take it in those other sentences there are other thing in the code, and the odd thing about this one is there no other thing in the code except the one we have been discussing.  And so I just wondered if there -- was there at the time anybody thinking of adding some new thing, that this might have been applicable to?  Or have you come across anything?  I take it your answer is no.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no.  It's a shift over to the sentencing guidelines which say a person like this one will receive an extra three or four or five years depending on the circumstances.  Will receive it, just like a mandatory.  Unless, of course, it is an unusual case.  That's what it's a shift to.  Am I wrong?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I did.   ",09-479X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, that's -- that's true.  The thing I was wondering in this case is there's a -- a dispute that's about racial discrimination and so forth.  There's a clause, and the clause says this is arbitrable, but that is being disputed because the plaintiff in the case says that's an unconscionable provision, so it doesn't really apply.  And then you say but now that dispute is referred to the arbitrator to just read the language.  But the plaintiff says that that language, too, is unconscionable, and as long as that language is unconscionable, then how is it clear and unmistakable that they, he, agreed to do it, because an unconscionable provision is not a provision?  So if we apply First Options -- I mean, it's complicated because of the language; it's not complicated once you think it out, and -- I hope.  But just applying it very literally, it would seem to say that you do not have clear and unmistakable evidence that they agreed to submit this kind of dispute to arbitration for the reason that what you point to is itself according to them a product of unconscionability.  How do you -- how do you respond to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, making itself could be, but I think that's a harder question, whether a -- certainly if the person says you see my signature there; that's not mine; that's Joe Banana's, who tries to imitate me -- there is no contract, and no matter what it says, it doesn't go to the arbitrator.  All right?  Now, we can argue about whether it is or is not analogous to that when he claims it's unconscionable.  There's a very good argument it is analogous.  There's a very good argument it is like fraud in the inducement, and there are some arguments the other way.  But First Options I think cuts through that, by saying whether that's true or not, unless it's clear and unmistakable that they wanted this matter, the matter of whether the arbitration clause itself is unconscionable referred to the arbitrator, whether or not they wanted that referred to the arbitrator has to be clear and unmistakable.  And they are claiming no, because the lack -- the provision that says that is itself a product of unconscionability.  That's to repeat my question.  But, having repeated the question, why isn't that the simplest, most direct, and four-sentence ground for deciding this case?   Stephen G. Breyer  He's not saying that this whole arbitration clause is unconscionable?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, all right.  So he's -- he's complaining the whole clause is unconscionable, and that's part of the clause.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, and in First Options, we said it wasn't clear and unmistakable.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the rules were what I just described.   Stephen G. Breyer  So let's go back to that.  Maybe the other way is simpler.  You say you agree that if my defense to this contract, which you are trying to enforce against me or which gives me a right to sue you, look at the argument, you put up this four-page document, and I say: Look, that is not my signature; that is the signature of Joe Bananas.  We agree that's for the court.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, we agree it's for the court if my defense is, what he did is he got me drunk, told me a bunch of lies, and I signed it.  I grant it's my signature, but look at how squiggly it is.  And my will was not a free one because I was under the influence of alcohol and lies.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Same.  That's Prima Paint.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay?  Now, he says the reason that I did not sign this contract -- I agree it's my signature; I agree it is not squiggly -- but still my will was overborne.  What was it overborne by?  It was overborne by those very situations that lead courts to label contracts unconscionable.  The reason we don't enforce unconscionable contract is because the person who was the victim had no free will.  He did not sign it of his own accord.  And that doesn't -- there's no other reason, and that's the basic reason, and therefore assimilate it to the other two.  What's your response?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but that's what I want the answer to.  I know you don't agree with it.  What I want is a list of reasons why.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But I'm not interested in arbitration law.  I'm interested in contract law, and I want to know why as a general matter of contract law an allegation of unconscionability, defense of unconscionability, is why is it not enough like the coercion defense or the inducement defense or the ""I was in Alaska"" defense?  Isn't it enough like that that they should be treated alike?  And now you're going to say no, and I want to know why not.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  What is the one-sentence answer, one sentence, to the thing, this is a very interesting case, lots of stuff in it that we needn't reach because irrespective of everything else, they in their reply, the district court, and the court of appeals all said these whole four pages, the whole four pages were unconscionable, so none of it's enforceable, and all we have to decide is whether that's an issue for the court.  And the answer to that being not an issue for the court is what, in a sentence or two?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They said, look, there's a four-page document.  They said this four-page document is unconscionable, the product of unconscionability, and, therefore, don't enforce it.  That's their claim.  That issue is at least is for the court, because there is no valid agreement here at all, if that's right.   INTERRUPTING ",09-497X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is -- what I'm not sure about what you are arguing now is my -- as I came into this, I thought there were three situations.  Situation 1 is common in labor arbitration.  It's an arbitration agreement that says wages, hours, and working conditions disputes will be arbitrated, and we have a question about whether a particular dispute is or is not full within the definition.   Stephen G. Breyer  As to that one, we assume that the parties intended the question of arbitrability to be arbitrated; we assume it.  Normally, that's the rule.  It's the scope of the arbitration agreement.  That's a little hard to distinguish, but sometimes that's not the argument.  The argument could be: Well, there are four different provisions in the arbitration section, and we think one of them is void because it's, say, unconscionable, but the others are okay.  Now, that one, I mean, normally, you could if it's clear enough say I want that one to go to arbitration.  And the third one is that you have a contract, and it's an arbitration contract, and it's on four separate pieces of paper, and what you're saying is, I was in Alaska, or the equivalent, and maybe unconscionability is the equivalent.  On that one I'm with you.  I don't see how you can submit -- agree to submit that to the arbitrator, because there's no agreement, or at least no valid one, at least no valid one under State law.  But what are you arguing?  That this is that case or this is the other case I just mentioned, that middle case where you have 10 provisions and you're saying that this one over here is unconscionable but that one isn't; and -- but I did sign a valid arbitration agreement.  I agree with that.  It's just that certain provisions of it are invalid because they're unfair.  What are you arguing in this case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the second one -- I don't see how you get there, because if it's the second, one you concede that there is an arbitration agreement that's valid.  And if you concede that there is a valid arbitration agreement between you and your client, and you're arguing over the scope of different provisions or whether certain provisions within it are valid or invalid, why can't you submit that to an arbitrator if it's clear enough?   Stephen G. Breyer  As to each provision?  As to each bit of -- why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But suppose you and your -- your client -- rather, your client and the other side have absolutely agreed, clear as could be, under the arbitration agreement: We want arbitrated too whether the provision that these words are contained in is unconscionable.  Can't they agree to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Let me say it more easily.  We have agreement number one, four pages, and within it is a question of -- which just looks like this one.  Agreement number two: The two parties agree that if any dispute should arise as to whether any words in agreement number one are unconscionable, they will go to the arbitrator.  Agreement number two is concededly valid.  Now do you want to say that agreement number one -- those words have to be decided by the court?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right, but if you're going to say yes--   Stephen G. Breyer  --then I think if you're going to say yes to that, then it's contrary to First Options, I think.  I'm not sure, but I don't see why not.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I read your -- I promise you I'll go back to First Options, which I thought was of gem-like clarity--  [Laughter]  And I am apparently the only one in the world--   Stephen G. Breyer  --the only one in the world who thinks that.  And I'll go back to--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'll go back to that and look at it.  But the -- the--  [Laughter]  Looking at your response to their motion to arbitrate--   Stephen G. Breyer  --it seemed to me you said here that -- that because of your -- your position, your client's position, that the whole thing is unconscionable.  You didn't say that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But not every contract.  I mean, I'll take that argument.  I'd like to know about that argument.  I'd like to know what really is the underlying, which I've never looked up.  What is the underlying rationale in contract law of setting aside contracts as unconscionable?  Why do courts do it?  What's the theory?  I'd like to know that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  See, that's what I wonder, that last part -- is it that the basic theory is we want to protect a group of people by -- who voluntarily entered into contracts by giving them the right to opt out, or is is that we don't think that they really meant to do it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  On that question, or any other question, is, I would imagine, where we have agreement one, and the argument is maybe agreement one was unconscionable.  And then we enter into agreement two, and the parties in agreement two agree to -- to arbitrate their unconscionability dispute in agreement one, and there's nothing wrong with agreement two, I would think that's then the question of unconscionability is for the arbitrator.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You said ""all"", and I just don't think you meant all.  But maybe you did.  That's why I asked the question.   INTERRUPTING ",09-497X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Haven't you just pushed all the difficult questions into the word ""generally applicable""?  I imagine a fuel tax applies to everybody in the State, but then we exempt everybody who does business in the State with fuel.   Stephen G. Breyer  Except for railroads.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, now.  You want to call that not a generally applicable class?  Do you want to call it a discrimination against railroads?  It seems to me about the same question.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So why isn't the easiest thing to say, since there's so many other questions involved in discrimination: Yes, the clause applies?  What counts is a discrimination is an obviously difficult question, and we will send it back for somebody else to wrestle with this, since it's so difficult.   Stephen G. Breyer  What is the choice?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I realize that, but what they are worried about is somebody that's having passed on the property level--   Stephen G. Breyer  --thinks I have a great revenue-raising idea.  What we do is tax the New York Central, and then they sit down with a bunch of lawyers and the lawyers say: Oh, great, they come through this State; what we'll do is we'll have a tax that applies to all fuel and then we will exempt everybody except the New York Central.  All right.  Great.  We've now found a replacement of the revenue that they just said in Congress we couldn't have in the first three provisions.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, because you're saying that's not generally applicable.  They are saying sure it is, read the first line, applies to everybody.  You say no, no, no.  That's a trick because of the second line.  So now what we will do is we'll monkey around with it a little bit.  And we will make it tough.  All I'm saying is that's precisely the same question in that context as whether it's discriminates or not.  I'm not saying it's an easy question.  I'm just saying it might be clearer if we said, yes, the thing applies, now go work out the hard question of whether you had have got a discriminatory tax.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The property taxes, the language is different.   Stephen G. Breyer  You are assuming how the Court will decide the word ""discriminate"".   Stephen G. Breyer  I understand what you are saying, and so would every other judge.  And of course, it's hard to figure out in these contexts what is real discrimination, but there could be obvious cases.  And so why cut out the obvious cases simply because it's hard in a non-obvious case to figure it out?   Stephen G. Breyer  There is no way -- there is no way with the property -- the property tax is tough.  And once you start taking exemptions into account, it's double tough, and there is very little need, is there?  Every State in the country has property taxes and every State in the country has property taxes on businesses.   Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and it might not be so that every State in the country has particular taxes on diesel fuel.  And it might be that they don't have taxes on rails, or it might be that they -- you see?  So, I -- I -- that's how I am explaining to myself.  What do you think?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, but it's not quite, because this is the same problem I was raising.  You just shoved the difficult questions into generally applicable.  But you might think of some new ways of doing it that they don't want.  So I would worry about giving you just the decision where the word in the statute is ""discriminate"", and nowhere does it say ""generally applicable"".  I'd somewhat worry about whether this statute shoves the same problems into two words that aren't there as to rather leaving those problems for resolution under the one word that is there.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'll believe you, I'll believe you.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The word -- the word I was looking at was is 4, impose another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier providing transportation, subject to the jurisdiction of the board under this part.  Now, I read all the words of 4, and I found the word ""discriminates"", and I did not find the two words ""generally applicable"".   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but in all these years where they never challenged it, did all these other States not only tax their diesel fuel, but at the same time exempt the diesel fuel tax from all their competitors.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's the rationale, that the trucks don't have to say it but the railroads do?   INTERRUPTING ",09-520X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What happens if the president of the oil company, knowing that the statement is false, says: We have discovered 42 trillion barrels of oil in Yucatan.  He writes it on a piece of paper; he gives it to the board of trustees; they think it's true and they issue it.  Joe Smith buys stock and later loses money.  Can Joe Smith sue the president of Yucatan, of the oil company, for having made an untrue statement of material fact?   Stephen G. Breyer  What he is -- he didn't issue it.  What he did was he gave it to the board of trustees, who issued it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He's the president of the company.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I'm asking what happens.  Is there recovery?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He is running the business, the daily affairs, of the company.  Of course the president of a company is an authorized agent of the company, and so, yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, if he is subject to liability, why isn't your firm, your client, subject to liability, who, after all, run every affair of the Fund?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, that's what a president does.  The president of a company manages the company.  And if the president is liable, why isn't the group of people who do everything for the company -- why aren't they liable?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, you have to explain it to me more.  I'm not being difficult.  I understand this less well than you think I do, and I want to know.  That's an obvious, naive question, and I would like an answer that anyone could understand.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I get it.  In other words, you're saying on the papers here, it's -- it's the trustees that manage everything.   Stephen G. Breyer  That govern everything, and these are like helpers?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They do a lot as helpers.  Now, let me suggest to you, if that's one possible distinction, what about this distinction: That the managers of a Fund, even though they are outsourced people brought in, are liable as principals, not aiders or abettors, if -- following criminal law here, if -- they are principals if they get the false statement to the public through a conduit, the conduit being an entity or person that is unaware of the falsity of the statement?  That's LaFave on criminal law.  What is -- what about that?   INTERRUPTING ",09-525X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is it that -- I'm unclear on this.  That's why I use the oil company example.  Plain, ordinary -- the top executives in the oil company write the false statement.  They give it to a board that doesn't know it's false, and the board puts it out in its name.  Now, it seems to me it ought to be clear at this point in securities law whether those -- the president and the vice president are or are not liable under this 10-b, the (b) part.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And they are liable.   Stephen G. Breyer  You're saying they are liable?  All right.  Then their response to that is: This is not like the president of the oil company, and the reason that it's not is something to do with the nature of the obligation that runs between the managers and the Fund, which is somehow different between -- you understand it better than I.  Can you say what it is and what you think your response is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So you're saying -- you're saying it shouldn't matter that -- if they issued worse if they run the whole company than if they're just the president?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, at that point, we get into a problem, and the problem is how do we distinguish an aider or abettor from the principal?  At that point I am uncertain indeed, and that's why I put out this for comment, this suggestion that you follow criminal law here and say at least they are a principal if they have a high position, they participate in it, they do all these things you say, and the entity they're fooling in the first instance is simply a conduit, and therefore, you cannot say it's a scheme, because the other part of the scheme wasn't part of it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  What's the difference between substantial assistance and doing it?   Stephen G. Breyer  There's a distinction.  You want to say what the distinction is.  So I would say, consistent with the view, there is no aiding and abetting liability.  You still would win your case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He may just be some poor associate, his first day at work.  The law firm sent him there and he got stuck down in the boiler room.  And somebody said, why don't you write something that will get everybody to sell things, and -- and why don't you say we're a thousand tons of oil instead of only a ton.  In -- he writes it out.  You think he's liable?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, at some level he knows,  ""I shouldn't be saying they found 1,000 tons of oil when they only found 50. ""  okay?  And four people told him to go do something like that, but he's the guy who wrote it.  I would say he didn't behave well, but I don't think he's the principal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They didn't say what words to write.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They gave him the general idea, and then he did it.  He created the words, to use your phrase; when you say creating the words, he's a great writer.   Stephen G. Breyer  Ah, now we have ""sufficiently involved"".  Once we're into sufficiently involved, we're back into what is sufficient to make the person the principal rather than the aider and the abettor, and apparently creating or writing the statement is not clear whether it is or is not sufficient.  So we're back into the problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm interested in your test.  I'm interested in your test, not the--   INTERRUPTING ",09-525X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I thought -- this I'm confused about.  I would think you would have to have a State which has a law that permits the attorney general to sue the governor.  Wouldn't you?  I mean, if the State law is the attorney general can't sue the governor, that's the end of it, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Suppose the State's law is the governor of the State cannot bring a lawsuit against the attorney general, and vice versa.  Okay?  That's the State law.  Now, under those circumstances can either bring a lawsuit on a Federal right in a Federal court?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I want just a yes or no answer.  In your opinion, can an attorney general where the State law says, black letter law, attorney general can never sue the governor; he's fired instantly if he tries -- that's the law in this State, okay?  Now, can that individual come into Federal court and sue on an Ex parte Young theory suing the governor?   Stephen G. Breyer  He could?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't -- I think that is a problem.  Isn't that what we are saying here?   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought that -- suppose I am right about this and you can't do it.  You can't.  You can't -- the Federal Government cannot tell a State how to organize itself.  If it wants to have an attorney general that can never bring a lawsuit, that's up to the State, unless it's a due process problem.  Now, suppose I believe that.  Now, do you lose this case?   Stephen G. Breyer  Suing in his capacity as attorney general and under his.  That's the plaintiff, not the defendant.  And he has no right to bring that suit, because -- it's not that he doesn't have a right.  It's that he doesn't have authority.  He's not a person that can do this kind of thing.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, right, exactly.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm with Justice Scalia on this.  I will pass to the other side.   Stephen G. Breyer  Have you found any case, are there a lot, a few, none, where one State agency at a State level sues another in Federal court, period?  Say they have a rising under jurisdiction.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, are there any?   Stephen G. Breyer  None?   Stephen G. Breyer  See, nagging at me is some kind of Article III problem.  Maybe there is none.  I don't know.  There are none, though?  None?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It wouldn't have to.  They could get into all kinds of arguments about EPA and all kinds of Federal rights with each other.  I would think.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   ",09-529X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose you have a State which loves litigation.  48 percent of the population are retired lawyers.  Nothing pleases them more than to have everybody suing everybody else.  So they pass a statute which says, for purposes of lawsuits in this State, every department can sue every other department.  Now, if you have such a State, what in the Constitution stops the Federal Government from abiding by that rule and applying ordinary Ex parte Young rules, looking at the defendant, looking at horizon, and then if the plaintiff happens to be a Federal agency suing another, say, well, if it complies with those first set, the fact that A sues B and they are both State agencies, that's the State's decision.  What in the Constitution can prevent the State from deciding to organize what we'll call the legal heaven way?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  That's A, we can go into A later because I agree that would be an answer, if it's correct.  If that is what happened, that's a different question, whether Congress could restructure the State.  That's a serious question.  My question was on the first.  Can Congress stop the State from restructuring itself?   Stephen G. Breyer  If they wrote it down specifically in the law and said we would love to have our agencies sue each other.  They don't say Federal court.  They just say we love to have our agencies sue each other.  They don't mention the Court.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why, because what's undignified about allowing the State to live with the choice it made?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  The hypothetical -- Justice Sotomayor is totally right.  I am talking about Ex parte Young.  I am imagining.   Stephen G. Breyer  I am imagining a system where the State wants to let the AG, this organization, the sheriff of Middlesex County, the City of San Francisco, they want to permit such entities to become plaintiffs against other parts of the State government in such a State if ordinary Ex parte Young requirements are met.  What in the Constitution of the United States prohibits that suit from going ahead?   Stephen G. Breyer  It isn't that Ex parte Young -- if I understand this right, which is why I mention it -- it isn't that Ex parte Young permits one part of a State to sue another part, it is a State permits one part of the State to sue another part, that that's common in the State, that the law requires it, and the question is, in that circumstance should the Ex parte Young situation be treated differently?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Am I right about the statement of the question in the case?   Stephen G. Breyer  In your experience, this would be helpful.  Would you characterize as common or uncommon situations where State agencies are given authority to sue other parts of the State?  As I think it to myself, I think, well, the city of Glendale v. State Water Authority, or Middlesex County Sheriff v. The Bureau of Prisons.  That doesn't sound weird to me.  It sounds as if there probably are a lot of such circumstances, but I don't know.  What -- what do you think?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Cities against -- they must do that a lot.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  University of Massachusetts v. State Environmental Organization.  Does that kind of suit sound familiar to you or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  Now, explain to me -- this is good, because that's very helpful to me.  It's the exact statement that Justice Scalia made, and you said, Yes, that's exactly right.  And then it is the case of that a citizen of the State can come into the Federal court and sue the State official under Ex parte Young, but you say, but the agency of the State can't do it, even though they have State litigating authority.  And the reason that the latter is more injurious of the dignity interests of the State than the former is--   ",09-529X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So what is your view of what the liberty -- you are saying that the words in the Constitution that protect the right that you claim was violated are the words, ""No person shall be"" -- I guess --  ""deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. ""  I guess you mean the word ""liberty"".   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And in your words, it is liberty -- define it.  Liberty to what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There is a right to liberty to control information about oneself?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And all information?  Some information?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Liberty -- there is a liberty to control all information?  Protected from -- from what?  From the State?  The State doesn't have a right to give you any -- get any information about you?  On a driver's license?  It's -- when does it come into play?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So the fact that the Government says -- I go and I want my driver's license, and they say, fill out the form, we want to see how you -- if you can drive or not, that potentially could violate the Constitution?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Potentially.  It might not, because it might be justified, but each such case would have to be justified.  Is that -- is that your theory?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It says ""liberty"".  The liberty, you said, was liberty to control information about yourself.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So I want to know how that works.  Every time anyone in the Government asks a question about you personally, of course, it wouldn't be unconstitutional.  But every time it would have to be a justified thing; is that -- is that your theory?  I'm just asking.   Stephen G. Breyer  So how do we decide?  I am a little interested, if you could spend two or three minutes elaborating this.  A number of laws, Federal laws, I imagine the regulations fill this room, and I think many -- maybe more, maybe several rooms.  And many of them involve asking people for information.  And the number of forms that ask people for information, I guess, about themselves, might fill several rooms.  And I can imagine in a country of 300 million people, you would find someone objecting to many of the questions.  And so how is the system supposed to work, in your view, where judges will decide whether a particular question -- I'm not saying you are wrong.  I just wanted to get an idea from you as to how this legal system works, where any question asked by the Government about a person is potentially subject to challenge as unconstitutional.  You and I will agree that many are fine.  But you are worried about some that aren't fine.  How does it work, the system, distinguishing the ones from the other?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is your view on that question?  There is a famous, funny example that supposedly may be untrue.  Senator Hruska used to ask and say in giving a reference he would write about someone, you'll be lucky if you can get Smith to work for you.  That's the kind of thing that you might want to know.  And despite the ambiguity there and it seemed to me that question 7 sort of drove at that.  And so, but they did enjoin it, so in your view, is that aspect of the injunction wrong.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right then.  Well, then, if it's right, why is it right?  Because it seems to me the basic thing any employer would want to know is whether I'm lucky to get this person to work for me, that kind of thing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is the specific thing about question 7 that you think is unlawful or should be changed?  What words do you object to in that question?   Stephen G. Breyer  So they cannot ask, do you have any information about this person's employment, residence, or activities concerning general behavior or conduct or other matters?  Now, I am an employer and I would like to find out if he's going to do a good job.  So what am I supposed to say, there doesn't seem to be a place here other than that to get into that question.   Stephen G. Breyer  I see, I see.   ",09-530X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  How is that so?  I've read the instruction that the court gave and it seems to me the instruction the Court gave was word-for-word taken from Canton.  And when I read the question that you presented in your Petitioner's brief -- in the petition for cert, I thought what this case was about was an instance where there was only -- it was conceded that there was only one such instance.  But then when I read that your second reiteration of the question, which is a little bit different, and read the briefs, I thought no, there are four other ones.  So what you are really asking us to do is to decide in the case of perfect instructions whether the evidence supports them.  I didn't think I was getting into that and, frankly, the brief clearly supports it.  Others could disagree.  But why are we getting into that business in this Court?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Then what is it you are asking?  Is there something in the instruction that is wrong?  What?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Sorry.  Where -- I'm reading the instruction, I have it here.  What is it?  I'm not saying you are wrong.  I'm just saying, what in the words stated are wrong and where is the request that they be stated differently, that I should look at that, and that they weren't.  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  To the words -- I mean, it looked to me like the words on page 828 are pretty similar to my copy of what he actually said.  So what are the words on page 828 that you think he should have said that he didn't say?   Stephen G. Breyer  What he says here is  ""The situation involved a difficult choice or one that the prosecutors had a history of mishandling, such that additional training, supervision or monitoring was clearly needed. ""  So it looks to me like, unless I'm reading the wrong page, which I've sometimes done out of my memo here.  It looks to me like he gave those words.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm saying what is it that you asked the judge to do that he didn't do or that you asked him not to do that he did do?  That's what happens.  That's the way you object to an instruction.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So what is that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I want you to point out in the record the words that were said to the district court saying  ""judge, I want you to say this. ""  and then the judge didn't do it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Which is where?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then I think we take it as you saying that you not objecting to the instruction.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, your whole brief is objecting to the instruction and you didn't include the objection?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Wait, wait.  If you don't object to the instruction, then we're back to what I'm saying, that what you are objecting to is you don't think the evidence was such that, given that instruction, the jury could find guilt.  And that's what I thought this case wasn't about to begin with, and there are three other instances.  So I don't see why, given this instruction, the jury couldn't find guilt.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But look -- he read the instructions.  They came right out of Canton; seems perfect.  Now you're saying, well, whether they did or not, you cannot have an incident -- you can't have liability if there is only one incident.  And at that point, I say, gee, I don't know; I mean, maybe it depends on what the incident is.  Maybe the incident involved somebody saying: Hey, Brady, what's Brady?  Or somebody saying: What's a criminal trial?  I mean that person needs training.  And -- or -- but I don't even have to think of that here, because there were four incidents here.  And therefore, I don't have to try to make up weird hypotheticals.  So where we have four instances and we have correct instructions, what's the problem?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  We have -- we have -- all this case?  I thought that they had several instances in other cases.   Stephen G. Breyer  All involved -- in other words, there has never in this office been an instance of a Brady violation outside of this case.   Stephen G. Breyer  After, that's what it was.   Stephen G. Breyer  Ah.  There were four Brady violations involving this office, okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So now we are talking about not one; we are talking about four--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --over many years, with tens of thousands of violations, correct?   Stephen G. Breyer  This is helpful.  Thank you.   Stephen G. Breyer  Do we have to overturn what the jury found?   Stephen G. Breyer  We don't?  Because they found that the failure to adequately train amounted to deliberate indifference to the fact that inaction would result in a constitutional violation.  That's what they found.  Now, how can we -- assuming that's true, and accepting it and not overturning it -- find that there was something unlawful?  Because you are arguing -- you are all arguing about whether the training program really was adequate or not.  They found it was not.  What do we do?   ",09-571X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Isn't -- am I right -- am I right on this?  Here -- I read on page 4 of your brief that it seemed what happened -- and I might not be right, correct me if I'm not.  What happened is a piece of paper called the lab report came to the -- one of the prosecutors' attention two days before the trial, and what it said was, the blood that was the perpetrator's was type B.  And the person on trial has blood of type O.  Is that what happened?   Stephen G. Breyer  And the -- and the prosecutor knew that the person on trial had type O?   Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Was there a procedural issue in this case before the California Supreme Court?   Stephen G. Breyer  What was that?   Stephen G. Breyer  But in this case, they didn't reject it on a procedural ground.  It was a reasonable ground that they applied consistently.  Then the Ninth Circuit or the Federal courts couldn't consider the claim at all; is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If in fact the -- they are right, if in fact the State was correct that this was procedurally barred, they should have raised it earlier.  They didn't.  And if that was correct and reasonable and proper under both Federal and State law, then it shouldn't be in this subject at all; is that right or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  So normally, to decide a matter on a substantive -- to have a presumption that they are reciting it substantively rather than procedurally will help a defendant, though not in this case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is it fair to say that this in this case, that every party in the lower courts assumed this was going to be a merits-related issue and that some deference was due, and that nobody ever said anything about it being a procedural issue where there would be a procedural bar of some kind that was either waived or not waived?   Stephen G. Breyer  The first time anybody mentioned this procedural issue was when?   Stephen G. Breyer  That was on the merits brief in opposition?   Stephen G. Breyer  There was nothing before that?   ",09-587X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But what they cite it for, actually, they make a slightly different argument in their brief.  They say going back to 1974, there are at least three cases in the Ninth Circuit that have said when the California Supreme Court says nothing, just denied, we take that as a decision to reach the Federal issue and deny it on the merits.  Now, not in your case, but in most cases that will benefit a defendant, because it will avoid the question of whether there's an adequate and independent State ground of a procedural nature.  So, what they are saying is that that's the Ninth Circuit's statement in three cases, and the California Supreme Court over a course of 30 years has never said to the contrary, which it had plenty of opportunity to do and in other instances where the Ninth Circuit was wrong, it did do it.  So, that, I think, is a fairly strong argument.  Now, you're going to -- the only reason that you are not out of court on your own interpretation is because you will say that the State waived the procedural issue.  And then they will come back and say, so did you.  So, what -- what is your response to all of that?   Stephen G. Breyer  For example, in Hunter v. Aispuro they quote it as saying the following, the California Supreme Court's denial of a State habeas petition  ""without comment or citation constitutes a decision on the merits of the Federal claims. ""  And then they have three other cases roughly to the same effect.  Now what you are saying is that this Court should hold to the contrary, and by the way, in doing that, we will bar many Federal habeas petitioners from the Federal courts, because what it will mean is that there is an adequate and independent State ground in case after case, which perhaps is an irrelevant feature, but nonetheless, the silence of the California Supreme Court is significant, I think, when faced with those pretty clear interpretations of what their silence means by the Ninth Circuit.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know.  It seems to me you go further than you need to and, moreover, imagine a State offense that just says possession of marijuana, zero to 5 years.  Now, our problem is, reading those words, is that or is that not analogous to a Federal -- a Federal -- what a Federal law would make a felony?  And suppose you discovered as a matter of fact that all the people who did have a prior conviction got more than a year.  In simple possession, they got less than a year, which you'd have to do research to find out.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if those were the facts, I would say it is analogous to the Federal felony where this person was sentenced to more than a year.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, we could argue that one--   Stephen G. Breyer  --but I don't see where--  that there's a line, because it seems to me the rule is set forth -- we said in the last sentence here of -- what's the case?  You know--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, Lopez.  It says:  ""A state offense constitutes a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act only if it proscribes conduct. ""  So we're not looking at what happened in reality.  We're reading some words from a State statute.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that Federal law.  This would be normal.  We get some words in the State statute, and you have to decide are the -- those words cover some events in the world.  And you look at those words, what -- the events they cover and discover, did they or are they analogous or not analogous to what is a felony under Federal law?  Sometimes that's easy, sometimes it's not.  You have a case, I think, that's easy.  But I can imagine the case you're talking about, not easy.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you say, what do you do?  I see no rule there.  I see no rule absolute how you treat it, so I probably would treat it by trying to look at what really happens under this statute in the world.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why -- where does it say ""offense element""?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where does it say that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, where in the statute--   Stephen G. Breyer  --does it say ""offense elements""?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you say that it says ""elements"".  I don't see any of our cases that say ""elements"".  And I -- and I think that -- that what we could do is look to the conduct that's likely to be at issue under these State words, and if in fact it's regular that the State does punish people for more than a year when in fact they do possess for the third time, at least there would be a good argument--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --that that counts.  You want to argue it doesn't count, okay.  I don't know why you do.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But, I mean, I'm interested in why you do, since that isn't your case.   Stephen G. Breyer  I know, but the reason I ask my question is it seems to me your approach, which I think is consistent with Lopez and Nijhawan absolutely--   Stephen G. Breyer  --does raise the question you are talking about.  So I want to know: Why are you talking about it?  Because I might be missing something, because I don't think -- if I'm right, your case doesn't raise these issues.  Or am I wrong about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Well, skip the question.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's -- that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Because she got to that argument at the end, and she said my -- I wrote that, I think, and I -- when I used as an example or the text uses an example, this provision is one where you don't look to real conduct.  She said that was a mistake, really.  It was overstated, because what they're saying is that recidivism analogous to the $10,000 was meant to be a real conduct aspect, not just offense of conviction, and -- and she gave similar reasons.  That's why -- similar reasons are that the States are too mixed up in this; it will be too difficult to look at that element itself.  So she's trying to analogize that to the $10,000.  Now, why isn't that a good analogy?   INTERRUPTING ",09-60XX
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The exact words of Lopez, which I think are important:  ""We hold that a State offense constitutes a felony punishable under Controlled Substance. ""  ""only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony. ""  Okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  Under Federal law.  Now, there's an ambiguity when you use a word like ""offense"" or ""crime"".  Sometimes you mean what this guy did, and sometimes you're referring to a statute.  It's statutes that proscribe, not what this guy did.  So we're talking about the statute.  So what it tells us to do -- and we said the same thing in Nijhawan, and I have written in other opinions the same thing -- you go read the State statute.  Forget what he's done.  Read the statute and see if the statute proscribes conduct that would amount to a felony under Federal law.  So let us read the statute.  We turn to the statute of conviction.  What it says is it is a class A misdemeanor for which you are punishable of less than a year if you possess less than 28 grams or whatever.  It says nothing about recidivism.  There is no increased punishment for recidivism.  So all we did was read the statute.  The statute does not proscribe conduct that would be a felony under Federal law; it proscribes conduct that would be a misdemeanor.  QED.  This person has not been punished in Texas under a statute that proscribes conduct that would be a felony under Federal law.  End of case.  Now, what is the matter with what I just said?   Stephen G. Breyer  What do you mean, ""a two-step inquiry""?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  No--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Where does it say that?  Where does it say that in the language?  You are looking to the conduct that the statute proscribes, not what he engaged in.  Suppose the State statute says it is a misdemeanor to steal a chicken, okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  It is a misdemeanor.  He is convicted of stealing a chicken.  It turns out that the way he stole the chicken was to burn down the farmhouse.  [Laughter]  That is a felony.  Now, what we have written is: Forget the second.  I've written it in five opinions or four or three, most of which had a majority.  It is called -- it is written right here in this case.  It is written in Nijhawan.  What is it that tells us to go beyond the conduct that the State statute proscribes, not some other thing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where is the additional question?  Read me the words of the statute that -- there might be.  I'm not -- I'm being argumentative, but I want to know what words in the statute say there -- or what words in a case say go look to some other thing beyond what the State statute proscribes?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  What offense?  The offense proscribed--   Stephen G. Breyer  --by State law.  That's why I asked you: Where does the State statute proscribe something that has to do with recidivism?  I've read that State statute three or four times.   Stephen G. Breyer  You go ahead.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask you a related question, which will show what I'm trying -- another thing that's worrying me.  Suppose we're in the Armed Career Criminal Act.  Now, I have -- this is my hypothetical.  You've heard of cat burglars.  Well, this gentleman is called the pussycat burglar, and the reason is he's never harmed a soul.  He only carries soft pillows as weapons.  If he sees a child, he gives them ice cream.  [Laughter]  It is absolutely established that this person in breaking into that house at night only wanted to steal a pop gun, and he is the least likely to cause harm in the world.  Question: He is convicted of burglary.  Is that a crime of violence?  Answer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Correct.   Stephen G. Breyer  The answer is of course, because we are not looking to whether he is the pussycat burglar or the cat burglar.  We are to look to the statute of conviction and see what it is that that behavior forbids -- the statute forbids.  Lewis, Nijhawan say -- do precisely the same thing with this part of that long list.  Indeed, Nijhawan lists this provision as an example of what you would do the same thing for.  Now I'm back to my first question.  Let's do it.  Read the Texas statute.  And where in that Texas statute does it say a word about recidivism or punish that conduct?  Now, if I adopt your position, am I not, not simply overturning Lewis and Nijhawan, but getting a very mixed up area of the law which we have tried to straighten out -- Taylor, ACCA -- once again totally mixed up.  That's my concern.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what was worrying me, that's why I asked the other question.  But the -- what was worrying me would be a statute where they -- it's big enough in the State to cover possession with recidivism or not, and they deal with it at the punishment stage, and I can see your point in respect to that.  But that isn't this statute.  This statute not only doesn't deal with it at the punishment stage; it's forbidden to take it into account because what this says is you can only get recidivism if you previously had a conviction for a class A misdemeanor, and the prior conviction here was a class B; and, therefore, one thing we know about the statute is that under this statute, his behavior as a recidivist is as close to irrelevant as you could make it.  That's why I'm back to the cat burglar.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It did?  Well, Nijhawan uses this provision as an example of where it didn't.   INTERRUPTING ",09-60XX

I mean, imagine a case where it's clear there was a malpractice or an inadequate assistance, and it happened a long time ago and now you have to decide, well, was it prejudicial or not?  It's prejudicial if in the absence of that he would have gone to trial or wouldn't have pleaded guilty, or -- and what's the alternative to trying to figure out whether that's so?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It can't be the State always wins and it can't be the defendant always wins.  So -- so what's the alternative?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, but that is -- isn't that -- sorry, maybe we are just quibbling.  I -- I don't quite see it.  That would seem to me to be going into the plea bargaining process.  Would he have pleaded guilty, what would have happened?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If -- if he had gone to trial, what's the sentence -- what's the range of sentence he could have gotten?   Stephen G. Breyer  And if they had gone back to the grand jury, as the prosecutor I guess could have done, it could have gone to the grand jury?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Might.  See, that's the trouble.  We have a lot of evidence, I think, here, at least by first glance, that -- a lot of evidence he shot the guy.  A lot of evidence he carried -- kidnapped him.  All right?  And now the -- now, maybe it was accidental, but if it was accidental, it's still felony murder; and he received through the plea bargaining the minimum sentence he could get for that.  You started out by saying that the -- the State court's conclusion that this was not prejudicial was clearly wrong.  All right.  If it's clearly wrong, what is it so clear, that he could get off if he went to trial?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There is no -- there is no State court finding that this was not prejudicial?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not talking about Hill.  I don't know the names of the cases associated.  I thought that the court in the State court said -- but I might be wrong; I'd like to know -- made a finding that one, this was not ineffective assistance of counsel and two, it was not prejudicial.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now I haven't read this very thoroughly, so -- so you -- yet -- so you tell me if I'm wrong about that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Doesn't Strickland require that it be prejudicial?   Stephen G. Breyer  If I assume that the word ""fruitless"" and the reference to Strickland were a finding, that this is not prejudicial -- if I assume that for the sake of argument for the moment, what is it that you can show that shows it was prejudicial?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That was the same question I think Justice -- Justice Sotomayor started with.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  I've got on the other -- I've got -- the other reason I asked the question, to be clear about it, is that -- is that he wouldn't have gone to trial in my mind unless he had a pretty good chance of getting a better deal.  And what he -- like getting off.  And what he got was the minimum.  Okay?  One thing I've written down is that the State would not have the confession.  That's correct.  Number two is he could say his brother is not a very good brother.  Moreover he's a rather dubious character there, and bring all that -- stuff.  Was there anything else?   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't want to miss anything.   Stephen G. Breyer  That is an irrelevant question.  I don't see how we could go back to a possibly irrational state of mind.  I mean, don't -- when you're trying to figure out what a defendant would have done in the absence of an error in respect to a plea, don't you have to ask a question: What would a rational person have done.  I mean, I would say that's a good question.  I don't know the answer, but if we are trying to figure out he might have been totally irrational and would have gone to trial even though he was likely to end up in jail for life as opposed to 25 years, we should then reverse it and give him a trial?  I'm rather disturbed by that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What do you actually think about this?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They believe it.  The jury believes it was an accident.  Now, how does that get him a lighter sentence?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  The sentence is 25 years mandatory for felony murder.  Now, the jury believes just what you said.  It believes it was an accident; he never intended to pull the trigger.  How does that get him a lighter sentence?  That's my question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Isn't kidnapping a felony?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  How would you put the rule about when you have to renew a motion?  You move for summary judgment.  Can you say this?  You've looked up the treatises and so forth.  If the motion for summary judgment involves either a question of fact or a mixed question of fact and law, it has to be renewed.  If it involves neither of the others, neither of those two things, but it's a pure question of law and not mixed, it doesn't have to be renewed?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any authority for that?  I mean, is there any -- it seems to be roughly what you are trying to argue, roughly.  At least it seems to me a rule that would make sense.  Is it -- what do you find related to that?  It seems to me that must have been thought about before this minute.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not necessarily by you, but by somebody.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, but -- let -- let's imagine it has nothing to do with qualified immunity.   Stephen G. Breyer  A bread and butter case.   Stephen G. Breyer  You can't appeal a denial of motion for summary judgment.  But there is a trial and the lawyer forgets to renew the motion.  Sometimes he's lost it; I guess sometimes he hasn't.  I would think he would have lost it if it's a mixed question of fact or law or if it's a pure question of fact that the answer turns on.  I would think he hadn't lost it if in fact it is a pure question of law.  But is that the basic hornbook rule out of this context?   INTERRUPTING ",09-737X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But surely it has to be raised post-trial if your legal argument is: Look at the facts; the facts of this case as proved do not support liability.  I mean, I would have thought that was a classic instance where you do have to make the motion.  That's the whole point of having to renew it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Am I wrong?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?  I mean, do you normally -- forget this case.  What the lawyer says is: Judge, they are never going to be able to prove that my client crossed the intersection.  Okay, we go to trial.  At trial, he wants to say: We heard all the evidence now and it doesn't show my client crossed the intersection, so not liable.  Okay?  Doesn't he have to renew it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Fine.  Now, how is yours one bit different?  Because what you're saying is that the evidence, when you look at it, will show the facts are such that there must have been qualified immunity under the law.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  When you go back -- you are the one who read these cases pretty thoroughly, and as I looked at it, I -- with the incomplete knowledge, I would have thought that Justice Ginsburg's statement of it is basically right.  What Rule 50 is about is sufficiency of the evidence.  And 50(a) involves, we are saying it won't be sufficient.  And 50(b) involves it wasn't sufficient.  Then you could have the Chief Justice's rule.  It would work perfectly.  But apparently there is a Second Circuit case and some things in the treatises that says sometimes Rule 50(a) is being used for some other purpose; and that's what seems to be going wrong.  Like if you have a pure question of law, you ought to be outside 50(a).  You ought to be doing some other thing in, you know, a question like: Was there collateral estoppel?  That means that he couldn't say he was a policeman, because they litigated this four months ago.  It's a pure question of law.  So what are these cases and that exception in the treatise about?  What are they thinking of?  What kinds of instances do they think come under 50(a) that aren't sufficiency of the evidence?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Suppose we can say this: That when a lawyer uses 50(a) to make the kind of motion that does not involve sufficiency of the evidence but rather, in fact, could be made without 50(a), under those circumstances he doesn't have to say 50(b).  How would that work?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It would work fine, because it seems to me you have a lot of sufficiency of the evidence claims, but that's another question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Your case, anyway, is a case -- judging from what they wrote, I'm back to where I started with the mixed questions and fact-based questions -- where you really have to renew your motion, and reading your opinion it seems to me it's filled with determinations of fact.  They were reviewing what the jury did and could have found, and on the basis of what they could have found, they say you're not entitled to -- or you are entitled to qualified immunity.  So this would seem like a Hornbook case where you have to make the motion, and if you have to make the motion, you didn't, and if you didn't, you don't go back and review the facts as -- the motion on the basis of the facts as they were before the trial.  End of matter.  What's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I mean they went on the jury's resolution of the facts.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  For that reason, they can't take the facts as they were in your motion for summary judgment.  They have to take them on the basis of -- they can't just go back and review them on the -- yes.   ",09-737X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So far we are just discussing, I take it, whether under (1) the other side is entitled to their benefits even if they weren't hurt, on a contract theory.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But I thought we took the case to decide a different issue.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that is: I will assume you are right, it should have come under (3), but I don't know if that is harmful, whether it was (3) or (1).  And the question I thought we were to decide WAS, if you are under (3), say, where equity is at issue, now equity is at issue and the district court says: Here we have 27,000 people, and now here's how I'm going to go about this.  I'm going to look at this provision mistake here, and the mistake it seems to me was likely to cause some harm.  And once that is shown -- and they showed it, it's likely to cause it harm; we can't be sure, but it's likely -- then it's up to your client to refute case by case that these guys or women were not really harmed.  Okay?  Now, that seems very sensible to me.  And if that's the issue we're going to decide, I would like to hear you explain why that isn't sensible.  It's an equitable matter.  This is simply a way of going about it.  What's wrong with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I agree, but I don't understand -- I'm with you on this one so far.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You are sounding to me as if you are saying there wasn't likely harm.  Okay.  Are you conceding that the standard that they used, the standard was -- the question that you raised at the beginning, whether -- whether the showing of likely harm is sufficient in the absence of a rebuttal?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  That's what I want to hear: What's the argument against that standard?   Stephen G. Breyer  Does ""likely harm"" capture that idea?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?  That's the kind of harm they mean.  What they mean by harm is they were hurt, brought about by reliance.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You object to this decision, saying the following: Of course, the lower court said likely harm is necessary.  As we understand it, given the context of equity, what that means here is that there is reason to believe -- reason to believe -- it was probable that, or some words like that, that there would have been harm caused by reliance on the misstatement.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe it wouldn't be too hard.  They are joined as members of the class in light of a certain set of characteristics and the judge would find that, other things being equal, individuals who have that set of characteristics which in this circumstance make them members of the class would be harmed in all likelihood, okay?  Done.  Now, it's up to -- it's up to the -- the defendant then to show that in a particular case this individual wasn't harmed.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it depends on the facts.  Maybe they'd have a union--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  (j).   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but I still have the same question Justice Scalia had, which is why didn't this (h) thing apply here, because they didn't have, their claim, the notice wasn't good, and if the notice wasn't good then the plan didn't change, and if the plan didn't change they should have gotten the money.  Why didn't it apply?   ",09-804X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Are you finished with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  If you are finished: As I understand what you have been saying and written, you don't mean that the SPD, the summary, is a contract?  I mean, one thing would be to say it's a part of the plan and moreover it's a contract, so therefore we enforce it according to terms.  That's one view.  But if you took that view, you get into problems such as were mentioned.  The employer would write 10,000 pages because he knows it's an enforceable contract.  Nobody would understand it.  You would have to worry about the time when it was less favorable than the written document.  So call it a plan if you want, as long as you don't mean it's an enforceable contract.  Now, there is a provision that deals with it, saying just what you said in response to Justice Alito.  And what I don't understand is why wouldn't that provision govern?  I take it there's a provision, 1054(g)(1), that says a plan cannot reduce the rate of accrual of future benefits unless there is written notice in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant.  So I would have thought, I read that, I get what you've said in your brief.  The summary was inadequate.  It wouldn't have been understood, and therefore, according to this particular provision, those provisions in the plan that reduce benefits are void.  So now we enforce the plan with the -- in the absence of those particular void provisions, and you get what you want.  Now, I thought that makes a lot of sense to me, except I don't see that anywhere in this case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So there's some reason it doesn't seem to appear in the opinions.  It doesn't appear in the briefs.  It doesn't appear anywhere until you just mentioned it in response to Justice Alito, or seemed to.   Stephen G. Breyer  It is?   Stephen G. Breyer  (h).  He's right, it's (h).   Stephen G. Breyer  I understand that.  So suppose we can't reach that, which would seem to be the logical thing to govern this, but we can't, okay.  Then we only have two choices.  The first choice is (1)(b), which seems to -- you want to use that by treating the summary as a contract, or we go to (3), in which case we are under equity.  Now, between those two, the first one gets all the problems that we just were talking about.  The second one would seem to be you are free and clear as long as you show some kind of reliance and harm, and then we are back to what I thought we granted this for, which is why not say if harm is likely then the burden shifts?   Stephen G. Breyer  What happens in a trust law where, let's say, there are 10 or 50,000 beneficiaries in a trust, and -- and the trustee has indeed made an error.  And now they can recover money only if, only if there really has been harm.  Now, how does -- how does trust law work that out?  This can't be the first time this ever arose in history.  We have a big class.   Stephen G. Breyer  Could they here have gone -- could they also have said to the company: Look, why are you doing this?  If interest rates fall, we are going to lose money.  But interest rates might rise, and if interest rates rise, you'll lose money.  So we're risk-averse, so what we would like to do is just make sure we get the same pension that we would under Plan A, and then if there is more on Plan B add it in, and we'll risk the fact that interest rates might have gone up.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They could -- they might have talked the company into it.   Stephen G. Breyer  But the SPD is written by the fiduciary.   Stephen G. Breyer  And the other is written by the -- by the person who is giving the money, the employer.  So now you are saying that it's a contract, even though it wasn't written by the employer, and even though it could differ in dozens of ways from the actual -- from the actual plan document.  Sometimes they would be favorable to the employee, sometimes they would be unfavorable, sometimes they would be different but neutral.  So what's the judge supposed to do?  Forget about the basic document and just enforce this thing written by the fiduciary?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I said that there can be conflicts, sometimes favorable to the employee, sometimes unfavorable, sometimes neutral.  So what we have is a document that's, by the way, supposed to be short, but I guess if we took your view it wouldn't be short anymore.  And -- and it -- it could differ in any one of three ways; and I could think of seven other ways.  So -- and we'll find seven others.  So what -- how is a judge supposed to react?  He's supposed to say that this twopage document is the contract, is the contract, and there are all kinds of conflicts -- what's supposed to happen?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That isn't my question.  My question is: One, why should a document written by a different person, the fiduciary, govern over the actual plan?  Second, what happens when you have a favorable conflict, what happens when you have an unfavorable conflict, what happens when you have a neutral conflict?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How should it be worked out?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I think the fact that this individual in this case happened to be the same group or person is beside the point of my question.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why do you feel the need to go beyond, say, what the AFL-CIO identifies as a normal oral failing -- filing?  They use language like, at the initial stage of the grievance procedure, there is confrontation with an eye to fact finding, and the dispute is joined when the employee or the steward or supervisor come face-to-face to identify, to discuss, and hopefully to resolve a problem.  Now that's a formal kind of relationship.  It doesn't involve a cocktail party, and yet it is done orally.  And there is a tradition as to how that works.  But from you've said, I gather that you want to go well beyond that and provide that cocktail parties -- perhaps not cocktail parties, but just a tap on the shoulder would be sufficient, where I take it that would normally be sufficient in the grievance process.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Suppose I think that that provides a good precedent for -- for oral filings.  What happens then?  What am I supposed to do in your case?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, we are talking about a filing.  In the grievance process -- I don't want to repeat it, but it seems to me form having read the brief that filing takes place without writing, provided that there are these other safeguards which are described.  Now, I want to know in your opinion, is there a reason for not importing that into this system?  I take it you win the case -- or maybe you lose it, I don't know how it works on the fact.  I don't know what the filing was.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There is a word ""filing"" in the AFL-CIO statute as well.  So I am looking for a way of interpreting the one in light of the other.  Do you favor that?  Are you against that?  If so, why or why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Fine.  It's a perfectly normal use of speech, I accept that.  But what is it that would surround this use of speech on a particular occasion with enough formality that we know it isn't something that could pass unnoticed and bring in a whole lot of things like the cocktail party example, et cetera?  I noticed there was a paragraph in the AFL-CIO -- that's why I brought it up.  Is that the right standard?  What we say here may take effect or have influence, so -- so I want to say it correctly.  What kinds of oral complaints count as filing a complaint?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But I would like more than that.  The Government sees these statutes as a whole, so I would like the Government's assistance on what words to write to be able to get this right so it will not be too formal, it will not be too informal, it will do the job.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, fill in this blank then, there must be surrounding the oral complaint sufficient elements of formality such that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But it's on a form.  So we have got that -- that helps a lot.  Also an employer could have a notice.  Notice, if you really are upset because you think there is a violation going here, go to this microphone which is directly connected to the complaint department and cite the statute.  That would work, too.  [Laughter]  But -- but there have been years and years of -- you have just said, of statutes like this, you say that many of them operate orally.  All right.  What kind of thing, if you can help, maybe you can't -- which is dangerous, but then we just try to do our best, and we don't have the labor law experience necessarily, but -- but what is the -- the form of words that we can use to separate the wheat from the chaff?

Breyer  Maybe it's 30 years.  Maybe it's 30.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, Chevron deference would depend on an intent.  I guess you are getting into an argument here that there's no reason to repeat in public.  I mean, Justice Scalia and I don't necessarily agree on this.  Why would you--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Why?   Stephen G. Breyer  How do we know?  I mean, all right, if you want to get into it, this is a very minor sort of interstitial point in a statute that they administer, and there are lots of instances, I think where the Court has said, where these minor matters of how you work out the actual application of the word are implicitly delegate it to the agency to determine within the context of reasonable view.   Stephen G. Breyer  But not everything has to be done through formal rules.  There -- there are many, many ways of agencies determining practice.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  Why would it be different?  If an agency work out a system of deciding when a person is really making a complaint, as opposed to an offhand remark, and that is good enough to run the government of the United States, where they have -- where they are in this business, why -- why couldn't whatever their indicia are there, also be transplanted to the private sector--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and get that to work out all right--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --in which case you would be left, if you are going to say that might work, then -- the you are left with the simple argument that you don't think that this statute means to apply to complaints to an employer, written or oral?   Stephen G. Breyer  Would you accept -- you think -- that a tenable interpretation?  What this means is that written complaints are good enough to count as filings where you complained to your private employer, but written or oral count as a filing where you deal to -- with the government agency?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, it isn't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, I agree with you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  On the ground itself, is there anything in the legislative history of the statute that says it's limited to the government?   Stephen G. Breyer  That could be.  It could be that they are thinking of malicious complaints and they are thinking of government agencies at the time, but neither their language nor their purpose, as history later shows, requires that limitation on scope.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is it -- is it -- the -- the answer to Justice Ginsberg's question -- I was uncertain.  Suppose a student is working 45 hours a week in the grounds department cutting lawns, and he does -- cutting the school lawn, and he earns enough money to help his way through college.  Now, I thought, under this, that he is not within this statute because it's 45 hours and not 40?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then it's not.  Okay.  So -- so, what they're doing is -- it started out with the word ""student"" and the word ""service"" performed in the statute.  Then, for many, many years, they have talked about the employment, how it has to be incident to the study.  And ""incident"" is the key word.  And so now what they have done is interpret their own word, ""incident"", as saying if it bulks too large in comparison with the -- with the studying, it's not incident to the study.  It's a separate thing.  And that's true whether it happens to be medical school or it happens to be lawnmowing.  They can't -- they don't want it as so big in comparison to the study that it's not really part of trying to get the study.  It's just too big.  And they use the 40 for that.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now if you are going to admit the word 40 hours a week?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no -- didn't as interpreted -- it's not -- it's that -- I concede everything you say: It's a total learning experience and it's a special learning experience.  The problem I was having that I wanted your answer to is that they have for many, many years said: Just because it's a pure learning experience and nothing but a pure learning experience, you still can't get this exemption unless the work is incident to that experience.  And by ""incident"" we mean it can't bulk too large--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --in respect to the whole.  So the problem for you is not that it's not education.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's that the work is the education.   Stephen G. Breyer  I looked it up in the dictionary, and meaning number one of ""incident"" is: An accompanying minor occurrence or -- occurrence or condition.  Minor.  In other words, there's the big thing, and then there's the incident.  Now, if that's the meaning, well, this is 40.  It's trying to get at whether it's minor or the whole--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, that's because of the second meaning here.  It's very surprising.  I'm found, first, reading the statute in the last case, and now I am reading the dictionary.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  And here what it is says is: Something arising or resulting from something else of greater or principal import.  So they are trying to work out, with that word ""incident"", is the studying of greater or principal import?  And what they are saying is, when it's 40 hours a week, this other thing, the studying, is not of greater import.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Rather, it's -- let's say it's of equal import.

Breyer  And the odd thing is that -- that kind of appeal takes place either days or possibly weeks after the defendant may already have appealed his conviction to the higher court.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that right?  That normally happens?   Stephen G. Breyer  And what I'm curious about is what happens if the court affirms that sentence, let's say two months after it already affirmed the conviction?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Which is the judgment pursuant to which -- which is the judgment that became final by conclusion of direct review?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The person is not being held in custody pursuant to a judgment of the State court, or at least a relevant judgment, until the sentence has been appealed.  Then there is the conclusion of direct review in respect to the judgment in respect to which he is being held in custody.  I'm just reading the statute, the Federal statute.   Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's why I don't -- that's why I am confused.  I look at the language of the Federal statute and it seems to me that this individual is not being held in custody pursuant to a judgment until that sentence is final.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the sentence is final in the lower court, but they say when the sentence is final at the conclusion of direct review in respect to that sentence, which hasn't even taken place yet.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Then you are going to say--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can you explain--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Can you go back for a second?  Imagine that the defendant is convicted of robbery and he's sentenced to ten years.  He thinks there is an error in my conviction of a legal nature and he thinks there is another error in my sentence of a legal nature.  Now, I take it in Rhode Island he files an appeal to consider the first?   Stephen G. Breyer  And as to the second, he files a Rule 35 motion?   Stephen G. Breyer  And when does he file the Rule 35 motion, because it says at any time?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, it doesn't say that.  It says a court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.  It has nothing to do with mercy.  I want to know how it works.  He says there is a legal error in my sentence.  When -- how does he get that corrected?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Don't take what I have as my view.  I just want the fact.  I'm asking you a fact.  How and when does the person correct the legal error in his sentence?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where?   Stephen G. Breyer  If the trial court says no, what does he do.   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  Okay.  So now we have two appeals.  One is from the judgment of conviction; another is from the judgment imposing the sentence.  Now, the Federal statute says a one-year period of limitation shall apply from the date on which the judgment became final.  Correct?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  When is the date on which the judgment of the sentence became final?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if they are not -- they are not -- if they are not at the same time, then what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why not the sentence?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In April they affirm the conviction.  In June they affirm the sentence.  Do those two months -- is the date on which the judgment became final by conclusion of direct review, does that run from April or from June?   Stephen G. Breyer  June.  Okay.  Now suppose he doesn't.  Suppose that there were no appeals from the -- I see.  Our problem is that there is no appeal from the judgment -- from the sentence where he asks for correction as a matter of mercy and not law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There may be?   Stephen G. Breyer  What I'm trying to figure out is why, if you are willing to call for purposes of one -- the one-year statute begins to run from the time the direct appeal becomes final.  Why is it a direct appeal of a sentence where you appeal the matter of law and it isn't a direct appeal of a sentence where you ask for mercy?  It's the same rule.  It's the same procedure.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  This would help you just as much, I imagine.  I'm just trying to get it straight in my mind.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You see, my basic question is: Why -- look.  Two appeals, one judgment, one sentence.  Okay?  January, June.  You are prepared to say the one-year statute does not begin to run until June.  Fine.  The Rule 35 motion, when you took an appeal, became final for purposes of a Federal habeas statute in June.  So why doesn't the Rule 35 motion become final under (1)(a) of the habeas statute, whenever that is decided, finally?  Why is it collateral at all?  Why isn't it direct, just as your first one was direct?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Wait a minute.  Judgment of what?  Judgment of conviction or judgment of sentence?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's the same reason that it doesn't become final when you have not appealed your sentence yet, or when they haven't -- they didn't consolidate.  I am quite confused, as you see, as to how this all works in Rhode Island.  Rhode Island -- I used to be on the First Circuit.  I know it has some special ways of doing things.  They are sometimes different, and this is different.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There must be in Rhode Island some complaints about the sentence.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Both.   ",09-868X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I thought that Discover Bank is the California case that sets it out; is that correct?   Stephen G. Breyer  So that's California law.  And what they say in Discover Bank is -- they are talking about class waivers in both arbitration contracts and not arbitration contracts.  And they say they are void when it's a consumer contract of adhesion, when they predictably involve small amounts of damages, when it is claimed that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme deliberately to cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money, and the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party from responsibility for its own fraud.  Now, seems to -- those seem to be the principles that apply.  Those principles apply to litigation.  They apply to arbitration.  What's the problem?  They don't say anything there about the things you mention.  They just mention four things, which I just read.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I would guess it's like Switzerland having a law saying, we only buy milk from cows who are in pastures higher than 9,000 feet.  That discriminates against milk from the rest of the continent.  But to say we want cows that have passed the tuberculin test doesn't.  So I guess we have to look at the particular case.  And here, my impression is -- correct me if I am wrong -- the class arbitration exists.  It's not a -- it's not like having a jury trial.  You could have it in arbitration.  You can have it in litigation.  So where is the 9,000-foot cow, or whatever it is?  Where is the discrimination?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why, why, why?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  That's I think what Justice Kagan is getting at.  If a State wants to have a doctrine which says, you have to have a seal of a certain kind on certain kinds of contracts, they've never done it before, but now they do it, and on that kind you have to have a seal both on the arbitration contract and on the other.  And here what they've done is they have listed the four characteristics from Discover Bank, and they've said all contracts to do with litigation have to satisfy those four.  At which point I think Justice Kagan said, so what if they've never done this before?  They sure have done it now.  And what's the basis for saying that the Arbitration Act or any other part of Federal law forbids California from doing that?   ",09-893X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Your brother says that the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --You have to -- you would do it differently, because they might be telling the truth.  The example that your brother lawyer gave is this: That we have a State and the State says, if you have a contract, in the dispute resolution provision, whether you have arbitration or not, that provision is void if it says you won't have a judge, and it's void if it says you won't have a jury, and it's void if it says that you will not go to the United States courthouse for deciding all Federal claims.  That applies whether there is an arbitration clause or not an arbitration clause.  Now, that would seem to me no subterfuge.  It is absolutely clear.  They are not lying.  It just happens to prevent arbitration.  And he says that's absolutely true of this one, that once you get into class actions you will discover you have something that really looks like a court case.  You have to have discovery, you have dozens of lawyers involved, you have depositions, you are running off every 5 minutes to the judge or to somebody to say is this deposition good, bad or indifferent.  You have methods for enforcing the deposition.  You have all kinds of things.  He can make a much bigger list than me.  So he says: This case is like the case of California saying everybody can decide it any way they want as long as they do it before a Federal judge.  Okay?  Now what's your answer to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  But what's your answer to his specific effort to assimilate the issue in this case, which is the class action, to the made-up issue, which you concede is a discrimination?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about -- what about a rule that says what you have to have in any contract is a rule that all the rules of the Federal Civil Procedure apply to discovery, not necessarily in a courtroom, but you have to follow exactly those procedures?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, why isn't this obstacle preemption?   Stephen G. Breyer  Where do we look to find the answer?  I mean, I understand your answer and I know the other side's going to say: Well, this is a tremendous obstacle.  If I have one person to deal with, I say: You want your $75, I will offer you $75, and if you don't take it and I turn out to be wrong, I'm going to give you $7,500.  That's their system.  Right?  So they say the alternative is class action.  There are a million customers.  I'm faced with a claim for $75 million.  I can't afford that.  I'll settle it, even if I'm right.  So if you have your rule, I'm going to be facing these things all the time.  I'm not -- I'm not going to enter into arbitration agreements.  I will take my chances in court.  Okay?  Now, that -- that's their argument.  So it is empirical, in part: What do I look to?  It's not logic.  It's a question of where should I -- what should I read to show, in your opinion, you're right?   ",09-893X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You do.  You do, but the difficulty that I -- I don't get the answer to Justice Ginsburg's first question.  Of course you have all kinds of costs dealing with ownership, but what the IRS says, what it says in the statute, is you are supposed to take the applicable costs from IRS.  And what it has on page 5a is it has something called ownership costs.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it defines those as $471.   Stephen G. Breyer  And then on 3a, where it says what ownership costs are, it says  ""The transportation standards consist of nationwide figures for monthly loan or lease payments, referred to as ownership costs. ""  So when I read that, I said: Ownership costs means monthly loan or lease payments, nothing else.  Now, you have all kinds of other things.  It's just these words ""ownership costs"" don't refer to those other things, because of that definition given right there.  That's what I thought Justice Ginsburg was initially asking.   Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and how do you get out of that what I think of as very, very clear language which says what these standards refer to?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but it doesn't -- for example, suppose you buy a dozen apples every month and they cost you $48 extra.  You are not going to say the ownership costs refer to the apples, even if you decorate the car with them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, ownership costs refers to lease and loan payments.  Nothing else.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there something wrong with the IRS saying what they mean?  It says  ""Ownership costs means monthly loan or lease payments. ""  Now, is there something--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --That's what it says it means.  Now, is there something illegal about it defining ownership costs in that way?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is -- we've got about half the courts in the country agreeing with you.  And so you've read all those arguments, and what in your opinion is the best one on the point, again, where I am stuck, which is Justice Ginsburg's original point.  I mean, I can think of millions of examples.  You have a form that says the employer says entertainment expenses and it defines entertainment expenses as food and transport, and they leave out movies, you know.  Or you could have vacation expenses and vacation expenses are defined as transport and hotel, and they leave out meals.  And here we have a definition of ownership expenses and they say leasing and loaning and they leave out other forms of ownership.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, the argument is, well, that's what they mean by it, so that's what applicable.  Now, what's the best argument against that in those 50 cases?  Why is it trying -- why to try to get an expense which isn't loan or lease?  Have you any more right to it than if you tried to get an expense to my totally irrelevant apples?  I mean, it doesn't fit within the applicable definition.  What's the answer?   Stephen G. Breyer  I've looked at the form.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Ownership.   Stephen G. Breyer  Two pages earlier they say what they mean by the word ""ownership"".   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Half the courts say, oh, you just sort of imagine what ownership expenses are and anything that they can fall within that general English language word is what they can deduct; is that their approach?  Because if you go longer you say cut off the definition, cut off the definition from the word ""ownership"", don't use it.  So what do we use to define what ownership is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know, but it's for ownership, it's not for, for example, whistling; it's for ownership.  So how do we define what that $471 attaches to?  Do we use a State common law definition or something?  How have they done it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why don't we?   ",09-907X

Breyer  I think it is -- well, I'm trying to work out what was his point.  And I don't blame him for this.  But trying to figure it out, he says look: This whole thing was written for a different purpose than the IRS and if we start reading all those things from the beginning into the tables we are really going to get into a mess.  For example, we are going to give people deductions when they have lease payments, even though they are not owners when they have lease payments.  The company owns -- not even an ownership expense, but it does say use the lease payment, and then it has all these other things.  So forget it; do a simple thing.  It says ownership expense.  You go to the registry of motor vehicles and you say, is Smith the owner?  And they will tell you, yes or no.  And if the answer is yes, he deducts $471.  Sometimes that's too little, sometimes that's too much.  But once we depart from that, we are really in a nightmare of trying to figure out what all these things mean that were written for other purposes.  So what do you say to that?   ",09-907X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  I am not certain, as I find this a difficult case.  It seems to me the government is prepared to concede that if an individual has a Federal right that he would like to enforce and someone is trying to block it by asserting a State law that he thinks is preempted, he can go ahead.  If it looks as if the State is going to take something from him that a Federal law guarantees and he has a defense that he would like to make to that under Federal law, the State law seems to allow, it is preempted, he can make it.  Our problem arising where neither of those things is true.  So we say, what is true here?  What kind of Federal claim does he have?  And the word is that rates have to be -- that the rate that the State has to pay back to the doctor has to be ""sufficient"".  Okay, ""sufficient"".  That's basically the word.   Stephen G. Breyer  So I see three possibilities.  One is you say, sure, let all the doctors go and sue.  There are only 50,000 kinds of reimbursement.  Maybe there are a million.  I don't know how many.  And they only take place in like, say, 400,000 counties.  And we will have Federal judges reaching different views about what is sufficient in each of those different places.  And sometimes they will agree.  Did Congress want that?  Well, hm, a problem.  The second way of going about it is cure that and say you win, but you have to use primary jurisdiction and you have to get the government's view on it, Judge; and before you decide, you have to pay attention.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There is a long line of cases -- I have one more thing and then you'll get all three.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  If I want your view, I want your view on whether the right approach -- you are saying what is the status quo pending.  And I want your view on these three possibilities:  One is the possibility the judges just do it in all the different places, try to figure out what is sufficient.  The second is the possibility that we try primary jurisdiction, and that's the -- then the curlicue on that is what do you do pending.  And that's your injunction.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  And the third possibility is, you say I'm just sorry, that this is just too vague, the sufficient, et cetera.  It has to be centralized.  There is no way to work this out with all these different judges and different rates and different kinds of provisions, and so this is an instance where you cannot bring your claim that something violates the Supremacy Clause because you don't have a Federal right to a thing, and you are not trying to take away a thing that the Federal right gives you, et cetera.  Do you see those three possibilities?   Stephen G. Breyer  And what I wanted you to do is address them.   Stephen G. Breyer  You think primary jurisdiction is the way to do it.   Stephen G. Breyer  I see a practical problem and the practical problem is millions of rates all judged by the term ""sufficient"" and instead of the agency in charge deciding what's sufficient, we do have a lot of judges.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   Stephen G. Breyer  There must be a limit.  There must be a limit because if there is not a limit under what you can do under Ex parte Young, I can go in my office and I look at the statute books and they are just filled with statutes, and I -- Federal; and if I have all the State statute books there would be 15 offices or 20 or 100; and I know perfectly well that a lot of those statutes in the Federal books have to do with Federal agencies, and they give jobs to agencies, and it's perfectly apparent that the ones who run those statutes in many instances are the agencies, and really judges are out of it.  Now if I adopt your line, it seems to me I am saying that any time that a person has an individual of saying that a State law is contrary to one of those statutes, he can run right into court.  And I can see we've done that where he has some kind of right that he is protecting that is threatened in some way or that he wants to assert.  I can see that we could do that in the foreign policy case like Burma; I see that we could do that where Federal voting rights are at stake, which are very important.  But a principle that says you can do that any time you want, seems to me a little -- it seems to me the real fear of far reaching, in the extent that it just stops the agency of doing their business at the behest of anyone who would like to assert a State law, or States -- it's a mess, in other words.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  Your people have your problem.  But some other people have another problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Then is it constitutional if we get a new system?  Here's what the system will be: The taxpayers who are religious will be able to check a box and the check that they send to the IRS -- it's a possible system -- what happens is that that check is cashed by an official and the cash is given to the local priest to say prayers for the individual who contributed the money.  And in your view, there is no one who could challenge that?   Stephen G. Breyer  The difference is, of course, that in the one case it's a deduction and in this case you are paying it 100 percent with money that would otherwise go into the coffer.  I understand that.  But I am interested in, conceptually, does the government think that there is no one who could challenge that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you go back into history, it could have been the case that the -- as long as they were fair to every religion, the first Congress could have funded prayers throughout the nation in churches for anyone to go and pray and that would not have violated the Establishment Clause, or if it had, nobody could have challenged it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Flast is gone; is that right?  Flast is gone.  There is no more -- there is nothing more to Flast, because it just happened that nobody had thought of this system at the time of Flast.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Breyer  Something that worried me in Zelman is this, and I might get your answer.  Probably Arizona spends some billions of dollars on public schools, doesn't it?  I don't know what the exact amount is.   Stephen G. Breyer  Let's take 30 or 40 percent of that and spend it through this program on religious schools.  Imagine that happens.  At that point people might get into considerable discussion about what qualifies, when it doesn't qualify, whether it's a balanced school or is it just teaching religion, and what the rules and regulations are.  How is Arizona dealing with this problem?  By saying there are no regulations, by saying that we're not -- is there a system for dealing with the legitimacy and circumstances under which a particular religion's schools qualify for this program?  Who decides and how?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that must be a set of regulations and rules.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And when do they teach the religion part of their program?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, when does a private school -- normally the schools -- I'm not an expert, but what you have to do to be a school is a very complex thing, and you have all kinds of requirements that eat up quite a lot of the day.  And I just wonder how the religion part fits in.  Has there turned out to be no problem?  When do they -- do they teach religion at 6:00 in the morning?  Does it matter if the person's qualified?  How does the -- I once had a case on this in the First Circuit and it came out to be surprisingly complex, and I just wondered how -- if there turned out to be any problem at all in Arizona in this area.   Stephen G. Breyer  Flast, I looked at again briefly, and it seemed to use that wonderfully precise word nexus.  And you are quite right that in Flast that was the case.  But why isn't it, given that it is a nexus in Flast, what was in Flast, why isn't it also a nexus where you have this complicated system which is designed to make the ordinary taxpayer pay a little more in this kind of instance, where what you've done is directly subtract from the treasury $5,000 cash to turn over, in the view of the plaintiffs, to a purely forbidden religious purpose?   Stephen G. Breyer  Was that in that instance in Flast -- does Flast rule out?   ",09-987X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  If you assume that it is a -- I see your argument there.  Now, in Zelman the holding, I would think -- which I was not in agreement with, but it's now law -- that government can have a -- a spending program.  And what they did was the government spent money in the form of vouchers to be given to private individuals to use for such education as they wish, that met certain standards, including religious schools.  So what's the difference between the program here and the one that was held constitutional in Zelman?   Stephen G. Breyer  But who here says to the parent who is going to the school, what is your religion?   Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, the STO gives the scholarship only to Catholics to go to Catholic schools--   Stephen G. Breyer  --only to Jews to go to Jewish schools?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose they change one rule and the rule that the STOs had was this, they said: We will give you tuition if you otherwise qualify for your child to go to the school that you wish to go to, and if you are Jewish or you are Protestant and you want to go to St. Joseph's Catholic school, that's absolutely fine, they won't kick you out, and vice versa.  Now, in your opinion that then would be constitutional?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The answer is yes?   Stephen G. Breyer  So the only thing you are challenging is the rule that they will not -- the STOs will not give the scholarship to a Protestant to go to a Catholic school.  How do we know they would -- that that is the rule.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Ah.  Ah, but that's--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That's different.  You were complaining about: I'm Jewish; I want my child, let's say, to go to St. Joseph's; and -- so now, do I qualify or not?  The only thing--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Your -- your complaint is only with the STOs that wouldn't let you send the child.   Stephen G. Breyer  We know that they exist because?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is the problem with that?  That is to say, suppose that the government gives its money to put CAT scans in hospitals.  And it has certain beneficiaries.  And one group of beneficiaries is the Association Of Catholic Hospitals, another is the Association Of Jewish Hospitals, another is a set of totally secular hospitals.  So it gives the tax credits to all three.  Now, of course the Catholic group is going to give it to Catholic hospitals and so forth.  What is wrong with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  What they do is they have government money, just like you claim this is, and they say we are going to give it to umbrella organizations like the Association Of Catholics, Jewish or secular hospitals and we expect them to distribute it.  And they will, of course, distribute it to those who are their members and in some cases their members are religious organizations and in some cases they are not.  Now, what is the difference between that and what happens here, leaving the student out of it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The beneficiaries of the government, Catholic hospital -- government CAT scan program will be Catholic hospitals, because they're the ones who belong to the Catholic Hospital Association.  Money will also go to the Secular Hospital Association, as it goes to a secular STO here.  So I don't see that part.  That's the last prong that we are talking about.   Stephen G. Breyer  The government says -- that's the different -- the government says -- it does give the money away on a religiously neutral basis, it gives it to hospital associations.  It turns out that some of those naturally are supposed to give it to their members, all of whom will be religiously affiliated.   ",09-987X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So what are you supposed to do if your company happens by chance to come across a very, very high correlation between people who take your generic drug and who get seriously ill?  And now what you know is that nobody else has really found that, but, my goodness, there you are; it happened that it was associated, a special group or something.  What are you supposed to do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And so are they saying that you -- is it conceded in this case that you did tell the FDA everything you knew about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or is that a point in dispute?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, how would it conflict?  Suppose the State said: Here is what we want; we notice that it says in the Federal law that you must keep your warnings up to date, and if you find an association, you must revise your warning.  Now, we understand you can't do that without FDA approval.  But as far as our State is concerned, we think that when you come across this serious problem you have to tell the FDA in some form or other, a reasonable form, about it.  Would that law -- is there anything Federal that that law would conflict with?   Stephen G. Breyer  What I wonder -- see, I wonder if that's this case.  I wonder if this case is what they're saying is: Oh, we concede you told the FDA every single thing, so they were just as informed as you are about the risks here, but you did not add the words: And please change our -- your permission, so that we can change the warning.  Is that what this case is about?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  When they come up here they might say this isn't just what this case is about.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So your argument is that if we run across this tremendous, really serious -- I can make an imaginary as serious as you want -- really a serious problem, and you're saying the State has no right to say -- even if we purposely didn't tell anybody, they can't get involved because they can't get involved with our failure to tell the FDA anything because that's Federal, and we can't -- they can't get involved with our failure to try to change the warning because that's taken care of by our obligation to tell them, which we didn't fulfill?   ",09-993X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  It appears also that the -- it's Buckman, it seems to me, the relevant case, not Wyeth, because what -- if -- you're now saying, I've learned, that -- that they have a set of FDA duties; they must tell the FDA every detail.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That sounds awfully familiar to Buckman, where the State claim was basically a claim of fraud on the FDA.  And we said it's not up to the State to -- to -- they can't bring -- have a claim for fraud on the FDA.  The FDA has to enforce their own stuff.  And why isn't the same true here, that the FDA has to enforce their own legal requirement to tell us everything you know?  What's the answer to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, because Levine involves the Wyeth case, right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  The -- the difference there is the difference that the SG points out: There is a broad-ranging obligation for the initial drugmaker to tell the FDA all kinds of things and change the warnings.  But here the FDA tells us they have no power to change their warnings.  They can't, unlike Levine.  They have to copy the original maker.  So -- I'm -- I'm just referring there to the whole SG brief.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Be sure you answer, please, my original question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose they had.  Suppose that -- is a generic required to file adverse incident reports?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, imagine a company that files every adverse incident report, complies completely; period.  Now, in your view does it have an additional obligation?   Stephen G. Breyer  And what is that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, their argument is that in respect to their failure to do the first, that's Buckman.  That is similar to Buckman.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now.  And that's what I -- now, as to the second, it just doesn't add anything.  The FDA has all that information.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, why is it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Your basic argument, I'm getting this now, that -- I think -- is that the failure is, where State law has a right to enter, is to require them to keep track of adverse incidents and other things in the -- and do their best to change the label, which will consist of going to the FDA, likely, and asking them to change.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I guess if the situation were such that a lawyer who is representing a client and has to figure out, has there been too much delay or not, suppose he looked into the situation thoroughly and he said, gee, I just have no idea, because half the cases come out one way and half of them come out the other way.  Could he then go to the California Supreme Court and say,  ""Court, look what you have been doing? ""  And would the court then grant a hearing on that and possibly correct it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So you are saying there is no such evidence.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I suspected from reading this.  But if there were such evidence is there a route in California that they could deal with it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes?   Stephen G. Breyer  Adequacy of notice, because no notice might be an inadequate notice.   Stephen G. Breyer  And if it's absolutely divided 50/50 you have no notice.  You don't know what will happen.  And it isn't a rule to say, oh, this is our rule, you don't know what will happen.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I agree with you, we are in hypothetical, never-never land so far.  But it's possible your opponents will convince us it's real land and not never-never land.   ",09-996X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's a puzzle to me.  I mean, Justice Scalia's question was courts all the time, they all the time, they don't decide an issue of whether it's filed too late because it's the simplest thing just to decide the merits.  It's the same result.  And sometimes they don't do that.  But that happens often in a district court on appeal and triple in a supreme court which has hundreds or thousands of questions for review.  So how do we know that that simple practice, which I have never heard of as attacked as unconstitutional, how do we know that that isn't what's going on?   Stephen G. Breyer  But that's -- they -- what's your point?  800 are silent.  What does that show?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then you can make any claim against him.  What I wonder, maybe this is where I'm leading, the California Supreme Court is not the only court in California where people file for habeas petitions, is it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  So why if there is inconsistency in this rule, wouldn't somebody go look at the decisions in the appellate courts which write the reasons down, and then you would know whether it is being decided, applied consistently or not inconsistently.  Why look at a blank wall?  Why not look at people who write opinions and then you will find out?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, of course not.  But is your claim, are you conceding or are you conceding, are you denying, are you just saying nothing about whether the practice in this rule, applying the rule of substantial unexcused delay disqualifies you for -- that's the rule, isn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Are you saying it's being applied consistently or inconsistently or you do not know?   Stephen G. Breyer  In all courts below the California Supreme Court?   Stephen G. Breyer  So you do not know.  So what you have done your research on are questions that cannot be answered due to the fact that a supreme court normally doesn't say why when it denies something, but you haven't looked into the research that is readily obtainable, which is these are courts that write opinions.  Have I gotten that correctly?  Because if that's correct--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  Then I don't see why you didn't because it would be easy if you are right to show this from the lower courts, but of course if you are wrong, it wouldn't be easy, then a blank wall is better than nothing.  Now, what can you say that will disabuse me of the notion that I just expressed?   Stephen G. Breyer  But there is something called sampling techniques and sampling techniques are designed to limit the burden.  I'm not saying it wouldn't be burdensome, but you have examined thousands of cases.  So I'm back to my original question and statisticians, many of whom would like to help you perhaps if you could find some, could do this for you, I think.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The wrong court.  And amicus did it from the time that the case was filed, while the rule is you start the period of running from the case when the person should reasonably have known his issue, which isn't the same time as the time his case was divided against.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's like having rules; when you have rules and say 60 days or 90 days, you find impossible cases that you should have heard because it was the 91st day or it was the 92nd day, and then you give the people equitable discretion to depart from it, and pretty soon you get litigation over that.  I mean, there is no perfect system.   ",09-996X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't understand.  Could you answer the original question that Justice Sotomayor asked?  She said: What happens in Arizona?  You said a prisoner, or defendant, he has been convicted, gone through his first round of appeal.  He is given a form, which you said was a simple form, do you want to proceed in collateral review?  And he answers yes.  Then does Arizona appoint a lawyer or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Then what are we arguing about?  He had his lawyer.   Stephen G. Breyer  Ah, so now you are talking about the second round.  You are talking about does he have a right to a lawyer when he wants to claim that the first lawyer that they gave him on collateral review was ineffective?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is the issue?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So why -- that's what I thought, actually; and I don't understand what all the briefs are about, and I must be missing something, about whether they are all going to have to appoint lawyers or not in these different States.  It seems to me that has nothing to do with this case.  This case comes out of a State that does appoint lawyers and the question is whether you, your client, should have from your point of view at least one full, effective chance to say, every lawyer I have been appointed, I've gotten 100 and they are all terrible, and -- or whether the State can block that from being heard in habeas, by saying, oh, no, we gave him 19 and the claim that all 19 were ineffective, he can't even raise.  That's the issue, is that it?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no -- but I'm not -- I'm not ridiculing as it sounded your claim.  I'm saying maybe that's right.  Maybe he's not going to win the claim, probably; but the question is, if his claim is in Federal habeas, I have gotten 102 lawyers in 102 proceedings and every one of them was absolutely ineffective, perhaps that habeas judge has to look at it and say oh, I see, he's claiming he never had one full effective chance to claim that his trial lawyer was ineffective because the other 19 was just as bad -- I have to look at it if I'm a trial judge.  Now, that is not a silly argument in my opinion; that could be a winning argument.  I just want to know is that basically your argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now let's start at ground zero, sorry.  Everyone else--  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  But you can -- you can have a -- you don't have to give him a counsel.  Look, the State did give him a counsel on first collateral review; that counsel was supposed to, according to him, raise the claim, my trial counsel was no good.  Now we go to the next round.  The State says: I'm sorry, you are on your own here; we are not giving you a lawyer anymore.  Okay.  That may count.  He now has to know he has to make the argument himself.  And therefore he goes and makes the argument himself, and now he's in habeas and he can argue they got it all wrong.  He's not blocked.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So what -- there isn't an issue in this case about giving people counsel, on that view.  There is an issue about if you do give them counsel, then they have to be able to have an argument later that you did it ineffectively.  That's a different matter; that's a question of whether you are blocked in habeas and can't even make the claim.  All right, forget it.  I will ask the other.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, okay.   ",10-1001
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  This is not -- We will say this is my argument.  I don't want to make this your friend's argument.  In Arizona there was a trial, and the defendant thinks trial counsel was inadequate.  Then there was a collateral review, and Arizona appoints a lawyer for that.  And after that, the Arizona courts thought, no, he was adequate at trial.  This particular defendant wants to say that that lawyer was inadequate, too.  In fact, it was the same one.  Hardly surprising.  That's his view.  Now when he makes that argument in Federal court, I guess he's going to be met with the claim, since Arizona didn't have to appoint the lawyer for collateral review, it doesn't matter what that lawyer does.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Don't guess where I'm going here.  Maybe nobody wants to go there.  Just follow the questions.  The question is, if he tries to make the claim he does, want to say that my first lawyer was no good at trial, and my second lawyer, who by coincidence was the same in the collateral proceeding, was no good either, then the State comes in and says: You can't make that argument now because we had a proceeding called the collateral review proceeding; we didn't have to give you a lawyer there.  But even if that lawyer was inadequate, you lose because we didn't have to give you one.  Am I right about that?  That's all I want to know.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  You know.  I'll answer it.  You say that is enough to give him a lawyer.  Okay?  It is enough.  But you have to give him an adequate lawyer if you give him one.  If you give him one.  You don't have to give him one.  But if you give him one, it has to be adequate.  Now what about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But would that is done.  But that's where I think we are at.  Now why not say this, that every defendant has to have one fair shot at claiming, they can make the claim that his trial lawyer was inadequate.  And the State doesn't have to give him the lawyer at collateral review; but if it does, then that lawyer, he can say, couldn't make that claim because he was inadequate.  So you say, fine, they can make that argument in habeas.  I bet they never win.  But somebody might.  He can make it.  So what would happen would be that the habeas judge in Federal habeas would read the piece of paper.  He'd say: What's the ground for thinking this, and then he would make his normal kinds of judgments.  Now what is -- Is there anything wrong with that view?  Is it absolutely blocked by precedent?  It seems to me it would relieve the concerns of the states about worrying about having to appoint a lot of lawyers, and it gives him a fair shot to make his argument.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's where you would have to make the exception.  You'd say: If you give him a counsel, he does have the right to an effective assistance of counsel insofar as the ineffectiveness would prevent him from raising a claim that to be fair the trial itself has to be -- he has to have that about the trial itself.  Without exception, it would be that exception.  Now is there something in those cases that blocks that exception?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, in a sense it does, but he's never going to win the infinite continuum.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You never have to give him a lawyer at all.   Stephen G. Breyer  What about not going that far?  What about saying in this case -- in this case, Arizona did give him a lawyer.  In this case, it was the same lawyer.  In this case, the proceeding was filed prior to the completion of the appeal and ended before the completion of the appeal.  So for this case, this counts as the one round of proceedings, and therefore, his client can in fact assert that that single individual who was his lawyer was incompetent in those proceedings that ended -- didn't end prior to the termination of the appeal, ended first?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, but it didn't face the issue of what about a claim that you have a constitutional right to bring up at least once?  And this is the first time he was able to bring it up.  So in other words, Coleman didn't face this problem.  It's as if you couldn't bring up the claim that the judge was sleeping until he got the collateral proceedings.  A State could have such a rule -- I don't know why they would, but they could.  But if they did, it would be your first chance ever to attack that file process, and so isn't Coleman, in its effort to bar relitigation, actually rather beside the point?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, we are saying it the same way, just as if his lawyer, when he could raise the fact that the judge was sleeping, didn't raise it because he was staring at the ceiling and had been drinking too much.  Just as he could raise that point in habeas, because it's his first chance to do it, so he could raise the point that the lawyer, the first time that he had the chance to raise the ineffectiveness of trial counsel, was incompetent, et cetera.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why are you separating the four things.  I mean, I have heard it seems to me three separate rationales.  One, the easiest, is in (D) itself, sometimes a woman could have a miscarriage and of course she has to stay home.  And that isn't covered by (A), (B), or (C), so we cover it in (D), you know.  And then we put the men in too because we don't want to make this incentive just to not hire women.  That's one.  The second one was the one Justice Ginsburg brought up, that there is a gap in the pregnancy law which won't work unless you have to give people some medical leave.  So here it is, (D).  And the third one, which I think was related to what Justice Alito just said, is when -- you have to read it together to understand the third one.  You get weeks altogether, all right?  Now, that means once you put in (D) this act will have less of a bad effect.  The bad effect of the act is if you protect the women then the employers say, well, we're not going to hire women, perfect.  We have to give them 12 leaves, we'd have to give the men -- terrible, it's a terrible disincentive.  But then they worked out how to lessen the disincentive.  And the way you do that, you say 12 weeks overall.  Now look what happens.  A woman wants to take, say, 12 weeks to look after her family, and she gets separately sick, 4 more weeks.  But how many does she get?  Answer: 12, right?  12.  You could answer, 12.  Now let's think of the man.  Let's think of the man.  The man would like to look after the family, say, for 6 weeks.  And he gets sick 4 weeks.  How many weeks have we got?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  10.  Thank you.  [Laughter]  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Perfect.  So now the employer is sitting -- and it will work with other numbers.  I don't rely on those.  [Laughter]  But now look what happens.  Without this act, he's got a woman who is going to be out of there -- I mean, with the act -- unless we put in four -- unless we put in the fourth part of it, we have a woman who is gone for 12 weeks, and a man who is gone maybe for 6 but maybe for zero, okay?  Maybe for 6.  With the act, the woman is gone for 12, the man is gone for 10.  You see?  And so the comparison there -- and it will work with whatever numbers you want -- the comparison there is very different.  And the comparison doesn't, doesn't totally erase the problem with the woman, but it may reduce it to a size where the Act itself will no longer act as such a disincentive to hiring a woman.  Now, we have three different rationales.  All of them are related to a serious problem, which is the problem of discrimination against women because the employers think they will be home more, and so you see the conclusion I am drawing?  Yeah, okay.  So where are we?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it doesn't have to, of course.  But the whole point of the question that I was asking was, sure, what helps you by doing it separately is it helps your case.  But if we look at what Congress was trying to do, they were trying to do it as a whole.  That's my point that-I want you to answer.  And they are trying to do it as a whole because, no matter what numbers I use, if I look at it without (D) -- is it (D)?  Yeah, (D).  If I look at it without (D), the ratio will disfavor the woman.  And if I look at it with (D), suddenly the ratio from the point of view of the employer of the disadvantage of hiring a woman over -- over hiring a man, it goes way down.  And that helps women.  And that is why I think, reading this and listening, a major reason why they put in (D) as part of the other, because working with that 12-week limitation, and the whole rest of the statute, we now have a statute that doesn't defeat itself.  We now have a statute that actually can achieve the end of leading employers to not discriminate against women.  Not perfectly, but there's a big improvement.  And that's the -- that's the argument I'm making.  You have to read it as a whole to see that.  And that's what I -- I wonder if there's an answer to that.  Of course, I'm at the moment thinking there isn't an answer to it, but I ask the question because I want to hear what you say.   Stephen G. Breyer  He's absolutely right.  And that's why this health spa thing, (D), this is -- in fact has two independent reasons that all -- the miscarriage reason and the Pregnancy Act reason, and so it isn't just saying go to a health spa.  But I mean, I don't want to put arguments in your mouth, which I just have, which you wouldn't like there anyway, because -- but I would appreciate your going on with this discussion in respect to what Justice Alito and I have been talking about, and I would be interested in what you say.

So we'll let Lincoln prosecute this case.  Now in your view Abraham Lincoln would not have had immunity, but the local prosecutor would have.  They did exactly the same thing, by the way, it was just that Lincoln had a better reputation.  Every word was the same.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm asking you, in your opinion am I -- when I write this opinion I could say, not even Abraham Lincoln, when he acted as a public prosecutor, brought in for the occasion, in your opinion he should not have the immunity that Joe Jones, the local prosecutor would have?  I'm trying to get your opinion.   Stephen G.

And what they said was, use your judgment--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Okay.  So there are problems with both standards both ways.  This is one of the things that is bothering me.   Stephen G. Breyer  Imagine in this case the lawyer sat down with the other firemen, the supervisor, and so forth, and they said not necessarily this event, they said we want to do X.  And the lawyer said, I have to tell you, it's unclear whether X is constitutional or not.  Now because it's unclear, I also have to tell you that if you do it, you will not be held personally liable.  Now, can a lawyer give that advice?  Yes.  When he does, of course, he is subjecting himself to personal liability.  Now it's that conflict that is worrying me, among other things.  So what do we do about that?  The lawyer is being asked to give advice to the client.  Under the canons of ethics he ought to have their interests at heart and in doing that he is subjecting himself to what could be hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars worth of damages or whatever in suits for malpractice.  Is there a way we side with you out of that dilemma?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no.  What I'm assuming in the question is since it's a close question, he has to worry about a court saying, you were wrong in saying it was legal.  It was not legal.  The matter was unclear, but it was not legal.  At that point he becomes subject to much damages.  But of course, the others do not, and he had to tell them, go ahead with it.

What is your response to that?  Are they right about that in your opinion?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm asking you--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Thank you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So am I right in saying your -- you would agree with them that that is how the Privacy Commission understood the Act, but in your opinion, the Privacy Commission was wrong?   Stephen G. Breyer  And by pain and suffering they mean mental pain and suffering?   Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  This would save you some time, possibly, but my guess is you may know that every State or many States have statutes or tort laws or something against invasion of privacy.  Now, you may know how many.  And -- and if you know how many, that's helpful.  And of those, if you know how many, how many of them, and perhaps all, provide damages for mental suffering caused by a violation of that particular tort-like provision?  Do you know anything about those statistics?   Stephen G. Breyer  Do you know enough to know if they have done so through the use of a term like ""actual damages"" that run analogous thereto, or whether they had to have some special form of words?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   ",10-1024
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  And how did this -- this may be a side issue, but I don't see how this is a fee for service.  I mean, I thought points is simply a way of paying more money up front and getting a lower interest rate later.  It isn't supposed to be for any service; it's simply a question of the loan term, how much you borrow and what the interest rate is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what are we supposed to do, decide theoretically in the context of a case that does not involve paying a fee for a service that doesn't exist, whether you can pay for a service that doesn't exist?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How?  What's -- what's the argument on the other side?  A point is a way of paying more money, i.e., borrowing less.  Since you pay more, that means you borrow less.  So your interest rate is lower, because you borrowed less.  Now, what's the argument on the other side?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  How does that work?  The bank says to Mr. Smith: We are going to charge you $100 for a courier service, and then they don't.  So there it is on the bill.  And Mr. Smith, really knowing he didn't get the courier service, pays the $100.  All right.  Why isn't Mr. Smith guilty, on your interpretation?  I mean, on your interpretation every innocent consumer is guilty of a crime.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't understand that.  It's my fault.  But -- but wouldn't -- it says that if she doesn't get the appraisal, but she has to pay for it, then why isn't she -- why hasn't -- why doesn't she fall within the statute?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What you got was nothing.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why hasn't the consumer violated?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then why is the bank liable?   Stephen G. Breyer  I can see.  So you are saying when the bank writes down,  ""pay $100 for the courier service. ""  the bank is charging for the courier service.   Stephen G. Breyer  When the consumer pays for the courier service which he sees there, the consumer is not paying for the courier service.  He is paying for the nothing.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Then why doesn't he fall within the -- within the statute?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   Stephen G. Breyer  And the consumer doesn't violate it in those circumstances because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can you tell me where in the briefs?  I have to read this about six times to get this one in my head.  Where in the briefs does it explain to me why in your situation the bank would be violating it, but the consumer wouldn't, since it says ""no person shall give"" as well as ""no person shall receive""?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, my goodness.  If it isn't in the briefs, maybe I'm off on a track here, but it seems to me a pretty obvious question.  I mean, we have a statute that looks like a kickback statute and the reason it looks like a kickback statute is because it refers both to the person giving and to the persons receiving, and it seems to make them equally liable.  You want to apply it to a situation where I don't think you want to hold consumers liable, and so I think you have to explain to me why this statute doesn't on your reading of it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, you mean it's all prosecutorial discretion?  In other words, if you happen to be a consumer you just have to rely on the goodwill of the prosecutor; is that the idea.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What more?   Stephen G. Breyer  But can you -- I don't want to take all your any more time on this because to me the more important problem was the problem of the difference between a kickback statute, which we could understand as well as within HUD's expertise and normal and of course very good reason for doing it.  But a price control statute, where we have the Federal agency deciding whether the prices are accurate for each service that is rendered or whether some percentage or all of it represents service for nothing, that's a rather big novelty in American life.  That is, we have it, but there are usually Federal agencies that have a system set up for determining proper prices and so forth.  So it's hard for me to believe that sort of inadvertently Congress brought in the second under the guise of the first without a big fuss being raised and big debate and so forth.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but that's the problem.  The problem is, look, you are saying this is a payment for a service that wasn't given.  I think I might say that this is just a lower interest -- a higher interest rate than they -- than they expected.  Somebody might say, you didn't get the courier service at all.  Others might say, you got service but not the gold-plated service, and the gold plate was nothing.  You see, that's what happens when you get into a price control statute rather than a kickback statute.  And that is our concern here, I think at least mine.   Stephen G. Breyer  Once you say that, you're -- you are outside the reg.  I mean, when you read the reg and the policy statement, it's pretty clear what they are thinking of.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the policy statement is even clearer; what they are thinking of is overcharges, period.   Stephen G. Breyer  No?   INTERRUPTING ",10-1042
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, in 1992 they promulgated the regulation, which is the strongest argument I think on the other side.  It's a strong argument.  Have you -- has anybody looked at that notice-and-comment proceeding?  Have you looked at it?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If you have, do they go into this point, a point about the point being this is a kickback statute?  It isn't an overcharge price regulation statute.  Therefore, promulgating a regulation that makes it a crime, a federal crime to overcharge, which is what the regulation says, is outside the scope of the statute.  Now did someone make that argument?  If so, I would like to be able to read it, and I would like to be able to see what the agency said in response.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you would say--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Is this a fair statement in your view, and we will hear this on rebuttal, that in respect to the 1992 regulation there is a sentence which says,  ""A charge by a person for which nominal services are performed is an unearned fee and violates this section? ""  All right, I've ellipsed part.  All right, it says that.  And that later on is taken as being: This statute is a, to that extent, a price regulation statute.  Is it fair to say that notice of such a regulation was not given?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Was comment received in respect to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  That's a good question, and your problem is different people feel differently about the answer, which is why from my perspective -- and perhaps you're only answering a question for me and no one else has it -- but I would be pretty interested to know whether when you looked at the legislative history of this, what you discovered was a lot of complaints about consumers paying for things they didn't get, period.  Which favors HUD's interpretation.  Or whether you see a whole long list of complaints about consumers having to pay referral fees, where that's just one person taking advantage of another person's business.  I would -- I think it would be relevant.  And then if you've looked at all this, which you can tell me you have, and I will try to -- but what do you find?   ",10-1042
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I do, actually, because I see their point better than I did.  This is -- is I think they are worried about.  They're worried that when you get judicial review of this kind of order, the Court doesn't refer on fact-finding that isn't made on a record.  The substantial evidence test applies to fact-finding made on a record, or a 556/557.  And so they'll have a hard time -- or a harder time -- in each of these cases subjecting it to judicial fact-finding.  And they think that the purpose of this, the purpose of this procedure given to them by statute was to call it -- the shots in favor of them, because there might be thousands of these things and they can't prepare all that formal thing.  Now, I -- I see that as a -- as a -- now I understand their concern.  I'm not saying they're right.  I understand their concern.  So if you want to comment, is there some way to accommodate their concern that also accommodates judicial review, or are we just in a kind of -- they're in a Hobson's choice, in a sense.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They want the power because they have thousands of these things.  They investigate it, and they find the facts.  They think it's sufficient that judicial fact-finding is carried out before a judge who doesn't have their experience, et cetera.  And therefore, there is a risk of incorrect decision-making, at least two -- under the statute, it would be too pro-homeowner rather too pro-environment.  That's why it is more of a dilemma than I thought.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, they -- they might -- the might change their -- their system here if you -- if you win this, and provide for various kinds of preorder procedure or post-order procedure where they would be open to change.  I see a number of possibilities.   ",10-1062
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You say ""practical"".  The order itself says that.  It says you don't do it you are going to get penalized 32.5, which is now 37.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How can they bring an action -- I would like some clarification here.  The Corps's regs say the Corps will accept an after-the-fact permit.  I mean one after -- if they applied tomorrow, the day after getting this order, you would run up against the reg, which says we won't give you any after the fact, we won't even consider this matter, until any required initial corrective measures are made.  And then, just to be safe, they say that no permit application will be accepted unless the Corps determines that concurrent processing of an after-the-fact permit application is clearly appropriate, ""clearly"".  So I looked at those two things and said: Of course you can't apply to the Corps of Engineers; they are not going to accept it unless you have a very unusual case.  So I expect you to tell me why I'm wrong about that, if I am, or how many after-the-fact permit applications has the Corps of Engineers accepted.  Maybe there are a lot.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right, I agree.  If we agree then, look, for 75 years the courts have interpreted statutes with an eye towards permitting judicial review, not the opposite.  And yet -- so here you are saying that this statute that says nothing about it precludes review, and then the second thing you say is that this isn't final.  So I read the order.  It looks like about as final a thing as I have ever seen.  So tell me why I am wrong on those two points.   Stephen G. Breyer  You're arguing on the final part--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Is there anything you've got by -- I mean, I'm -- You've got me now into the area, we are applying the APA and the question is Abbott Labs and is it final.  Well, here there doesn't seem anything more for the agency to do, and here the person whom the order is directed against is being hurt a lot.  So the only thing I -- left in my mind here is the order itself does say: Come in and talk to us about this.  Which may suggest it isn't final.  So do you have any information on that point?  That is, have you looked up or has the APA told you that really when we issue these things, in fact people come in and modify them at X percent of the time.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any impression that you could tell us?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do--   Stephen G. Breyer  --This is not a warning.  I mean, you only have to look at it.  I was quite moved by the fact when I looked at it, it didn't say a warning.  It said: This is an order.  It looks extremely formal.  I even overstated in your favor the question of negotiating because it doesn't say negotiating about changing the order; it says negotiating about amending the order.  And -- so this is not just a warning, is it?   Stephen G. Breyer  The more -- that's what I am trying to get you to talk about just for one minute.  You are talking about a huge upheaval.  My honest impression is that it is the government here that is fighting 75 years of practice because -- because the issue is the Abbott Labs issue of finality.  And of course a warning isn't reviewable.  But this seems to meet the test where that fails.  Now please correct me if I am wrong about the agency practice.  I can't find support for you on that.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Go back to the -- what happen.  I think what the government says should happen, you should give them a form and the form should say do you have money to pay or not.  So what did happen, did the judge ever ask him?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Did he bring some proof of employment?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So then why would you put him in jail?  He has no job.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You mean he didn't believe him about what?  That he had no money?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So he -- he thought he did have the money?   Stephen G. Breyer  I think actually trying--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Just out of curiosity--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Fine, but I would like to ask a different question.  I'm trying to find out what happened here that was different from what the government suggests.  The government suggests provide a piece of paper and ask certain questions.  What I would like to know is: What's different in this proceeding from what the government suggests?  That would have -- perhaps no one else, but could have an effect on the way I decide the case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I understand there was no -- look.  If he asked the questions orally, I might be tempted to say it doesn't matter.   Stephen G. Breyer  So I'm trying to say: What really differed from what the government wants?   Stephen G. Breyer  And skip that one.  What I'm trying to figure out -- and I'm sorry, I may be the only one trying to -- I'm trying to figure out is: What, in general, is the fairness of such situations in where the woman is normally the one with the child, the man is normally the one who doesn't pay?  Is it true, for example, that in most such situations across the country, the woman has a lawyer but the man doesn't?  Is that true or isn't it true?  There must be some organization that's studied that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So the answer to what I think of, in my own mind only, as very relevant, whether the woman has a lawyer but the man doesn't, is: I don't know?   Stephen G. Breyer  And that is the answer?  We don't have good information on that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Fine.  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  But there are things that -- did anybody look at housing courts?

Your allegation, which you believe states a valid claim under Bivens action but not under state law is--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I don't understand specifically what they are.  I mean it sounds to me that if a person, A, deliberately starves somebody to death, for example, or deliberately gives him something which will make him sick when he eats it, that that would at least be negligence and would arise under ordinary state tort law.  So I'm curious to know what your claim is that does not arise under ordinary state tort law?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, don't answer my -- forget my hypothetical.  Tell me your specific claim that does not arise under state tort law, that's all I want to know, which is the same question I heard -- I just didn't hear the answer to.   Stephen G. Breyer  I heard the answer in general.   Stephen G. Breyer  I want to know specifically what you say they did to your client that doesn't make out a State tort claim.   Stephen G. Breyer  I heard you say--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --that.  I just want to know what it is physically you say the defendant did to your client, so that I can evaluate your statement that California gives no tort remedy for that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Sorry, I don't mind to sound irritated but I just have trouble getting my question across.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  They failed to give him adequate food for what?  So he could live, or for what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They gave him -- and if a person in California who has charge of -- of a ward or someone fails adequately to nourish that ward, you are saying California tort law gives no remedy?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --cause like negligence, you give a remedy.  It's not negligent; it's deliberate?  Or what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --of -- because the Eighth Amendment says cruel and unusual punishment.  So you have to have a cruel treatment and where a person deliberately or negligently subjects someone else to cruel treatment, my -- my law school recollection of many years ago is that there ordinarily is a tort action.  So, so -- that's what I would like you -- I'm suspicious of your statement that there isn't.   Stephen G. Breyer  Therefore, I ask for some elaboration of that.   Stephen G. Breyer  When I went to law school, evidence on in this case.  which was many years ago, instead of talking about, like, starvation cases or medical malpractice, they talked about a general thing called negligence.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it seemed to apply to doctors, and then it was medical malpractice, and it applied to others, and -- and is there something here that wouldn't fall in that general kind of rubric, or the general terms of California tort law?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I know, I don't want you just to repeat yourself.  So I guess I have the best answer I have.   Stephen G. Breyer  I would find that rather surprising, too, actually.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because I -- I think what they're asking to do is fine.  On their theory you have no problem, because you go back and show to the Court that there is no remedy in California for shackling a person -- I guess deliberately, with knowledge that that would cause severe pain, and if you can show that, then you are going to have your Bivens action in respect to that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That -- that -- what they are saying is that you are not going to be able to show that, so it doesn't worry them.   ",10-1104
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Nature--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  So how do you -- that's -- I see that.  I will spare you the reasons why I think the law of nature doctrine exists, because they are not relevant to my question.  My question is, I think it's hornbook law that the law of nature cannot be patented.   Stephen G. Breyer  It is also hornbook law that the application of a law of nature can be patented.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So in this case, what I think the claim is is that we are applying a law of nature.  Now, we read the words of applying it: Administer a drug, determine the level.  And then it uses the word ""wherein"", which I will ask them what that means.  But -- but -- so they say those two words, administer the drug, determine the level, are the application of the law of nature that they found.  Now, there's something odd about that in your view--   Stephen G. Breyer  --at least.  And I want to know what.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Suppose it didn't.  Suppose I discover that if I take aspirin, someone takes aspirin, I discover they have to take aspirin for a headache and, you know, I see an amazing thing: if you look at a person's little finger, and you notice the color of -- it shows the aspirin, you need a little more, unless it's a different color, you need a little less.  Now, I've discovered a law of nature and I may have spent millions on that.  And I can't patent that law of nature, but I say: I didn't; I said apply it.  I said: Look at his little finger.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay?  Is that a good patent or isn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  If you can tell me why not, I'll have an understanding of where you are coming from.   Stephen G. Breyer  Ah.  Now, we're into the problem.  And that is the problem of how much you have to add.   Stephen G. Breyer  If you look at the Court's cases, they seem to say Flook, one thing, and Diehr another thing.  And so what is your view about how much has to be added to make it an application of a law of nature?  And how would you put that in words?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You are getting warmer, but--  [Laughter]  But the -- the words, look, ""a simple conventional step"".  Hmmm.  You see, whether it's true in this case or not, discovering natural laws is often a very expensive process.   Stephen G. Breyer  And there's lots of investment to be protected.   Stephen G. Breyer  But they can't, okay?  So now you are going to say, well, what do they have to add to that?  And now we run into problems, because if you have to just not look at the law of nature, don't look at it when you decide whether it's novel, that not only runs into conflict with prior cases, but it doesn't make much sense because really the novel thing is often the law of nature.  But you say you have to add something.   Stephen G. Breyer  What?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now that -- what do you have to add?  And it can't be that you take the law of nature out and look to whether the rest of it meets the patent criteria.  It's -- it's pretty clear in the law and I can give you reasons why, but forget the reasons.  But look, what do you want to say the rest of it has to add up to?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You are going on a limitation thing.  You are going to say reject all the 15 fancy hypotheticals I will also spare you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But it's pretty easy to think of the same problem you have, you know, which doesn't have this infinity in it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Which unfortunately we have to deal with.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but what my opinion lacked, frankly, and sometimes that's the virtue of a dissent in such a case, it lacked -- and Novartis points this out very well in their brief -- it lacked an explanation as to why what I thought was a patent just said, observe the correlation--   Stephen G. Breyer  --why isn't that an application of the law of nature?  And if you look to LabCorp's dissent to find an answer to that question, you are better than I, because I couldn't find it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  Why is the question.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --Because--   Stephen G. Breyer  Look: Anything can be transformed into a process.  Look at those real estate ones, lawyers ones.  I have a way of making a great argument in the Supreme Court.  You know, you could patent some of your arguments.  [Laughter]   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --Most are pretty obvious.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not cut them off at the pass?  That is, if you're really prepared to say -- it has to do with process, not machines.  In the 19th century not many patent processes were granted, so they are rather special because of the special problem the Chief just noticed.  So why not cut them off at the pass, if you are prepared to say--   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  I'm sorry.   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, I will add a little bit to this because I am questioning what you say here in the other direction.  You say if you just look at everything minus the law of nature, hmm, and that is a process that's otherwise known or obvious in light of the prior art, you can't patent it.  That seems to me maybe it goes too far in the other direction, because we know that a lot of work goes into these laws of nature.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Our position is a little different.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So there are both parts, but I'm more interested in--   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Your Honor, if I could, if I could.  I do think that one has to think about what -- this seems like a straightforward case on these facts, but if one thinks about the principles that Mayo is advocating and applying them in a different set of circumstances I think you will see the problems.  Take for example nuclear stress tests that cardiologists use.  That's a process.  The patient gets on a treadmill, the heart rate gets elevated, radioactive dye gets put into the body, it allows an image to be taken of the heart with an x-ray machine.  That improves treatment.  Now, the transformation there is, as in this case, incidental to the process, it's not the point of the process.  But I don't think anyone would suggest that that's not a patentable process, but under Mayo's process it's not a patentable process.  Similarly I think -- I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, but this drug is patentable because it's a -- what is the third word.  You know, it's combination of nature.  What's the -- it's a composition of matter.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Yes, Justice Breyer.  But those patents are not on the composition of matter.  Those are process patents.   Stephen G. Breyer  They don't have to be.  You'd say that where it's a new use there were some specifications and the specifications limited the area to over here, I think -- and tell me if I'm wrong because I'm really asking just a question -- they limit it over here, you see.  And now we have a new use and we are saying this composition of matter is being used over here.  So aren't you getting a -- simply a different area where you are using a composition of matter?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Well, but that's a use patent.  That's not a composition-of-matter patent and--   Stephen G. Breyer  That isn't a process patent.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --Yes, it's a process patent.  It is a process patent, and the problem would be if one says--   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   ",10-1150
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I thought of two examples that will try to get you to talk about the problem that's really bothering me here, anyway.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well.  A patent for -- we've discovered, at some extent, what counts as too little fertilizer and what counts as too much to make plants grow, a certain kind of fertilizer, very common.  Less than an quarter of an inch, forget it; more than half an inch, you are going to burn the plant.  Imagine that.  Law of nature, absolutely, about the chemicals in the fertilizer.  Patent: A method for determining when there is too little or too much fertilizer.  Put some fertilizer in a field and measure how much there is, wherein less than a quarter of an inch is too little and wherein more than half an inch is too much.  Second example.  Einstein never lived, but at vast expense you invented E equals mc-squared, a method for measuring energy which is very useful that comes out of a cyclotron.  Put some stuff in a cyclotron, measure the stuff in and measure how much comes out, and keep -- wherein, wherein, the missing part is -- think about -- wherein -- it says: Wherein the missing part will be calculated as an amount of energy according to a formula E equals mc-squared.  If your patent is valid, why aren't the two I just mentioned?  And if you -- if the two I just mentioned are valid, there is something wrong with this picture.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where is lack of novelty?  Nobody has these numbers before.  They always thought it was a quarter, an eighth of an inch.  It's huge novelty.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, my point -- assume with me the eighth versus quarter of an inch which is the law of nature part is not obvious.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  My question is, what has to be added to a law of nature to make it a patentable process?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if you put too little in the answer to that question, I believe I can take things that like E equals mc-squared and make them patentable.  And if you put too much in, you are going to wreck your own case.   Stephen G. Breyer  What about a process that all the steps are -- it's a process to -- to generate some useful information.   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  And the only new thing about it is the useful information.   Stephen G. Breyer  Anything like that in history, any patent case that comes to mind that you say that was okay?  Can you think of one?   Stephen G. Breyer  What?  Good.  That's what I would like to know.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  That's not what I'm thinking of.  I'm thinking of a patent to find useful information that chickens can only eat so much chicken food.  That nobody has ever known before, you know.  Okay.  Now there's something like that.  But they tell you the useful information that's going to be found right in the patent.  In other words, we have a patent to discover some useful information and here is the useful information.  And now here's -- see, that's what they're complaint--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --But you don't know what you are going to find because you don't know how much ore you are going to find?  Let's see, okay.  Let me think about it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Rosenberg would have been the law.  Fleuti.  And the answer to the question would have been: Yes, you can make trips abroad, wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's true, but in St. Cyr, as I read it, on pages 322 and 23, the Court focused directly, not on the crime point of time, but the time of the guilty plea.  And what the Court says there is that a person who is thinking of pleading guilty might well have taken into account the fact that he could ask the Attorney General later when he's about to be deported to exercise discretion in his favor.  So that's -- as I read those pages, you can say, I'm not reading them correctly, but that's how I read them.  And then, having read them that way, I thought the question in this case is whether the person who is sitting at the table and deciding whether to plead guilty or not is likely to think, well, if I plead guilty, I can always ask for discretion.  That's St. Cyr.  Well, if I plead guilty, I can still visit my aging parents and grandparents, a matter that could be of importance to some people, as opposed to whether I will never see them again.  Now, that seems to be the question.  Is the second as likely to be in the person's mind as the first?  And to tell you the truth, I don't know the answer.  I mean, maybe it would be.  There isn't that much chance of getting discretion.  It might be important to some people to visit their aging parents and grandparents.  So, go ahead.  Answer the question.  Is the one more important than the other?  And if not, why not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, but I -- isn't my question the key question?  Now you can answer that no.  But I, I mean, I suppose you could prove that the only thing that mattered to LPRs who plead guilty, the only thing that mattered was visiting their parents and grandparents, a matter I doubt; but, you can say, even on that situation, it would make no difference.  Or you could say, I think the one is as important as the other.  Or you could say they are not.  I just want to get your full answer, your whole answer to my question.   Stephen G. Breyer  So why do you -- as I read the statute, it isn't even clear whether it overrules Rosenberg v. Fleuti.  I mean, they talk about admission, but admission after all could be, we have an exception for the 4-day trip.  That's what the Court said effectively in Rosenberg v. Fleuti.  So Congress certainly wasn't clear on what policy they're following.  I would have thought that.  You can disagree with that.  But I -- but the part that's still gnawing at me: 95 percent of the people plead guilty.  All right.  You know.  Everybody pleads guilty.  Or about.  And now the -- the consequence that this ex post enacts is he can't take the 4-day trip.  And you keep saying well, a 4-day trip requires action on a person's part.  Right.  Of course it does.  So why does that matter?  I mean, the fact is he can't take the 4-day trip.  A 4-day trip requires action.  You have to buy a trip -- ticket.  You have to get on a plane.  So--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --That's -- that's why I think the Chief Justice's question and the ambiguity of the statute are relevant.  Like with SORNA you would apply it backwards, because that's a pretty clear intent.  I don't know about you know, like, ""three times and you're out"" statutes, et cetera.  But -- but here you have a disability on the ones -- the disadvantage to the person pleading guilty, the problem on the one hand, and on the other hand you have the policy that with a -- fill in the blank -- with a statute that doesn't talk about it, but simply uses a new definition of admission or admissibility.  That's -- do you want to say something about that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  More than that -- I'm ignoring -- more than that, I'm saying what's the policy on the other side?  The policy that favors the retroactivity despite the fact that the person might not have pleaded guilty?  And that's why I was interested in the Chief Justice's question and also the ambiguity of the language in the statute that they used.   INTERRUPTING ",10-1211
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's what we said in Merck.  I mean, wasn't Merck just like that?  It says a cause of action can be or whatever -- it may not be brought -- may be brought not later than the earlier of 2 years after the discovery of the facts or 5 years after the violation.  I take it that means 5 years after the violation.  Forget about the discovery of the facts.   Jeffrey B. Wall  Well, that's right, but the -- the reason that that language created a period of repose was because of the structural inference.  I took Justice Scalia's hypothetical to be if the statute just said no suit shall be brought more than X years after the violation.   Stephen G. Breyer  There are two different doctrines, I gather.  One is equitable -- equitable tolling.  The other is sometimes called equitable estoppel or fraudulent concealment.  But whatever you call them, if you take your position, a person who really thinks he doesn't have to file and so he doesn't file will be liable forever, there will be no statute of limitations because the plaintiff will never find out.  Maybe 50 years later, all right.  If you take the opposite position, then you will prevent plaintiffs in borderline cases from bringing suits because they aren't going to find out if somebody thinks it's a borderline case.  I see one harm one way, one harm the other way.  You are arguing that the second harm is the worst harm.  Okay, why?  What's the argument.   Jeffrey B. Wall  --Justice Breyer, I want to fight the premise.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm making it for you -- I'm making your argument or I'm trying to.  [Laughter]  I'm saying it's something on your side and something on the other side.  If he's arguing it, you are wrong.  Because if there is no bad conduct by the defendant, he honestly thinks he doesn't have to file, then the statute never runs.  Okay?   Jeffrey B. Wall  We have--   Stephen G. Breyer  But on the other hand his position leads to the plaintiff never being able to sue in borderline cases.  Which is worse?   Jeffrey B. Wall  --You are absolutely right.  They are both bad.  We've occupied the reasonable middle ground.  Hope you like it.  [Laughter]   ",10-1261

It was made by an insider, and if your client finds out about it or reasonably should find out about it, then the statute begins to run.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Otherwise it's tolled, period.  Simple, same as every other statute.  What's wrong with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  But there are people, you see, who don't know.  There are always borderline cases, some people, whether it's this one or not, think maybe they don't have to file.  They think they are outside the statute.  So they don't.  Okay?  You are protected.  If they don't file, and you wouldn't reasonably find out about it, fine.  But when you find out about it or should have, not fine.  It's very simple, and makes everything logical.  It seems to be fair to your client, certainly.   INTERRUPTING ",10-1261
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't have a fixed meaning.  I mean wouldn't you think -- I suspect the answer is you do think -- that -- a district judge has a lot of power in many, many areas and in one of those areas some district judge sometimes could make a horrendous mistake that really wrecks a case, and in such a matter the court of appeals if it sees a really horrendous error will probably have the authority to say you went beyond whatever standard applies, at least here, at least -- okay, we agree on that one.  So they use some words, ""effectiveness"" and whatever the words are, ""interest of justice"", just to reflect that fact.  I mean, that's what I think what happens.  And your complaint is he didn't abuse his -- he didn't really abuse anything, he made a good decision, the district judge.  Isn't that what that comes down to?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's important?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right, so what's bothering you is the way they applied it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And they applied it in circumstances that you think -- the district judge actually, his decision was fine.  You don't have the power to set that aside because it was within -- it's within the scope of any kind of standard you want to call it, including calling it ""interest of justice"".  Am I right in thinking that, that that's really your concern?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what you really want us to do is to look at the record of the case, go through it, and say, here, whatever words you want to use, the district court acted in his discretion in saying don't change the counsel?  Is that what I'm supposed to do?  I'm trying to get at what you want me to do.   Stephen G. Breyer  No--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I didn't mean literally ""whatever words you use"".  I'm trying to figure out what you want me to do.  One is to go back and search all the cases that use some words for a standard, which, as you can tell, I'm reluctant to think that that is meaningful in this case.  The other is to look at the record to see if he acted within what you would normally think of as the district court's discretionary authority.   ",10-1265
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The Ninth Circuit -- I see -- I think I see what they were trying to get at.  They want -- they don't see anything practical here to do except to try to get the judge, the district judge, to focus on the question of whether the petition should be amended to assert this kind of claim about the new physical evidence; is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's where they were trying to go.  Okay.  Now, suppose you lose this case.  Suppose they were to say -- suppose this Court said, well, to tell you the truth, that district judge was operating within his authority in saying that this counsel can continue to represent him.  We know subsequently relations broke down and now there is a new counsel.  All right?  Can't the new counsel go back to the district court and say, judge, we would like to amend the petition so that you will consider, you know, whether it should be amended to include this physical evidence claim?  Couldn't he do that?   Stephen G. Breyer  And what did--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I think you answered this, but I can't remember the answer.  What happened when he filed the 60(b)?  Did they amend the petition or did they consider the thing or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  So there is no -- so in other words -- what the Ninth Circuit in my view is trying to do is they've worked out some complicated way of trying to get the district court to consider the motion about the new physical evidence.  And if that's right, then unless you -- there is no way to get there.  I don't see how you get there under the law.  That's my -- but--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'd just like to know what he's thinking.   INTERRUPTING ",10-1265
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Could you -- could you digress for one minute to help me understand the procedural posture of this case.  When it was here last time, we were dealing with an issue called fleeting expletives and that was Fox.  And the Fox case involved just that.  They didn't really, or we didn't, or the Court didn't, attack the 2001 order which is now at issue.  And then without it going back to the commission, the Second Circuit decided it on a ground that sets aside the 2001 order.  Now, can we here just decide the fleeting expletive case, because the fleeting expletive case has to do with one subset of applications of the 2001 order and has to do with part 2.2 or something.  I mean, it has -- and how you interpret the words ""material dwells on or repeats"".  Now, that I -- I understand how to get at.  The ABC case raises -- doesn't raise fleeting expletives.  It wasn't fleeting.  And it raises the question of the validity of, under vagueness grounds, of 2001 industry guidance and how that's been applied.  But the Second Circuit didn't deal with that case.  It sent it back to the commission.  So has there been a commission decision recently which has reviewed the basic arguments being made here about the validity of the 2001 industry guidance as applied?  Has there been such a thing?  Alternatively, has there been an appeals court holding on the analysis of the ABC case?   Stephen G. Breyer  But they didn't -- they didn't in that case, and they sent the ABC case back -- I see your--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  When this ABC case was argued in front of the commission, I have here about 30 briefs at least, maybe 40, and they are filled with very good arguments.  Were those arguments made to the commission in the context of the ABC case?  Because as it comes up here, we are -- whereas I thought when we granted cert, quite honestly, that this was Fox coming back, as I've read the brief it isn't at all.  This is a new case, nothing to do with what we decided before.  This is the case of ABC, period.  And it is an attack on the 2001 guidelines, not fleeting expletives.  And therefore, I want to know, at least satisfy myself, that this Fox -- this ABC case has gone through ordinary procedures and indeed these arguments have all been made in front of the commission and they have been rejected.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not saying every one, but has the essence of these arguments--   ",10-1293
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right, so suppose we take that particular line.  You didn't argue -- I mean, Fox didn't argue -- Fox was worried about the fleeting expletive policy in Golden Globe.  I doubt in Golden Globe, when it was before the commission, they raised all these vagueness challenges to the whole 2001 policy.  So why -- here you have taken a much broader stance, now, though you didn't before.  I mean do you want to say anything about what I think is the basic issue that Fox raises?  We don't have to overrule Pacifica.  What Fox was penalized for was two women on television who basically used a fleeting expletive which seems to be naturally part of their vocabulary.  [Laughter]  And we're worried about small stations that cannot censor people because they don't know what they are going to say.  All right, that is what we wrote, I think in my opinion, anyway.  We were worried about that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Are you abandoning that argument?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's an A, B, C argument primarily.  But you made that argument in the Second Circuit.  What I am fishing with, you don't have to comment more, but -- is do we have to reach that argument?  It's--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --It's very, very broad.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But this wasn't -- I mean, I -- don't know about this instance.  It's called ""Nude Awakening"", it's about the sexual awakening of a child.  You ran it, your client, after 10:00 on both coasts and they choose to run it at 9:00 for some unknown reason in the Midwest.  Maybe they thought -- I don't know, whatever.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But my point is what the FCC terribly told you to do was run it 1 hour later in the Midwest, just as you did on the coast.   Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and why is that not -- I'm not saying, taking this point of view, but I'm saying why -- isn't that just time, manner and circumstance that puts you to very little trouble, and allows everybody to see it, and therefore is constitutional?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because you wanted to make more money from it, I understand that.  And maybe people would have been a little bit inconvenienced, but the inconvenience -- they made a judgment that looking at this show is not like ""Private Ryan"", it's about sexual awakening; they are showing a part of a nude woman, the viewer is supposed to put himself in the position of the boy who is seeing her, and the whole thing was titillating.  Now they might be wrong; there are two sides to that argument; and so I guess what you are arguing is, if I were to say is that a reasonable view -- I guess I would have to say it.  But you have to say much -- you are telling me I have to say much more than that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  You're going off the question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Which -- you haven't seen where I'm going.  I wanted you to say just exactly what you said, and you did, which I thank you--  [Laughter]  And -- and my question, which I have been trying to get so you would see very precisely what it is, is why don't I just say, if you are right, just what you said?  And say this is an instance, case-by-case, in which, for the reasons and I quote you, that the First Amendment forbids the application of a good guideline to this case.  In other words, what I'm driving at is the basic thing that's worrying me here: Does this case in front of us really call for the earthshaking decision that you all have argued for in the -- in the briefs?  And that's what I'm trying to figure out, and that's why I am particularly worried about whether or not this whole big argument here was presented to the FCC about whether we have to reach that far.  Now do you see where I was trying to get?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I--   Stephen G. Breyer  --looked and found 17.  I looked and -- I'm sorry.   Stephen G. Breyer  But your only conclusion from that is that they can't have any rule.   Stephen G. Breyer  What is -- I looked through the briefs; I don't see what you're -- tell me where in these briefs do you suggest what the rule ought to be.   Stephen G. Breyer  Are they in the briefs?

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What's bothering me is I can't figure this out very well.  We have an imaginary State, and what the State says to the jury: Jury, you have three choices.  Choice one is you acquit this person of everything.  Choice two is you convict him of something.  Choice three is you say you're hung.  Okay?  I don't see anything in the Constitution that prevents a State from doing that.  So if that -- if no -- what is it?  And, of course, if you follow that, there was no acquittal on those early charges.  That wasn't a permissible verdict.  And now you structure your argument in any way you want, but that the State has, I would think, within the limits of due process, it can structure the jury's arguments as it wishes.  But -- so what's wrong with that?  And if that -- if there is nothing wrong with that, then how do you win?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you could say, well, could say -- well, that's one route.  What you say is, nothing wrong with that.  But if the judge is foolish enough to get the jury -- to get the foreperson to say what the state of the deliberation is in detail, then the Double Jeopardy Clause kicks in.  Well, that's an argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So they make a mistake and now suddenly there's jeopardy, where it wasn't before, or -- this seems like a minor matter compared to the issues of jeopardy, whether the jury honestly said what was going on in the room, particularly if it's changeable.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, so let's -- go ahead.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why ""surely""?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, why?  Look, the thing ends.  To go back to my example, the case is over, the jury comes in and says, judge, we're hung.  Okay?  Everybody is going to go home.  But the defense lawyer says, judge, I'd like to know which of the five charges they are on.  Does the defense lawyer or the prosecutor have a constitutional right to find out?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not assuming anything.  I gave you the example.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is the answer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In the State I imagine is -- remember, there were three possible verdicts -- acquit of everything, convict of something, or say you're hung.  That's what we're imagining.  Okay?  And you can imagine the set of instructions go to A, B, C; that's fair enough.  Those four things.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay?  Now, case over, acquitted -- no, hung, Your Honor.  Defense attorney: I want to find out which of the five they are on.  Does he have a constitutional right to get the answer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He does?   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know what -- I'm sorry.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  I see, okay, fine.  In other words, here I--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Okay, okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm only midway, because I'm trying to follow this through.  I still don't know why the Constitution does that, but I'll take your word for it.  I would assume it was State law that does that, but -- but fine.  But now he says, yes, you have the right, either of you has the right.  We're on number three.  Your Honor, I would like a poll of the jury as to the acquittal as to one and two.  Does both -- do both sides have the right to get that?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Here's what happened:  ""Judge, I want to know what number they were on when they couldn't reach. ""   Stephen G. Breyer  Foreman: ""Number five, Your Honor"".  ""Judge, I would like a poll of the jury, each juror, as to numbers one, two, three and four to be sure that they were unanimous on each as to the acquittal, which under the instruction allowed them to go to the next one. ""  Okay?  Constitution requires it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  Why doesn't the Constitution require it?  You have to be sure there was an acquittal.  What -- what I'm doing obviously is I'm spinning out what I see as the constitutional consequences of taking your constitutional position, and I'm going to be ending up by saying, I've never heard of this before.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Would you then go back -- I did have the same question Justice Alito asked and I would like to hear the answer.  The answer has -- I will add one footnote, perhaps, which might make it a more complete answer, and that is that it makes very little sense to me when a worker becomes disabled on January 1, 1990, for example, he is now disabled.  And so we calculate what his wage was.  His wage was $200 a week.  And now we say, but that shouldn't exceed twice the average weekly wage, and we are not going to apply it to him.  You are going to apply it to him at some random date.  His wage that he is getting paid is figured out as of January 1, 1990.   Stephen G. Breyer  But the maximum that it could be is figured out as of January 1, 1998, when he finishes a proceeding.  Now, I just -- for both reasons, why would you distinguish and why would you get that result?  For those two reasons it doesn't seem to make much sense to me, your reading of it, while theirs does make sense.  Now, you explain why that is.   Stephen G. Breyer  You think it is not stupid because you think it is a good idea to give a lot of work to the Department of Labor and that all the employers are going to do this voluntarily and there will never be a problem with it; all should be encouraged to go and get a certificate from the Department of Labor.  All right.  I will take that as something.  Now, why is it I can't read the statute the way that it seems to make somewhat more sense?  I don't see any words here that stop me from reading it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Where exactly?  You mean in (c)?   Stephen G. Breyer  You just told me that just this had to do with permanent or total disability, and this is far--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Why don't they both?  I mean, as I read it naturally, it says that -- we now have a special thing, you know, which these people are the dead ones and the widows are getting it and the permanently disabled people, and the -- this individual, and the secretary, the secretary or his delegate is going to calculate this thing all the time, and they've got a special thing here for -- for -- for permanent people, permanently disabled, and they are saying as to those people, we are giving them a break.  They can't look for more work.  They can't look for -- they are dead, for example, and they can't find other sources of income.  And so we say that, that if the average wage goes up and their wage was higher to begin with, we will raise it a bit.  And that applies not only to the people who are just getting this for the first time in the relevant period; it also applies to all those who have been getting it.  It applies to both groups.  Well, that makes sense to me.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  So the whole thing applies just to the permanently disabled and the death things.  What says it applies to anybody else?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The whole thing.  The whole -- the whole -- all of (c), that's in my thing here that's seven lines.  All of (c) applies to permanently disabled and those who died.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, yes.  Oh.  I feel slightly like an Abbott and Costello movie, but I am getting--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I see.  Is your argument this now -- I'm sorry to be so slow.  But that, look, there is a statute here that says compensation cannot exceed more than 200 percent of the annual or weekly wage, then in (3) it says how to calculate that particular number.  And then you guy over to (c) and (c) says that calculated number applies to those newly awarded compensation.  And you're saying ""newly awarded compensation"" means somebody got it through an award, not somebody got it automatically.  And since somebody got it -- had to get it through an award or it wouldn't apply when you just get it because they pay for it, it just doesn't apply.  You have to go get the award, and the word you are turning on is ""newly awarded"".   Stephen G. Breyer  That's the argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  Like Abbott and Costello, I don't know what I'm talking about.  But I do -- I do -- I was, I was -- now I fully understand your argument.   ",10-1399
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What happens, just for my technical knowledge here, the -- the employee suffers partial disability on February 1.  He then doesn't notify the employer until, let's say, February 10, and then the employer waits for a week or so, and then begins to pay.  Now is the employer supposed to calculate the -- the weekly wage that he's paying on in the week February 1 to February 10 -- or 3 days he puts it aside.  But -- the first week?  Or does he do it on the first week he got notice?  How is that -- how does that work?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's right.  But I'm saying he has to write the check now.   Stephen G.

Which week does he calculate the payment on?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then we can't -- we cannot read this thing ""award"" to mean award by the employer.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  There are -- there are lots of regions of the country, Puerto Rico for example, where there are vast numbers of documents that have to be translated if you go into Federal court, not necessarily in the Commonwealth court.  That's expensive to people.  And they might have thought for a long time, while that expense won't go away, it's at least better to have it paid by the loser than to have it paid by the winner.  So that's been the common practice.  I don't think that's a foolish approach.  And you can find language in this, which is to go back -- to go back to Justice Sotomayor--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What do you think of the -- I mean, the First Circuit dealt with this, which deals a lot with Puerto Rico, and it felt that this fell within the idea of fees for exemplification, which is certifying the document.  And in fact, to certify a document that comes into the Federal court in San Juan, you have to have it translated very often.  And so, the translation cost is at least consistent with the idea there of trying to -- you may -- you don't have to -- you may impose the cost on the loser.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I haven't -- I was interested here that the amici on your side consists of some professors and the, I guess the trade associations of interpreters or translators, but the people who would have the financial stake in it, the defense bar, the plaintiff's bar in certain circumstances, have not filed any brief.  And I tend, though not putting a lot of weight on it, to take it as a sign, along with the long period of time, that there hasn't been some tremendous financial problem.  What evidence is there that there has been?  I see a few cases, but in general.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The plain language argument I got.  But how many years has the great bulk of the court been going the other way?   Stephen G. Breyer  How many years has, would you say, the great bulk of the Federal system been deciding this differently from the way you think it should be?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's the bulk.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, when did all this rot set in, in your opinion.  How long?   Stephen G. Breyer  When is the first one?   Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What do you think on the -- I guess nobody wants to defend this argument, including you, but the First Circuit and several others did look to the provision which permits the taxing of costs with the making of specific exemplifications or official documents, for the costs of making copies of any materials obtained for use in the case.  Now, if you are going to make a copy for use of the case of something in Japanese, you are going to have to turn it into English.  So they included that as part of the costs of making copies of the materials and documents for use in the case.  Now, which is discretionary; it's whether you do or whether you don't.  But that's how several courts could read it.  I am just wondering, that didn't strike me as so obviously wrong.  Maybe it's obviously--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I am sure you would like to win on any subsection.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So the history is that prior to '78 a serious number -- some number of circuits said you can get the translation paid for under -- as -- as being necessary to create a copy that is usable in court.  Then Congress passes, this knowing of those cases in principle, and then there is a shift after Congress passes this, and then the majority of courts say, all right, this is the provision that permits it.  Is that an accurate statement?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there anything in the history of the '78 statute which suggested that Congress didn't want these taxed?   Stephen G. Breyer  That means you don't have to look at this.   Stephen G. Breyer  I accept the following, that there was a history basically giving -- doing what you want before the statute, but the statute, nobody thought, was going to do that history, that statute is capable of being translated but it is a most natural thing.  And so, the question is, do we take -- go with the smaller capabilities and leave well enough alone or do we say, gee, that is just too hard to translate that -- to interpret the statute that way.  Have you got any other examples in the law?  I mean, can you think of an example in the law which I have been trying to think of where there was a history of doing something?  The statute comes along that makes it a little tougher for the judges to do it.  And then the court says either, sorry, too tough now, or it says let sleeping dogs lie.   INTERRUPTING ",10-1472
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So how does it work?  How does it work?  Two legal permanent residents, a man and his wife, happen to show up in New York and they have a 6-month-old child.  What's the legal -- why doesn't the INS just take the child, ship him off?  I mean there -- is it just discretion?  Or is there some rule of law or regulation that prevents that from happening?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, no.  I have given you the hypothetical.  I mean, there we are.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's all you know.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not asking for that.  I'm saying, what in the law -- that's all you know, all right?  There are -- you know the hypothetical.  I want -- one possible thing to say would be that child is -- is actually -- we are imputing that he is here for lawful permanent residence, too.  Every circuit has had some kind of imputation rule, and moreover there are other areas of law where I have found imputation rules in the immigration law, roughly three or four cases on that.  But they are -- they are not exactly comparable.  Okay.  So I just want to know what is it that prevents you from taking the child and shipping him off to China if we don't impute?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not asking that.  That's another question.  I just want your best effort--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --to give an answer.  Or I'm thinking that your answer is there is nothing, it is either imputation or nothing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And you don't want me to reach that conclusion.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  That isn't my hypothetical.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Actually they came from Italy, in my hypothetical.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't see how -- were you finished?   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't see how you can read the Lepe-Guitron -- that was one of the cases -- it seems to me clearly imputes residence as well.  They quote the earlier case from the circuit which said the 7 years of domicile have to come after their admission for permanent residence.  And then the dissent says: Hey, what about permanent residents?  And what they say is this case was different because in that earlier case the parents had never been admitted.  He came after he was married in this case and was here after his parents were admitted.  Now, I grant you they didn't explicitly say this, but I don't see how they reached their conclusion without it.  And then there is a different split in the circuits about the pro and con of taking on periods, you know, before the domicile, after, et cetera.  And that seems to be what Congress resolved.  So I think if you are talking about what was the law, the law was you did impute with -- you did impute for residence and then Congress sort of just doesn't deal with that and deals with a slightly different thing.  Is that a fair reading, or what do you think?   ",10-1542

And there are criteria -- country with a resettlement program.  And then that seemed like a status, a residence, where you resettled in the other country, were you not, that's his status, and then that's imputed to the child?   Stephen G.

I think I can -- you're not going to say anything that I can't read in the brief on that.  But the other one is worrying me, the structural issue.  So imagine there's no due process concern whatsoever.  Now, when I looked at Crowell, your case would seem to fall right in it.  It is an adjudication under the law as such, you know, between two people -- whatever that famous line is.  You're captured by that one.  So the question is: Can you get out of it with later cases?  And you point to Schor to get out of it.  And Schor, as I read it, is an all-factors case, that when she talks in the structural part of -- about -- when Justice O'Connor is talking about the non-due process part, the structural part, just what you said, that there isn't a hard-and-fast rule, that there are a bunch of factors that we should look at.  At least that's how I read it.  And you were reading it as a hard-and-fast rule, which means you win.  Now -- now, who's -- should I just read this case further and make up my mind about that, or is there something you want to say about it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's what she says.  And the -- and what you're interested in there, the key thing is not fairness.  The key thing is maintaining the integrity of the judicial system.  In Crowell, Justice Hughes says you've made that integrity as long as there were review of matters of fact, the independent decision by a court of questions of law, and reservation to the court of constitutional facts which have never been heard of since.  Okay?  So we have this case.  And your issue is, after all, something that for many, many decades or longer has been the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding.  The bankruptcy judge is an adjunct to the court.  It is well-established, this kind of review.  Every part of Crowell is met.  So what is -- what is essential to the integrity of the judicial process that requires you to have a de novo hearing before a district court rather than the kind of review that's given here?   Stephen G. Breyer  In which case?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, Marathon, you know, you had four, four and -- and who knows what it stands for.

Now, imagine everything the same except the person who asks is called Joe Smith, fraud officer for the agency.  Everything else is the same.  Now is it a report?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you -- first, there is nothing about this in the Sixth Amendment, is there?  I mean, the text of the Sixth Amendment talks about criminal prosecutions requiring the assistance of counsel for defense, period.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There is nothing in the Sixth Amendment that has these qualifications.  I haven't seen anything in any case which was other than case specific.  That is, this issue hasn't been decided before, not to my knowledge.  The language can be taken out of those cases, as you have very properly done.  And so there is nothing that I could find in the cases.  There is nothing in the Sixth Amendment itself.  In 95 percent of the cases, they do plead guilty.  And what's the problem about ordering the prosecution to simply repeat the offer he gave before?  Well, I mean, I don't really see if there -- And prejudice?  Well, if a person's been executed, if he had gotten the -- if he had gotten the plea offer, he would have pled guilty for 50 years in jail, okay?  That's my imaginary case.  I can think of one where there's prejudice.  He's dead.  All right.  So what's the answer in my imaginary case, if it's not in the amendment, not a holding, etc?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't want to -- I want to stop you there because I don't understand it.  The suggestion is -- I'm not taking this case, I'm making up a hypothetical since we are discussing it really based on the next case.  The defendant never heard the offer, never heard it.  It is crystal clear that if he'd heard it, he would have accepted it.  Okay.  I'm trying to separate out difficulties of this case, which strikes me as difficult because of the facts, from the principle.  And what I want you to do is to tell me why I shouldn't accept the principle, and then we can worry about what's a clear case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Death.  Let's say death.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He shows that never did he ever become aware, because his lawyer was sleeping and moved on vacation and never told him about the plea offer.  That's my hypothetical.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, if you don't want to do the capital case, I'm still trying to get to the principle.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I will change my hypothetical and say all that happened was that this perfect trial because of mandatory sentencing rules led him to prison for 50 years, as compared with a plea bargain that would have given him 2 years.  Now, he is in prison for 48 years more, and I consider that that is at least harmful to him.  So where the amendment doesn't speak of it, where the misbehavior of the lawyer is crystal clear, where it's 48 years more in prison, what is it that bars what seems to me obvious that an inadequate assistance of counsel, remedial through a specific decree saying reinstitute the offer, led to enormous unfairness and prejudice.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let's say there is an occasion where people don't get the sentence that they deserve because, for example, the lawyer was inadequate.  I mean--     INTERRUPTING ",10-209X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  It wouldn't be a problem.  The problem with Justice Alito's hypothetical, I take it, is what the order would say is that the prosecution has to for a reasonable time extend the same offer.  And then if it's accepted, you go to the judge.  The judge doesn't have to accept the plea.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You can't make him do that.  But I have a bigger problem with this case, which is -- which I may be the only one to have.  But as I've looked at it, I don't see ineffective assistance of counsel within the AEDPA meaning.  That is, you have two courts in the State which have said this is not ineffective, and as I look at it it's somewhat ambiguous at best -- and we have the Sixth Circuit saying it is.  Well, I know both sides agree, but I mean, both sides couldn't make us decide a case by saying there's a murder when in fact it's not.  I mean, so what am I supposed to do about that?  I find this a tough case.  I have read the record, and in my own opinion at this moment, perhaps no one else's, there is no ineffective assistance of counsel such that the Sixth Circuit could set that aside -- a contrary finding of the State court.  So what do I do?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  Why, why wouldn't the remedy be -- as -- judging from what you said before, is an order saying to the prosecution, re-institute the plea bargain and give him, a week or whatever it is.  Now we imagine the defendant says I accept.  So then they go to the judge, just as they would have before.   Stephen G. Breyer  And the judge has the freedom to accept that or to reject it.   Stephen G. Breyer  If he rejects it, there is no plea agreement.  Now the defendant must plead.  He can plead guilty or not guilty.  And whatever flows from that, flows from that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  His suggestion is perfect but mine is more perfect.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  You don't, you would -- he's right, you would have to, under my suggestion, have a new trial; even though there was a trial that took place two years ago or whatever it is, correct?   Stephen G. Breyer  But that isn't the end of the argument.  So, if you are the defense counsel, the best thing for you to do is not communicate any plea offer you get, and then if your client is found guilty, then you can go back and say, oh by the way, I didn't tell you about this, and he gets a whole new trial.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, let's go back because I'm now becoming convinced -- I am -- I am trying out what Justice Scalia suggested.  Maybe that does work better.  What -- what you'd say is first, throw the defendant out, unless you are convinced that not only is there ineffective assistance, but also it would have made a difference; he would have accepted the plea bargain.   Stephen G. Breyer  So now they have to hold the plea bargain open.  They then do it.  They then go to the judge, like any plea bargain.  90 percent of the time the judge will say fine, and that's the end of it.   Stephen G. Breyer  But should the judge decide that this is a case where he would reject the plea bargain, for any one of a variety of reasons, then our assumption was wrong and we reinstate the previous trial.  Now does a judge just say it's over, you were tried, you were convicted, that's the end of it?  What's wrong with that as a remedy?  I mean, what's -- why is that -- why does that muck up the criminal justice system in some way?  I think that's pretty much what Justice Scalia suggested, and I -- and I am now trying that out, because the more I think about it, the more I think maybe that's okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Montello, I take it was not a title case.  Montello was a regulation of the stream case.  So I can understand perfectly well why that language in Montello applies for the reason Justice Kennedy just said.  Now, I grant you that in later title cases this Court has taken the same words and written them.

Now, how is that not what is forbidden, any requirement -- the exact words are --  ""in addition to or different from the Federal requirements governing the operations of that Federal meatpacking facility. ""  The Federal law does not require me immediately to go over and euthanize the cow.  Your law does require me to go over and immediately euthanize the cow.

It has to -- I mean, if you're going to be so specific as to say the only things that are within the scope of the act are the specific requirements that are there already in the Federal act, then this prohibition against extra, extra regulations means nothing.

What is the scope of the act?  Are you saying the scope of the act refers only to those particular provisions that are already in the act, requirements already there?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes?  Then why did they put in something saying you can't add anything?   Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't see your argument and now I see it.  Okay.  So I understand where you're going.  But then if I look at Section 610 of the act, it has a whole bunch of prohibitions, including prohibitions and references to how you slaughter animals, and including how you slaughter animals humanely.  So there how do you say that this provision which talks about euthanizing an animal that you look around and is lying down, how is that not within the scope of the act?  I'm not saying that they have that particular thing, but the subject matter, slaughtering animals, indeed humanely, is something the act absolutely deals with.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I didn't say that.  I said yes, it's part of the operations, but also it's the subject matter with which the act deals.  The act deals with the humane slaughter of animals and other forms of slaughter of humane -- of animals.  So how -- how is -- So I repeat my question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.

And I suspect from the answers I've gotten so far there's never been a court that read it differently.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know if they said this, but I mean, as I read it, I thought the reason that negligence doesn't play a part is the act which was negligent played a part, of course; it was ""but for""; but the fact that it is negligent is totally irrelevant, because it's not within the risk in any sense whatsoever.

Breyer  Here they have a trigger, not -- not quantitatively.  But here they say it's okay to finance a public candidate publicly, okay to do that.  Now, what we're going to do is give them a million dollars to start with, up to $3 million to spend, depending on how much their opponents spend.  Now, you think that's unconstitutional?

McCain-Feingold is hundreds of pages, and we cannot possibly test each provision which is related to the others on such a test of whether it equalizes or incentivizes or some other thing, because the answer is normally we don't know.  And it is better to say it's all illegal than to subject these things to death by a thousand cuts, because we don't know what will happen when we start tinkering with one provision rather than another.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Where would I read this?  As I read the statute, the statute says the cheap system here is where they provide -- they have a duty to provide the incumbent interconnection, okay?  That requires some physical stuff.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  And they have to -- they -- you're not charged a lot for that; there's a limit on what they can charge you for the interconnection.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, somebody is going to have to decide whether if Pacific Tel and Tel is being tried to forced to connect with Maine, you know, they have to pay for a wire across country to get the interconnection or not?  That seems unreasonable.  Across the street, maybe they do.  My candidate would normally be the FCC or some regulator decides that kind of thing, and it's up to them to say whether this is or is not what's needed for interconnection.  That would be an intuitive account I would have, without having read the statute in depth.  So now what do I read to find out how this works?  What is it that distinguishes something that is ridiculous, like my California example, from something that makes a lot of sense, like they're next door and have to make 50 feet of wire.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Michigan blue--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Where -- where -- 28a, okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So it's up to the State commission.   Stephen G. Breyer  This is the FCC speaking?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And the State commission says -- they say it's up to the State commission.  And the State commission here said?   Stephen G. Breyer  Can I go back to my question?  Because I haven't gotten an answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  I would think -- you said, well, this is an existing facility.   Stephen G. Breyer  But my intuition would be, that makes no difference whatsoever.  You could have some kind of mechanism that connects two companies.  Now, half of it is a simple wire and half of it is bells and whistles, and so we have to decide which part is the part that's necessary for the interconnection and which part is some kind of -- well, I don't know, extra bells and whistles, and therefore, since it's not an impairment kind of problem, they have to pay full price for it.  That, again, seems like the kind of job that Congress would leave up to a commission, but I guess I want you to tell me: Who's to decide that kind of thing, and how do we decide it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know what it is.  Often, these things are not distance.  Often a connection is all kinds of complex things, you know?  And some are necessary and some aren't.  But I can -- can't you imagine with me the same kind of California problem arising, but it just arises in -- in kind, rather than in distance?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't -- what I -- there's no way for you all to go to the FCC and decide what part of this thing is, or any State regulator, what part of it is -- part of what's necessary to facilitate interconnection and what part of it is really providing the work primarily of the -- simply transporting services?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What part is doing something else?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There's no way to do that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, so a judge has to say, on the basis of what, on the basis -- the judge has to say on the basis of the statute, which just uses the word interconnection?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't help because it's a network element, if it's in (3) and what this is, is something that's going to be needed to -- to interconnect.  If it's -- if it's in -- if it's in the first one.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I don't know which is which, and I gather that sometimes it would be tough, and what courts use to do with the ICC when they got into this kind of situation is a doctrine called primary jurisdiction, and they would ask them for a brief.  All right?  So if that's what we've done hypothetically, we have the brief.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now why don't we have to follow the brief?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's not what the statute says.  The statute says the carriers have a duty to provide interconnection.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, in carrying out a duty to provide, you say that's just picking the point, that somebody could equally well say, no, it's a duty to provide means to get to the point.  Now, either of those seem equally consistent with the language.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, it doesn't say that, but it doesn't say the opposite, and therefore, you might have an agency reasonably deciding that to -- to fulfill that duty, you must provide equipment reasonably necessary to allow the competitor to connect.  That's equally sensible.   Stephen G. Breyer  Apparently, you have an agency that never really said one way or the other.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't see what the other -- I didn't hear anything that said they said the other.  They said when you have wires and you're using the wires for communication, then they don't fall outside of this; that's true.  But if you're using them for interconnection, and they're necessary to use for interconnection, maybe it does fall inside this.  I don't--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --They excluded -- they excluded transport -- all transport to the point of interconnection, where you could not provide the facility to interconnect unless you had the transport?  Is that what they did?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Did they do that?  Yes or no?  I bet the answer is no.   Stephen G. Breyer  But there are -- there are cases, I think, in primary jurisdiction where what a District Court has done, anyway, is to hold the case while the ICC went and had a proceeding, and I'm sure that hasn't been used in a long time.   Stephen G. Breyer  It is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, maybe this is the case for it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It all didn't matter because, in fact, they got the TELRIC rates under (c)(3) until they changed the impairment part?   Stephen G. Breyer  So who cared.  And now after that they care.   Stephen G. Breyer  And now -- now -- now the other side cares, of course, and so now -- now we're faced with a situation where they're just putting this in the brief for the first time but they can't base it on anything the commission actually did?

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, we've got to be -- aren't we taking this on -- isn't there an assumption that there is a finding, or some lower court judge made a finding that if he had known about the better deal that was offered, he would have taken it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So that's a causal problem.  You are saying that, even if he had accepted it, it would have gone to the judge, and the judge would have turned it down anyway, the judge wouldn't have accepted it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that your point?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then there's a -- somebody must have found somewhere that this made a difference, that the failure to tell him about the special offer of the misdemeanor did in fact make a difference because he would have accepted it and he would have ended up with it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  This is on the basic question--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, the -- the question -- I make a counter-assumption.  The problem that I -- I have a feeling that I would like you and the others to comment on, is that you are worried deeply about a practical problem, and that the practical problem is that it would be too easy, as just was suggested by the question, to find that the lawyer after the defendant is convicted did a bad job during the plea negotiation, in which case everybody will get two or three bites at the apple.  And one of the reasons for that is every brief has been lifting the standards, particularly in respect to prejudice, from Hill, which was addressing a different question.  It was addressing the question of missed -- bad performance by the lawyer at trial.  And that is hard to track what the effects are.  It isn't that hard to say the trial was unfair, give him a new one.  That won't work here, I don't think.  So suppose what we did, instead of saying there was no right, you simply said you have to prove with some certainty, work out a standard, that there really was inadequate assistance during the plea bargaining, and you have to show something more than a reasonable probability that this would have led to the plea, et cetera.  You have to show that it would have happened.  Or you have a -- in other words, you have two tougher standards for this area, but you don't reject the idea of inadequate assistance of counsel during the plea bargaining stage.  I would like people's views insofar as they are willing to give them, on that question.   INTERRUPTING ",10-444X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What about as a constitutional violation that, in a context of a world where 95 percent of all people in prison are there as a result of bargaining and guilty pleas arranged with prosecutors, in that context, it's fundamentally unfair to deprive a person of his liberty for 40 years instead of six months because the lawyer which he is guaranteed fell down on the basic, fundamental, obvious duty of communicating the relevant plea agreement?   Stephen G. Breyer  So is there any support for me?  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you have read these cases, and now we are right on what I think is the point, because we've both defined a possible constitutional right but there is a practical problem.  All right?  Now, the States and others have dealt with this on your side for the last 30 years -- and presumably you but not me.  I've read a lot more cases.  Now, have they developed -- as you look across those cases, are there some States or places that have developed reasonably tough standards in respect to what counts as ineffective assistance, and in respect to whether it made a difference that would help to alleviate the concern that this would turn into a great mess?  Which it hasn't, apparently.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  Because you have to show a causal connection, so you would have to show -- show in the causal connection that he would have taken that deal.   Stephen G. Breyer  And if -- if you are going to use the words reasonable probability that he would have taken it, it might be fairly easy to show.

Breyer  Well, why wouldn't they have been -- I mean, as I understand it, if a person of a certain set -- it's the same set in both, virtually, the same set of people -- where they are injured on navigable waters or piers and docks and so forth, it's the Longshore Act.  And if you are on the platform, it's this act, so far.  And the benefits are the same.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So the only thing that extending this does, I think he says, is imagine a person who worked on a platform goes to get some platform bits repaired miles from the sea.  Now, that person would not be covered by Longshore Act, would he?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  And he would be covered by this if they're right, but not if Clement is right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So he's saying what point was there for Congress to do that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Let me give you an example.  It might help.  A longshoreman is working on a dock.  Someone tells him: There is a winch here that is broken; take it to the plant to have it repaired, which is 100 miles inland.  He does it, and he's hurt at the plant.  He is not covered, correct.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, that's right.  So he's not covered.   Stephen G. Breyer  But if the same thing happens on the platform, under your theory he is covered.  Now, your opponent is asking a reasonable question.  That seems to be about the only difference that he can think of, whether it's the one act or the other, and why would Congress have done that?  That's his question, and I would like to hear the answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Your answer is basically there are many statutes like this, they all have some kind of OCSLA type requirement, it's the Longshore Act that was rather stingy, and we don't know why.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because of the workmen's compensation?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I'm curious.  To go back a second, I thought Justice Sotomayor's question was, imagine Smith in Germany.  He has written a book.  It's there, already exists, but it has no copyright protection in the United States.  So after this, would he be more willing to send it to the United States?  And I take it your answer is no.  The reason is because I can go and buy a copy and sell it in the United States even without this law.  Is that right or wrong?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, isn't that the question?  The question is, now that Smith has the same protection in the United States that Germany gave him, doesn't that give him an incentive to send his book to the U.S.?  In thinking about that one, I thought: Not much, because I can go buy it today without this law and bring it to the United States and sell as many as I want.  Nonetheless--   Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  No, but in Eldred the main difference is that in Eldred, there was a law that might, at least in principle, have elicited a new book.  And in this case, by definition, there is no benefit given to anything at all that is not already created.   Stephen G. Breyer  So by -- How does it give any benefit to anything because it's already created.   Stephen G. Breyer  How does this provision do that?  I think maybe there are other provisions, but I thought this provision is talking solely about books, for example, that are already created.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is it not?  I may have been misreading, it but I certainly got that out of like 42 briefs and--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Oh, oh.  Okay.  Well, you know, as you also know from the 42 briefs, that there is a lot of argument that you could comply in other ways that are less restrictive; and whether that's true or not, is that -- there what you're saying is -- if I parody it, it's not a fair reading I'm going to give -- but what you're saying is we are, here have a law which says that libraries, music lovers, book buyers will either pay more money for things already in existence or will simply be unable to get them if they are orphans, on the one hand, so that other countries will impose similar kinds of restrictions upon their music lovers, music goers, libraries and -- so that they pay more for our works that are already in restrict -- that are already produced, or simply can't use them because they can't find who owns them.  Now that's in parody form, for succinctness.  What I think the argument is on the other side--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --And they will say, no copyright law -- with your exception of when the country was founded -- no copyright law has served that kind of purpose.  That's served often by tariffs--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --but not by copyright law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not necessarily.  There are three categories.  One is the category of the people who you couldn't, because of the country; that's Egypt, I think, and Russia.  Their second is the category of the people -- of sound recordings, and their third is category which is not the null set, of people who did not comply with certain registration requirements.  For example, I believe that the widow of Samuel -- Brittan failed to renew her copyright, and there are probably many that failed to renew the copyright after 28 years, and the reason that they didn't is because they didn't think there was much money in it, and those are the very works that the libraries want to get ahold of and put in their databases.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true, but for one text.  They say that text has to do with progress.  And when they read it historically in light of Macaulay, in light of the Statute of Anne, in light of going back to Venice and the copyrights, in light of going back to letters between Madison and Jefferson -- that term has always meant produce at least one new thing.  And here there is not one new thing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It couldn't have been that -- it must be somewhat overstated, mustn't it?  Because the only concern is not about protecting new works in the foreign countries -- the concern as I understand it was that we've had things in copyright for many years, and we want retroactive protection there.  The countries that didn't give it, like Japan, were not kicked out of the Berne Convention.  Rather, we pursued them in the WTO for many years, and I guess somebody might pursue us and then you get into an argument about whether there are other ways.  Now, is that strong enough to overcome what these briefs are full of?  I'll give you an example.  Save The Music is charged with looking for Jewish music in the periods '30s, '40s, and '50s.  Other organizations might find a treasure trove of literature that was -- that was copyrighted in Czechoslovakia or in Warsaw, and they want to put it on the web, and they want people to listen to it.  But they have no more idea of how to track down the person on that, and they aren't protected by any notice requirements because they aren't reliance parties.  We're told by Barbara Springer, former registrar, that there are millions of such instances where people would like to go back and would like to put music literature, film, et cetera, in a form that people can use it today and there is no way to do it without their becoming scofflaws, or without their having millions of dollars to hire infinite numbers of trackers and lawyers.  Now, that's the argument that's made on the other side, as the interest in communication that's important.  What do you say?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right here, we have the argument.  I agree with you that it is a general problem.  It may be diminished in the United States but it still exists.  And I guess the argument here is well, don't make it millions of times worse.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is your -- take, what is your reaction to a less dramatic kind of holding?  Suppose we were to say the truth is that the particular individual here does have some religious obligations in teaching and quite a lot that aren't.  So she is sort of on the edge.  At the same time, there is a statute which, whether it applies or not, you could take the principle, and it says a religious organization like your client may require that she conform to the religious tenets of the organization.  So Congress focused on this.  And the district court looks at it -- and suppose it were to decide: That's true, but there is no evidence here at all that religious tenets had anything to do with her being dismissed.  No one mentioned them.  She didn't know about them.  I didn't until I read the very excellent brief filed by the Lutherans that explained the nature of taking civil suits.  No one said that to her, whether it was in someone's mind or not.  She found out on motion for summary judgment.  So therefore this wasn't an effort by the religious organization to express its tenets.  She was dismissed.  She could have -- they could have had a defense, but it doesn't apply, and therefore, even though she's sort of like a minister, she loses.  What are your objections to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Did anyone mention that to her?   Stephen G. Breyer  Really?  My law clerk couldn't find it.  Can you tell me where, where someone did say the reason we are dismissing you is because of our religious doctrine that you cannot bring civil suits?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, does anyone explain to her, which she might not have known, that this is a religious doctrine that you are supposed to go to the synod or whatever, and you're not supposed to go to court?  Of course they wanted to fire her because she threatened to sue them.  But what I'm wondering is, is there anywhere before the motion for summary judgment where someone explains to her, our motivation here is due to our religious tenet?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I understand that.  But I would argue a different piece of matter, that the people who were involved in this were doing it for religious rather than civil reasons.  I'm just wondering what the evidence is that they knew there was such a doctrine, that they were motivated by the religious doctrine, and that they expressed that to her.  I just -- I'll look at page 55.  Is there anything else I should look at?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, Mr. Laycock, we're looking for a citation in the record.  I just wonder, is there anything you want me to read other than page 55?   Stephen G. Breyer  That isn't -- that isn't the problem.  The problem, it seems to me, is I don't know how substantial these interests are religiously.  I don't know how substantial the religion itself considers what they do from a religious perspective.  So let's go back to Justice Alito's problem.  And now on the ministerial issue, we call the synods, we call the how certain was it -- how central is it to the heart of the religion what they're actually doing, and we replicate exactly what he said -- in respect to the problem of religious tenet -- now in respect to the problem of religious minister.  And maybe you can tell me we don't have to go into the one or the other, but I've had enough of these cases in the lower court to know they are really hard.  People believe really different things, and I see no way to avoid going into one or the other, and therefore, I think, rather than try this constitutional matter, let's go to the one Congress suggested.     --Well--   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what do you, that's -- that's the state of the argument that you're walking into, I think.     --If we go to Congress, Congress made it quite clear how this case should be resolved, because Congress expressly did not apply the religious exemptions of the ADA to retaliation.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I don't agree with that.  I think -- I think what it says is a religious organization may require that all applicants and employees conform to the religious tenets.  It put that in the section defining defenses.  The defenses are part of the right, and when it forbids retaliation, it says retaliation against an individual for the exercise of any right granted.  And therefore, I don't believe that a person who has failed to violate the substantive section could be held up normally.  I mean, I don't--     Well, we differ on that, but--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I can think it's pretty easy to read that exception, even though it's in a different subchapter, into the retaliation exception.  Assume for me that that's so.     --It is still the case it is a constitutional matter -- the State's interest in allowing citizens to have access to its courts and to its agencies is paramount -- in cases like child abuse, reporting of school safety problems and others.  In this case, it's -- we are mindful--   Stephen G. Breyer  You bet they don't.     --But they are entitled to.   ",10-553X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, suppose that that's a central tenet.  Suppose you have a religion and the central tenet is: You have a problem with what we do, go to the synod; don't go to court.  And that applies to civil actions of all kinds.  All right?  So would that not be protected by the First Amendment?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Your view is it's not protected?   Stephen G. Breyer  So the fact if they want to choose to the priest, you could go to the Catholic Church and say they have to be women.  I mean, you couldn't say that.  That's obvious.  So how are you distinguishing this?   Stephen G. Breyer  You are saying that going to church -- sorry -- that going to court is a more fundamental interest than a woman obtaining the job that she wants, which happens in this case to be a Catholic priest.  But that's the distinction you're making.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I don't know why that doesn't -- I mean, you may be right, but it isn't obvious to me that the one is the more important than the other.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but then you have to say that it's more important to let people go to court to sue about sex discrimination than it is for a woman to get a job.  I can't say that one way or the other, so -- so I'm stuck.  And since -- since I'm really -- this is tough and I'm stuck on this, I don't see how you can avoid going into religion to some degree.  You have to decide if this is really a minister, for example, and what kind of minister.  That gets you right involved.  Or if you're not going to do that, you're going to go look to see what are their religious tenets?  And that gets you right involved.  I just can't see a way of getting out of something -- of getting out of the whole thing.  I don't see how to do it.  So suppose you said in case of doubt like that, we'll try what Congress suggested.  And now we have here a borderline case of ministry, not the heartland case.  So you say, all right, where you have a borderline case the constitutional issue goes away and what Congress said is okay, so now what you have to prove is you have to prove that the church has to show that the applicant was disciplined or whatever because she didn't conform to the religious tenets.  All right?  That's what they have to show.  And I'm sorry; they maybe only make a prima facie case, but they got to show it, and if they don't show that there was at least some evidence to that effect and that somebody knew about the religious tenet and there was something like that -- maybe it's in the air, as is obvious with Justice Alito's question.  But where it isn't in the air, you'd have to make a showing.  Now I -- I see that's an interference, but -- but I don't see how you avoid an interference someplace or the other.  Otherwise you're going to get into who is a minister.  So what's the answer to this dilemma?  At the moment I'm making an argument for following what Congress said, go back and try it that way, and if they can show in this case and she shows in this case nobody ever thought of this religious tenet, nobody told me, they didn't read it, then she's going to win.  And if they come in and show that they really did this because of their religious tenet, they will win.  What about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it does have the virtue of deciding a statutory question before a tough constitutional question.  And I agree, with what we sometimes do, that seems bizarre, but I thought that was the basic rule.   INTERRUPTING ",10-553X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  You agree with Justice Scalia?   Stephen G. Breyer  The statute says ""or advocate the passage of"".  So I guess that's speech.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Breyer  If it doesn't apply, if voting is not speech, then no matter how outrageous the law or rule, it doesn't fall within the First Amendment; and if it is speech, then you get into some of the questions that were raised, is this too vague or is it not?  So which is it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We might have to write an opinion, irrespective--  [Laughter]  --which says--   Stephen G. Breyer  --either it is speech or not, and so that's why we're asking the question, to get your opinion--   Stephen G. Breyer  --which is an informed opinion, about how we should write that paragraph.  Do we say that voting is within the First Amendment scope or do we say it is not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In that case, the most outrageous law you can think of--   Stephen G. Breyer  --in respect of voting is not covered by the First Amendment?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not asking for willing to do--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I think his argument is -- I don't see -- that the Ethics Commission at least in part relied upon the fact that he was the campaign manager, and he is saying, I think, as I understand it, or at least I have this question, that an ethics commission cannot disqualify a legislator on the ground, even in part, that an individual had a political association with him previously.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It may be a new argument in this Court, I don't know.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that a new argument in this Court, as I've stated it to you?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You made that argument below?   INTERRUPTING ",10-568X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So why -- I mean, what the commission says is Mr. Vasquez has been a close personal friend, confidante, and political advisor throughout the years.  So that doesn't sound like any volunteer.  It sounds like somebody sitting on a case where his best friend is likely to gain millions of dollars.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what it seems when I read that opinion, that they're thinking all these things combined is what causes this to fall within the category of a reasonable person might have doubts about the independence of judgment.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's part of it.  But my -- my basic question is, as you know, with judges, and I guess you have a very vague statute which was quoted to you, and what we have are subsidiary rules with ethics commissioners.  I have in my office--  they're not commissioners; they're committees of judges.  And I have in my office seven volumes which I look at when there's a question, as others do, and those seven volumes contain dozens of opinions of a committee trying to apply vague statutes and vague rules -- not constitutionally vague, but generally.  So what's wrong with Nevada doing exactly the same thing here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, so you're saying that the difference is that we're judges?   Stephen G. Breyer  You mean Congress and legislators and Executive Branch people couldn't have exactly the same system?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And they have general rules?  It's called the common law system.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You didn't answer my question, which is since the Judiciary uses what's called the common law method, why is it impermissible for the Executive Branch or the Legislative Branch also to use a common law, case-by-case method of elucidating through example what a general -- what a general provision means?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I -- so you're saying that one who engages has to use a -- a definitive rule-based method rather than a common law method?  So my question there would be, assuming your difference between the branches is right, still why?   ",10-568X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, suppose somebody goes -- he goes to a country where we have no extradition treaty, takes all his assets and writes a postcard to the IRS once a month saying ha-ha-ha.  I mean, why wouldn't that be an attempt to evade?  That's why he went; he didn't like to pay his taxes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, 7201.  Why can't you -- well, why doesn't that violate 7201?  I mean, my simple question really is you are a drafter, imagine you are a drafter, and you are charged with drafting section 43.  And you read -- try to get the fraud and deceit crimes, okay?  So now we read 76 -- 7206(1) and (2).  And you see for both of those you can't be convicted unless you materially and willfully make a false statement.  So you think, hey, I don't need a special section on that one.  But then you go to 7201, and you say, oh, my God, I just thought, somebody might violate this by going off to some special country, taking all his assets and writing ha-ha-ha.  Now there is no fraud or deceit in that.  He is totally open about it.  But he sure has evadded it.  So therefore I better write a special section.

This is just perjury, which isn't good, but it's And there we are, not in the not fraud or deceit.  statute.  What's the answer to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, not always.  But here we were dealing with a very serious statute, aggravated felonies, that has terrible consequences for the persons who fall within it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And in most of these M's and A's and B's and C's, and so forth, they refer to statutes by number, so most of it although not all of it is very specific.  So when we read these words fraud and deceit here, why don't we say fraud and deceit means fraud and deceit?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Traditional elements.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no.  You have to prove that the -- the liar intended reliance to -- to his detriment.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any -- is there any evidence of what -- I mean is there any argument other than that you just think that and you could argue the other way?  I mean can we get anywhere?   Stephen G. Breyer  Let me go up and start with I mean, if this Justice Ginsburg's first question.  falls within it, 7206, this fraud, what about perjury?  Is every perjury statute within it?  lying to a FBI agent?  And what about And what about lying to a government official which is -- You know, there are all kinds of statutes on that one.  Are all those aggravated felonies?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The government's view is that of course you have to meet the other requirements.  But as far as the words fraud or deceit is concerned, aggravated felony picks up every perjury statute, every lying statute, lying to an FBI agent, lying to this or lying to that, and has that been the consistent policy of the immigration service?  Have they deported people where the other two conditions were fulfilled?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But all I need are a few.  I mean, I just wonder, is it the policy of the INS and the government to deport people where these other things are met, which they may perhaps be rarely, I don't know.  But to deport them where the crime, the underlying crime cases.  is perjury, lying to an FBI agent or lying to other government officials.   ",10-577X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  I mean, normally a lawyer just looks to see what the docket is.  And when there's a case that seems to affect his case, he asks for cert. And our practice normally, since I have been here, is where it implicates the case you hold it until the case is decided; then a writing judge or other people look through it and see if in fact it really does affect it and if it does, we GVR.  I mean, as a practicing lawyer here, have you discovered instances where we failed to do that, do you think?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm having trouble following it.  It may be my fault.  But the -- suppose the Supreme Court has now some kind of interpretation of something that's new.  Now, there are going to be a wide range of people that that many might apply to whose convictions became final or just about final in State courts at different times.  So it's obviously always going to be somewhat unfair and somewhat arbitrary that it applies to some and not to others.  So what is the problem here?  What -- the reading of the statute on the other side says: I'll tell you who it applies to or who it doesn't apply to.  It doesn't apply to people who are the last State court decision was made before the Supreme Court made its decision.  That's it.  Now, that's arbitrary somewhat, but you have to cut and draw a line somewhere.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's the problem?  Why is that complicated?   Stephen G. Breyer  Or the person would say: Look, the State supreme court has -- we are under a decision here the exact opposite of what the United States Supreme Court held; will you please either take our case and hear it or at least send it back to the lower court?  And wouldn't most State supreme courts do it?   ",10-637X

And then sometime thereafter I am being vague on how much time.  Maybe it's a couple of months or something.  The Supreme Court says that particular kind of conduct is protected by the First Amendment.  So now it falls within its exception for: you can't criminalize this.  Now habeas is filed.  Smith files habeas.  Well how can you get that heard?  Because this particular provision says that unless it was clear at the time under, in your view, of the State statute, the final state decision on the matter, you can't get into habeas.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Before you get to the court, could I ask you about what the State attorney, the prosecuting attorney, knew?  Did the prosecuting attorney know that these two individuals from New York were representing this person?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So you think you have -- in your view, the counsel of record knew that these two people in New York were part of the representation.  Did the counsel -- I mean, not the counsel of record, the counsel for the State.  Did the counsel know that they hadn't gotten the notice?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any reason to think that the State attorney or whoever was prosecuting thought that the local counsel was likely not to do much?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, so it's possible -- we will find out later -- that the prosecuting attorney who works for the State knew all those things: One, he's represented by counsel in New York; two, they didn't get the notice; three, the local attorney isn't going to do anything; and conclusion: They likely knew he didn't get the notice, but they are asserting that this is an adequate State ground to bar him coming in to habeas; is that the correct posture of the case?   Stephen G.

Breyer  --All right.  We have to send it back.  I guess we'd have to say what the rule is.  So what -- what is the rule -- what about a rule that says, where in fact attorneys do abandon the client, and the local attorney does as a matter of practice in the State do virtually nothing except to facilitate foreign representation, and where the State had cause to believe -- cause to believe that all that was true.  Then the State cannot assert this as an adequate ground.  That's all.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Irrespective of what the rules were, you would have to show that -- you would have to show that, in fact, in this State it is a practice such that the local counsel doesn't do much of anything except facilitate, because this is a state of mind as to whether the State -- and the State knows that.  If he shows both of those things, and shows that the letter came back, and shows this was abandonment or close thereto, then the State ought to know that this individual had no idea about filing a piece of paper, and thinks somebody else is doing it.  And that's enough to say this is not adequate State ground that would block Federal habeas.  Now your argument against that is what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's true.  But it may save a little time.  I worry we're in an arcane area of the law.  It was created by Robert Jackson, Attorney General and by Thorn burg, Attorney General.  And if we are starting with that, what that says is we have a list over here of excludable things and we have a list of deportable things.  And if you are deported for a reason that shows up on that first list, than the AG could waive.  That's basically the outline I have.  And also I have, which isn't quite right, that in that first list there is something called -- in big letters, CIMT or something, crime of moral turpitude.  And all of the things on the second list, the big issue is, is it a crime of moral turpitude.  As I looked through the opinions, this is what I got out of it.  This is tentative.  I got out, just as you say, there are two things in the second list which are not crimes of moral turpitude.  They consist of illegal entry crimes and gun crimes.  And there are special reasons for the first and the second is debatable, but they have been consistent with that.  Then there are things that are on both lists, they are crimes of moral turpitude.  I counted at least eight cases.  Say, for example, rape, burglary, manslaughter, second degree robbery, indecency with a child and probably some others are all crimes of moral turpitude, so it cuts here, okay.  Then I find Blake, and Blake says sexual abuse of a minor is not a crime of moral turpitude.  That's a little surprising.  But it gives us a reason because, and this was the problem here, it talks about, there has to be substantial -- there has to be similar language in the two lists.  I don't know where that one came from.  It certainly had not been in the earlier cases.  And now we have this case, which is voluntary manslaughter.  I would have thought that voluntary manslaughter is right at the heart of the lists that they said the things are crimes of moral turpitude, and not like visa crimes or gun crimes, if I read the cases.  So where do I end up?  Well, what I end up with is this.  And this is what I would like you to reply to.  Justice Brandies once said something like we have to know before we can say whether an agency opinion is right or wrong, what they are talking about.  I felt perplexity after I had read through these decisions.  In other words, I don't understand it.  So I would like you to explain to me why this all fits together and how, if you can do that, I couldn't get that clear explanation from the brief, and I suspect it is not your fault.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Rape, burglary, manslaughter, second-degree robbery -- all of those cases -- about seven or eight of them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Don't -- that may be his approach.  My approach is look to the category.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Look to the category.  And the category here is not, you know, category as in crime, the category is what kind of a crime.  And this is a crime of violence.  In the statute, or if you look at what was charged, it's called voluntary manslaughter.  Either way, I would think those categories as categories fall within ""crime of moral turpitude"".   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can we go back to the second one?  It's very interesting.  Suppose I say: Okay, I concede.  I'd only do it for the sake of this question: You are absolutely right in your categorization.  The right category is crime of violence.  And then I look at the statute, which is 8 U.S.C. 1101(43), which you probably know by heart -- and I look at the definition of gun crimes, and I look at crimes of violence.  My non-schooled reaction is, well, gun crimes, I can see why they said that wasn't really a crime of moral turpitude, because there are a lot of registration requirements, there are all kinds of different things that drug dealers -- gun dealers have to do, and you could commit that crime in various ways that don't involve moral turpitude.  I can understand that, sort of.  At least, I can see how somebody else might have understood it that way.  Now, I think crimes of violence, I say, hey, I am having trouble here.  Why don't you try to list a few crimes of violence that when they come into the country you are going to say, oh, that wasn't a crime of moral turpitude?  And by the way, I am not asking you to list specific examples; I am asking you to list categories.  List categories of crimes of violence that when the person comes in, you are going to say, hmm, no moral turpitude there.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That is not a crime of -- that is not a moral turpitude, simple assault?  You're going to just hit somebody?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Of course, my basic concern--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Oh, really?  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So there are some.  There are some.   Stephen G. Breyer  They're a little odd, but what I'm raising--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Okay.  What I'm afraid of is this: That once you put this in your category, that you say crimes of violence are not crimes of moral turpitude, then to a large extent you have said good-bye, Justice or Attorney General Robert Jackson.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You are saying good-bye to Jackson and Thornburgh, because you have driven such a wedge between these two statutes that there's hardly anybody who would be able to qualify for the Jackson-Thornburgh approach to this statute.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I overstate slightly, but you see my point.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You are also telling me that -- I didn't know this; I learn something in every argument -- that if we have Jack the cat burglar who was burgling dozens of office buildings -- and abroad -- and assaults people and hits them over the head or whatever with his -- I guess with his fist, that we have no way of excluding that person, should he try -- I -- I have heard criticisms of our immigration policy, but this is surprising to me, that we have no way of excluding that person who is filled with the simple burglary of office buildings and assaults.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Let me just get -- use an example, a hypothetical based on the next case, really: I was thinking Congress passes a law, says you can't phone people between 7:00 at night and 7:00 in the morning and try to sell them something, okay?  That's the law.  And anyone who gets such a phone call gets $500 in damages automatically if they sue in court if they receive such a call.  The harm was getting the call.  So my grandmother, who is always complaining no one ever calls her, loved the telephone call.  She loved it.  The best thing happened to her in a month, okay?  Now, can she sue?   Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, if the FDA bans a substance on the ground that 98 percent of the people it hurts, and there is some kind of automatic recovery, $500 anybody who bought the substance because it wasn't supposed to be sold, and she's one of the 2 percent that it helped--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --you can't sue?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, here she was exposed, or the plaintiff was exposed, to the kind of transaction that Congress said was harmful as a general matter, just like the example you gave.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose Congress makes a finding; this is the finding: We think that lawyers or whoever is engaged in these who hire title insurance companies should hire the best one on the merits, not on the basis of which one will give them the biggest kickback.  We think that's so because that will help keep people secure.  Everyone in such -- who buys a house will feel more secure knowing that the market worked there.  We can't prove who feels insecure and who doesn't.  We think in general they would, and so we give everybody the right to recover $500 if they are injured, where the injury consists of being engaged in a transaction where the title insurance company was not chosen on the merits, but was chosen in whole or in part on the basis of the kickback.  And they write that right into the statute, so therefore there is no doubt that the plaintiff here suffered the harm that Congress sought to forbid.  That harm was being engaged in a transaction where the title insurance company was not chosen on the merits, but partly in terms of a kickback.  Now, what in the Constitution forbids Congress from doing that?   ",10-708X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is the -- I think this is very interesting and informative to me.  Go back to the middle category.  As I am now seeing it, have you a version of the middle category that the Chief Justice was asking.  And -- and call it Congress sometimes passes a statute that creates a pariah.  It could be a substance, it could be a form of behavior, it could be a structure of an industry.  And then once it does that, it makes that unlawful.  And now what it's done, it is more unusual than I ever thought.  It comes up in the loyalty context, fiduciary, but we are not talking about fiduciary.  It says it is a harm and you will earn money if you deal with a pariah, assuming it wasn't your fault.  Now, that's -- that's where I have ended up with your answers to the Chief, and now, having put it that way, I can find loads of examples in my mind where there is a trustee or fiduciary involved.  I can think of an example in the qui tam context, but to think of one right on point is a little hard, though I thought there must be some.   Stephen G. Breyer  The what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You mean you can sue in court even if what you come in and you say, they breached my contract, and as a result, I made $10,000 I wouldn't have otherwise made?

LAMKEN -- and that is the majority rule today.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But Justice Scalia has a point.  I mean, as I heard it, he was reiterating what used to be called a prudential rule of standing.  It wasn't constitutional, but you looked to see if the statute is meant to protect this kind of person against that kind of harm, all right?  And if not, there is lack of prudential standing.  Well, if that's the test, his case would fall outside it, because the tax law is not meant to protect the plaintiff there, but this case would fall within it.   INTERRUPTING ",10-708X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right, suppose -- suppose that the Federal Trade Commission after a 3-year study of pharmaceutical manufacturing practices, decides -- finds the following.  They say: We have found that when drugs are sold to doctors it is very important that the doctor find out what's curable, what the drug does, how much it costs; and by the way, all those things apply no matter who the doctor is.  Who the doctor is, is irrelevant.  And therefore marketing that focuses upon who the doctor is and what his previous practices were is irrelevant and harmful and false; and therefore we find that it is a false and deceptive practice under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to use the following prior practices of the doctor in selling him new drugs, because it's irrelevant and because it's false and because it's harmful.  And they enact that as a -- as a rule of the Federal Trade Commission.  Does the Constitution of the United States forbid them, having made those findings in detail, from controlling advertising to prevent what they have determined is a false and misleading practice?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, nobody says it doesn't apply.  The question--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm not interested in what they're saying for the present purposes.  I'm interested, surprisingly enough, in what I'm saying.  [Laughter]  So therefore I would like to know the answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  This is a highly regulated industry.   Stephen G. Breyer  If the Federal Trade Commission's specialists and experts in false and deceptive advertising concludes that this is a false and deceptive practice, are you going to say that the Constitution of the United States forbids them from doing that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well -- well, when you say you are, is there any precedent that says they can't regulate false and misleading practice?  Of course you see where I'm going.   Stephen G. Breyer  If they can, why can't Vermont?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, they said it was biased--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and they -- they have made a study of it in the legislature and that's their conclusion.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's where I was going.   Stephen G. Breyer  I chose an example that's beyond your case.   Stephen G. Breyer  But that's why I wondered how you would respond to that.  So -- I thought that was one that was going to be obviously constitutional, but you're going to stop me there.  So -- so what I want to say--   Stephen G. Breyer  --is how is this different?   Stephen G. Breyer  And I suppose I don't know the extent to which this does or does not promote unbiased information from going to the doctors, and isn't that a matter for the doctors themselves and the Vermont legislature rather than this Court to decide?   Stephen G. Breyer  Could the Federal Power -- the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission say, we want you to collect certain information about who is using what natural gas and give it to the fire department?  It's for the fire department in case of emergency, and what we don't want to have happen is it's used to stove manufacturers to sell homeowners gas stoves.   Stephen G. Breyer  They could do that?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, fine.  If they could do that, why can't they do this?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, this is information -- see, this is information that starts off being collected because the government requires it to be collected.  So it's there for that reason.  And the government says we want you to get this information, it's done for this purpose, so, you know, other purposes, and we don't want it to be used for commercial advertising purposes.  That's what they say they've done in this statute.   Stephen G. Breyer  It used to be true there was something called a regulated industry.   Stephen G. Breyer  And selling was simply one activity among many.   Stephen G. Breyer  And there were lots of regulations that could be imposed upon selling.   Stephen G. Breyer  Are you saying that all those should be reexamined?   ",10-779X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is the reason why, if we give absolute immunity to the witness at a trial, we give absolute immunity to the prosecutors and government officials at the trial, and a grand jury is sort of like a trial, at least it's testimony under oath.  And in addition there's this special thing about grand juries being secret, which if you allow people who are annoyed and they would be quite rightly angry, they have been acquitted, they had to go through this process, they'd want to sue somebody.  If we let them sue, you will wreck the secrecy of a lot of cases.  So I see a reason for treating the grand jury even more strictly.  What's the reason for treating it less strictly?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose I don't accept that.  Suppose I say, yes, I accept that, there's a relationship, but exactly what happened in 1871 is not precisely always the convincing feature for me.  So I read what the situation is today, and it is I think as I described it.  So given the situation today, my question remains.   Stephen G. Breyer  You can't disagree with my question.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I would like an answer to my question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Are there States that have that?  or are there any other jurisdictions where they don't give immunity to grand jury testimony for complaining witnesses or others?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Today are there a lot?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, is there any way to find out what's happened?  Have they been -- have the grand juries been undermined?  Have they not been undermined?  I mean, what has actually happened in those cases?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can you give me an example of one or two States that allow these actions?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  For how long have they had that?   Stephen G. Breyer  For how long?   Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and have there been many such grand jury acts?   ",10-788X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is it different from -- I mean, I find the Solicitor General -- it's my fault, I'm sure -- I don't understand the position they're taking.  I mean, I think in every case there is some evidence about what goes on outside the courtroom or the grand jury room, and then there is some evidence about what went on inside.  And I don't know when you're supposed to introduce what.  So I'm guessing that, whatever the rule is about when you can use what parts of what, that if you win the rule about when you should use or when you still can use the testimony that's given in the grand jury room is the same as the rule that says when you can use the testimony of a witness at trial.  See, I would have thought that immunity means you can't use that testimony, but I'm told I'm wrong about that.  You sometimes can use it.  So then I don't know when you can use it and when you can't.  Maybe you know.  You've studied this case.  I admit I haven't studied it as thoroughly as I hope you have.   Stephen G. Breyer  When you say absolutely immune, I'm thinking of a typical case as follows: Smith says to his friend: I hate that rat Jones.  I am going to go and lie and say he stole my horse.  Next step, he goes to the grand jury or someone and says: Jones stole my horse.  Third step, he's in the grand jury room saying: Jones stole my horse.  Fourth, he's at trial, okay?  So what comes in and what doesn't?  And can you bring a case in the first place?  I'm at sea.  Whatever you can help me with, I'd be happy.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But there's always something else.  He didn't think of this thing for the first time in the grand jury room.  The defendant thought of this thing outside the grand jury room before he even got to the grand jury, and he probably told somebody about it, or he could have, or at least there's the evidence that he walked to the grand jury room, okay?  So there is always something outside the grand jury.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is the prosecutor immune -- I know the prosecutor is not immune or the complaining witness is not when they get an arrest warrant.  Is the prosecutor immune when he is taking the step of getting an information or indictment?   Stephen G. Breyer  He is immune?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So this is equivalent to doing that.  That's a prosecutorial function.  The prosecution would be immune.   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course, this isn't a prosecutor; this is a subordinate.  The person here is the defend--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Is there any subordinate government official involved when a prosecutor gets an information, files an information or -- the way you get somebody indicted is you have an indictment, which is the grand jury, I guess.   Stephen G. Breyer  Or an information.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  When you get the information, is it just somebody from the district attorney's office or the prosecutor's office, or is there somebody else there?  Is there a policeman there that gives any--   Stephen G. Breyer  --There can be, okay.  If there is, has he ever been held immune or not?  The prosecutor is immune.  Now he's there with an assistant, the policeman to back him up.  Is there any law on that, whether the policeman is immune?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, he's not immune.  We know he's not that.  It's just he files the information.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.   ",10-788X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can I bring you back for a minute, please, to the statute, and if you -- it's in page 3 of the blue brief.  And in just reading it, I might be missing something which you will point out to me, I'm sure.  But if you get the statute at the bottom of the page, it says, as I -- if you've got it there, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  It says, ANDA Holder> [""], now that's -- that's Novo,  ""holder of the approval -- the approval Holder for the drug, a. ""  --I'm skipping words --  ""a use of which is claimed by the patent. ""  and that's what you are doing -- what's that use was, and I look at page 12 and the use is  ""a method for improving glycemic in adults with type 2 diabetes mellites. ""  So that's the use that you're -- that's the use that's claimed by the patent.  ""If you bring a patent infringement action against the ANDA applicant. ""  that's them,  ""the ANDA applicant may assert a counterclaim, which they want to do, seeking an order requiring the holder to correct the patent information on the ground that the patent does not claim an approved method of using the drug. ""  So I look at that with those words -- I've skipped words.  I look at those words and I say that's what they are saying.  They are saying the use that -- that it -- that your patent does not cover a portion of the set of things described by your use.  And therefore they would like to correct the description so that the description no longer covers something that you do not have -- a use that you do not have a patent on.  Now that would seem to me to fit within those literal words.  And of course the purpose is what we have been arguing about.  But just looking at the literal words, why doesn't it fit?   Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, you are saying that the -- this -- a method for improving glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes mellites is not the patent information.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know, but are saying it is patent information?   Stephen G. Breyer  I do.  Maybe your colleague can find it for you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You know, I know that argument, right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You don't need that argument.  If you're right that the patent information in this particular provision does not have anything to do with or at least does not cover the words about diabetes I just read, well, then I guess this section would have nothing to do with it because those are the words they want corrected, aren't they?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but what it also says is this, and that's what I want to go back to this literal statutory argument.  We took the words, because this is what you can correct.  What you can correct, the statute says, is you can correct  ""patent information submitted by the Holder under subsection (B) or (C). ""  So we look at (B), and what (B) says is (B) tells us that you are supposed to submit in respect to where you claim the use of a drug the patent number and the expiration date.  So, so far that seems to support you.  But then we look at the regulations which the FDA promulgated, I take it promulgated in respect to (B) and (C), particularly the sentence I read, or maybe some similar sentence, and it tells you that you have to provide the description of the patented method of use as required for publication.  So now I go back and look at what you did provide.  And what you did provide was you provided -- you said that what we do, we have a method for improving glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes mellitus.  That seems to fit directly under (iii) of the FDA's requirement and that FDA requirement was an expansion of (B) and therefore it sounds to me as if when they say ""correct"", ""correct the patent information"", it includes the sentence that you put there that they would like to see corrected.  Now, what's wrong with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, the government -- now, the government, which is representing all the government agencies, whether the FDA signs it or not, tells us that that language, that (b) and (c) language about patent information as interpreted by the regs does cover this stuff.  This is about the most technical statute I ever read--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and -- when I'm talking about patent information among (b) and (c), we have the government telling us that that covers this, and why don't I just stop right there and say thank goodness I am out of this case -- and I'm not out of it--   INTERRUPTING ",10-844X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What happens in a 12 or 13 case, just your typical case -- and this must arise fairly often -- in year 1, on January 1 the farm or the ship or whatever is the subject goes into Chapter 12 or 13.  They have a lot of pre-1 debt.  Then in year 2 and year 3, the proceedings are going on, but the farm is operating, so is the ship, or whatever.  And they earn -- they run up debts during that time.  People give them fertilizer -- you know, all kinds of things.  So they have a lot of debts that they've run up in that time.  Now, it draws to a close at the end of year 3.  Now, what about those debts that have been run up during that time?  There isn't a separate bankruptcy estate for tax purposes, I understand.  But if Joe Smith has loaned his farm some money during that time, and it comes time to look at the future income to subtract the prepetition debts, does his debt get wound up and get some priority in that process, or is he just at the end of the queue?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Well, if he gets priority, then why in heaven's name shouldn't a tax get priority?  That's your point.   Stephen G. Breyer  And if it does, then, of course, the exception that Senator Grassley put in applies to that.  So that's a question I should ask them, given your answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But that's -- that's my first question.  What actually happens?  I mean, this isn't the first year of Chapter 12 and 13.   Stephen G. Breyer  And there must be instances where the -- where the debts run up postpetition are pretty big--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and there isn't enough money to go around and they are going to have to be paid out of future income along with the prepetition debts; and it can be done, but there is a question of priorities; and the government is saying there is no priority -- I think they are saying that -- for a postpetition debt, and -- and you're saying: Oh, but of course there is.  So what actually happens?  There have been perhaps thousands and thousands of cases, haven't there?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Get paid, if necessary, by assigning priorities?   Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Just following up on that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm looking for what I call past practice, where there must be a lot--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that would shed some light on this.  So, I see -- your point that we cannot call these taxes administrative expenses is because when that's defined in 503 for the entire code.   Stephen G. Breyer  It talks about administrative expenses incurred by the estate.   Stephen G. Breyer  So you are saying here are three people who incurred their own taxes.  One is Section 12, one is Section 13 and one is individuals in Section 11.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  At least that's my--   Stephen G. Breyer  --So we have three categories of people that -- where the taxes literally taken, they incur postpetition taxes.  Now the bite would come up if it turned out when they were getting around to settle these things that there isn't enough money to pay fully the postpetition or let's -- no, to pay fully the domestic support obligations, wages, and also Federal taxes.  Isn't that -- that's where it's going to show up, because the question will be, do you have to shave the Federal taxes because they are coming in to be paid as an administrative expense priority which is only -- there as number 2, I think, in light of number 1.  Or do you not shave them at all.  If they were liable personally, there isn't any reduction in the amount of the Federal government, if they are allowed because it's one of the estate's expenses basically; using the estate very, very loosely then they would have to take a reduction, too.  Am I right?  Are you following it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  The administrative expenses don't have to be paid in full if there isn't enough money for them to in unsecured claims for domestic support obligations, because the administrative expenses is the second priority, it isn't the first.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  How would it show up?  I mean, what -- what -- what difference -- suppose -- suppose -- in 11 individual, 12, or 13, what's the difference whether you treated it as an administrative expense or not, as long as they all have to be paid anyway, you say?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  How would we know?  How would we know--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let's imagine you are absolutely right.  They mean to treat them differently?   Stephen G. Breyer  They mean to treat the postpetition tax obligation to the Federal Government not as an administrative expense.  But this is an instance where the business will continue, and therefore, you have said in order to continue you have to pay all your tax liability and all your administrative expenses.   Stephen G. Breyer  Therefore, what difference does it make whether you do or whether you don't treat them as administrative expenses?  What is the operational difference?   INTERRUPTING ",10-875X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What I'm concerned about I think is the same thing that the Chief Justice mentioned, the particular language in Napier.  And whatever -- however this might come out today if Napier were decided again, it did come out the way it did.  And Justice Brandeis did write it, and it's been the law a long time.  And the argument is made in Napier that this particular State regulation is aimed at preventing sickness and disease, not at making locomotives safe, and therefore it's not preempted.  And the answer to that was not: Sickness and disease are an object of the statute, too.  The answer was the Federal and the State statutes are directed to the same subject, the equipment of locomotives, and therefore it is preemptive.  Now, how could we come out in your favor without overturning what seems to be that key sentence in Napier?  That is the problem that's bothering me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  That's a -- the problem with A is that it's been followed and followed and followed and followed, and really read for all its worth, and so forth.  So -- so one question is, to what extent can I go back and revise that sentence?  That's A.  Okay?  What's B?   Stephen G. Breyer  Not -- now, is there any way that you could win your case -- reasonably, in a reasonable way, not some far-out way -- but you win your case on this, and it does not affect the manufacturers' way of dealing with their equipment?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is that?   Stephen G. Breyer  You just -- you just said that, which I think you certainly have the right to bring a claim, don't you, to say the repair shop doesn't have adequate warnings.  And if -- if that's -- if the railroad's at fault in that, or the manufacturers or the owner of the repair shop, everybody who ever puts the asbestos in there is negligent in not putting up adequate warnings.  What's wrong with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  What about -- what about not -- what about getting away from the equipment and saying the failure here is not to fail to put it on the equipment; it's to fail to put it in the repair shop.   Stephen G. Breyer  There's something I'm not seeing.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what's the difference then?  How do you do it?  How do you -- what is it you're thinking of that the manufacturer's going to have to do in respect to his locomotive in order to comply with the State law about warning that is not going to mean that he changes the locomotive when it runs on the railroad?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, give me an example.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Does that have anything to do with this case, the removal, never further -- no further use of a bit of a locomotive?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Okay.  Let's get to this case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, I didn't know anybody denied that, that the State could regulate the repair shop, indeed require what warnings they wish, indeed require what equipment workers have to have.  I thought we are only talking about those rules of State law that would affect what the manufacturer has to put by way of design in his locomotive.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's where I'm having trouble.  I'm thinking one that would only affect repair shops and repairs, but maybe there is some kind of equipment that you could stick on the front of it and it is a hook or something and it holds something, and before it goes back on the line you take it off and put it in the locker.  And -- but you know, the more I thought along those lines I thought I'm getting into outer space.  This isn't reality.  So--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  Now, does that have more than theoretical value in this case?   ",10-879X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why would their law be preempted, a law be preempted, a State law that says: Since the railroad knows that asbestos is dangerous when revealed and since it would be revealed in a repair shop, the railroad has to provide the repair shops with appropriate worker safety equipment; or alternatively, in Lesser, the railroad has to provide for the repair shop's documents to be given to the workers which explain the risks and how they can overcome them.  Now, in respect to that, which I'll lump under various kinds of failure-to-warn claims, how does the act preempt those?  It doesn't affect design of the railroad, nor does it affect the use.  Neither.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no.  That argument would prevent States doing what they can do lawfully which is to regulate the repair shop.  Because with any given repair, with many of them you could say, well, we wouldn't have to -- we could just change the locomotive design, for example.  It carries beds with it so that the workers who are repairing it get adequate sleep.  I mean, that isn't an answer to the argument that it doesn't affect design to say well, they could comply with it by changing design, I don't think.   Stephen G. Breyer  What you're saying is because when you open up the box, something no one does on line, you will expose yourself to risks.  And what we are saying is, therefore, you must post a notice that tells workers about those risks.  And indeed there is a conflict, conflict preemption will take care of it.  But why should that kind of thing fall within the scope of field preemption even under Napier which, of course, referred to equipment while this rule doesn't.  It refers to a sign.  You're not going to change the equipment.   ",10-879X

Now, is everything okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So what are we arguing about?  Why not just say look, this is like the Copy Write Act registration requirement.  I mean, it's not jurisdictional, in the sense that the court has to look through all these appendices itself to see that everything is perfect.  It's just something you should do.  And if you didn't do it, then in an appropriate case the judge didn't do it himself or waive it or whatever makes sense in this circumstances.  What's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So they entered judgment without it.  We will assume, nunc pro tunc, they didn't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is the horrible thing about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  You tell me.  This is a statute that the purpose of which was to speed things up, which was to help courts of appeals by eliminating drawls while focusing on issues that really do have constitutional issues.  Now suddenly what's worrying me, and I don't have the definite answer, is if I adopt your interpretation, this is jurisdictional, I am somehow increasing the workload of the courts of appeals because they will have to have staff people going through to see whether every i is dotted and every t crossed and they did have all the right things there, and the pain of doing that is if you don't do it, then you have to do these things over again, and it will be too late, people get another lawsuit.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why then -- I mean, you can read the statute differently.  You can say I'm now the court of appeals judge.  I look at it.  Lo and behold, there are two blanks.  But on the basis of what I read in the briefs and the record, I can say that the appellant has made a substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right.  I know the record, and he has these things there.  And also, I know what they are.  Okay?  So I fill in the blanks, or the chief judge of the circuit fills in the blanks, with the panel's approval.  Now, the only reason for doing that is that it saves everybody a lot of time, and it costs nobody anything.  So -- so why not, since the language permits it, do that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But no, you're giving the conclusion.  I've just said the statute doesn't.  They can take the appeal and they are not going to get anywhere because of this error of the lower court judge unless the court of appeals, having looked at the record a little bit, discovers that there is a substantial constitutional question and they know what it is, and then they fill in the blanks.

I'd have to be able to fill in those blanks, or goodbye.  So it doesn't get any meritless ones up there.  The only ones that come up are merit -- merited.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if there is an insurmountable obstacle -- although, as in this case perhaps we don't reach the constitutional issue -- there is one there, so it is appealable, but we say we do not reach it because there is this impossible procedural obstacle that here blocks it.  There we have a system that seems more efficient, and seems what is being argued, and all we have to do is say this is not a jurisdictional requirement in (2) or (3), and there we have it.  What's wrong with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't say that--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --So I could just sign this tomorrow and that would moot this case and get rid of it.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What if the -- it might be unusual, but you can't try a person who's not competent.  You can't try him.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what about -- and now he's been tried, and he's been convicted and been appealed and gone through the procedures.  But some case could arise where, in habeas, they made like a prima facie showing or a -- convinced the judge that there really is a very good chance here, or maybe even I think it's probable that the basic trial was unfair, to the point where it's like not having a trial.  What about in that situation, if it ever arises?  I mean, should we leave the door open just for that possibility?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I have that.  That's why I put in the possibility that on the basis of what's presented to me, the judge, I think I have so much without this defendant's testimony here suggesting it was unfair, that maybe the presumption should shift back.  That's what's worrying me in the back of my mind, that there could be such a case.  There have been in history.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Which he can't do if he's not competent.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  I mean -- sorry.  I didn't mean to say it in that particular tone.  But I mean, trial judges run their trials.  You know, that's what they're hired for.  And once we make it clear, it shouldn't go on forever, and why can't we trust them to do their job?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It shouldn't be indefinite.  The object of this is you're trying to give -- like you would with any witness who's not around at the moment, you're trying to produce a hearing that will reach a result with this witness.  And if you think after a reasonable period of time, that witness will recover and be available, fine.  And if there is no hope of that, forget it.  I mean, you know, something like that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why would we, in this kind of case, as opposed to, say, some other case where a witness is missing and it's crucial?  The district court does have authority to grant stays.  And we haven't said, but no longer than a year.  Why do we say, but they do it in a reasonable time?  If they abuse their discretion, there is mandamus, or there are other ways of controlling the discretion.  Why are we suddenly here, in this case, imposing a fixed number of days?  I mean, the reason, of course, that the psychological association says six months to nine months is they have different studies.  In some places, it's six months; in some places, it's nine months.  And so why are we picking a number out of a hat here when we don't elsewhere?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It should, but it should be something like reasonable or don't abuse your discretion or -- I mean, at the moment, I'm just not seeing why this is different than 10,000 other kinds of instances where we set that kind of limit, rather than days.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, which is it you're doing?  I mean, I imagine -- I thought you were saying you always need a reasonable suspicion, so I imagine a case where the person is going to be arrested, put into the general prison population, there is a warrant out against him for second-degree murder, and the policeman stopping him for a traffic offense arrests him because he knows he is wanted on a warrant in another place, and the jail has a policy that says when you're -- come in here because of second-degree murder, we strip search.  Okay?  Can they do that under your rule or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's all they know.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then you do not want to -- then you are not saying it always has to be reasonable suspicion.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, all right.  That isn't helping me.   Stephen G. Breyer  What helps me is to know what the category of things is that the jail in your opinion is going to have to look into the characteristics of this individual person, and when I look at the ABA, they talked about minor arrests.   Stephen G. Breyer  And when I look at some of the cases, there is a long list, like violence, drugs, and so forth, where you don't have to, where you can just use the general fact that he was arrested--   Stephen G. Breyer  --for the thing.  But there are other ones, minor ones, where you do.  So what is your rule on that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Then the next question which we'll get--   Stephen G. Breyer  --who is a minor offender and how do you administer that rule?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, that of course--   Stephen G. Breyer  --unfortunately, I'm asking you and not them, and -- and it's the same question.   Stephen G. Breyer  How do you want us to write this so that jail personnel all over the country--   Stephen G. Breyer  --have to be able to follow it and know exactly what they are supposed to do.   Stephen G.

Breyer  Do you know?   Stephen G. Breyer  Try the ABA.  The ABA is minor offenses, not drugs, not violence, and there you have to have reasonable suspicion.  Now, I've read through the briefs and I can't find a lot of contrabanders that were caught in that category.  In fact, my law clerk thinks it's one out of 64,000 or less.  So -- so what is the justification for a rule to avoid reasonable suspicion in that category?   Stephen G. Breyer  It's a conclusion, and we have a lot of practical experience because different States have different rules and San Francisco came in with I think the toughest on your side, for your side.  I just say, looking through that, it's very hard to find somebody who really was in this minor offender category, who really was found to have contraband.  So what should I look at to show that my initial reaction from the quick reading is wrong?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do I just say--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Is there any evidence -- I count seven or eight States anyway that have some variation of the reasonable suspicion rule like what they want -- roughly.  Is there any evidence at all that in those seven or eight States, there is more contraband being smuggled in?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's my -- that is my problem.  You -- I overstated the strength of your evidence.  I was just trying to throw it out, but I understated it.  San Francisco's point is really the 30 to 60 percent or some very high percentage of people who come in for minor crimes are high on drugs or have been -- and there is just that footnote really which has a few examples.  Definitely they are there in this category.  So would it be helpful if you included in the excluded part people who were high on drugs?  You see, so we give you the high on drugs people.  It's the drug offense, and those who are high on drugs, and those -- I mean is there a way of drawing this rule that we could catch most of the people--   Stephen G. Breyer  --The simplest thing for any prison official is say do it for everybody.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And so the fact they do it for everybody and don't try to make some exclusion for traffic violators or something might be consistent with little or no evidence; it might be consistent with some.

We take that as a harm; is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So the question is how likely is that to occur?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Fine.  That's why I say certainly -- it might not be a storm tomorrow.  I mean, you know, nothing is certain.  But I see it's some degree of what you say -- some people say certainly, some people say likelihood, etc.  So put to the side.  What I want to know is, we have a declaration of Mr. Scott McKay.  Now, Mr. Scott McKay says he's represented two of the people who are allegedly part of al Qaeda and committed crimes, and he has represented them for some time.  One is in Guantanamo.  Another is charged with various crimes and is subject to many, many civil suits.  In the course of that, he has to phone and has phoned lots of people in Saudi Arabia, in the various Arab states, and in the past the U.S. intercepted some 10,000 telephone calls and 20,000 e-mail communications involving his client.  So isn't it a fair inference, almost pretty certain, maybe about as much as the storm, that if the security agencies are doing their job, they will, in fact, intercept further communications involving this particular individual, the two that he's representing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And why doesn't that meet the test?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But why can't we get an answer to that question?  I mean, I see your point.  I'm interrupting because I see where you're going.  And it seems to me that, at least, if held in camera, I can't imagine what security it would violate, whether the government were to say, if necessary privately to a judge, would say, no, we do not intend to use this new authority for this purpose.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or it could say the contrary.  And so couldn't we find out whether he has standing there without jeopardizing any concern of national security?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, there is if, in fact, the government is going to use this statute to continue to do some of the 10,000 or 20,000--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you think it's speculation.  The government has a statute that says you can wiretap in the United States organized crime when life is at stake and you show it to a judge.  Then they say, that isn't good enough.  We pass a new statute, and it says, suppression of organized crime, wiretap when you want, without a judge.  Now, a lawyer who represents organized crime says, my clients have been wiretapped under the first statute 400,000 times.  Now, I'll tell you, when the government gets ahold of this second statute, it's going to be a million times, because they want to suppress organized crime.  I'm not saying my clients are guilty, but we all know.  Okay.  So.  Now, the question, which I haven't thought of before, you are saying no standing, no standing, can't raise it--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --No, you can't.  You can't do that here.  So -- so what I'm thinking is, he seems to be separate from other people.  He seems very likely to have a concrete injury.  If they -- if they aren't wiretapping the people who are described here, who are they wiretapping?  And they passed this statute in order to have extra authority.  So put those three things together, and they seem to spell mother, perhaps, you know.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1025
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I think the -- which I think is difficult, because it makes this case somewhat unique, so that what you're worried about most is the definition of foreign intelligence information, which defines it to include information with respect to a foreign power or foreign territory that relates to the conduct of foreign affairs.  It's very general.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then, the Attorney General can, if he decides there are exigent circumstances, wiretap for a year, anyway, without going to any court, something that isn't true of the ordinary wiretapping.  Now, you say, look, if there is any special group that's going to apply to, that is the group that they wiretapped 10,000 times when they didn't even have that authority.  And the government is saying, maybe, maybe not.  And there, we have an argument.  Is there a way of resolving it?  That is, is it open to the government, if you prevail, and we say, you know, they have this extra broad authority, there is no way to check it through a court, it does cause harm, these are the most likely people to be harmed and there is very good reason, whatever words we use there, to think it will be used for them, that the government -- is there some way the government could say, in camera even, no, we are not doing it?  Here are our procedures.  We are not going to show them to anybody but you, judge.  I mean, is there a way for the government to show that you're wrong--   Stephen G.

Breyer  That's on that branch of your argument, which makes me more nervous than the other branch.  The other branch, they might say something like: We're supposed to minimize risks of catching in surveillance Americans and this is what we do.  And they show that and they say: We go to the FISA court.  Except in these very rare instances where there are emergencies, da, da, da.  And I guess by that point they might be able to reduce the risks to this kind of plaintiff to where it's the same as virtually anybody else or they might be -- be showing it's constitutional.  That's where I -- that's why I ask the question.  I'm not certain of where I am going.   ",11-1025
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  This, I take it, is a statutory case, not a constitutional case.  That is, do you have any constitutional objection if Congress had said in 216(b) that Joe Smith and other people similarly situated to Miss Laura Symczyk have a genuine dispute with the employer, and the way they file their case is Miss Symczyk's case will be deemed to be their case as well, though it ceases to be their case unless they confirm within 60 days of such and such in writing that it is their case.  If Congress passed that statute, there couldn't be a constitutional objection to it, could there?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no.  You see what I'm driving at?  In other words, if Congress had explicitly said in 216(b) that the Third Circuit's procedure is the correct procedure for Mr. Joe Smith to bring his case in such circumstances, if they had said that explicitly, is there a constitutional objection; if so, what could it be?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, we know at least, since we are doing -- I looked up a little bit, but Article III is what was a case or controversy in Westminster in 1788 or 1750 or whenever, that in Westminster, in a court of equity, I found at least two instances, a person dies, there is no case with that person, but it remained in equity on the docket until the other person, the estate, came in.  A woman could not bring a case if she was married.  She starts as a single person.  She gets married.  Lo and behold, the case remains on the docket until her husband comes in.  That's not a happy example, but nonetheless it's in point.  Now, I could find nothing the other way, so I thought of the canon of interpretation that equity deems to have been done what ought to have been done, or something like that.  Others on the Court -- but the -- the point is that there are instances--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What?  Yes.  It remained on the docket in the Westminster courts, even though there was no plaintiff.  So I would ask you again, is there any counter example?  Is there any instance from equity or elsewhere where there is a constitutional objection, had they said it, at which point our question is have they said it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  It's Mr. Joe Smith, if he confirms it in writing.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  That's true.  And so what we would be reading into this statute is a relation-back doctrine, which happens every day of the week in class action cases and has historical analogies.  So I understand the difference you're pointing to, but why not read that in?  It would be fair, and it would get the job done that Congress sets up in the statute.

Is there a different rule or a different -- what -- what rule?  So I could come back to the statute.  And Congress could deprive -- could provide exactly the system that you suggest.  I don't see anything unconstitutional about it.  But isn't it a little hard to read this statute as providing that mechanism, since what it says is no party shall -- no -- you know, it says what it says in the last two sentences.  How do we read that to foresee the mechanism that you're talking about?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, he says the difference in the class action context is, in the class action context you can consider them there, but there isn't a specific sentence somewhere in a statute which says no one shall be a party unless he signs in writing.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why?  Why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because that's -- why?  Why is my question?   Stephen G. Breyer  How does that differ from an employee who says -- he is annoyed for a variety of reasons at the employer and he sues the employer for his pay, for his pay for the month of October.  The employer says: He got his pay; I -- I sent him the check; I mean, he gets it every month.  And he says: Yes, but I didn't cash the check.  Is there a case for controversy?  He can go sue for his paycheck that he didn't cash?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So why is it any different when the -- the defendant employer says, here's the check.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And he says: Oh, I didn't cash it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now we have a case if the employer for some reason, a mistake in bookkeeping or something, didn't send the check on time, so it arrived 3 days late.  And he says: Ha, I'm not cashing the check; now I can sue him.  Right?  That's your theory.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  He -- he -- it's a contract.  You know.  He -- he is paid every month, the end of the month.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Even though the -- the employer gave him the paycheck.  He just didn't cash it.

That if it's the purpose of the certification stage to try out every element of liability at that stage rather than waiting for the trial?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, it's not.  Good.  Now, once you say that, what you have said is, you know, it could still be material for some individual, even though there is no market reliance.  And similarly, a silence going [indicating,] some odd set of words or whatever it is, although it's not false for almost anybody, for some particular person it could seem -- convey something false in some particular set of circumstances.  So let's try out falsity at the certification stage, too.  In fact, let's try out everything, because we could always think of a few examples where, despite the fact that, you know, that it's only a common issue 99 percent of the time, we can dream up a situation where it's not a common issue.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, but you are saying with a cert -- class certification here, if there is no materiality there is no class; and you are repeatedly faced with the question: You are absolutely right; in fact there is no case.  And so then what you say is, and indeed I have a few instances here in which there could be a case, and I would say I bet if we are, you know, professorial enough, we could dream up a hypothetical for anything, where there still is a case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Traditionally, how did that work?  How did that work traditionally?  No class, okay?  Joe -- Farmer Jones comes in, you have to show it's false?  You have to show it's material, and then you show the reliance that he did something on that basis--   Stephen G. Breyer  --So the materiality was not part of reliance.  Materiality was an element that was always proved, and then you went on to show reliance.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1085
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  This is true, but I'm -- I'm -- I'm trying to work out what, as I understand it now, Mr. Waxman's point is -- is basically this, that -- that why do we use an efficient market theory?  We use it because if the market is efficient and the statement is public, then someone who bought over the market is buying in a -- in a world that reflects the false statement.  I mean, that's -- so he -- there was sufficient reliance indirectly.  All right.  So I think his point is, yes, I can see materiality is something that's relevant to everybody.  Of course it is, a common issue in the case.  But also it is a feature of materiality that if it wasn't material, then our theory of market reliance -- market -- efficient markets goes out the window, because you can have all the efficiency in the world, all the publicity in the world, but still where something to a reasonable stockbroker is irrelevant, his reaction is “ who cares ”?  And therefore, although there could be special cases, the efficient market theory plays no role.  Now, I think that's what his theory is, if I understand it.  And -- and I don't hope it is if I've got it -- I mean, I hope I got it right.  But -- but if that -- so what's your direct answer to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So you're saying in this kind of case, the -- the materiality or not is not likely to be specially sufficient -- specially significant.  In fact, you are going to decide if it is a common issue, and there is no reason to import that common issue into the preliminary finding, even if what I just parroted, we hope is true.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  So if I've got this, your answer -- which I am trying to follow it; don't tell me I'm right if I'm not -- that with efficiency of the market, that's not a traditional element of a tort--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that is something special to get into this theory.   Stephen G. Breyer  The publicity of the matter, that is not traditionally a common element of the tort, that is something special to get into this theory.   Stephen G. Breyer  With materiality, it is a common element of the tort always; it is traditionally there; it will be litigated, so there is no special reason to or desirability in or need for litigating at the outset.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There are preconditions -- there are preconditions, not related to the merits, that do, in fact, justify the use of a special reliance theory.  Now I've said that; of course, so is materiality.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But materiality, unlike the other two, is part of the element of the basic case where it is a common issue in this case -- and in most -- to everybody.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what about the other?  The next line that they give is they give to the hospital authority the power to acquire and operate projects and the power to form and operate one or more networks of hospitals, physicians and other health care providers.  Now, as I read that, it certainly includes the rather specific power of acquiring a hospital.  And having read that -- not just something you might see in General Motors' charter.  And that's the language of the grant of power.  Now, I want to know what you want us to do, because in my mind, reading this, it's a statute that provides for regulation, price regulation of hospitals.  And you say -- and I have no doubt you thought of one way in which that could be; I can think of 100, that you could have prices that are different from those set by a free market.  So I have no doubt that this sets -- I start from.  Now, what is it -- I go back to Justice Scalia's original question.  What is it you want us to say?  Even though this -- this statute is immune, does grant immunity from attack on a basis of cost and price regulation, it is not immune in respect to mergers, okay?  I can, unfortunately, think of about 50 examples where a merger might be anticompetitive and yet it would lead to lower prices.  And the Department of Justice might attack it, but this statute, and that's what's bothering me, seems to want to further that kind of thing.  That's where I am, and I'm not at all decided.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, I think I know that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You are not understanding my question, I guess.  You have to take as a given that, even though what you say is true, I would find that this statute clearly prohibits the application of the antitrust laws to pricing decisions.  That's the job of the authority.  Now, if I start with that, then you will say, okay, I have to decide against you.  Or you might say, even so I win, because mergers are different.  Now, that's what I'm trying to get you to say.   Stephen G. Breyer  I want to ask you, why are they different?  After all, we have, one, the specific language I read; and, two, I can think of examples where a merger would be anticompetitive under the DOJ and your FTC rules--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and yet probably would further the purposes of the statute by lowering the cost.  Do you think that's the null set?  I don't think that's--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What does the words mean,  ""to form and operate one or more major networks of hospitals? ""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Which follow the words  ""to acquire and operate projects, defined to include hospitals? ""  So what about those words?  Why aren't they good enough?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm looking at Section 30 -- well, where are we?  31-7-75(3).   Stephen G. Breyer  And that falls within the words “ to acquire and operate projects ”.   Stephen G. Breyer  And can't -- in other words, the two hospitals in the town, when they say the price here, you shall see that the price is not higher than 38 cents, whatever, and would you please get together and be certain that you have similar terms and you have similar agreements and similar prices there, we don't want either of you to be higher, you would then proceed against them for that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And would you also do the same if the electricity regulator in any State or telephone, a local telephone regulator--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --or gas pipeline regulator -- what they did is the same thing; they said, our prices are -- you're to file tariffs and the tariffs are to be reached after you go meet in committee; and that would also fall within the antitrust laws?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How is that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the language is awfully similar to what you find in public utility statutes: To set reasonable rates, to be certain that nobody is higher than a reasonable rate.   Stephen G.

Do you know in fact where these hospital authorities got their hospitals from?   Stephen G.

And now they can acquire not just general.  I agree with you, it isn't just general.  They have a lot of power there to acquire other hospitals from outside the system; but, when they do that, there's no reason to think that that gives them the power to acquire it where it's anticompetitive.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The fact that you can regulate your own hospitals, which is one track and one group, doesn't say that you have to bring in anticompetitive people -- I mean, you have to bring in others where they're anticompetitive.  That -- that I think is his point.   Stephen G. Breyer  Don't think of it as one thing, think of it as two separate systems.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I know that.  But once you don't, once you don't, he says, you see, they don't regulate prices at non-authority hospitals, they don't do this for non-authority, they don't do that for non-authority, even though they might have the power to bring them in; but, when they have the power to bring them in, why read this -- it's at least ambiguous -- why read this as saying you can bring them in where it's anticompetitive to do so?   Stephen G. Breyer  And they -- they say on that, that it's a sham.  Well, just say 30 seconds on their argument that the FTC looked into it, these people had never regulated anything, they'd never looked at any price anywhere, they've never done a single thing, it's a sham; and therefore that's the end of it.  What about that?   ",11-1160
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, my problem with this is I don't -- I mean, I read the whole statute, and they have a good claim until I think you read the whole statute.  And I don't know what to say other than the impression -- the impression is that subsection 3, which is what's at issue, the whole thing is meant to say that the winner, when it's the plaintiff, is going to get attorney's fees.  You know, it mentions costs, but that's the background rule.  And then when you get to the second sentence of that, it means, and if you're in bad faith, the plaintiff, then the defendant gets attorney's fees.  It doesn't really mention costs.  That's the background rule.  So -- and I look at the legislative history, there's some staffer, at least, who's tried to find that interesting; the -- they're talking about what the point of this is, and say the whole point of this section is to help prevent frivolous suits.  Well, so there we are.  That's -- that's where I am at this moment.   Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't say on some technical linguistic basis, it may do that, that's correct.  But perhaps I'm unique in this, but I don't just look at the language, I look at the context, I look at the purpose, and -- and I don't see anything in the language that gets rid of the background rule, and I don't see anything in the purpose that gets rid of the background rule, and I don't see anything in the history that gets rid of the background rule.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't see anything in the consequences that suggests that you get rid of the background rule.  I don't see anything in our traditions that says you should get rid of the background rule.  So, what do you do with some obstreperous judge who doesn't just look at the language?  I mean, I know uses it, but that's not the only thing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, why?  A person who is a drafter says, you know, you get your costs and you also get the attorney's fees.  They don't -- they don't know every statute, the people who draft this.  They -- they -- they just say, Senator, what are we trying to do?  He says, we're trying to give them attorney's fees.  They say, okay, we'll give them the costs and the attorney's fees.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's if you had been drafting it, perhaps.  But the people who actually draft these things are a whole section over in Congress, they don't know every statute, and you give them a general instruction.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the -- the general instruction would be add attorney's fees on the plaintiffs, and add attorney -- all right.  You understand the point.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, ignorance of other laws.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's right, general ignorance.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then they shouldn't have put those words in.  We're talking about the next sentence, and the next sentence doesn't put the words in.  So you're -- you're -- you're assuming from that fact that in a pro defendant, this is a pro-defendant provision they put in, that was their whole point apparently reading it, that what they decided to do is take away from defendants costs which they normally get without saying anything about it.  I mean, that's -- you understand the problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't -- where does it say that?  Where was the--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I would like to read it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Did you look up -- did you try to do any sampling on that?  Because I did, actually, and -- and I discovered something that I think is not as strong for you, but it isn't too much against you.  We just did a random sample of 28 successful cases, and I think the average recovery, except for one outlier where it was very high, it was around $4,000, 3 to 4, and the average costs on the ones that the defendants won, I guess, was around a thousand.  So you have a point--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --But it isn't quite as good a point as you seem to suggest.  That is, it's a not so low value and the costs are not so high--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --in order to make it.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1175
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose you're right.  What about their policy argument here, that you're a -- you're a potential plaintiff, you've borrowed a lot of money, you don't have a lot of money.  And the deal is this under your interpretation; if you win you're going to get 2 or $3,000; if you lose it will cost you about a thousand.  That's -- that's under your interpretation.   Stephen G. Breyer  And under theirs, it's if you win, you get 2 or $3,000, and if you lose, at least you don't lose anything.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, it could be worse.   Stephen G. Breyer  What about the -- how does this work, the canon?  I'm very interested.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm very interested in canons, and I want to know on the canon, the traditional thing, which you've probably looked up, what about the specific governs the general?  Is it -- how is that, that's an old canon that's been around a long time, and people are aware of it, and--   Stephen G. Breyer  --This is -- seems to be the one they feel is very important.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I'm curious.  To go back a second, I thought Justice Sotomayor's question was, imagine Smith in Germany.  He has written a book.  It's there, already exists, but it has no copyright protection in the United States.  So after this, would he be more willing to send it to the United States?  And I take it your answer is no.  The reason is because I can go and buy a copy and sell it in the United States even without this law.  Is that right or wrong?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, isn't that the question?  The question is, now that Smith has the same protection in the United States that Germany gave him, doesn't that give him an incentive to send his book to the U.S.?  In thinking about that one, I thought: Not much, because I can go buy it today without this law and bring it to the United States and sell as many as I want.  Nonetheless--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That's not right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, don't just jump on my answer as being correct if it's not.  [Laughter]   ",11-1179
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  No, but in Eldred the main difference is that in Eldred, there was a law that might, at least in principle, have elicited a new book.  And in this case, by definition, there is no benefit given to anything at all that is not already created.   Stephen G. Breyer  So by -- How does it give any benefit to anything because it's already created.   Stephen G. Breyer  How does this provision do that?  I think maybe there are other provisions, but I thought this provision is talking solely about books, for example, that are already created.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is it not?  I may have been misreading, it but I certainly got that out of like 42 briefs and--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Oh, oh.  Okay.  Well, you know, as you also know from the 42 briefs, that there is a lot of argument that you could comply in other ways that are less restrictive; and whether that's true or not, is that -- there what you're saying is -- if I parody it, it's not a fair reading I'm going to give -- but what you're saying is we are, here have a law which says that libraries, music lovers, book buyers will either pay more money for things already in existence or will simply be unable to get them if they are orphans, on the one hand, so that other countries will impose similar kinds of restrictions upon their music lovers, music goers, libraries and -- so that they pay more for our works that are already in restrict -- that are already produced, or simply can't use them because they can't find who owns them.  Now that's in parody form, for succinctness.  What I think the argument is on the other side--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --And they will say, no copyright law -- with your exception of when the country was founded -- no copyright law has served that kind of purpose.  That's served often by tariffs--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --but not by copyright law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not necessarily.  There are three categories.  One is the category of the people who you couldn't, because of the country; that's Egypt, I think, and Russia.  Their second is the category of the people -- of sound recordings, and their third is category which is not the null set, of people who did not comply with certain registration requirements.  For example, I believe that the widow of Samuel -- Brittan failed to renew her copyright, and there are probably many that failed to renew the copyright after 28 years, and the reason that they didn't is because they didn't think there was much money in it, and those are the very works that the libraries want to get ahold of and put in their databases.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true, but for one text.  They say that text has to do with progress.  And when they read it historically in light of Macaulay, in light of the Statute of Anne, in light of going back to Venice and the copyrights, in light of going back to letters between Madison and Jefferson -- that term has always meant produce at least one new thing.  And here there is not one new thing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It couldn't have been that -- it must be somewhat overstated, mustn't it?  Because the only concern is not about protecting new works in the foreign countries -- the concern as I understand it was that we've had things in copyright for many years, and we want retroactive protection there.  The countries that didn't give it, like Japan, were not kicked out of the Berne Convention.  Rather, we pursued them in the WTO for many years, and I guess somebody might pursue us and then you get into an argument about whether there are other ways.  Now, is that strong enough to overcome what these briefs are full of?  I'll give you an example.  Save The Music is charged with looking for Jewish music in the periods '30s, '40s, and '50s.  Other organizations might find a treasure trove of literature that was -- that was copyrighted in Czechoslovakia or in Warsaw, and they want to put it on the web, and they want people to listen to it.  But they have no more idea of how to track down the person on that, and they aren't protected by any notice requirements because they aren't reliance parties.  We're told by Barbara Springer, former registrar, that there are millions of such instances where people would like to go back and would like to put music literature, film, et cetera, in a form that people can use it today and there is no way to do it without their becoming scofflaws, or without their having millions of dollars to hire infinite numbers of trackers and lawyers.  Now, that's the argument that's made on the other side, as the interest in communication that's important.  What do you say?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right here, we have the argument.  I agree with you that it is a general problem.  It may be diminished in the United States but it still exists.  And I guess the argument here is well, don't make it millions of times worse.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Barbara Springer said a million, numbers it in the millions.  Do you want to say that's--   ",11-1179

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why do you resist -- I'm just curious.  I -- I would have thought that to answer Justice Scalia you were going to say the answer is it isn't more accurate.  If you write a will and say I want these proceeds now to go to my second wife, that is a better expression of the person's intent.  But if you open that door, you'll get other wills that aren't quite so clear, and that's the problem that Congress faced.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  If he is right, if the only consideration that led Congress to make this absolute rule and so forth the underlying the previous holdings, if the only consideration were ease of administration by the Federal administrator, this statute wouldn't undermine it.  So -- so isn't that true?  I mean, the Federal administrator writes the check to the person that's on the list.  This is a matter after the check gets mailed, or this doesn't undermine it at all; there is no problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  And if that were the only consideration, administration, this doesn't interfere with Federal administration.  So in order to find something to -- to interfere with, we have to figure that they are trying to protect an interest like the following: The person is married twice.  He secretly wants to leave the insurance in the name of his first wife while pretending to the second wife it was just an oversight.  I mean, that's what we have to make up in order to--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Is there anything else?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, maybe we should say, look, this is a statute that is absolute.  There is no interest.  All this does is run around, without being too pejorative, it runs around the earlier cases, which is your basic point.  It's absolute.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1221
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But that's why I wonder what the basic underlying principle is.  I mean, I would have thought, but I'm not sure what you think, that -- that the way to look at these cases is, using ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, would a reasonable legislator, having enacted these words, intend to give the agency a degree of leeway in interpreting the statute?  Now, if that's the basic question, it helps but isn't determinative whether you classify this as a claims processing rule or a jurisdictional rule.  Those are conclusions.  But, really, it's the question of leeway that the Congress intended to -- to delegate to the agency that is determinative.  If the answer to that question is yes, your rule stands regardless of label, and if the answer to the question is no, it fails regardless of label.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but you have three -- the point that you make is right, that -- that you have specific language in the beneficiary part and not here; but, you have the other way, the point that Justice Ginsburg made, the fact that the language here is -- is -- doesn't say file within 180 days.  It says you may have a hearing if you file within 180 days.  It doesn't say what happens if you don't.  It's open, the language.  And the subject matter is not a court.  The subject matter is a rather technical agency review board.  And normally, I would think, you would think, and members of Congress would think that the agency knows best as to how to run its own operation and don't interfere too much in details, and this is a sort of detail.  So those are the things against you, it seems to me, though the thing you cite is certainly for you.   John F. Manning  Quite -- quite right, Your Honor.  And typically an agency has discretion to set its own procedures, as the Government argues.  And the Government is quite right to cite Vermont Yankee.  And I would add Chevron, that -- that the Government promulgated its regulation in a Chevron-eligible format.  But Chevron only applies if the statute is not clear, and here we say that Congress addressed the precise question in issue.  It's very difficult when one reads the beneficiary provisions and provider provisions, which are quite different.  One provides discretion, and one doesn't.  And what Respondents would have--   Stephen G. Breyer  One was passed long, long ago, and was part of the Social Security Act or something, the one you're talking about, and passed many years before the second one was passed.  And when they're sitting in Congress writing, you know, they don't know everything that was passed in history.   John F. Manning  --You're exactly right, Justice Breyer.  But Congress, in Section 2990 of the 1972 Act, that enacted -- that created the PRRB, amended and reenacted the provision from the 1965 legislation that prescribed the beneficiary review provisions.  It incorporated by reference provisions that gave the Secretary express discretion to extend those deadlines.  So in the same statute, what Congress did was it set up two systems, one for beneficiaries and one for providers.  One prescribed discretion, one didn't.  What the Respondents are asking this Court to do is to read these two sets of provisions, which are worded very differently, to mean the same thing, to mean that the Secretary has discretion whether Congress gives it or doesn't.  And I submit that that's a good reason to treat this as a step one case.  The Secretary does not merit deference in this case because the statute is clear.  And to return to Justice Sotomayor's question about the phrase -- and your question about the phraseology of subsection (a), this Court held in Bowles v. Russell that Section 2107 is jurisdiction notwithstanding that it--   ",11-1231
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Are there examples?  I mean, it seems to me that even if you lose this -- I mean, I mentioned the three arguments against you, the other -- the ambiguity of the language and so forth.  So if it ends up, even though it's not just a lawyer's argument, it isn't really that clear and they do have some authority, you then have the second string, which is you say their rule is unreasonable because it has an absolute 3-year cutoff instead of a little flexibility there for fraudulent concealment.  So do you have statutes, are there statutes that say 3, or are there cases that say 3 years is not enough, that you have to have more than 3 years?  I thought 3 years a pretty long time.  I mean, I guess they can't go back to fraudulent concealment pre-Civil War, you know.  I mean there's some period that must be reasonable to cut everything off and what is that period?  What do the cases say?  If it isn't 3 years, what is it?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's their view there, and their view here, which is a different kind of thing, is that 3 years is enough.  The question is, is that reasonable and do you have any authority that says it's unreasonable?   Stephen G. Breyer  So what about -- then let's get back to the question I really meant to ask before.  You know, assuming they have some authority here to write a rule, you want to say a 3-year absolute rule is not reasonable in this situation.  So what is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, you want to go back to the Civil War?  I mean, let's imagine you really have the strongest possible case.  All the records burned up, and it took 5 years for scientists to reproduce the records by putting charred pieces of paper together.  Okay?  So you couldn't possibly bring your claim until they finished.  That's a pretty equitable claim.  5 years okay?  10?  What is the -- 100?  I mean, what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What I hear you saying is go back to the Revolutionary War.  If it took 100 years to put the papers together, you're saying no time limit at all is -- is the only reasonable solution, because there are too many weird cases or unusual cases or misconduct cases.  You've got to have some exception in there forever.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that right?  If that is your position, I just want to know.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  And by the way, do we -- are you supposed to, in such circumstances, give the agency's own determination some weight?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  They'll come in and say, I don't care what the cause is, there isn't cause here because we weren't that awful.  And now, does the judge give them some weight?   ",11-1231

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Now, that's the question, because I certainly agree with Justice Scalia that this is not an SEC statute, this is not a securities statute; it is a statute that applies to all government actions, which is a huge category across the board and it's about 200 years old.  And until 2004 I haven't found a single case in which the government ever tried to assert the discovery rule where what they were seeking was a civil penalty, not to try to make themselves whole where they are a victim, with one exception, a case called Maillard in the 19th century where they did make that assertion.  They were struck down by the district court, and the attorney general in his opinion said: The district court's absolutely right; of course, the government cannot effectively abolish the statute of limitations where what they're trying to do is to gather something that's so close to a criminal case.  Okay.  So my question is: Is there any case at all until the year 2004, approximately, in which the government has either tried or certainly succeeded in taking this general statute and applying the discovery rule where they are not a victim, they are trying to enforce the law for the civil penalty?  The reason I brought up Social Security, Veteran's Affairs, Medicare, is it seems to me to have enormous consequences for the government suddenly to try to assert a quasi-criminal penalty and abolish the statute of limitations, I mean, in a vast set of cases.  And that -- you know, I have overstated that last remark a little bit, but I want you to see where I'm coming from, which isn't so different from the -- from the questions that have been put to you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All I'm asking you for is one case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, it is not a problem of fairly recent vintage.  I'd say for 200 years there is no case.  The only case, as far as I have been able to discover, which is why I am asking, is that what created the problem of recent vintage is that the Seventh Circuit, I guess, or a couple of other circuits decided that this discovery rule did apply to an effort by the government to assert a civil penalty.  That's what created the problem.  Before that there was no problem; it was clear the government couldn't do it.  All right.  Now, you will tell me that I'm wrong by citing some cases that show I'm wrong.  And that's what I'm asking.  I want to be told I'm wrong, sort of.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I haven't found one.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, we are asking the same question, but in 30 seconds I am going to conclude there is none.  What I want is a case before the year 2000 in which the government sought a civil penalty and was not trying to recover money or land that it had lost, and I want the name of that case in which they said that the discovery rule applies.  The two that you cited, Amy and the Case of Broderick's Will, did involve the government being injured by losing land or losing money, something like that.  So I have those and I don't think they count, but I will look at them again.  Is there anything else you would like to refer me to?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The reason would be that the -- you know, once you start talking about applying this to Social Security, for example, or to Medicare, for example, or to DOD, for example, you have somebody who did commit some fraud and they kept the money.  You know, she had five children not four, or she has five, not six.  And I can understand it being fair when the Government catches her, you know, 18 years later, they say, We want our money back.  Okay.  I say that's fair, not necessarily merciful but fair.  But then to go and say, and in addition we want this civil penalty, even though -- of course, we couldn't have discovered it.  Don't you know there are 4 million people who get Social Security or 40 million or something, and we can't police every one.  So suddenly, I see I am opening the door, not just to getting your money back but to also you're having what looked like criminal penalties years later without much benefit of a statute of limitations.  That is at the back of my mind.  And I'd like to know, having brought it up front, what your response is.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  This is not the securities context.  This is the context of -- that's why I started down the road I was down.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, because you have two people who are hurt, where two people have been hurt.  For example, I wrote the case in Burk and we had the statute of limitations and Congress focused on this.  And it wrote a two-tier statute.  And it wrote a two-tier statute in large part because it was concerned about the problem you mention.  You have a victim.  So you're either going to let the defendant keep the money or the victim gets it back.  I understand that.  But this is not that context.  This is like a criminal context where not only are you getting your money back, but you also want to assess a kind of criminal penalty, and in that situation, I see a pretty clear line and I don't understand why the Government is so anxious to change what has long been the apparent--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That's correct, you have a fraud and you can't put them in jail either, but you can get your money back.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, no, you can't--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, if all that's true, and this is a point I want you to -- I'm not sure I am right about this point, but remember your banking case now, we're sounding like that, I thought -- doesn't the doctrine of fraudulent concealment still apply?  That is, if the defendant, in fact, takes any affirmative action to hide what's going on, the statute will be tolled.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  As long as that's right, then in all your banking cases, there are bank inspectors all over these banks, I hope, you know, about once a month or so--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --or once a year.  And so the chance of there -- the chance of this somehow escaping notice without fraudulent concealment, which would allow the Government to extend the toll strikes me as small, but am I right?   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought it was the opposite.  In other words, I thought both parties, for purposes of this argument, are assuming fraudulent concealment has nothing to do with it.  We are not to consider fraudulent concealment.   Stephen G. Breyer  Am I right when I say that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's correct.   Stephen G. Breyer  I assume that we are on the same ground, but I don't know that you have -- I mean, I'm worried about your giving up the fraudulent concealment.  I mean, you wouldn't give up equitable estoppel, would you?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no.  I mean -- I mean, there's nothing--  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  If we were to say -- if we -- if the Court were to hold, it seemed to me, and this is again tentative to get your response, but if the -- if the Court were to hold the discovery doesn't -- rule doesn't apply, there's nothing in that that says equitable -- equitable tolling doesn't apply, nothing in that that says equitable estoppel doesn't apply, nothing in that that says fraudulent concealment doesn't apply.  Now, you've shaken me a little bit on the fraudulent concealment, but I don't know about the other two.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, not the equitable estoppel.   Stephen G. Breyer  Equitable estoppel, the person comes in and says: Oh, yes, I'll tell you all about what I did, but by the way, I won't assert a statute of limitations defense, I promise.  And the Court says: Hey, you just asserted one, you can't.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1274

So I am left with $50,000 net, because I had to pay my lawyers, I had to pay expert witnesses.  There were a lot of different things I had to pay.  I'm left with $50,000 now.  So in comes the plan and says, we want 100,000.  I say, what?  Then I look at the language.  The language allows them to get back expenses which were recovered from the third-party.  I didn't recover 100,000 from the third-party.  I recovered 50,000 from the third-party, because it cost me 50 to get the 100.

And so you'd say -- if it says you can recover anything, that “ any expense ”, it means, yes, you can recover that which was paid, but not money that you had to pay to get the amount paid.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But this is a plan that they wrote and that US Air--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  So I can--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What is the issue of law?  The issue of law is what happens if we have a plan which says Joe Smith, my employee, if you have to spend $90,000 to get back 92,000, you have to give us back all 92, even though you only have 2 in pocket.  And we are supposed to assume that's what the contract said.  Is that right?  And then -- and then we say, now, can you override that with the principle of equity; is that the issue you see before us?   Stephen G. Breyer  But that's my exact question.  I think now what we're being asked to decide is, from your point of view, does the common fund doctrine apply?  I take it, the common fund doctrine says, if this victim here got some money back from the person who caused the accident, that that money goes into a common fund in the sense that those who share in the fund must share as well in the cost of producing the fund.  So if it costs $50,000 to produce $100,000, which is in the fund, that we have to have US Air as well pay part of the cost of producing the fund.  That sounds very fair.  But I hear the argument, fair though it is, we have here an agreement, and in this agreement it says, it's as if it said, and you shall not apply the common fund doctrine or any other equitable doctrine such as he who seeks equity must do equity, etc.  And I think that's the question that's being asked.  And so what is your response to that?  In particular, why do you say the common fund doctrine applies, though the contract says it doesn't, we assume, but all these other equitable doctrines don't apply?   Stephen G. Breyer  Good.  So now we have 18th century authority which says that in the 18th century, Lord Cooke or someone said that the common fund doctrine applies, but the other doctrines don't.  And the -- and the name and citation to that authority is?   ",11-1285
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why -- why is it so unfair?  I've been putting it in a way that looks unfair, which favors your side.  But US Air or the equivalent says, now, here is the deal, we'll pay your medical expenses.  And now, if somebody causes those expenses, you come to us, and we decide whether we want to sue and get our expenses back, and any extra money we give to you, and we pay our attorneys' fees extra.  They don't count against the fund.  And if our lawyers tell us it isn't worth it, you're free to sue; but, I'll tell you what, your lawyer is going to be at the end of the queue.  We're first, then comes your lawyer, and anything left over goes to you.  Now, if you can find a lawyer that takes it on those conditions, good for you.  But he might, because he might think he's going to get -- but our lawyers have already told us it's not going to work, so that's the situation.  Now, what's -- I'm not -- I think US Air's point would be, well, what's unfair about that?  That's -- that makes sure we get our money back.  That's what we want to do.  And you're free to sue; it's just your lawyer who's going to come at the end of the queue, okay?  What's -- why is that unfair?   Stephen G. Breyer  Enter best case.  What is your best case?  I'd love to find it.  There's a case that says something like this.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well -- well, let me tell you what I'm thinking of.  The -- there is a contract all written down.  They forgot to put a seal on it.  They forgot to put a seal on it, so I guess it's now 1463 or some year like that.  So they go into equity.  And now, they are in equity.  And the plaintiff says, judge, I want you to enforce this contract.  He says, I'm a judge in equity.  He says, I know, but we've agreed, and you enforce it in equity.  The contract says give Smith all the wheat, and equity says, you know, there are other people who would like some of this wheat, too, so we are not going to follow the contract.  We are going to modify the contract according to equitable principles, which, as you say, they can do.  And the other side says, no, they wouldn't.  They'd follow the contract.  They are just in equity because they forgot the seal.  Okay.  What is your best case to show they did, indeed, modify it with the Common Fund Doctrine or some other doctrine?  I want to be sure to read it with a magnifying glass.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know, but I didn't ask you about what they found.  I was asking what you found.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1285
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I see the problem, but I am still back to where Justice Kennedy was, and that is my own failure.  I didn't quite understand.  I thought when you grant a dismissal, and you dismiss the case in the middle of the trial because the prosecution was brought too late.  All you're doing is, in the middle of the trial, granting something that you should have granted in the first place before you impaneled the jury.  But I thought in Fong Foo, Judge Wyzanski had dismissed the case after empanelment because he wrongly thought that the U.S. attorney had been talking to a witness or a juror or something at lunch time.  And that he had -- and that's an acquittal.  And I thought Justice Harlan for the Court wrote double jeopardy.  Jeopardy attached, you can't try him again.  And I didn't think the Court ever overruled that.  That -- what--   Stephen G. Breyer  --So Scott says that even in judge -- Scott says Fong Foo was wrong, that that -- because the reason that Charlie Wyzanski dismissed it is he has this idea of a -- the AUSA doing something improper at lunch.  And -- and that's -- that's -- now on your theory, on the theory you just enunciated, there would -- there would -- double jeopardy wouldn't protect against the second indictment, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's--   ",11-1327
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Now -- now, I take it you -- you -- you agree that sometimes the prosecution -- I'm not saying anyone would -- but they -- the defendant's acquitted by the jury so -- because he doesn't find -- they don't find enough evidence and so the prosecutor thinks,  ""I think I'd like to try him again. ""  and then he's acquitted again.  ""I'd like to try him again. ""  and he's acquitted again.  Now, substitute judge for jury, the same thing could happen.  I mean, I don't see why not.  And there's no answer to that, is there?  And if there's no answer to that, the same bad thing could happen.  Well, then you're going to have to start distinguishing among which judge or jury acquittals do or do not invoke the problem of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  And where I'm driving is that -- that there is a principle and the principle was -- seems the simplest way to put it is where in fact the acquittal rests upon a judgment that there isn't enough evidence, that's it, that's what we're after.  And where it's some procedural thing or not, maybe we aren't.  Okay.  Now, the virtue of that is it's simple, it's consistent with the cases, it's been clear.  And you're advocating let's go into that and change it or at least interpret the cases that's consistent with it.  And we're saying there wasn't enough evidence is because the judge had in mind a legal point that he was wrong about, then Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't work.  But if the judge was right, it does work.  Well, except for the matter of substantive evidence.  Now, that waste is your opponent lies a mess.  I just went through that long thing, because I don't want you to get -- sit down without addressing what I see as a central problem, namely, if we don't accept his view, it's going to be a terrible mess.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you're beginning to make distinctions.   Stephen G. Breyer  And once you make those distinctions, I go back to the question I asked, which was there is a distinction.  The distinction is whether it's a procedural ground or -- and Justice Harlan's -- it's whether there was --  ""Just talk to the U.S. attorney, I didn't like it. ""  or “ Talk to the witness ” or “ The prosecution brought too late ”.  The other side of it where the clause attaches is where it was done on a substantive basis, not enough evidence.  I said -- I don't want to repeat myself, but I'm saying what he's coming up with is a simple, clear rule basically consistent with the cases and why shouldn't we follow it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Let's go through this.  My basic question: Normally, a judge will wait till the jury comes in and then decide, if the jury convicts him, whether to set it aside.  So there's no problem.  So now we have the judge -- for one reason or other, this judge has decided to grant the motion of acquittal in the middle of the case.  Now, this is unusual, I think -- I hope.  And if so, though, the judge might not think of writing down his reasons.  So he might just say there isn't enough evidence.  And now it happens that, just before he did that, the defense lawyer argued to him an erroneous theory.  All right.  An added element or something or other.  Some kind of misconstruction of this.  What happens then?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  But this a judge, after all, who for some reason -- we don't know what -- decided instead of waiting, as they normally would do, grant it in the middle of the case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I think there are a lot more places--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --They do.  They--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --And then this is a--   Stephen G. Breyer  --This has arisen a lot more than -- than I think.  All right.  Fine.  Thank you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And in that case, do they have to write it down?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So then, in other words, when an acquittal--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Do you have any -- your -- your idea of what the empirical situation is in the last 30 or 40 years?  Have most U.S. prosecutors or prosecutors in these states thought that they could appeal an acquittal in the middle of the trial on the ground that the judge made a mistake of law?   INTERRUPTING ",11-1327
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What would -- what do you do, if anything, about those of us, I hope more than one, who actually look at legislative history and the House and Senate Report, the Senate Report says subsection (e) would nullify a provision of the Tort Claims Act which would otherwise exclude any action for assault and battery.  Then the House says about the same thing.  So when I look at those two things, I think the purpose of this Act was to do just exactly what the other side says: It was to get rid of assault and battery as an exception and said the government of the United States will pay for unlawful assault and battery.  That's what the two reports say.  That's why they passed it.   ",11-1351
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  And you're -- you're -- I'm picking up from -- I find Justice Scalia's hypothetical interpretations of legislative history very useful.  So the -- the--  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  The -- the thing where we are in this -- we have a -- we have a statute, 1089 basically, and it says you can sue the government for the tort of an employee.  I'm oversimplifying, I'm oversimplifying.  And we should interpret that narrowly, okay?  We should interpret that absolutely has to be definite, and it is pretty definite.  Now what we have is an exception to that.  And the exception is an exception for battery, but not battery.  Can't sue the United States for battery.  And we're supposed to interpret that, I guess, as broadly as possible.  If you have a plausible argument that it could be broader, you get it, as long as it's plausible.  Then what we have, because after all, after these two things, you can still sue the person who hit you over the head.  You can go sue him in a State court, can't you?  Now, oh, now we bring a new Act there.  And this new Act says, We are going to have a little exception to the exception.  Right?  And we are supposed to interpret that one, I guess, as narrowly as possible.  So now, what we are -- because that's an exception to something which should be interpreted as broadly as possible which is an exception to something that should be interpreted as narrowly as possible.  So I think I get it like Costello used to, I don't know what I'm talking about.  [Laughter]  There are a lot of words in these things.  And -- and so given all these words and -- this is where the Chief Justice started -- I mean, can't we at least look at legislative history to try to figure out what Congress was doing by the time we get to the exception to the exception to the exception?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then you win as long as I find it confusing.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I don't find it all that confusing.  What it says is that this battery exception, which is in (h), is not supposed to apply when we look at the military doctors.  That's what it says.  And you say, Ah, but it says for purposes of this section.  Okay.  I look at for purposes of this section and the purposes of this section, the very first whole sentence has to do with 1089.  It has to do with the scope, it has to do with the general waiver.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  Why would they have wanted to do that?  That is to say, Look, if you cut the exception to the exception to the exception, the presumption, da, da, da, out of it, what we've got on your interpretation is that a person who's hurt by a battery committed by a government official, given your interpretation, has no remedy at all.  I mean, previously he could have at least sued in state court.  Now what you're saying is Congress tried to do with this language is say, Hey, you can't sue in state court, and by the way, when you try to sue the Federal Government, we are not going to give you your suit, either.  Why do that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Would you -- are you finished there?   Stephen G. Breyer  Would you go back for a minute and think before this Act was passed, the Gonzalez Act, and think of the millions of government employees, and they're in different parts of the country, and some of them commit batteries.  Now, you told me before that where an injured person, a plaintiff, sues a government employee and they sue under State tort law and they say, this government employee committed a battery, okay, in the course of duty, you say there was an immunity there.  Where did the immunity come from?   Stephen G. Breyer  From what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, what was the theory of it?  I mean, here it's just -- it's a person, he's at work, he does happen to work for the Federal government instead of working for someone else--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and everybody else, you have to respond, and if liable, you'd have to pay damages for the battery.  Where did the immunity come from--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --if the employee did it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   ",11-1351
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Even without Chevron -- I mean, even apply it; I would have thought the point of Brand X is you look at the language of the statute and you look at what Congress intended, and where they intended the agency to have power to interpret, you follow the agency.  And you could do that after the event if the basis for your decision is that it isn't clear.  But that isn't Harlan's opinion at all.  He goes and looks at what Congress meant, and what they meant is treat basis like you treat a deduction; and he gathers that from the legislative history.  And so I don't see the basis for saying now the agency still has power.  Now, forget that one.  I mean, that's one point you might want to address, but I may be too unique in that, in which case it's not worth your time.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, well, I didn't think that was the basis.  I thought the basis is that there are two kinds of things: One is you just don't put in some big category of stuff in your return, and the agency can never figure that one out.  And the other is where you don't state your deductions correctly.  And now, the cost of goods sold and the basis are difficult cases because of the way the -- the code defined ""gross income"".  It defines it in terms of gain.  But Harlan says they are like deductions for purposes of this statute.  That's how I read it.  But I have a different question.  You can pursue this one if you want.  What's really bothering me about this case, and I can't quite figure out the answer to this, is it seems to me when they filed that tax return in April of 2000 it was a terrible loophole, but these lawyers have the job of creating loopholes or at least trying to take advantage of them, okay?  And the IRS had told them this was okay.  Indeed, they had informal advice to that effect.  Now there's a -- you don't put the date of the year 2000 reg and I don't know if you are both talking about the same thing.  I was really surprised there was no date there.  Then what happens is after you lose in every circuit -- not you personally -- they lose in every circuit; and then in the year 2009 they say: Though we lost and though we told everybody this is okay at the time they filed the return, now we are going to pass a new reg and we are going to penalize them, taking all back this money 9 years later.  That seems to me pretty unfair.  So I would like to know just that answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  You say in your brief on page 4:  ""In 2000 the IRS issued a notice informing taxpayers that Son of BOSS transactions were invalid under the tax law. ""  And you cite without a date.  So I was sort of curious whether that particular cite came before or after they filed their return.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And they say that -- and I -- in July 2000, 3 months after they were filed, the Commissioner reiterated his view:  ""It has long been held that the extended statute of limitations. ""  da, da, da,  ""is limited to when specific receipts or accruals are left out of the. ""  --""of gross income"", which is basically the Colony statement.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Are you talking about the same thing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So there are two different documents.  So -- so in July, they are telling the tax bar this is okay.  And what you say is this document here, which you refer to without a date, told them it wasn't okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'd be rather curious if you could sort that out.   Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I know there are many ways of downplaying that.  But I am just curious as to what happened.  What about the one you cited?  When was that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about the -- that's the July.  What about this other, undated one.  Now, I notice what you say about it.  You say that it  ""described arrangements that unlawfully purport to give them. ""  --If I read that piece of paper, which I might -- you probably read it because you cite it -- will I come away with the impression, had, uh-oh, these loophole arrangements, Son of BOSS, which previously seemed to be okay are now not okay?  Is that the impression I'll have?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that the impression you had?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, all right.  That's what I suspect.  Then look at the unfairness of this.  I'm not saying there aren't worse unfairnesses in the world, but nonetheless people spent a lot of money, the whole Bar has gone to an enormous effort.  Everything up through 2000 seems to say you can do this.  You have a case on point in the Supreme Court.  And then 9 years later, after continuous litigation, the IRS promulgates a regulation which tries to reach back and capture people who filed their return 9 years before.   ",11-139X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I agree with you on that.  And I agree with Justice Scalia, actually.  There are many different kinds of ambiguity and the question is, is this of the kind where the agency later would come and use its expertise.  And you are saying here it was up to the Congress and looking at what they had in mind.  All right, maybe that's the base, best ground.  But suppose it turns out the majority think you are not right on that, okay.  Now, here's my question.  Assuming you are wrong on that, which I'm not sure you are, but assuming you are wrong, now we get to this regulation.  Here is my problem: One -- I have no doubt at some level it seems rather unfair, but that instinct is not enough.  The question is what -- what's the law?  A, you can say the word ""open"" doesn't include this case.  But we run into the problem that an agency has great authority to construe its own regulation.  B, you could say that, well, there's this statute out there that says don't apply it, and there are two routes there.  One is something to do with language, which I think you can think of, which seems to cut very much against you if read naturally, but you can strain it to read it in your favor.  And the other has to do with a parenthetical where, once again, although they left it out of their brief and they put in ellipses, I can see why they left it out because when you read it it's again ambiguous.  We run into the same problem.  Then you could say: Well, they are not supposed to do these things retroactively, either on common law administrative law grounds or something like that; they shouldn't do it; it's unfair.  And they'll say: But you see, it wasn't that unfair; a child of 2 would have known this was a loophole.  That's how they would have characterized it.  And the IRS never said anything, except for one district director in a different district that really encouraged or underwrote this kind of thing.  So it's not nearly as unfair as you think.  If you live by loopholes, you will die by regulation.  You know, something like that.  So looking at those four possible grounds -- and I can't think of a fifth -- you take your choice.  Which is the strongest, and how do you reply to the objection?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  ""Open"", that's the term.   ",11-139X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So why can't you do that?  I mean, the only virtue I see in saying you have to go get a warrant is the officer picks up the phone, there is usually somebody on duty, a magistrate somewhere, he phones him up and says: I have a drunk driver here; he's wobbling, he can't cross the center line; and he won't take a breathalyzer; I want to give him a test.  Now, you have a second judgment and the officer has to talk to somebody, so he's a little more careful.  And that's a protection, not necessarily for this person, but a protection for others who maybe weren't wobbling.  All right.  So I think that's the question you're being asked.  Why -- what's the problem with doing that?  Which adds a little bit of security that this warrant really is -- this search is really necessary.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why wouldn't it take -- let's see, how long did it take me to say that?  It took me about 30 seconds.  So -- so even if you are a lot more careful, why would it take more than, say, 3 minutes?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what you do is you have a system, and you phone up and you do just what I said.  And this man or woman who is there is not a policeman.  The virtue of it is this man or woman is trained to listen to policemen and others say things and try to pin him down a little bit and make an independent judgment.  So -- so why would it take more than 5 minutes?   INTERRUPTING ",11-1425
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I thought the question was if -- if in fact the person won't agree to a breathalyzer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Was your client was offered the breathalyzer twice?   Stephen G. Breyer  How many times?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, aside from all -- the thing, what it boils down to, at least in my mind, is, is yes, of course it would be better to -- to have a neutral person hear what the policeman has to say and to act as a second judgment on that; it would make it less likely that people who are really innocent in fact have this happen to them and so forth.  But they're arguing that that's a -- that's a considerable burden in many, but not all States.  And at some point -- and the addition in respect to the second judgment, namely the magistrates that you get, is not worth really what you're going to lose, which are going to be people who are drunk driving around on roads and -- and possibly killing people.  We all know how that side can be built up, too.   Stephen G. Breyer  So at some point, I would wish you would spend some time addressing that, that practical argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  A lot of States have varying degrees to which they want to enforce strict rules against drunk driving.  And a State -- that's exactly the kind of thing that worries me on your side.  The -- you have a bunch of States that don't -- you know, it's not easy to get hold of a magistrate in 15 minutes or so forth.  And so what to do about that?  If you say, well, you don't have to because you haven't got it provided, you give them every incentive not to make the magistrate available.  That's cutting in your favor.  On the other hand, it's pretty tough to say that all these States have to have the best possible magistrate available 24 hours a day so somebody can call in ten instances a year because the guy won't take the blood test -- won't take the breathalyzer.  That's where I am in a dilemma.  So I'm looking for an answer to that.  And you don't have an absolute rule or I don't see an absolute rule.  Should you say, look, here's what you have to do, it's better to have a second opinion there, which is the magistrate's?  And so on the way to the hospital, it's just that's where we started, you have to phone and try to get one, and if you don't have one by the time you're at the hospital, tell them again: It's your last chance, give us the breathalyzer or else.  And if he says no, then you take the blood test.  Well, that's a solution, or do you have a better solution?  What's the solution to the problem if you are willing to reject, which you aren't, but hypothetically you might be, that there's the absolute rule.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  My question is what you don't want to do and you don't have to, but if you think of a second-best solution it might always be better than what I think of as a second-best solution.   Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I want to know if you want to say anything that would suggest -- we have a number of them floating around -- and I just wonder if you want to express any view on a second-best solution.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I am probably just -- but a policeman has probable cause to believe that somebody inside the house has drugs.  He hears the toilet flushing and he thinks they're flushing the drugs down the drain.   Stephen G. Breyer  He doesn't have to get a warrant as long as he reasonably believes that the evidence is disappearing.  All right.  Now, the difference between your case here and that is specifically what?  Suppose we were just to refer to those cases--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and say it's the same thing.   ",11-1425
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So what I think might be driving some of these questions is the district court says, just as you say, had Koontz offered additional mitigation, the additional, that would have cost $10,000, he would have gotten the permit.  That's what he said.  So then you look back to see what additional mitigation.  And here we have in the record, at least that my law clerk finds, he noted that they went to Koontz and they said, here are some choices: Install a subsurface stormwater management system in the development, I mean right on your land; or reduce the size to 1 acre; or eliminate the filling of the slide slope areas; or replace 15 culverts and eliminate a ditch system somewhere else; or enhance 50 acres somewhere else.  Now, at that point -- and then they said, won't you negotiate for 30 more days, maybe we can find some other things?  He says, no, I'll bring a lawsuit.  Okay.  Now, I absolutely can see a Penn Central claim there.  But the land -- what you're talking about is not some land somewhere off the site.  We're talking about his land.  If after all they said you have to leave all the coal in the mine to hold up the ceiling -- you know what I'm referring to?  Then they go too far.  And here, if we look at all these conditions proposed and said -- you know, this is just terrible, they don't do it for anybody else, your client's the only one, it bears no relation, oh, it just goes too far, you win under Penn Central.  So I can see the framework here.  I'm not saying you're going to win, but I got it clear what the framework is.  But suddenly you bring this Nollan-Dolan business into it and I get confused.  And the reason is because there was a different piece of land in Nollan and Dolan.  The piece of land that was different was an easement in front of -- and an easement is a piece of property in Nollan, and there was a bike path in Dolan, right across his property.  So I don't see how Nollan and Dolan have to do with this.  I see everything that Penn Central has to do with it, and that grows out of the nature of what was being offered.  You were saying what they are offering you is simply going too far.  I've got that conceptually.  I ask this question because all these briefs are about Nollan and Dolan, and I don't understand what they have to do with it.  I must be missing something, and that's why I am asking you.   Stephen G. Breyer  But of course, they are land claims because they took a piece of land which everybody assumes -- right in front of his house -- and said you've got to let everybody from the beaches walk back and forth from one beach in the north to another one in the south.  And they are going to walk over your land.  And the Court said you can't take his land unless you have a nexus to some public purpose that is related to his building the house.  I got it.  I just don't see what it has to do with this case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Of course you can.  You backed out too much coal.  That's an unconstitutional condition.  It goes too far, and there is a framework called Penn Central which deals with it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But it's the same question.  I just want an answer to my question.  And for the purposes of this question, I am assuming enormously in your favor.  I am assuming that this set of conditions is the worst thing since sliced bread.  [Laughter]  I think there -- all right, I'm assuming that in your favor.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, it's been proved bad.  [Laughter]  But -- but in any case, the -- the -- the point is, you see, I assume that in your favor.  I'm trying to figure out the conceptual framework.  I assume that in your favor.  I assume whether they didn't issue the permit and would have, but they haven't quite or maybe they have, it means nothing.  Now, having assumed that, it seems to me what your argument is, is that this is a form of regulatory taking of the kind that Holmes was talking about, and that -- that's what was going on in Penn Central, and so we simply look to see if it went too far or whatever.  The lower courts could do that.  I got that part.  Now I want you to answer the question, which is, am I right?  Is there another part, a different part to this case called the Nollan, Dolan part and explain that to me.  That's why I asked the question.  I want to hear what you're going to say.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1447
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So that -- am I wrong about -- I might have this -- I thought the framework roughly is the following: It is not the case that Penn Central applies only where there is a physical invasion of property, or there is total destruction of the value of the property.  In those two situations, what we said in Lucas is it applies without case-specific inquiry, but there are another set of cases where Penn Central and McMahon apply with case-specific inquiry.  And those to discover whether you have one, you look into such things as whether the regulation destroys investment-backed expectations, and then you look to the nature of the government interest and the relationships, et cetera.  That's what I thought the framework was.  Now, if that's the framework, then when the government says, I will let you develop your land if and only if you give $50,000 to the Shriners hospital, you would say, I can't develop my land.  And besides, that significantly interferes with my investment-backed expectations.  And besides, there is no relation whatsoever.  Therefore, I win under the Takings Clause.  Now, I spell all that out, because if I'm wrong about that framework -- if I am right about the framework, that could apply to this case.  If I am wrong about the framework, I want to know where in the cases I'm wrong.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So if I'm right about the framework, that takes care of all the hypotheticals you were asked.  In those cases, there is a significant interference with investment-backed expectation, and there's no justification whatsoever, so the Takings Clause applies.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  Why isn't the answer yes, it is applicable?  Of course it's applicable.  I own a piece of land and they have significantly interfered with my investment-backed expectation.   Stephen G. Breyer  And to say that I can't put a house on this because I'm supposed to pay for a football field, which has nothing to do with it, is as close to insisting that you have to have 4,000 columns of coal in your mine so that you can never use it as I can think of.  It's Holmes brought up to date.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  At least that argument would be made--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --And why wouldn't it be a winning argument?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I agree with you--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What he's going to say in part is, I guess, I did a little numbers from your brief, the 37 million acres in Florida, say about 4 million are bodies of water, and say a third of them are built up, and we have 11 million that are wetland and 11 million that aren't.  That's crude.  So they're saying why in heaven's name are we supposed to -- everybody wants to build, and why should the people that happen to live in wetland have to pay for all the other wetland?  That's just coincidence.  So he is going to say that that is like the Shriners Hospital.  You are going to say, No, it isn't like the Shriners Hospital.  Now, all I'm saying is, isn't it at least an issue under the takings clause whether it is or isn't?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know you'll say that.  He will say that it is.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1447
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  This is what I -- could you go back--   Stephen G. Breyer  --to Justice Kagan's first question?  I was looking at the words of the statute.  And if I look at 1332, which has been on the books a long time, it says:  ""The district court shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest, of costs, and. ""  --et cetera, okay?  Then I look here and it says:  ""The district court shall have jurisdiction of any civil action in which the manner in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $5 million, exclusive of interest and costs. ""  et cetera, okay?  So the words seem identical.  Now, in respect to the first, we know that a lawyer can file a binding stipulation that says, I don't care what this is about, I am not asking for more than $75,000, and the Federal court does not have jurisdiction.  Given that's true in the first statute, and given that the second statute is almost identically worded, at least in that part, why can't you do the same thing with the $5 million?  And it can't be the words I quoted that stops him from doing it, so what is the word that stops him from doing it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  As to what that looks like, “ shall be aggregated ”, again from the language, is it simply to make certain that Zahn does not require the individual thing to approach -- to count.  In other words, you aggregate rather than just looking at the individual members, which is Zahn, which has nothing to do with the issue before us.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, they rarely pass a statute that says: Let's just get rid of case X.  Normally they look to the holding of case X, and then they pass the statute that says the opposite.  So the holding of Zahn was that you could not aggregate the individual members' claims in a class.  So to get rid of Zahn, what we do is we pass a statute that says you can aggregate.  And indeed, nobody objects here to the aggregation.  It's the total amount of the claims being limited by a stipulation that is the issue here, and that's why I had trouble finding your argument in the word “ aggregation ”.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1450
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's the same question.   Stephen G. Breyer  If so, this is just a loophole because it swallows up all of Congress's statute, which is what their problem is, all you have to do, even if you were less obvious than the Chief Justice's example, what you do is you -- you file a complaint, you say it's for $4,900,000; in fact, it's worth 10 million.  But you inform people, unlike Justice Alito, you figure a way around his problem, you keep them informed, and you say: It's getting close, getting close.  And once you are up to $4,800,000, the others get the word: Stay out of it.  And once they stay out of it, you go ahead with your action and then those that stayed out of it becomes the subject of a second action.  And if it's for 50 millions, then you have ten actions and then you have 20.  So, in fact, all that is required is a few extra pieces of paper that will soon become standardized, and a lot of postage stamps.  And we have 30 or 40 or $50 million cases being tried in whatever counties Congress liked the least.  I gather they're some in Arkansas.  But that seems to be all behind Justice Scalia's and the Chief Justice's questions, and I would like to hear a pretty complete answer on that.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what you said then in response -- we're on the same subject, and I'm drawing the conclusion from what you say that yes, we've found a way around this.  And what we're going to do is we will divide our $25 million class action into six subsidiary actions and proceed exactly the same merry way.  And we do that by means of stipulation.  Now, your words in the statute do favor that, in my opinion, at the moment.  But the purpose seems to strongly cut the other way.  And I do see a way to go the other way, in that you could say, given the purpose of this, the words do mean something different, and they do mean you should aggregate the real value of the real amounts that the class is likely to have.  Now, it's capable of that reading, and the virtue of that reading is that it would stop what looks like, from what you're saying, a mechanical method of avoiding the purpose of the statute.  I say that explicitly because I really want to make it as much as possible that you will focus in on what's a response to that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about -- what about, has anyone thought of this -- I hate to bring up sort of a new idea, but somebody may have thought of it.  Imagine we're now in the Federal district court.  And the Federal district court reads the statute because the case has just been removed.  And he says, you know, this -- this case would be worth a lot more than 5 million were it not for that stipulation.  And let now me look at that stipulation.  That stipulation is a part of some, let's call it quote “ monkey business ”, end quote, which you will resist that, but I mean by that to -- to encompass the kinds of things we've been talking about, that there are going to be five similar class actions, that they're going to take the people A through K, that they're going to -- anything like that.  And he says that's not under this statute the kind of stipulation that Congress meant to bar my consideration of the $5 million.  So if it's a manipulative stipulation, whatever that might be, it doesn't bar me as the district judge from aggregating up to -- beyond 5 million, but if it's not manipulative, fine.  Has there -- has there been any thought on that kind of--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, but there might be -- there might be ways of working with this notion, a little risky from your point of view, but there might be ways of working with this good faith notion so that some -- there would be some power in the Federal district court to set aside certain stipulations which were used for manipulative purposes and what definition that manipulative is something that isn't clear to -- to me at the moment.   ",11-1450
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Could -- could you go back, please, to Justice Alito's question?  I -- I don't understand the answer to that.  That is, I don't understand, and it's just something I don't understand.  I'm not saying it facetiously.  I don't understand the relationship of mental state to the issue.  I mean, I didn't think there is any doubt here that the individual, your client, knew what he was doing.  He knew for a fact that he was taking money from the trust.  He knew he was giving it to his mother.  And he knows where it's going.  And he knows it was later paid back with 6 percent interest.  So you don't have to assume extreme recklessness.  He knew it.  Now, what he didn't know was that that was unlawful.  And therefore, if I look at the accompanying things -- embezzlement, larceny, fraud in the trust -- I don't think any of them require a knowledge that what you're doing is unlawful.  So if I -- or do they?  I don't think -- you can be convicted of embezzlement while misunderstanding the law of embezzlement.  You can be convicted of larceny, it's saying.  And as far as I know, a person to commit fraud lies, knows it's material, knows, et cetera, but he doesn't have to know there's a law against it.  And -- and so -- if I do what Justice Harlan was doing and comparing it to the other three, it looks as if you don't need to know that what you're doing is against the law, where you commit defalcation.  Now, that I think is what Justice Alito was driving at.  And I'd like to hear an absolutely clear answer on that.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I didn't think there's any respect here in which missing, mistake of law, would negate the mental state as to having taken money from the trust, used it in the family business and then paid it back, which I take it are -- we assume, which is a different question I have -- but for present purposes, we are assuming that that's sufficient for defalcation.  Is that right?  Where is it -- and where does it negative the intent in respect to what happened?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, it had nothing to do with recklessness.  He did these three things knowingly.  That is a stronger mental state than recklessness, not a weaker one.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Were unlawful.  So we're back at the same question, and I'm now assuming you have no answer to the question because there is none.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but you see -- should I have to write the opinion in this case, I would have to deal with this issue, and I'd have to say something about it.  And as soon as I look at the other words, those are words like “ embezzlement ”, “ larceny ” and “ fraud ”.  Now, elsewhere in the U.S. Code where those are crimes ignorance of the law is not an excuse.  It often is an excuse where in fact it's a tax violation or some other technical violation.  So I would have to explain why the word “ defalcation ” when linked to those three is being treated differently.  Or I'd have to say Congress used words which never have ignorance of the law as an excuse and meant them differently.  Each of those is pretty hard to say.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I have one other question on a different subject that may be more helpful to you or not.  I think of defalcation as the individual who has defalcated shows up in Rio with two suitcases full of money, and it seems to me if you look at the root of the word, it consists of deminishing, taking a sickle and cutting something down, and therefore it did seem to refer to an instance where you take the corpus or money belonging to the trust -- now it becomes ambiguous -- and you run off with it.  Is there anything you would like to say about that?   ",11-1518
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Wait, wait.  You say -- you mean either, both?  I mean, there is no doubt here, I agree with you, as far as the act is concerned.  It wasn't just reckless, it was intentional.  So you don't have to worry about that one.  Thus Justice Kennedy's basic question I'd like to hear your answer to.  I thought it might have come from the other side, but you concede, I take it, that there has to be an element in which the person not only knows what he has done, but that he does it with an element of moral turpitude; i.e., he knows that the law forbids it or -- or are you conceding this and then fill in the blanks, or.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Then if that's your position, what do you say to what Justice Kennedy said, add in Justice Harlan's comment that embezzlement and larceny are set off.  These two concern fraud and defalcation in respect to the trust.  There is a case of this Court that says fraud in respect to the trust requires an element of moral turpitude.  That suggests a knowledge that what you are doing violates the law.  And if we read in pari materia, we get the same kind of requirement for this, indeed more so.  Indeed, you just conceded it existed even in respect to embezzlement, which is outside the parenthesis.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  Defalcation on your definition would seem to be more likely to be thought innocent by someone who commits it in some circumstances than would fraud.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  It may mean, for example here, fine, okay, no fraud, but what you did was you took some money that belonged to the trust given by your father to help your mother.  And your mother says, help me, and the brothers and sisters will benefit well too.  And so you go to your insurance guy and he says, sure, no problem.  And then, lo and behold, they did it.  I mean, innocence just radiates from what the conduct was as described.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is it -- before we leave this conduct, I mean, I understand I was painting you a picture of they're being innocent.  But we are in a court that this Court has described as a court of equity or akin thereto.   Stephen G. Breyer  One principle I used to learn was he who has clean hands can come into equity, but nobody else.  Now, we have two lower courts that are saying your client has pretty dirty hands or at least they don't understand it; that this, the other client tried to get him to sell the property, but they write the properties are abandoned and uninsurable.  Even though Mr. Bullock produced a buyer, they won't sell it.  And so do you have clean hands?  Not you yourself.  You didn't take the money and you do not have dirty hands, all right?  But did your client here -- does he lack clean hands because two courts have said he should have just sold his collateral and he would have gotten the money and saved everybody a lot of trouble?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Did we remand it so they could?   Stephen G. Breyer  And then what's the loss?  I mean, let's assume the trust was worth $1 million plus 6 percent, and every year, they have in their coffer $1 million plus 6 percent.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The only part they don't have is the extra money that the trustee made, that there is no cutting down of the size of the trust.  At least that's an argument.  Now, what's the answer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?  I mean, I thought defalcation is -- supposes that the person does pack his suitcases with the money and he goes and shows up in Rio.  I take it that would be defalcation.  That isn't fraud.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you didn't cite to the Latin, did you?   Stephen G. Breyer  But you didn't have the Latin definition, which I take it from my colleague and it was confirmed by my law clerk, it comes from medieval Latin, starting with a sickle and meant to cut down, to cut down, and that suggested reduction.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about the other argument?  I just don't want you to leave without addressing the other argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In your brief you talk about and quote Learned Hand and say it means --  ""If it doesn't mean a deliberate malversation. ""  said Learned Hand--   Stephen G. Breyer  --then it must be the same as fraud or embezzlement.  So I will go look up “ malversation ” as soon as I return to my office, and I will get that.  Now, the other argument was, yes, fine, a loss; two, done deliberately; but with an innocent state of mind because he didn't understand the law.  Justice Kennedy quoted, fraud -- from this Court, that fraud in bankruptcy for purposes of this provision requires some degree of moral turpitude.  Well, that suggests that you aren't innocent in respect to knowledge that it's against the law.  What about that?   INTERRUPTING ",11-1518
1,NO QUESTIONS,11-159X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The question is, what you haven't mentioned the text that suggests you are not right, which is right in (h) which says,  ""In determining whether an applicant is a child of an insured, the Commissioner shall apply such law as intestacy law. ""  Okay?  That's what it says.  Now, how do you get out of that?  Because you say well, there is an implicit exception.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You are saying that that doesn't apply.  And so I've listened carefully to your reasons for saying why (h) doesn't apply when its language seems to say it does apply, and I'm not sure of why it doesn't apply.  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Suppose that two parents have lived together for six years and four months in State X, and they have a child.  Fine.  The father dies.  Were they married?  They never went through a ceremony.  Is there a common law marriage?  Might it depend on the State?  Do you know the answer in every State?  My answer is: You don't know.  And I don't know.  And, therefore, we have to look to the law of the State in order to see whether that (e) is satisfied.  Now we have to look to it to decide if they are married.  Even you say that.  So what Congress did is it found a pretty good shorthand way of saying where you look.  We are not going to worry about six years and two months; we are just going to look at their intestacy law.  That, as I read it, is what it seems to say.  Now I have been listening to you listening to you, and I don't see how you're going to save us from even worse problems, particularly when I started looking at the state of the artificial insemination and so forth, and every State has a dozen different variations; there are uniform acts, there are things you have to acknowledge in writing.  It's a very complicated subject.  And -- and that's why I am rather hesitant to read it the way you want.  But I want you to reply to that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where is that sentence?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is it the bottom of the paragraph?   Stephen G. Breyer  It says  ""applicants who according to such law would have had the same status relative to taking intestate property as a child or a parent shall be deemed such. ""  So?   Stephen G. Breyer  At the bottom.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's sort of like a -- you say there is no board of taxes.  Sorry, I don't think that.  But -- because they used the word ""deemed"".  Is that right?  That's the heart of your argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The obvious practical thing is--   Stephen G. Breyer  --is that -- that, you know, once you get beyond this and the child wasn't even -- if he's conceived -- or what the father could do, couldn't he just write a note and say this is my child even if it's conceived later, and then wouldn't he fall within one of these other exceptions, the exception for being acknowledged?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He has acknowledged in writing that the applicant is his son or daughter.  What about that one?   Stephen G. Breyer  Does it?  He doesn't say it.  I mean, it seemed to me easier to work with that one than the one you're trying to work with.  But I -- I don't know.  You're the -- but -- but anyway, what I'm worried about here--   Stephen G. Breyer  --No, no, I know.  [Laughter]  Okay.  What I'm actually worried about and want you to address is, I just -- if we were to adopt what you said, what they're concerned about is many different applicants coming back later -- that's what State intestacy is concerned about.  And you don't really know who their parents is.  Another thing is there are already children who are eating up all of the money.  And then some new person shows up and you have to take the money away from the other children in order to give it to this new child.  And all the time, you don't know if that's what the parent who was dead really wanted.  And so that's why the States have gone into All kinds of writing requirements.  And -- and you want us to sort of -- applying this old law to new technology, just overlook those complications.   INTERRUPTING ",11-159X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I thought there were a lot more than 20 different lots.  20 different -- I mean, what's your view of how the cutoff should work?  Do they have to refund all the money, everybody who, in fact, ever paid a Barrett Law assessment?   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't care what the State says; I'm saying a matter as a constitutional law.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why in the State, when they have let's say, 10,000 people who have already paid their assessments -- well, why doesn't it have to give them back their money, on your theory?  That's my simple question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why aren't they?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Fine.  They define here who is similarly situated, and the people who aren't are the ones who are on the installment plan.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They do.  The reason is because they think it's unfair to give the people -- they think it's unfair -- they don't want to bother collecting it from those people who haven't paid yet.  Okay?  That's why.  And they don't see a way, if you -- so if we are going to free them, we don't want to go back into history and then suddenly give back all the people whoever paid their assessment.  I mean, so we draw the line somewhere.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  This is where are we drawing it.  That's the State law.  What's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean -- My point, I'm not making it clear.  My point is that what is less rational about saying, if you paid, too bad.  We are having an amnesty for the future.  What's less rational about that than saying some of the people who paid in full will get their money back and some will not.  Which is the line you want to draw.   Stephen G. Breyer  But that isn't the administrative -- the administrative -- well, maybe that's one.  The administrative problem is, I thought, the following: Imagine that you are the city mayor.  All right?  And suppose the mayor does what you want.  The mayor says I'll give all these people in their project back their money.  The next day in my office, there show up 15 people who say, last month, we happened to be in project 2, and we paid all our money.  Why don't you give us back our money?  You just gave it to the people in project 1.  Give it to us.  And the next day after that, there are 14 people from project 3 and from project 4.  What is your answer to those angry taxpayers who have said: We don't understand why you refunded the money from project 1 but not for us.  What's your answer?   Stephen G. Breyer  I might have missed a fact which -- which I'd like to know.  Let's call your project, project 1, all right?  And all the others are 2 through 20.  Are there any people in projects 2 through 20 who still have money outstanding, or are they all paid off?   Stephen G. Breyer  They're in various states.  Okay.  What happened to the taxpayers who still owe money in projects 2 through 20?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So it's the same.  So now, the people for the angry taxpayers in projects 2 through 20 show up at the mayor and say, mayor, you're not only -- you only -- you're not only -- under your system, you not only gave the all-paid-up people back, if you win, but you also forgave the future people in 2 through 20, and you're not giving us our money back.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Am I arguing the facts?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Older projects.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oddly enough, I was not suggesting that.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  The goal here is very simple.  They say we have hundreds or dozens or 20 different programs anyway, and once we start getting into the business of distinguishing among people who are already paid up, it's going to be a nightmare.  And so the only clear line we draw is between the people who are already paid up and the people who haven't paid.  And we don't want those people who haven't paid to have to pay, because that's going to be another 20 years of administrating $33 a month.  Okay.  That's their rationale.  Now that may not be perfect, but it sounds reasonable, doesn't it?  What's wrong with it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's not their rationale, or it's not perfect?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's not impossible.  They don't say it's impossible.  Say, try looking through the U.S. tax code.  It has thousands of pages.  There is not one human being alive who understands every provision.  All we have to do is start comparing the provision on page 1 with page 3 with page 7 and page 9, and we will discover irrationality forever.  So I don't -- I mean, you may have this fairly simple case but I foresee, if you win, the -- don't ask me what will happen, but I have a suspicion it's not going to be too good.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   INTERRUPTING ",11-161X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Then you are saying that the difference between the two classes is that if you continue to have the tax apply to the people who haven't paid it yet, there is a large administrative expense.  And if you -- an expense that does not exist in respect to the class that has already paid.  So the question, I would have thought in, our Court is whether that's a rational distinction.  And I think contrary to what was suggested, administrative expenses, of course, make a difference where the Equal Protection Clause is concerned, because they differentiate between the two classes, and trying to avoid an administrative expense is a rational reason, normally, for making the distinction.  Now, I mention that because I know -- what can -- does that bring to mind any authority which would be helpful, because there was a question that there is no such authority.  It makes sense to me, but is there some authority for that?   Stephen G. Breyer  What -- what do you think would happen if the city says -- if it came out that way -- we really want to give refunds.  Or cut the loss.  We want to stop collecting the money, period.  Then to make it fair on this hypothesis, the city would have to go back and refund money.  To whom?  And how many?   Stephen G. Breyer  And you heard your -- your -- your friend try to -- make a distinction between this project, and you wouldn't have to give the money, he said, to every other person -- whoever back in 1850 or 1890 or whenever it was -- began to make Barrett Law payments.  But you would with this one.  Now, what -- I'd like a little comment on that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right, because it's a question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Let me try to get my question, which is, I'm not -- I'm thinking this is project 1.  So certainly on the hypothesis, you have to pay back the people who already paid up for project 1.  But in your brief, you say there's project 2 through 20.  And is there in your opinion a basis for distinguishing all those people who have paid up in those projects, or would you have to give them their money back, too?  Now, you heard your friend's statement -- explanation of why you wouldn't have to give them the money back, and I want to get your response to that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How many people does that involve, about?   INTERRUPTING ",11-161X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What's wrong with that?  I mean, a creditor loaned you a million dollars.  For the million dollars, he got an interest, a secured interest in a piece of property.  And that property is worth whatever it was -- whatever it's worth, less than a million.  And he says that's the deal.  I -- I have a secured interest in this; I want the property.  You are better off because you can stretch out the payments over time and maybe you don't have to give it to him immediately, but I don't see anything unfair about saying, give him the property if he wants it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, in accordance with (i), (ii) and (iii).  I mean, I'm not saying skip those.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't understand that.  I mean, as I read it, to put it out on the table, this makes perfect sense.  What they are trying to do is help the debtor a little without mucking up the secured creditor's collateral.  Choice (i) gives the secured creditor his collateral, and there is still a lien on it.  He has what he had before, and the debtor is better off because he can stretch the payments out over time, and that's one and two.  Choice (ii), we give the creditor some new collateral.  Hmm, that's a little risky, but to be sure it's fair, we are absolutely certain, with a few exceptions not relevant, that the creditor can credit bid.  So he has it within his control.  Choice (iii), something else which comes up in different situations, for example, a creditor who is over-secured, see, and they want to sell the piece of property.  And he says, sure, I will let you sell it, but I want something that's the equivalent.  Give me this other property over here that you own that has no liens at all.  And the judge can look at that and say that's fair.  That's what (iii) is basically about, as far as I could understand it.  So it all makes sense to me, and I don't understand why you would want to have a rule saying that (iii) trumps (i) and (ii) and stops credit bidding.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So that's the whole thing as I am seeing it at this moment.  So I'll give you a chance to reply.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, it doesn't have the language, which is why we have a case.  But I mean, trying to interpret it in a way that makes sense, what is wrong with what I said as a way that makes sense?  I mean, why, since we are trying to give the -- the creditor the indubitable value, at the very least -- the best way to do that would be let the creditor credit bid.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So why not?  And you can read it.  You don't have to read it the way that you want.  You could read it the opposite way, too.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm looking at it from the perspective of a bankruptcy system--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that is trying to get secured creditors what they have their security in, while giving the debtor the advantage here of being able to stretch out his payments.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Look, in subsection (iii), if it applies here -- I assume -- suppose it doesn't apply here.  There is a safeguard against having no bidder.  Bidders who would bid more than what the creditor thinks it's worth, the creditor will want them in this, and if he doesn't want it in, it's because he thinks it's worth more in his own hands.  So what's the problem?  But there is a problem the other way.  The problem the other way, and I'm not saying it's this case, but there are -- is that the insiders say to the stalking horse: We would like you to put this up at a low price and give us a job.  And if they keep the creditor out, well, that's a big incentive.  And they are the ones who know what a hotel is worth.  The judge doesn't know, and there is always leeway.  And so that was worrying me about this fact pattern.  You want -- you want to get rid of my worry?   Stephen G. Breyer  Good.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But the concern was, I gather, there is no other bidder, you have said.  You've just found the stalking horse.  You agree to pay the stalking horse a million and a half dollars in case he doesn't get it.  And then the people from the inside are being hired by the stalking horse if he wins.  Now, I'm not -- I'm sure they are acting very honestly, but you would have to say in such a situation that there is an incentive to try to value everything on the low side by the debtor to make sure that stalking horse gets the property.  And that incentive is destroyed, or at least doesn't work, if you allow the creditor bid.   ",11-166X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I was just guessing before, but, I mean, if you're right, what is the (iii), the indubitable equivalent, what kind of situation does that come up?  I mean, I was guessing it would come up, maybe an over secured creditor, they want to -- they want to sell the property, and he still wants his security, and they have to put in equivalent property that wasn't mortgaged, but I was just guessing.  So -- so what is it really -- what is it really used for, in your opinion?   Stephen G. Breyer  What?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, I'm sure.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I was thinking.   ",11-166X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  How do they have -- well, the same question, but -- but I'm trying to think of examples.  Example one is the person is arrested.  Now, it says any person who is arrested shall have the person's immigration status determined before the person is released.  So I wonder if they have arrested a citizen, he's Hispanic-looking, he was jogging, he has a backpack, he has water in it and Pedialyte, so they think, oh, maybe this is an illegal person.  It happens he's a citizen of New Mexico, and so the driver's license doesn't work.  And now they put him in jail.  And are you -- can you represent to us -- I don't know if you can or not -- can you represent to us he will not stay in jail in detention for a significantly longer period of time than he would have stayed in the absence of section 2(B)?  Do you want to represent that or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, if you cannot represent that -- and I'm not surprised you don't want to -- I mean, I don't know--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --What?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, fine.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But the Fourth Amendment -- for -- I mean, that's another question.  I don't know how long the Fourth Amendment allows.  I don't know on that.  There probably is a range of things.  But we do know that a person ordinarily, for this crime, X, would have been released after a day.  Oh, you know, the Fourth Amendment would have allowed more.  So now what I want to know is what in practice will happen?  From your representation, I think that there will be a significant number of people -- some of whom won't be arrested; it takes 11 minutes for some.  For citizens, it might take two hours, it might take two days.  Okay.  There will be a significant number of people who will be detained at the stop, or in prison, for a significantly longer period of time than in the absence of 2(B).  Is that a fair conclusion?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's a different argument--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  Can I make the following statement in the opinion, and you will say that's okay.  Imagine -- this is imaginary.  ""We interpret"" -- imagine --  ""we interpret Section 2(B) as not authorizing or requiring the detention of any individual under 2(B), either at the stop or in prison, for a significantly longer period of time than that person would have been detained in the absence of 2(B). ""  Can I make that statement in an opinion, and you'll say, that's right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can I say that?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.   INTERRUPTING ",11-182X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, let's -- let me just go back, because I think -- I'm trying to get focused the question I think others are asking, and one way to focus it is the same question I asked Mr. Clement.  Think of 2(B), the first sentence.  All right?  Now, I can think -- I'm not saying they are right, but if that means you're going to hold an individual longer than you would have otherwise, I can think of some arguments that it is preempted, and some replies.  So keep that out of it.  Suppose that we were to say, that sentence, as we understand it, does not raise a constitutional problem as long as it is interpreted to mean that the policeman, irrespective of what answer he gets from ICE, cannot detain the person for longer than he would have done in the absence of this provision.  Now, in your view, is there any preemption exemption -- argument against -- any preemption argument against that sentence as I have just interpreted it?  I don't know what your answer is, and that's why I'm asking.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if so, what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Look, in the Federal statute, it says in 1373 that nobody can prohibit or restrict any government entity from making this inquiry of the Federal Government.  And then it says that the Federal Government has -- any agency -- and then it says the Federal has an obligation to respond.  Now, assuming the statute were limited as I say, so nothing happened to this individual, nothing happened to the person who's stopped that wouldn't have happened anyway, all that happens is the person -- the policeman makes a phone call.  Now that's what I'm trying to get at.  If that were the situation, and we said it had to be the situation, then what in the Federal statute would that conflict with, where we have two provisions that say any policeman can call?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's the -- that's -- that's where I'm trying to push you.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because in my mind I'm not clear what your answer is to that.   ",11-182X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You don't have to read it that way, do you?  I mean, look, it says in (a), it says, let's take an employee who is affected adversely, and then it says  ""alleges that the basis for the action was discrimination. ""  okay.  In that case the board shall within 120 days decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action.  So they decided it.  They decided it was out of time.  They decided it was barred.  They decided da, da, da.  I mean, there are a lot of decisions on an issue that a person raises in court and we don't normally say they didn't decide the issue, the court.  It decided it.  It decided it was untimely.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, well, I see.  The issue.  They shall decide the issue of discrimination.  I mean, you can read it as saying they have to decide the merits or you could read it as saying, there could be several claims that went on below.  Heard them, decide the discrimination one.  Now, you decide the discrimination one.  And I agree they used the word “ issue ” instead of saying decide the discrimination claim, that it says here, he alleges.  They could have said, decide the allegation.  They could have said, decide that part of the case.  But, I mean, why do we want to jump over 14 hurdles to give this narrow interpretation to that word issue when all that's going to happen is we'll have a new jurisprudence arising.  Is the dismissal on the ground that it was an allegation of discrimination, that it wasn't enough to really make out discrimination?  It was partial summary judgment.  It was a dismissal on the basis of the statement in the complaint.  It was -- I mean, we can think of 40 different things, perhaps, that are going to be hard to distinguish as to whether they're procedural, jurisdictional or on the merits.  And why do we want to get courts into that, when the simplest thing is the person says, I allege discrimination.  There it is right in paragraph 1(b) of his paper.  The MSPB says, you lose for any reason on that particular one, and now we go to the district court.  That's just so simple.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, no, no.  All we're doing is interpreting what you've said is the word issue, not to be quite so technical as to mean decide on the merits, which it doesn't mean normally, but we're interpreting it to mean decide the allegation that he has raised that he was discriminated against.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there anything you want to say on the question of which is worse?  That is to say, I get your point on the word “ issue ”, and I think you can read the word “ issue ” to say there is a contested point as to whether there was discrimination or to say there is a contested point between the parties as to whether the MSPB -- whether the plaintiff has a -- has a legal right before the MSPB to get the lower -- the agency reversed on the issue of discrimination.  The latter way favors your opponent, the former favors you; okay.  So we could do either, I guess.  The one way, if you win, there will be a body of law about what counts as procedural and what doesn't.  That sounds confusing to me.  If you lose, I quite agree with you that there will then be different courts deciding different procedural matters, where you'd get more uniformity out of the Federal Circuit.  Okay.  Do you have anything to say about which of those two evils is worse?  Is there any reason--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Have we any way of knowing?   Stephen G.

And so -- so what is the big deal?  Appeal to the Seventh Circuit.  Who cares.  Why do you care which circuit you go to?  You said you think -- well, why do you care?   Stephen G. Breyer  I guess you and the Government could have stipulated, we agree it goes to the Seventh Circuit, and nobody would have opposed you on that.   Stephen G.

Breyer  Not in tort.  This seems an awful lot like a tort, or tell me why it isn't.  I mean, what you are saying is there's a statute that says you can't print more than the last five digits of a card or the date, the expiration date, and they did both and you want to say “ or ” means one or the other, it doesn't mean and/or.  That's what the case is about fundamentally, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, can you do and/or or or.  All right, got it.  Now, if you print -- in your view of it, they printed too much about a person's credit card.   Stephen G. Breyer  It sounds like an -- sort of like an invasion of privacy, which is normally a tort.   Stephen G. Breyer  What do you mean?  You can sue for -- in other words, if the statute were to say, if Smith, a government employee, assaults a person, he gets damages.  Federal statute.  Now he brings a claim -- I don't know this law; I'm asking, I'm not arguing.  The plaintiff sues the United States for assault.  And you're saying that they can bring that in the Court of Claims because it's a statute.  I don't know how this law works.  I just read that and I know the language doesn't totally tell you.  It's about liquid, illiquid.  I didn't get that part exactly.  But as I've understood it, you can't bring a tort suit in the Court of Claims.  Now, that's what I would like you to elaborate, because this sounds rather like a tort suit, not sort of.  That's why I am asking.   Stephen G. Breyer  Even if it says you may not assault someone.   Stephen G. Breyer  And the case I should look at to show that is what?  That's all right if you don't have it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean, the -- a lot of these provisions are technical, like the one I think is fairly technical, the one you are talking about, the government -- it provides for treble damages -- treble damages, does it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Minimum damage, punitive damages, a fairly lengthy statute of limitations compared to the court of claims.   Stephen G. Breyer  2 years.  And they have 6 in the other?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  My -- my impression was there are several differences.  And normally, these things you, at least arguably, are not appropriate against the Government, because the Government when it knows the law will follow it, we hope.  And, therefore, you don't need brow-beating mechanisms to make sure they follow it once it's clarified.  So, therefore, it -- I mean, I can imagine arguments.  At the same time, there are differences between the relief scheme in this statute and the normal one you have in the Court of Claims.  And they're arguing that that means that they didn't want this Tucker Act and these other things to apply.  I just want to know what your reply is to that.  They are different.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  So is -- are you also saying, FCRA, the underlying statute, clearly waives sovereign immunity, so we don't have to worry about whether the standard is a weak standard or a tough standard, doesn't matter.  We win anyway.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what you want us to say is, okay.  We will apply the tough standard.  There's still -- there's still -- sovereign immunity is waived in FCRA.  And since sovereign immunity is clearly waived there, then you can bring this under the Tucker Act, and the only differences are the remedial schemes are slightly different, but that doesn't matter.

I want to get my own understanding right.  At that moment your client's lawyer, who they call ""Beau"" -- is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  All right.  Your client's lawyer, namely you--  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  --has not yet seen the client, is that right?  They think he hasn't seen the client yet.  They say somewhere he hasn't even talked to him yet or something; he hasn't even talked to Beau.  He hasn't seen his lawyer yet.  They say that two paragraphs earlier.  So is that right, basically, that they think that, anyway?  You see at the top of the page, about six lines down, he hasn't even talked to the lawyer yet, he hasn't even talked to Beau.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, they're talking about the lawyer.  All right.  And what you are trying to do, as far as I can read this, is they think what you are trying to do is you want Perez to plead guilty.  Is that the fair thrust of this?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What do you think it means?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So it's hard to tell what they are talking about, I grant you that.  I thought they were talking about trying -- that you thought it would be better if everybody got some kind of agreement worked out.  And then she says, Perez's wife: ""How can I not worry""?  He says:  ""I don't understand what's going on. ""  --which is fair comment.  ""But it's not the way, Beau. ""  ""He's putting it two different ways. ""  ""If he didn't explain to you the way, then, either -- then it's a different story. ""  ""If you don't ask him-- ""  Then she says:  ""Yes, he's saying that everybody's going to lose. ""  ""He's saying that, whatever he wants to say. ""  ""I don't believe it. ""  By the time I got through reading that, I wasn't certain what they were talking about, and I thought it sounded like they were talking about: Let's all make an agreement or everybody's going to lose.  And -- that -- I could see that you could say that's prejudicial.  I could also see that the government could say it isn't prejudicial.  And it's -- it's pretty hard for me to read their opinion as thinking they were really not thinking about that error.  I mean that was -- or not an error.  I mean, of course they would be thinking about that; that was the issue.  And it says -- I read the opinion, they said, well, there's so much other evidence in the case, and in our opinion this is weak enough that it didn't -- wouldn't have made a difference.  And -- and if you didn't, say, take it for the truth.  And the other, dissenting judge, common, thinking: No, I don't know; you know, it's pretty hard to understand what it means, but there is an implication there the lawyer thinks he's guilty of some kind, and in context that might have made a difference.  So he comes to a different conclusion.  That's what I saw going on.  And I didn't see some big war of standards.  I just saw judges disagreeing about a fairly tough question in an individual case.  So what can you say to make me change my mind and think this is a war of standards that we ought to--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Okay.  So would it satisfy you in your opinion if we said we aren't finding your opinion totally clear?

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I would like very much to know what your answer is to Justice Kennedy's hypothetical and the Chief Justice's.  As I understand those hypotheticals, they're trying to imagine a case--   Stephen G. Breyer  --where a particular piece of improperly admitted evidence -- we know from how the jury reacted, or the kind of evidence -- it's the kind of thing that could really make a difference.  I mean, they were in tears, et cetera.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, in my reading of this, which I once had to read about 100 harmless error cases, and it seemed to me -- and you can confirm or deny this -- that in cases like that, the judge who knows this is a tough case when the jury's feeling this way, asks himself or herself the question,  ""could this illegally admitted evidence make a difference? ""  ""Could it have made a difference in this case? ""  ""Could it have? ""  And the answer is going to be no where that judge thinks a reasonable jury would not have thought it made a critical difference.  And that's just putting the same thing I think slightly differently.  But the answer in Justice Kennedy's case would be a judge just isn't going to think it has nothing to do with rationality.  If the jury's in tears, they're going to think it's a close case.  And therefore, if in fact this could have made a difference, the judge says, yes, it's not harmless.  And if the judge thinks no, it couldn't have made a difference to any rational person, he's going to say harmless.  Period.  Now, that was my impression reading those cases.  And I felt that those hypotheticals were getting at that.  And -- use them.  Answer them rather than me, because that's what I'm interested in.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING ",11-199X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's my point, actually.  That's where I'm sort of bothered, just exactly what Justice Scalia said, that if you look through what I've seen so far by the materials, they're pretty evenly balanced, and there are tens of thousands of people who work in this industry, and there's a history of 75 years of nobody said anything.  So you would think -- and it isn't the only problem that has just been recognized in other industries, too.  If the agency is going to reverse, not reverse, but suddenly do something it hasn't done for years, the right way to do it is to have notice and comment, hearings, allow people to present their point of view, and then make some rules or determine what should happen.  Perhaps they'd say for the future let's do this, but not let's give people a windfall for the past.  Perhaps they'd say some and not others.  Okay?  That's my instinctive reaction, not necessarily legal, but informed by administrative law.  But why shouldn't I try to get there?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I've read those.   Stephen G. Breyer  I've read those, and I find them beautifully ambiguous.  [Laughter]  I'll go back and read them again, and if they're absolutely clear, you win, fine, that's the end of it.   Stephen G. Breyer  You're right about that, and so they're at fault, too.  But on the other hand, their employees might have been satisfied, and this is done to protect the employees.  So I'm asking, not saying, but what is the process here?  How do you know -- at what level was this agency decision made to suddenly go ahead with this?  Who made it?  What was the input?  How do you know they're on your side?  You do know; you're right.  But I mean, what's the process internally?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, did the Secretary of Labor herself or himself, depending on when it was, consider this matter?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, we don't.  All right.

Breyer  What does that mean?  Does he -- I mean, an outside salesman -- in one document, it says is a person who often obtains a commission on his sales.   Stephen G. Breyer  And now what I'm trying to figure out -- I might not have the right words to ask the question -- are these people, people who in some sense or other receive out -- commissions on their sales?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let's pursue this for a second.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because I would like to go back to Justice Kennedy's question, and this is only me speaking.  I don't know how anybody else feels.  If this had come up in 1941, you wouldn't have had a chance.  I would have said look at the statute; it says the Secretary defines it.  You say, well, can you define it in a brief?  Yes, you have to be careful in briefs, but yes; and that's the end of the case.  It's not a question for judges, it's a question for administrators.  But now it's difficult for me because of the passage of 75 years.  And we can blame it in part on the industry or in part on the Secretary.  There is blame to go around.  So the question is, what do I do as a judge?  And partly my instinct is get somebody to decide this other than a lawyer in the Department of Labor, because this is a hard question.  And that's where we come to Justice Kennedy's question, which is he says all right, fine, let's write that and -- and what case do we cite?  And I don't agree with you, overturn Auer.  I think amicus briefs are often helpful, but use them with care.  And then I have the statute here, which talks about the Secretary doing the definition of ""outside salesman"", and I have lots of rules and regulations and reports, which are fairly ambiguous in my opinion.  So you tell me what to say.   ",11-204X

And it is a complaint filed before the -- the property was taken into trust, and it asks for an injunction under the APA, if it wants review of that, before the government has any title to it at all, or at least it hasn't taken it into trust.  So why are we considering quiet title?  What has that to do with this?  Why isn't it exactly what -- now, that's the same as the Chief Justice asked, and I have exactly the same question.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Well, why isn't that -- that's the end of that argument, then, isn't it, because this suit was brought seeking an injunction before the land was taken into trust; the district court denies the request for the injunction.  The court of appeals reverses that.  And so there we are.  We're reviewing that action by the court of appeals reviewing a judge who said you are not entitled to an injunction sought before the land was taken into trust.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, I don't know about that.  Well--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, I don't know how -- how we should treat that.  There was an order.  Suppose that order was wrong.  Suppose they should have granted the injunction.  Then isn't what we should do, send it back because that injunction should have been granted, then have a hearing or trial or whatever you want to have on whether the Act applies, and then figure out how you do relief?  Which I don't know.   Stephen G. Breyer  They did.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He didn't appeal that.  He appealed--   Stephen G. Breyer  But that -- but you don't -- you can't believe that totally because you agree there is some APA review of an action brought before the title shifts where the claim is you cannot take title, Secretary.  You agree with that.  You can bring some.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Once you agree to that, I stop at the words, not just ""under this section"", but  ""to adjudicate a disputed title to real property. ""  Then I read his complaint.  His complaint, on 31 to 38, is asking for an injunction, and it's asking for an injunction before they take any title to the property.  And maybe they went ahead and did it anyway, but is there some other complaint that I didn't read?  Is there some amendment to the complaint in the record?  If so, where is it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know about a constructive amendment is.   ",11-246X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no.  You can't -- I mean--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I thought -- I mean -- sorry.  You answer it as you want according to your argument.  There is a difficult question here.  The difficult question is what happens if one brings an ordinary APA suit before land is taken, before that suit can be decided, before that suit can be decided, the government takes the land.  Does that transform it into a quiet title action?  The obvious answer, which isn't obvious at all, is that the answer is that it's a proper APA suit if you bring it before they take it.  And if you bring it after they take it, it's a quiet title action.  And -- and that would seem to me a first blush answer.  But I haven't found -- I mean, that's a question we don't -- I don't know if we have to answer that question.  It seems to be quite difficult.  And I don't know what authority there is.  And is it fully argued in the briefs?  So what -- isn't that what -- you're thinking -- I think Justice Sotomayor is thinking, well, and you just said you can bring it after.  I don't know if you can bring it after.  So go one and answer now--  [Laughter]  And I want to hear what you say.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But your injury, your injury is that it's being used for gambling.  So is there room for relief that could say the government can do what it wants to the land, it just can't let it be used for gambling, if you want.  And that would cure your injury, and it wouldn't require the government to give back the land, and it wouldn't require any unscrambling, and title could rest in the government.  I don't know if that's possible or not possible.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't think Justice Scalia's argument was a bad argument.  I thought it was a rather good argument.  If in fact you go back and you take the view that any suit filed to review APA is not a quiet title action, people could go upset government title to property years and years later.  And they would say: Oh, well, we're not challenging the title; we're just challenging what happened when it was taken, the title was taken.  That can't be right, it seems to me, first blush.  So, therefore, I thought you -- yours was different because you filed before they took title.  But, as I say, I'm uncertain of that distinction.  Now, your answer suggests you've been going both ways.  Sometimes you think, well, it matters that we filed before, and other times you think, no, it doesn't matter.   ",11-246X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  If you are going to the merits, I want to know whether you want us to -- or are asking us to overrule Grutter.  Grutter said it would be good law for at least 25 years, and I know that time flies, but I think only nine of those years have passed.  And so, are you?  And, if so, why overrule a case into which so much thought and effort went and so many people across the country have depended on?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So your question is whether -- your point is, does your case satisfy Grutter?  Is that what you're arguing?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, how do you want to argue it right now in the next ten minutes?  I'm interested because I have a very short time to get my question out, and I need to know how you are going to argue it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I agree it might, but I want to get to the question, see what I'm trying to pinpoint, because we have such a limited time.  And to me, the one thing I want to pinpoint, since you're arguing on that this satisfies Grutter if properly understood, as you say that.  In looking up, we have a two-court rule.  And two courts have found, it seems to me.  That here there is a certain -- there is no quota.  It is individualized.  It is time limited.  It was adopted after the consideration of race-neutral means.  Each applicant receives individual consideration, and race did not become the predominant factor.  So I take those as a given.  And then I want to know what precisely it is that Grutter required in your opinion that makes this different from Grutter, in that it was not satisfied here?  The ones I listed two courts say are the same.  So maybe there's some others.   Stephen G. Breyer  But we have a rule that if two courts say it, we're very reluctant, on something connected with facts, to overturn it.  So -- so that's why I mention that.   Stephen G. Breyer  But the test is -- the test is, in your opinion -- I have to write this in the opinion, you say -- the proper test of critical mass is is the minority isolated, unable to speak out.  That's the test.  And it wasn't in Grutter or was in Grutter?  And in your opinion, it was in Grutter.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Isolated.  All right.  And the reason it was satisfied there and not here is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or they could -- this is what is underlying my thing here.  I want to get you directly to answer it.  I did look up the figures.  And before Hopwood and the 10 percent plan, it looked on the African American side that it averaged about 5 -- 5 percent per year, really, pretty steadily.  Then after Hopwood and 10 percent, it went down a little bit, not a lot, but it went down to about 3 and a half percent, 4 percent, maybe.  And then they introduced Grutter, and it's back up to 5 percent.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, is that a lot?  Is that a little?  There are several thousand admissions officers in the United States, several thousand universities, and what is it we're going to say here that wasn't already said in Grutter that isn't going to take hundreds or thousands of these people and have Federal judges dictating the policy of admission of all these universities?  You see why I'm looking for some certainty.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I saw what happened, you saw the numbers.  Sorry, go ahead.   Stephen G. Breyer  You can answer it later if you want, or not answer it at all if you don't.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask you to get -- if this is easy, do it; if not, don't.  I wanted to use accurate numbers, and so I discovered -- I wanted to find out how many universities actually used a Grutter-type process last year or the year before, etcetera.  And one of your amici, the admissions officers, according to our library, is the only place that has that information, though it's public, and I didn't want them to do it because they are an amici of yours.  And you are both here, both sides, so if you can agree on -- simply, roughly -- what that number is, I would like to know it; otherwise, I will -- I can use pre-Grutter numbers which are public and available.     Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Thank you.  I think it is important, Your Honors, not just to the government, but to the country, that our universities have the flexibility to shape their environments and their educational experience to make a reality of the principle that Justice Kennedy identified in Parents Involved, that our strength comes from people of different races, different creeds, different cultures, uniting in a commitment to freedom, and to more a perfect union.  That's what the University of Texas is trying to do with its admissions policy, and it should be upheld.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what you want me to do is go read back what we wrote in Grutter, go look what the underlying determinations of critical mass were there, go look exactly how it is being done in Texas -- which I have charts that help me see that -- and I will find enough of a difference that I can write some words that can be administered by 2,000 or 3,000 -- a thousand Federal judges as they try to deal with programs like this, in -- that's the point, is that right?

The employee says: You didn't consider my argument that the relevant statute was unconstitutional.  MSPB says: No, we can't.  The Federal Circuit says: But we can, so make your argument.  What's the problem?  And then I'll decide it.  And if they decide it's unconstitutional, then the action of the MSPB is wrong.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know.  I'm just saying is there any practical problem with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Which is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine, fine.  What they say is: You have one argument here, that the statute that led to your dismissal is unconstitutional.   Stephen G. Breyer  We do not have jurisdiction over that, therefore we say you were rightly dismissed.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, they appeal that, and they say: They are right that they didn't, but you do, so will you please decide that this statute is unconstitutional?  What's the problem?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It may be unusual.  I just want to know what's the problem.  I'm not saying there isn't one.  I want to know what's the problem with that.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, it doesn't affirm the dismissal.  It says the dismissal was unconstitutional; go reinstate it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, every day of the week we get constitutional claims and people submit all their arguments in the briefs.  Now, occasionally there is one you have to have factual development and I grant you on that one maybe they could appoint a special master or, if not, send it back.  But they have plenty of authority to get them to argue the facts.  But I doubt -- I don't know if there are such claims.  But I don't see why that would be a problem.  Now, I'm not -- again I'm not giving you an answer, I'm giving you a question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

I'm asking for your answer on that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Give me one where it wouldn't.   Stephen G. Breyer  Give me one where it wouldn't.  But I don't want to cut into your time.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't want to delay the -- don't pause too long, but I'm curious.  Where did this rule -- is there a statute or something that says an agency can't say this action would be unconstitutional?  Where does that idea come from?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  I mean, it sounds -- really what the argument boils down to is, is if we accept your position, there's a kind of procedural complexity and anomaly.  And your argument is that his position's worse.  Yours is also fairly bad.  [Laughter]  So, that's his point.  So I mean -- but that's why I wondered.  I mean, U.S. magistrates all, tax courts, all kinds of people as a preliminary matter have jobs where they say we think a statute is unconstitutional.  I suppose millions -- I don't know how many.  So -- so is this coming that they can't do it from some kind of lore from Kenneth Davis or something?  What's -- what's the basis of this?  And wouldn't it be simpler if you just said it says they can take appropriate relief; they can take appropriate relief, period.  End of the matter.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So somebody quoted Kenneth Davis in 1958, and wrote it into an opinion in a holding?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So Kenneth Davis said this in 1958.   INTERRUPTING ",11-45XX
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So you say they have two remedies.  The NRDC if they think you are polluting could have done -- could do two things.  One, they could go and get some expert to try to get a sample or to make an estimate based on what he knows about the industrial sites that it's actually your storm drains that are polluting.  That's one thing they could do; you say they didn't do it.  Okay; the second thing they could do is they go to the permitting authority and they could say: Will you please ask the L.A. County to monitor the actual storm drains when they come in, a sample thereof.  And you're saying they could have done that, but they don't have to now, because now that is a requirement and we are doing it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  But, anyway, you say that the court held the same thing in two other cases involving two other rivers, and they didn't cross-appeal from that, and so that issue isn't really in front of us.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if they did hold what you said, then they'd have to reopen the other two cases.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  But if we decide that they needed file a cross-petition and they didn't, then what's the basis for our remanding rather than reversing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's that issue that what we have to decide.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Sometimes the Court says in the bottom line in that italicized thing, which I've never fully understood when and when we don't do it, but it just says “ Reversed ”.   Stephen G. Breyer  And then sometimes it says “ it is so ordered ”.  And exactly when you write the word “ Reversed ” -- but I usually just ask the Clerk, all right.  But the question -- the question is when do we do the one or the other, and I think here what they're saying is: Just write the word “ Reversed ”, we'll deal with the rest of it.  All right.  So that's--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let me ask a quick question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Does it satisfy you if we just write in the judgment what you -- we usually write and you can all argue what it means below?  What about that?  Does that satisfy or do you want us to write something special?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING ",11-460X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But as I read it and he explained it, I thought that, look, what they're thinking is this.  Stormwater is really a big problem and it's really complicated how you work it out, and we want the agencies to work it out.  So the purpose of this monitoring thing is we first determine that there is an exceedance.  Now, once we determine that there is an exceedance, which is the point of this pertinent particular requirement, then we're going to go on to decide who.  And what we're going to do is leave you with two possible choices.  One is you can try to figure out who, which means you've got to get an expert and monitor it; or let us now have a new permit which will -- will, you know, which will -- which will put some responsibility on the individuals, because we'll monitor higher up the river.  Now, that's a rational way for an agency to proceed and it leaves you with pretty good remedies.  And so why -- why are we running all around trying to work this thing out.  Why don't you just sort of try to deal with it as they described it and say okay, we're going to either prove you did it before or at least we can prove it now?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So the upshot would be, however, as I understand it, and correct me if I'm wrong, that since they're doing that now anyway under the new permit -- and you can question my hypothetical assumption there -- but if they are doing it under the new permit, then the only result of your winning this would be to transfer the running of the district from the agency to the court.  And I suspect the Ninth Circuit knows less about it than you participating in a -- some kind of negotiation with the agency.   Stephen G. Breyer  So your basic argument is this permit requires you, L.A. County, to do monitoring to decide if you're violating it.  You chose this system, then common sense suggests you're doing it.  You struck out twice with that argument--   Stephen G. Breyer  --in the other two rivers, so now you're going to go back if we permit it, and you want to make the argument and tell the Ninth Circuit: Three times and you're out; in this case, hold the opposite.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I understand it.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Couldn't you get some expert who--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I see.  What do you think of the Government's point?  They are telling us just write what you usually write, and then you can go make all your arguments, see what they do.  Does that satisfy you?   INTERRUPTING ",11-460X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why can't they just do what we used to do?  Many district judges do this and -- because there are sometimes thousands of petitions of different kinds.  A lot go to the staff attorneys that look them over and flag the arguments, and you put at the end, just to be on the safe side: Any other arguments that are made are rejected.  All right.  Now, that serves one purpose.  A human being has a hard time writing that unless he's thinking: I've looked this over pretty carefully.  And if it's a staff attorney preparing a draft, the staff attorney doesn't want to -- doesn't want to write those words unless he or she has really looked with some care.  And so it serves a purpose.  It means they don't do it just as a form.  They could turn it into a form, but they shouldn't.  And so -- let them write that, and therefore if we get nothing then you put into play these presumptions, et cetera.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, anything.  Judges can not do their job.  But -- but when you write something like the word “ denied ”, which is all most district judges write in respect to many motions, they read the motion, they think about it, that's their job.  So -- so, similarly, a staff attorney or a judge who is going to have to write certain words will want to do his job or her job, and they will do it.  So I'm just suggesting that it won't -- that isn't a big deal.  Now, this case, they didn't write that for some reason.  Many do.   ",11-465X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  --a minute, please, to Justice Kennedy's question about page 104(a).  I read the court of appeals' opinion.  Most of it, about six or eight pages, recites the facts.  Then they discuss the law.  The legal discussion is on page 104(a).  It's approximately 30 lines long.  More than half of it concerns Federal law.  I mean, they don't just cite that Federal case.  They say,  ""In assessing whether a juror is impartial for Federal constitutional purposes -- Federal constitutional purposes -- the United States Supreme Court has said. ""  da, da, da, then they quote it all.  Now, since your argument, the argument in the -- in this brief here is entirely Sixth Amendment, as far as I can tell, they say, look, look what happened here, they took this man off the jury.  That violates my rights to Sixth Amendment right.  It says it over and over and over.  I have no doubt you raised it.  And now they give an answer.  And the answer that they give consists of 30 lines, and 16 of the lines consist of Federal law.  So -- so what's the problem?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The remaining 14 lines do consist of state law too; but, I mean, how can we say they didn't consider the Federal issue?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, they didn't quote -- Nesler doesn't.  What they did in Nesler is quote a Federal case.  And what they do here is not just say Nesler, they quote the Federal case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, maybe it doesn't.  Maybe they didn't properly -- maybe they didn't properly state what Federal law is.  Everybody has some concerns about that one.  But what I don't see is how when they spend 14 out of 27 lines quoting a Federal case which they believe sets the standard for impartiality and partiality you can say that they didn't discuss the Federal issue.   Stephen G. Breyer  For Constitutional purposes.  And this guy was kicked off the jury because they thought he was not impartial.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then your claim over in the Ninth Circuit is not that they didn't consider it, but that, rather, they considered it, but no reasonable juror could reach -- no reasonable jurist could reach the conclusion that they reached on the issue.  That argument is open to you.  The only thing I don't understand is how you're saying -- or everybody -- I must be wrong, because everybody seems to be saying it -- that they didn't reach the Federal issue when they spent 14 lines discussing it, rightly or wrongly.   Stephen G. Breyer  Which happens to be the issue in this case.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Now, what the court says about that argument, what the court of appeals says, is that the argument of your client not only misstates the evidence -- that's their -- not you, but they're criticizing -- and then he says,  ""It ignores the trial court's explanation that it was discharging Juror No. 6 because he had shown himself to be biased. ""  So this court of appeals thinks the issue is whether he had shown sufficient bias.  You think the answer to that is clearly no.  The government thinks it's yes.  And I can understand the differences of opinion, but I'm back to my question.  It seems to me in 14 lines they do address the Federal constitutional question of bias.  And that's -- that's -- maybe it wasn't the right issue, et cetera, but -- or maybe they didn't decide it correctly.  But you see what's bothering me.  And so I've listened to the answer.

Breyer  But the contract doesn't mention it.  That's Ferris.  I thought that the -- the real world is, in contracting, you typically have both a statute that says don't pay more than is appropriated--   Stephen G.

So in that world -- now we get to the question -- in that world, what happens when 15 people each enter into such a contract for $100,000 each, and the appropriation turns out to be too small to pay all of them, but big enough to pay some?

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I saw -- I read the Redbook.  I might have missed the part that you're about to cite to, because I'd like you to tell me where in the Redbook it says that a contractor who has a contract that says ""subject to appropriations"" and is then dealing with the law of Congress which says the appropriation will not exceed X million is then entitled to be paid on a contract where he and like contracts do exceed X million.  Where does is say that in the Redbook?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I couldn't find it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I did read it.  I just would like to know what page you want me to read again.  I read the Chamber of Commerce brief.  The Chamber of Commerce brief says everybody knows the contractors are paid in this situation.  So I looked up the authorities that they cited.  Okay?  I read the Redbook.  I read my other case of Cherokee.  I read Ferris.  I read Sutton.  I can't say I'm perfect at reading--   Stephen G. Breyer  --but I couldn't find it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So I would appreciate your referring me to those citations.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I have it in front of me, by coincidence.  [Laughter]  Here it is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I have the Redbook 6-44.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not saying it isn't there.  I just read through these pretty quickly.  I just need a little refresher.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, I don't have that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  That isn't quite my question.  My question was: I would like the authority for the proposition that when you have a set of contractors, and they read their contract, and it says $4 million, and then you discover that the amount of the contracts of the same kind in this category are more than $4 million, I want to know where in the Redbook it says that they get paid more than $4 million.  That's all.  That's fairly simple.  And if that's -- if that's normal practice, it must be there's a lot of authority for it.  So I just want to know what to read.   Stephen G. Breyer  But they aren't talking about there where it says specifically in the contract ""subject to appropriations"".  At least, I think they're not.  Now, I would like you right now to tell me, no, you're wrong; it does say that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They're distinguishing Sutton from Ferris.   Stephen G. Breyer  They're trying to use that to distinguish Sutton from Ferris, and it's filled with, well, we're not sure about this because Sutton, which is Brandeis, which comes out the opposite way, did have a line appropriation, and I thought that just refers to the fact that because there's a line appropriation the contractor is on notice.   Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly.  And when you do business with the government over a period of years, and it says subject to appropriation, not necessarily you but your lawyer, who is a good lawyer, should look up and see what the appropriation is or whether it was made.  I mean, that's what I--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --No, no, not as a matter of policy.  I'm putting it as a question because that was my first reaction, and I expect you to say, no, Justice Breyer--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --you're wrong, and that isn't the practice, and here is what I read to show that isn't the practice.  That's all I'm asking.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  By showing me where in the law it says -- and I don't want to repeat the question for the third time, but it says--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, here sometimes not everyone pays sufficient attention to these very clear questions.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Where -- Look, hypothetical, four people, four identical contracts, the words appear, ""subject to appropriation"".   Stephen G. Breyer  Each is for a million dollars.  Then you read the appropriation that was later made, and in that statute it says, ""we hereby appropriate three million"", and -- it is,  ""the payments are not to exceed three million. ""  Okay?  Something like that.   Stephen G. Breyer  All I want is the authority that says each of those four people can come in and get the $1 million, totaling four million.  I want the authority that says that.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  It did not say anything about it in the contract.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, there certainly is.  Putting in the words gives the lawyer notice.   Stephen G. Breyer  It does?  Where do you get -- I couldn't find the contract.  The language in Ferris is,  ""a contractor who is one of several persons to be paid out of an appropriation is not chargeable with knowledge of its administration. ""  True.  Now, Dyk says, in his opinion, that one difference from Ferris is they wrote the idea into the contract, saying you're subject to appropriation to get -- to make that lawyer chargeable with knowledge.  And the second thing in Ferris is that it was an individual who went off on his own in the administration and paid money that he shouldn't have paid.  It should have been over here for the contract.  In this case, it is an instance where Congress itself required the money to be paid, as it was paid, and didn't provide enough.  Okay.  So that's where I am with Ferris, which is a big question mark.  And I guess you can talk about that, but all I wanted to know is what is well established in this field.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't want to write something that suddenly upsets what is well established.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

And apparently, for about a dozen years, the EEOC has had, as -- as an alternative basis for qualifying as a supervisor, the individual has authority to direct the employee's daily work activities.  And in addition, we have three circuits that for some period of years have been following roughly the same kind of rule.  Now, has this problem of the country music or the other problems raised, have they turned out to be a significant problem in those circuits or for the EEOC?   Sri Srinivasan  They haven't, Justice Breyer.   Stephen G. Breyer  They have, or they have not?   Sri Srinivasan  They have not.  I'm sorry.  They have not turned out to be an issue, and that's what--   Stephen G. Breyer  But I guess they'd tell you.  There are three who signed the brief, or four.  And I guess they'd tell you, wouldn't they--   Sri Srinivasan  --Right.   Stephen G. Breyer  --what the problems are, if they have problems.   Sri Srinivasan  Right.  In our conversations with them about the way in which these issues arise--   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, we can ask the other side the same question.  They've seen the cases in the circuits.  Have they seen instances in the EEOC or before the circuits where it's turned out to be a serious problem, like the country music or any of the other hypotheticals raised?   Sri Srinivasan  --And I don't think it has, Justice Breyer.  And I think it's important to bear in mind that the nature of this inquiry is such that there's going to be cases at the margins that raise difficult questions; but, in Ellerth, the Court recognized that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, is there any?  You said he went through, you weren't preceding on the -- your client, originally in district court, not preceding on the basis of the straight Seventh Circuit test.  He had the EEOC look into it; the Government itself says that we should affirm and they have EEOC lawyers on it.  And so is there any piece of information that would be relevant that you know of that you would introduce, were it sent back, say to the district court, that you have not already introduced?   Stephen G. Breyer  I read what they said in the last page of their brief.  They said either affirm, that was their first thing, or send it back.  Okay.  Now my question remains the same.   Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's true, but if you're looking at expectation of a reasonable homeowner, imagine you have a home, a long driveway.  You do expect people to come up and come into the house, knock on the door, maybe even with dogs.  Do you expect them to sit there for 5 to 15 minutes, 15 minutes, not knocking on the door, doing nothing?  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --is that something I wouldn't -- would you be nervous about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Anyone coming to your door and not knocking.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Just sniffing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, there is in this sense.  Justice Scalia just said it.  He said, you do have an expectation of people coming into your door, perhaps even with animals, perhaps even with binoculars, but not looking into the house, not looking into the house from the front step with the binoculars.  Now, why is that unconstitutional?  Because it's very unusual that someone would do that, and the homeowner would resent it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Would a homeowner resent someone coming with a large animal sitting in front of his front step on his property and sitting there sniffing for 5 to 15 minutes?  Forget the sniffing.  Just talking, loud noises.  Is that something that you invite people to do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Ah.  Is that what happened here?   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought what happened here was 5 to 15 minutes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but I -- what I'm curious about, and it's an unanswered question for me, is we are considering whether the dog sniff is permissible, so I wanted to know what a dog sniff at the front door involved.  And at page 96, 97, 98 of the joint appendix, with which you are familiar, it explains that.  It isn't just going up and [indicating;] that's it.  It's a process called bracketing.  They describe it at length.  The officer, the dog officer, said he was in a rush that day and it didn't take more than 5 to 10 minutes.  And my question really is whether an ordinary homeowner expects people to walk down the curtilage and, with a big animal, and the animal -- they don't knock.  They behave in the page 96, 97, 98 way.  I subjectively think, well, that's pretty unusual behavior, whether it's a policeman or anybody else.  So what do you respond?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It was 5 to 10 minutes and it's 96-97.   INTERRUPTING ",11-564X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You're assuming the conclusion in these things.  I mean, I thought since Katz the rule has been whether the homeowner has a reasonable expectation of privacy in -- which is infringed or violated or interfered with when the Government acts.  So that's a question of does he have that reasonable expectation.  So now we're back to exactly where we were.  Your opponents say, no, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --to protect a person with a dog coming up to the door and going [indicating,] all right?  Now, your response to that is what?   Stephen G. Breyer  And then the question was, as Justice Alito put it, why?  He says, we go back to the 17th century, as far as you want, and there is no law that says there is any kind of expectation in a homeowner that a person won't walk up to the dog -- to the door with a dog on a leash and sniff, which, as he says -- which your opponents say is what happened here.  And your response to that is?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'll look at this later, but I'm rather surprised.  My understanding of the case law was the Chief Justice's, and I thought what you're supposed to look at is the behavior of the individual, the police officer, who comes to the door or looks into the house, not his subjective motive.  Now, as we just heard, you said, and with support here, that Jones changed that, but I don't know what in Jones changed that.  Jones is the case where the police did in fact go to a person's car and physically put something in it.  That's -- something that tracked.  That's behavior.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what is it in Jones that said what we're supposed to look at is not behavior, but the subjective intent of the officer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, it may be a search.   Stephen G. Breyer  Not a police officer.  If we start -- policemen have to know how to behave.  And in this area, they can behave the same way as other people can behave, and we expect them to behave, even though their motive differs.  They're always trying to find crime.  That's what I thought the law was.  I've been trying to figure out just what you say, but in a slightly different form.  Do people come up to the door with dogs?  Yes.  Do the dogs breathe?  Do in fact policemen, like other people, come up and breathe?  Do we expect it?  Yes, we expect people to come up and breathe.  But do we expect them to do what happened here?  And at that point, I get into the question: What happened here?  And I'd be interested in your view on that.   ",11-564X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Which ones?  Because I counted eleven cases which either say, state, some seem to hold or support the proposition that when it's temporary with a flood it's a trespass, and where it's permanent it's a taking.  Okay?  I mean, I have eleven.  And so I've got from my law clerk.  And then I tried to see, well, what are the ones that say the opposite?  And so far we've come up with zero.  All right?  You could argue that there were three cases during the war which might be read that way, though they don't quite mention it.  So which of the cases that you -- rather than list my eleven, I'm more interested in what you think, and so I'd like to know which are the ones you think support -- with something like a flood, which it's not -- you're not physically taking hold of the whole thing.  You're sending something in that comes back.  Which of the ones support you that temporary is not a trespass, temporary is a taking?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Dickinson -- I got written down Dickinson.   Stephen G. Breyer  Kimball Laundry.  Kimball Laundry was the laundry facilities.   Stephen G. Breyer  They took the laundry facilities for 3 years, but there what they did is they went in and they took this building, you know, took the whole thing.   Stephen G. Breyer  The problem with a flood is you don't take all the land.  You send some stuff in.  And the stuff is there for a while, and then it comes back, and -- it's called water.  And so I don't know what to make of the cases like Kimball Laundry where you actually appropriate the property.  I suspect that they are not quite the same.  Anything else?  I got Dickinson; I've got Kimball Laundry.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, Causby.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but in Causby, what they did -- there was a question about whether just flying some airplanes over is a taking or a trespass.  But it went on for 25 years, soit was a long time.  And, therefore, the permanency of it I don't think is at issue there.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what do you suggest -- what do you suggest -- I looked at the consent.   Stephen G. Breyer  To tell you the truth, I think it's permanent.  I think they're thinking it's intermittent, but permanently intermittent.   Stephen G. Breyer  The flood comes like three months a year every year.  And the erosion, they say that part that's eroded belongs to the government now.  And if he comes back with his dirt and puts it in, that's fine, but he's trespassing on government land.  So if I'm right in reading that, if I'm right -- and a big if -- it seems that eleven cases somewhat stand for this, I agree, somewhat arbitrary rule.  Now -- so I'm tempted, if I'm right, to say, okay, it's not perfect, but let's go with it.  There are people all over the country who have probably relied on this stuff.  And that would be so absent a better rule.  So what do you suggest would be a better, clearer rule for compensating for flooding where our problem is what's a trespass and what's a taking?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You know, but I want to know what your idea -- I understand the difficulties are there--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and I'm willing to accept a lot you mentioned.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what I'm asking -- which I just did ask -- is what's your idea of a substitute that would be better?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So a Department of the Interior employee trespasses on Jones's land, trampling paths, and even limbs fall off trees.  That's a taking and not a trespass?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   Stephen G. Breyer  So our department employee trying to find a shortcut drives his bulldozer through Jones's land knocking down his favorite redwood, it's a taking?   ",11-597X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is the legal rubric?  I mean what you're -- what I haven't thought of until you've been putting it this way is that the government builds a dam.  When it does it, water backs up behind the dam, and that water might flood somebody's land.  That's a taking, if it's at least permanent, and so forth.  Okay.  Now, the government builds a dam, all that happens.  Because the government builds a dam, a lot of other things happen.  They release water sometimes.  They make electricity sometimes.  Different animals come in.  All kinds of things can happen to different people 200 yards down.  Some will be 200 miles down, 200 -- you know.  Some will be helpful, some will be hurtful.  Can they never bring a lawsuit?  Can they sometimes recover?  How do we look at that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then, suppose what the government said is, Mr. Smith, you live 150 miles from here, and we have a rule, and our rule is you can't cut down any of your trees, and you can't farm the land, and you can't even walk on it without a boat.  All right, that would be at least a regulatory taking.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So why -- now, they're doing exactly the same thing here, but, instead of a regulation, they send some water in to do it.  So should we analyze it as a regulatory taking?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but that's the issue.   Stephen G. Breyer  But building a Government project, let's say an electricity plant or high tension wires, you could require the taking of some land to build it.  Now, you've got that and you begin to run it.  You could run it in such a way that it takes some of the property.  I mean, the electricity could, for example, because of some odd thing run around over somebody's land and kill all the chickens.  That wasn't expected but it happens, and it happened because of the way the Government runs the plant.  Now, I guess there would be a taking in such circumstance if in fact, because of the way it's run, it makes that land which no one thought would happen, as a consequence of the project uninhabitable; wouldn't there be?   Stephen G. Breyer  The collateral consequence is to make some piece of land 4 miles away quite unexpectedly but totally uninhabitable.  Now, what's supposed to happen there?  That's not just a trespass because it's permanent.  And even if it's once every 2 years, it's permanently once every 2 years.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What does it say?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but they made this--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So -- well, that's the part -- that's the point.  The reason they don't compensate there is it apparently had something to do with everybody suffering the cinders.  But where the cinders went out of the train and they ended up on just one person's property because there were some pipes or something, then it was a taking.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, here they're focusing it on his land.   ",11-597X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What about the -- I thought there was a -- a kind of caveat in one of these cases, maybe Stewart, that said take a thing that looks just like a boat, the Queen Mary, but if it is permanently -- they use the word “ indefinite ”.  I think they mean “ permanently ”.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But if it is permanently moored to the shore and is never going to sea again, then it isn't a vessel.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then if the Polynesian boat is permanently in the museum, there's a lot of objective evidence of that, it would not be a vessel.  But if it's something they really could well take out on the sea, then it is, is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That doesn't come up here.  That concerns the Queen Mary being sent to Long Beach and used as a hotel.   INTERRUPTING ",11-626X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  With cup.  What about the cup.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, well, this is lighter than you think.   Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I got stopped here, back at Stewart.  “ Practically capable of maritime transport ”.  Now, those are words I thought you have to interpret with some degree of common sense, and the reason for that is because each of us can of course imagine all kinds of things, from Styrofoam sofas to -- to just dozens of absurd things that have nothing to do with ships or vessels and really could be used theoretically to carry something on the water.  So what we think of is that practical capability means that there must -- this must really have as a function, as one of its functions -- I would like to say purpose, but some people apparently don't like that--  [Laughter]  --because it -- it has some other implication that I don't understand.  Okay.  So call it the function or the capacity, and it really does as a significant matter of carrying things, and not just accoutrements like nails in its walls, but -- but things from place to place to some significant degree, okay?  So I have just taken the words of the test and through voice -- and I'm trying to focus your mind, I've said you have to do that really as a -- it has to be some significant degree there, which this one doesn't seem to have, all right?  So you see what I'm trying to do, and really it's a way of getting you to respond to that.   Stephen G. Breyer  But it wasn't carrying things.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's true.  And of course a Styrofoam sofa is -- is carrying the holes, or it's carrying the -- you know, the -- the coffee can or something that is on top.  But when you have a thing that carries itself, that isn't good enough.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It has to be something to do with transporting a thing, transporting some stuff.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That is part of the house.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Think of what it's doing and compare that with the dredge that every day the workmen get on, they go into the middle of Boston Harbor, and then they start to work, and they dredge.  And so you'd say, well, I see one of the purposes of this boat is to carry those people out there.  Now think of this one.  This one is carrying things, but that which it carries is just what is part of a normal house which has nothing to do with transporting things on water.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  How do you then distinguish -- I see where you're -- you're just saying my distinction is not going to work, and so then I would ask you to say what one you want to come up with that will get rid of all the absurd examples that are lurking in the back of my mind, which I will avoid -- and yet include--  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  The floating sofa?  Somebody is retired, he likes to see it float around in the water, and you know, and it carries a cushion.  I mean, really that's absurd.  So -- so how do you distinguish -- I gave you an absurd example.  I don't need to say more.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That's where -- that's exactly -- I mean, I think that works pretty well; and you think that works pretty well, but I don't agree with you at the moment hypothetically.  So something's wrong somewhere.  And what I'm thinking is that you had could have very odd things, you know, like an advertising sign, floating advertising sign and tow it around.  Is that floating advertising sign a vessel?  No, it doesn't carry goods but it does carry, say, the eyes on the figure which might move around; and then it does -- and Justice Kennedy said carrying goods.  All right.  Does this structure, this houseboat have a function of carrying goods?  You're tempted to say yes, because his personal effects are in it.  I'm attempted to say no, because there is nothing special about those personal effects that isn't exactly similar to their being in a similar structure on land.  That's where I am wondering if there is a distinction.  That's -- do you see what I -- what is bothering me?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, it's--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Is there any problem here, which I think maybe the coast guard and the other people who are responsible for vessels, say once we start thinking that everything in the house is a vessel -- I overstate -- we are going to have an impossible time doing our job.  I mean, you know, you are going to see some kind of a log next to a beach somewhere and somebody's going to start calling it a vessel.  We have got to limit this somehow to things that really are used as vessels.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that a problem, and if so, how would you deal with it?   INTERRUPTING ",11-626X

I count hundreds of citations in the opinion, and I guess there are millions of instances in which employees and employers and others have relied on it in collective bargaining, so I'd appreciate your saying sentence a or two of why we should upset reasonable expectations over so long a period of time.   Stephen G. Breyer  I suspect you're going to answer my question, so I want to focus it -- and I'm sorry to do this, but I think it's important.  All right.  I suspect you cannot answer my question about reliance without accepting one of the following three propositions: First, unlike every other employee, government employees have no right to organize.  Or second, they have a right to organize, but they cannot bargain about wages, working conditions and hours unlike any other.  That's the same as the first.  Or, third, the courts of the United States are going to fashion, using the First Amendment as their weapon, a new special labor law for government employees.  And I'd remind you we have some experience on that in the 1930s where courts tried to do something analogous.  Now answer my question about reliance.     INTERRUPTING ",11-681X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The question you're being asked, I think, is a broader question.  Collective bargaining with any employer, meat packers, hours, safety depends on hours, always can involve public interest questions.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I think the question you're being asked is where you have SEIU or AFSCME, and they're government unions, does it have a bigger mix of public policy issues; and therefore, should this Court get into the business -- I'm putting it in a little loaded way because I don't want to suggest the answer.  Should this Court make that distinction and get into the business of saying when the union is too much of a labor -- wages, hours, and working conditions are too likely to affect public issues, and the other ones less likely, et cetera, you see the distinction that the question that was added suggests?

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what your argument is, I take it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So we are off on a kind of curly cue here.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I took it that the reason they wrote -- or changed the statute was just because they were worried about bailees or lessees or somebody under the old statutes not satisfying the first -- they were worried about that -- somebody -- a printer lawfully obtains a book, and he shouldn't have advantage of the First Sale Doctrine.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He's in the middle of printing it.  And therefore you have to change the language.  So they changed the language to lawfully made under this title.   Stephen G.

I mean, an American copyright holder licenses a British company to publish the work under British copyright law.  602(a) says he can't import the books into the United States, period.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, the only -- so there's plenty of meaning there.  The question is what happens when he sells it to his bookstore and you or I go in and buy it and we want to give a copy to our wife when we get back to the United States.  The question is, did -- is that unlawful?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no exception I take it once I bring back five copies and I give one to my son.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Millions sold in the United States.  They have copyrighted sound systems.  They have copyrighted GPS systems.  When people buy them in America, they think they're going to be able to resell them.  Now, under your reading -- now, this is one of their horribles, I gather, and I want to know your answer to it.  Under their reading, the millions of Americans who buy Toyotas could not resell them without getting the permission of the copyright holder of every item in that car which is copyrighted?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Am I right or am I wrong?  Am I off base or am I wrong -- am I right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Breyer  Now, explain to me, because they're horribles if I summarize them, millions and millions of dollars' worth of items with copyrighted indications of some kind in them that we import every year; libraries with three hundred million books bought from foreign publishers that they might sell, resale, or use; museums that buy Picassos that now, under our last case, receive American protection as soon as that Picasso comes to the United States, and they can't display it without getting permission from the five heirs who are disputing ownership of the Picasso copyrights.  Those are some of the horribles that they sketch.  And if I am looking for the bear in the mouse hole, I look at those horribles, and there I see that bear.  So I'm asking you to spend some time telling me why I'm wrong.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But we need--   Stephen G. Breyer  --interpretation--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But what about litigation in this respect?  I want to bring you back to the horribles.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The main point is that horribles haven't occurred.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Sometimes horribles don't occur because no one can believe it.  Now, for example, I believe there is going to be a storm, but it hasn't started yet.  So I would like to know -- I would like to know, if you were the lawyer for the Toyota distributor, and if you were the lawyer for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, or you are the lawyer for a university library, and your client comes to you and says, my God, I just read the Supreme Court opinion.  It says that we can't start selling these old books or -- or lending them or putting them in our word processor or reselling the Toyota without the -- without looking -- displaying the Picasso without the permission of the copyright holder, who may or may not be Toyota itself.  What, as their lawyer, do you tell them?  Do you tell them, hey, no problem; or, do you tell them, you might become a law violator; or, do you tell them, I better litigate this?  What do you tell them?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the word has grounding.  It is Coke upon Littleton, 1628, where it says that if a man be possessed of a chattel and give or sell his whole interest upon a condition, that condition is no good.  And Coke says, and that's how it should be.  And now that's picked up in Bobbs-Merrill; it's picked up in Dr. Miles.  It's been the law.  Now if, in fact, there are two ways of interpreting the statute, and one is consistent with that basic principle of commercial law, and the other produces some of the complexities that you have just mentioned, isn't it better to go with the common law and simply reaffirm a principle that's been in the commercial law almost forever?   ",11-697X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I see that.  There's something I really don't understand in these cases, because the other cases, our precedent's been around a long time, so I would have guessed that under that precedent in these other statutes, the obvious thing to do, the obvious puzzle here is not the Federal statute, it's the state statute, what is this thing he was convicted of about.  So you'd pick up the phone, and you'd phone at random four U.S. attorneys.  Not U.S. attorneys, but four state attorneys--   Stephen G. Breyer  --who work with the statute in Georgia, and say, now look, the indictment here says possession with intent to distribute, and I can show from the documents that it's a tiny amount.  Now, is it your policy, if he was selling it, to charge under the sell?  Is it your policy if he's not selling it to charge under intent to distribute?  Is it totally random whether you say sell or intent to distribute?  What's your policy?  Okay?  Then we get some answers.  Then we'd have an idea whether what you're saying is right.  Now, you could do that, but they could do it, too.  Anyone could do it.  And then we'd have some actual facts about whether this charge -- really, it corresponds to the misdemeanor or the felony in the Federal statute.  So why -- I'm not -- I mean, that isn't a brain -- that isn't -- doesn't require -- it's not rocket science, okay?  So why has no one done it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You don't have to say never.  The question is what kind of a statute is this state statute?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the kind of statute that it is, is a statute that is used to prosecute people--   Stephen G. Breyer  --with small amounts when they don't sell.   Stephen G. Breyer  If your version of what that felon intends to distribute, the distinction there is really picked up by the district attorneys.

Breyer  Okay.  You didn't.  In any words, nobody did it.  So my other question--   Stephen G. Breyer  --which is the only other one I really have, aside from making that suggestion, but here, what happened to this person?   Stephen G. Breyer  He was -- was he sentenced under 16-13-2(a)?  That is, was he sentenced to probation, which would be evidence in your favor, I think.   Stephen G. Breyer  But was he or wasn't he?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If he was, what it says in this provision is that the Court may without entering a judgment of guilt.  So there was no judgment of guilt.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it says, if he completes it, he then is discharged without court adjudication of guilt.   Stephen G. Breyer  And shall not be deemed a conviction, it says for purposes of this code.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why are we saying he was convicted of anything?   ",11-702X

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's what they said they are doing.  I mean, I count eight times in the House plan, the State house plan, and several times in the senate plan where it's clear and I think it's fairly clear in the U.S. House plan, they say things like:  ""The court began by considering the uncontested districts from the enacted plan that embraced neutral districting principles, although it wasn't required to give any deference. ""  And you say they are wrong about that.  ""The court attempted to embrace as many of the uncontested districts as possible. ""  So after I got finished reading their opinions I thought, well, there may be a difference between what you say and they say, but I'm not sure that there is a difference that is reflected in the maps.  And so it's now January 9th.  We have to have something in effect by February 1st.  They said that they are paying attention to what the legislature did and when I looked at the maps, as far as I can tell, they include some more, some less, most in the State senate, but they include a lot of the State's changes.  So what am I supposed to do?  I mean, I can't tell whether you are right or wrong without looking district by district by district by district.  What am I supposed to do on January 9th?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In which -- in which--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Okay.  El Paso County in the original plan I guess was all like number 16.  I've got it in front of me.  And they split it, and it was split somewhat differently or not.  Okay.  Then what else?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Correct.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So right now, why is that wrong?  Why is that wrong?  Tell me why it's wrong for them to do that?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, I didn't say that.  I said in their way of thinking they are taking the map into account.  Now, to sit -- the enacted one.  If I disagree with that, I can't disagree at the level of principle, I have to disagree at the level of particular districts.  That's why I asked you the question.  So you point to district 16 and I say, very well, tell me what they did wrong, and why?  Because, remember, they are facing a challenge that's based on section 5, part purpose.  And the district court there said in the D.C.: You don't survive -- I can't give you a summary judgment on that; purpose here may have been violated.  All right, now you tell me what's wrong with district 16, which I guess is your strongest case?  That would be helpful.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Tell me what's the problem?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What you said they were doing.  They couldn't have lost sight at the level of generality, because at the level of generality they said: We are trying to take into account the map.  I'm just repeating myself.  I want to know what is wrong with the drawing of district 16, what they did, given that there is a section 5 challenge based on purpose?   Stephen G. Breyer  Did you have -- what is that based on?   Sri Srinivasan  --What I would say is this.  The D.C. district court has scheduled trial to begin on January 17th.  It's supposed to last 8 days.  Closing argument is on February 3.  If you look at what happened at the summary judgment stage, Justice Breyer, they had summary judgment arguments on one day--   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, I read, I read, I read the opinion and what you said on the phone and so forth.   Sri Srinivasan  --No, not that.   Stephen G. Breyer  It seems to me that it's a complicated case.  Let's suppose you are completely right on your time schedule.  Then they will decide something.  How could any human being redraw maps in 5 days or 10 days where you will have different -- 6 different positions.  I mean, I think it's impossible.  How can you -- I don't see how you can do it.   Sri Srinivasan  Well, of course, if preclearance is granted we won't have an issue with drawing maps.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I think there's -- it seemed to me from reading it, I didn't think that the judge there is ready to grant preclearance.  And the other thing in sending it back, I read the brief and then I read the opinions.  I don't think I have -- I'm not being too generous to the opinions, but I thought that they were saying throughout is: We didn't try to draw extra coalition or extra opportunity districts; they emerged.  They say ""emerged"" about seven times.  They emerged as we tried to apply equal vote principles.  And it's hardly surprising that it would, considering that the population growth is primarily due to the minority expansion.  So it didn't seem to me -- now why do you want us to send it back to get more explanation when that seems to be the explanation, and to me at first blush, it seems like a perfectly good explanation.   ",11-713X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  --two sentences forward, if I could help with the reading, the fourth new district, district 33 was drawn in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex  ""to reflect population growth in that area. ""  All right?  Then he goes on to say just what Justice Scalia says.  And I -- I did read that as saying, well, when you apply -- I read it consistent what they have said in -- elsewhere, which is that what they are doing is, population grows, you have to have one person, one vote; the legislature itself in the new plan did create a minority, whatever you -- the opportunity district here, so we are following what they did.  We are taking into account population, and it turns out to be, and we do create it as -- in which case there is some ambiguity here.   INTERRUPTING ",11-713X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is the actual difference?  I mean, you have two officers or three.  If they go into the property and somebody's there, they can detain them, and Summers gives three reasons: One, as Justice Kagan pointed out, preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found.  We are considering now the case where, instead of going and detaining the people, the people inside the house walk out and there are two officers in a patrol car or an unmarked car outside waiting to go in.  Okay.  That seems to me identical, as you said.  The last one is facilitating orderly completion of the search.  That seems to me identical.  You want the person there so that he can open a drawer, so he can unlock a closet, et cetera, okay.  Identical.  The third one, where there is the only place for difference, it seems to me, is minimizing the risk of harm to the officers.  Now, the harm, risk of harm to the officers I guess if he goes into the house is that, well, if they leave, they might come back, goodness knows, and they would see they are looking for the drugs, da, da, da.  Or maybe they will rush out, or maybe there will be a -- well, any, goodness knows what.  Here I can see a slight difference, but maybe not.  I don't know.  Maybe they will come back.  Maybe they noticed the people in the car outside.  Maybe they didn't.  Certainly the policemen don't know.  And they might go in quicker, and then the others will be alerted.  I mean, when you talk generally about a risk of harm to the police, it seems to me pretty close, if not identical.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what am I missing?   Stephen G. Breyer  You already said the first one's identical.  I don't see how the third one could change, and what about the second?   Stephen G. Breyer  How do you know that?  They are sitting outside in the car.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's not just that.  It's that they might want to get in quicker to stop this person from leaving because he's the one who knows where the drugs are.  At least that's what they think.  Or they start to shout, and alert the others.  Or -- I mean, I have never conducted such a search, you know, so I don't know the risks involved there, but I can see the possibilities.  And probably you might have conducted them, but I don't know.  So how am I supposed to answer this question?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But that's the problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's the problem.  The police have to know what they're supposed to do when they go in to search a house, all right?  And they know that sometimes they can keep the people there, and you are saying, but they can't stop them from leaving if they're not -- all of a sudden, I'm a policeman, and I don't know what to do exactly because I don't know how to fill in that blank.  And therefore, I might rush in -- I don't know -- I see a recipe for a mess, and that's what -- and the mess could involve physical harm, and--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --They can't stop them from leaving if, blank.   ",11-770X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But is it in the process?  Does Summers apply and does this apply only when the police are in the process of executing a valid search warrant?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If -- if the police executing the valid search warrant walked through the gate and at that moment the individual emerging from the house had not yet passed through the gate, then under Summers the police would have the right to detain him.  All right.  So the question here is he's walked through the gate.  Now, I guess the police -- all right, I see.  The police objection is: I don't know.  These things are complicated and we might not want to push him back.  I don't know what the neighborhood is like and maybe somebody will get killed.  I mean, that's the kind of argument--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I know you'd say that was right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe he had a key to the -- to the place where they keep the drugs, the basement or something.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that fanciful?  Is it fanciful that people who are searched open doors or--   INTERRUPTING ",11-770X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  No, but you are allowing him to use those seeds for anything else he wants to do.  It has nothing to do with those seeds.  There are three generations of seeds.  Maybe three generations of seeds is enough.  [Laughter]  It is for this example.  First of you have the Monsanto, the first generation they sold.  They have children, which is the second generation.  And those children have children, which is the third generation, okay?  So, bad joke.  So, we are talking here -- he can do what he wants with the first generation.  Anything he wants.  And moreover, when he buys them from Monsanto, he can make new seeds.  He can make generation two, because they've licensed him to do it.  Here, he buys generation two.  Now, he can do what he wants with those seeds.  But I'll tell you, there is a problem, because the coming about of the third generation is itself the infringement.  So the second generation seeds have nothing to do with it.  If he went into a room and had a box that he bought from a lab and he put rocks in it and he said, hocus-pocus and lo and behold out came the third generation of seeds, he would have infringed Monsanto's patent with that third generation, would he not?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, he wouldn't have?  You mean if he goes and finds a new way of making these seeds which happens to be you pick some grass and you intertwine it and various things like that and lo and behold you have a perfect copy of Monsanto's patented seed, he hasn't made it, he hasn't infringed?  Why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  My question is the same with the grass as with the magic box.  I am saying the problem for you here, I think, is that, infringement lies in the fact that he made generation three.  It has nothing to do with generation two.  That has just a coincidence.  But that is in fact the way he made these seeds.  But he can sell, resell generation 2, he can do whatever he wants with it.  If he sterilizes it and uses them in a circus, he can do it.  The only thing he cannot do is he cannot create generation 3, just as he couldn't use generation 2 seeds to rob a bank.  You know, there are certain things that the law prohibits.  What it prohibits here is making a copy of the patented invention.  And that is what he did.  So it's generation 3 that concerns us.  And that's the end of it.  Now, what is your response to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm still not getting the answer.  I'm going to try once more.  Now, when you buy generation 2, well, there are a lot of things you can do with it.  You can feed it to animals, you can feed it to your family, make tofu turkeys.  I mean, you know, there are a lot of things you can do with it, all right.  But I'll give you two that you can't do.  One, you can't pick up those seeds that you've just bought and throw them in a child's face.  You can't do that because there's a law that says you can't do it.  Now, there's another law that says you cannot make copies of a patented invention.  And that law you have violated when you use it to make generation 3, just as you have violated the law against assault were you to use it to commit an assault.  Now, I think that's what the Federal Circuit is trying to get at.  And so it really has nothing to do with the exhaustion doctrine.  It has to do with some other doctrine perhaps that -- that somehow you think should give you the right to use something that has as a basic purpose making a copy of itself.  Maybe you should, but I don't see that.  Where is that in the law?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that there?  Is that -- is that there in the exhaustion doctrine?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true, but that's what I thought you were going to respond.  I thought you were going to respond to me that my question then makes it infringement when your client buys generation 1 from Monsanto, because they buy generation 1 from Monsanto, they plant it in the ground and, lo and, behold, up comes generation 2.  And generation 2, on the basis of what I was asking you, is just as much a violation.  But I think, though I'll find out from them, that the response of that is, yes, you're right, it is just as much a violation.  That's why we, Monsanto, give the buyer a license to do it.  And so it all seems to work out.  You don't need any exception.  There's no exception from anything.  When you create a new generation, you have made a patented item, which you cannot do without the approval of the patent owner.  Therefore, Monsanto gives that approval when you buy generation 1.  Now, it seems to me all to work out without any need for exception.  And I'm putting to you my whole thought so that you can respond to it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Don't people or animals eat them?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then why is it the only way you can do is to plant them?  That isn't the only thing you could do with it--   Stephen G. Breyer  --You can buy them from the grain elevator and sell them for other things.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The invented thing.  The invented aspect of the seed is it has a gene in it that repels some other insecticide or something that they have.  I understand that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You don't use that.  I don't think they used that particular -- well, go ahead.  You go ahead.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The people buying from grain elevators are mostly people who take these chips -- whatever they are, the seeds -- and they sell them for making tofu, or they sell them to eat, or this -- there are loads of uses, aren't there?   ",11-796X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, is -- I mean, that is an interesting question, because you can imagine -- you see, this is -- your answer -- this really deals with all -- it could be with genetic patents, with -- with hosts of things which are self-replicating.   Stephen G. Breyer  And some of the self-replicating items, which are infringing items, end up inadvertently all over the place.  Is there anything in the patent law that deals with that?  Is an involuntary infringer treated the same under patent law as a voluntary infringer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is -- is there precautions that you take?  I mean, is there anything in patent law that helps?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the person plants it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, he plants it, but he doesn't even know, you know.  He's just got -- we can imagine a lot of circumstances where this would be a -- where Justice Kagan's question could apply.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you're just saying that would need a--   Stephen G. Breyer  --modification in patent law.   Stephen G. Breyer  What about -- what about the other question--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --No, no, no, I want to go back to a different question that was asked, which was the question what do you think we should do about this other aspect of the case, the licensing aspect?  I mean, I would have thought it doesn't concern Monsanto's license of generation 1, because insofar as it's relevant here generation 1 carries the license that is just permissive.  It is to create generation 2.  But -- but they also said something in the circuit about a license -- about a restriction, implied perhaps, on -- on the use of generation 2 by the grain elevator for creating generation 3, namely you can't do that.  Now, they -- they thought, the circuit, that there's some restriction in a license and they have a doctrine that seems to say that you can restrict licenses -- through licenses the use of a product after it's been sold.  And that would seem contrary to the first sale doctrine.   Stephen G. Breyer  But you don't need that because in each instance, as you say, you are making new ones.  It's the making of the new ones, not the use of the old ones, where you prevent that from being done.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then you use the word “ use ”.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then you use the word “ use ” and you get to the same place.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't think you can think of an example.  I mean, you say -- I don't think you can think of an example where if you win on the other ground, you can produce a bad result for the manufacturer or the inventor because you haven't treated the conditional sale like a license.  I'm not saying you can't, I just can't think of one.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So lease it.   Stephen G. Breyer  So lease it.   ",11-796X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can I make a somewhat -- this is how I'm seeing the case and there is some mystery in it to me and it would affect how I might write this thing or consider it.  Look, what they want to do is to not have trucks park in the neighborhood on the street, and they want to put a tag on it.  All right.  So the second -- you seem to have said what they should have done: You go to the NTSB and you ask, and they do it.  They approve it or they don't.  And their -- their problem is that they don't want 40 or 50 States each saying a different sticker, all right?  So then the whole back fills up with stickers and that's the problem.  That's the problem.  You go explain, et cetera, okay.  But the first part, the parking, it seemed to me of course they should be able to do that.  And there seems to me to be a tailor-made exception: The authority of the State to impose highway route controls or limitations.  And if that isn't tailor-made for this, I don't know what is, I mean, I don't know what it's doing there.  And so why has nobody done that?  When I read the lower court on that, they said: Oh, it affects fares and it affects services.  Every route restriction affects fares and services, you know?  So here I see an exception which seems tailor-made for what they want to do.  I see all kinds of problems with the proprietary thing.  What am I supposed to do?  What -- what I see as the exception tailor-made for this isn't in the case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what do you suggest?  And it's a question for both sides.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, you can't say, don't drive our truck through the neighborhood?  This is residential area, no trucks over such-and-such.  If you can say that, why can't you say do it part of the time?  Why can't you say -- we're arguing a different question.  I agree it is not--   Stephen G. Breyer  But wait.  Why isn't the -- I mean, I thought that the purpose of these exceptions -- of course cities can have parking regulations.  Of course States and cities can have regulations involving trucks as to how and where they use the highways and which ones they can't use and which routes, et cetera.  That's the purpose of that exception, isn't it?  I mean, I -- I thought that's what it was.  And, of course, you're quite right in saying they should have to do it uniformly.  It says based on size and weight.  Okay.  Fine.  What's the problem with that, that I'm not seeing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, it says,  ""The authority of a state to impose highway route controls or limitations based on the size and weight of the motor vehicle or the -- or hazard -- or hazardous nature. ""  And it's size and weight, hazardous nature.  I mean, isn't there room in those words to include environmental consideration?   Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I myself don't know.   ",11-798X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's why the route regulation thing is the exception.  But the State of California decides--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Pardon me.  I know you're not.  The State of California decides: Here's what we have: A State public utilities commission which issues a tariff, and what the tariff says is anyone who contracts with a person in this State, a property owner, to move his goods and services, cannot charge less than $30 a pound.  All right?  Plainly preempted.  And your case differs because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're saying it falls outside the definition of “ routes ”.  Well, that argument is not in front of us.  I mean, I thought we were conceding here it falls within the definition of routes or rates or services.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The parking regulation--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, if it doesn't fall within, then I'm not sure what we're talking about, because I thought the problem was that it does fall within the rates, routes and services, and then the question is, is there proprietary exception, et cetera.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's why I asked you, and how does it differ from the hypothetical I just put.   Stephen G. Breyer  There are three reasons, and the first one, I -- I'm not sure why it wouldn't survive in a policy of deregulation if it seemed to apply a fortiori, or equally, but I don't want to argue that with you.  I want to be sure I have the second and third.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what is the second and third?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And what's the one that would be?  Give me the example that you're thinking of where, given Castle--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and its applications, it would be--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  Now, how does -- how -- how would that differ from Castle?  Because what Castle was concerned about was a State that has a perfectly lawful regulation, and it's violated, then the State as the remedy excludes the truck from the State.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what it's concerned about.  And it didn't say anything about accepting very serious violations, i.e., continuing ones.  The reason was the need for interstate regulation of an interstate enterprise.  And that was the reasoning.  Leave it to the ICC, a fortiori, where it's deregulatory policy, but leave that to the side.  I want to know your best case in that one, and I don't see the example yet.   ",11-798X

In the case of inadequate assistance of counsel, without being picky, the place where that claim is best developed, in my view is first collateral, because for reasons we both understand.

There are time limits there.  You could add to those.  And the -- the -- the direct review is itself a balance.

Fourteen wholesalers want to show that and each has different damages because they bought different amounts of pipe.  Hornbook law: Certify the class and leave the damages issues for later.   Stephen G. Breyer  This case, this case, hornbook law: Section 2 forbids monopolization.  It is absolutely clear Comcast has that power.  That's why they're -- that's why they're regulated and, indeed, they engage in things that show that they did not achieve that through skill, foresight and industry.  What things?  And now we have a list of four and the district court says exactly what?  If we prove monopolization, which is relevant to all these people in the class, then what we do is we later look into how much that monopolization raised the prices above competitive levels.

Now, if they're right, why isn't the measure of damages just what you said?  We look to the people who are subject to the monopoly power, and we work out how much above the competitive level they had to pay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Some paid some, some paid another.  We have some experts in to try to make that computation.  Sounds the same to me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I saw the four theories and it seems to me that we are now on the theory of one of the pieces of exclusionary conduct was agreement through various mergers, et cetera, that potential competitors would not come in and compete.  Now, I don't know why the judge struck out the other one, the number 2, but number 3 and Number 4, I can see it.  But on monopolization theory, that's not relevant to damages.  Throughout we assume that the regulator is doing a terrible job, otherwise the prices wouldn't be so high in the first place.  But what's the difference in this case?  I just didn't hear it, and I put that to show you how it seemed to me there is very similar.  The difference--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, that's liability.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You have the right to prove that they weren't, fine.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And this does, too--   Stephen G. Breyer  --because if they prove their case, the question on damages is to what extent did the absence of competition from the overbuilders -- and it should have been DBS too from reading this, but nonetheless let me express no view on that -- but on -- on -- to what extent did the failure of competition from those people raise price above the competitive level?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --the pipes--   INTERRUPTING ",11-864X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The strongest argument I think for that point of view would be simply this, the Sniff Company makes widgets.  The plaintiff says they monopolize the widget business.  That business is monopolized because they achieved the power to raise price above the competitive level through exclusionary practices.  For example, United Fruit used to pour garbage on the ships of its competitors.  Now we have here a class of people who have been injured by their monopoly power -- and here they are, and you give a list.  The judge says or the other side, how do you know that's the right list?  Well, we know; here's how we know.  We have an expert here who has used a model to pick out the right people who were injured by the monopoly power, its exercise.  And the other side says no, that model is no good.  Well, if it genuinely is no good, and really worthless, then I guess you haven't shown these are the right people for the class.  And I think that's what they're saying.  And so the response to that is, to answer this question, do we have to go look at the model?  I mean on its face, it seems okay.  I don't know, I haven't looked at the record.  And--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Could you talk about that a little bit, please?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Did I get my analysis right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, that isn't what I want to really know.  [Laughter]  I want to know -- if you think of the examples I just -- as the plaintiff, when you draw up your list of class members, you have to have on that list people who really were hurt by the -- or plausibly were hurt by the exercise of market power, and you have to have some way of picking them out, and you have chosen this model as a way.  So, I guess they could object on the ground that model is worthless.  Is this analysis right?  And you would have to show no, it isn't worthless.   Stephen G. Breyer  You don't have to show that much.  I think you only have to show it's a plausible model.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I guess in a monopolization case it is not the case that you have to trace the damages to the exclusionary conduct.   Stephen G. Breyer  In the classical class of -- section 2 case, the damages are caused by the monopolization, which lacks skill, foresight and industry justification.  So the fact that he omitted three but kept one has nothing to do with damages in the classical section 2 case, is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But here is the difficulty that I am having.  A little technical, but -- but it -- this is a regulated industry.   Stephen G. Breyer  And because it's a regulated industry, the regulator in your view is doing one of the worst jobs in history.  They are willing to come in and overbuild and everything, so he must be letting prices -- all right.  Suppose the judge or lawyer were to find: That's okay, doesn't matter, all we're interested in is what Justice Scalia says.  Then if that were true, from looking at the footnote on this, I guess you'd take this model and you would simply subtract or add to the base, which is supposed to be the competitively priced districts.   Stephen G. Breyer  The districts that also have satellite.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that shouldn't be tough to do but I don't know if it's tough to do and I don't see how we're ever going to find out.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know.  How would you answer such a question?   INTERRUPTING ",11-864X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't say that.  It says,  ""No State is entitled to more than 25 percent. ""  It doesn't say -- I mean that language doesn't say what happens if in fact there's a State that because of cliffs or something can't get the 25 percent to which it is entitled.  It just doesn't say anything about it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Where does it say something about it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Does that mean that a State can, when it can't get its pipeline to the river, go into some other State and take the water out of that other State?  I mean, I would have thought, if that was their intent, there would be a mechanism for doing it; that you'd have some authority set up by the Compact that would decide where, whether it's really true, and how are we supposed to do it, and there is no such mechanism, rather if there is such a right, which it doesn't say anything about, it's left to the State courts in different States to try to do what is an extremely complex and controversial administrative job.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's not at all complex when Oklahoma is going to say, Texas, go run the pipe to the south of the Red River, and Texas is going to say, I'm sorry, we can't get there, there's too much cactus.  And then they're going to say, don't you know that, in fact, when you put your pipeline into Oklahoma, you are going to be taking part of the 25 percent that belongs to us.  And Texas will say, no, we aren't.  And then we'll have to have a way of measuring how much goes into the river at different places and what are all these different pipelines are going to take out.  You understand what I'm saying.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I would have thought a mechanism would be set up to do that and there is none.   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  But they do say expressly, and I don't know what the terrain is like in the other areas.  And here it does not say anything about it.  That's why I think we're here in the Court, because all it says is you can't take more than 25 percent.  It doesn't say what happens when Texas is unable to get its 25 percent from the south.  I'm now repeating myself, but you point to the language that says what I just say is not consistent with the language.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Which language is it not consistent with?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Go back to the first one, because what you have done is you've pushed me back to the equal rights.  And now if I am going to fight you on it, I have to say the equal rights to water means equal rights to water arising within its boundaries.  And all you have to say is equal rights to water arising anywhere in the subbasin.  And if I just heard that, then I might say okay, I think yours is a little better.  But -- but we have this enormous administrative mess that would seem to be created, and both those interpretations seem possible.  So let's go back to that and let me hear quite clearly, now that I've focused it: What's the answer?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, we're only considering the instance where there isn't enough water to meet the 25 percent in Texas.  And in that instance, I guess there are 50,000 places, not just in Oklahoma, but also in Arkansas, where they might get some.  And all my question, and I think that was being asked, is there anything else you want to say as to why that's an easy matter to decide?   ",11-889X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But there was a point, it seems to me, to favor them, which is go back to 1970 -- the '70s, when they drafted this.   Stephen G. Breyer  So they are in the room, and there are representatives of all four States, and as they argue, there is going to be more than 3,000 feet, what happens?  And Louisiana would say, we want at least 25 percent; done.  Arkansas, 25 percent; done.  Oklahoma, same; done.  Texas, same; done.  But everybody in the room knows that Texas could never get more than 12 percent within its borders.  And since it could never get 12 -- more than 12 percent, Louisiana would be sitting there with not really 25 percent but with 38.  And so -- so--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that would suggest that, hey, no, they all knew this and so they meant there must be some way for Texas to get the extra; otherwise, why were they saying 25 percent for Texas?  If--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --You know, this is an example I made up, because I think--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --an imaginary conversation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But if in an imaginary conversation--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Why?   Stephen G. Breyer  Wouldn't that be a fairly easy thing to check going back to 1970--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --to found out whether, you know, Texas was just on some little salt flat--   Stephen G. Breyer  --near the river and--   Stephen G. Breyer  --In Subbasin 1, that's mostly in Oklahoma, but Texas gets a lot of the water or the other way around?  It looked to me like Subbasin 1's in Oklahoma.   Stephen G. Breyer  Subbasin 1.  It says Subbasin 1.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, 401.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  I get it.  Anyway--   Stephen G. Breyer  --because of that and because during the time when, let's say, there's 5,000 feet of the -- of the 2,000 extra, you know, Louisiana has to get 500.  Okay.  How do they know whether they're getting it?  I mean, how -- there must be some system of measurement going on or how does this all work?   Stephen G. Breyer  So, so -- in other words--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Fine.  So that -- I don't know how that cuts, because certainly the people who drew this must have thought at least in those other provisions they are going to develop a measurement system in case of controversy.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The relevant legal argument, I think, is look at what you just cited to us about this reach in the subbasin.  60 percent goes to Texas, 40 percent to Oklahoma.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, they've never measured it.  That's because they never fought about it, I guess.  And now we have a fight.  So why is it any easier to develop the necessary measuring system there--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --than it would be here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that argues against you because your main point, really, is that this is all too complicated.   ",11-889X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't think -- I mean I was -- I tend to be in dissent in these cases, so I don't have the authoritative view.  But the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but no.  But the impression I have is that -- that I had thought there were what I would call the elements of the offense, and then there were sentencing facts.  And sentencing facts have been traditionally facts found by the judge when imposing a sentence.  Now the majority of the Court in Apprendi went back into the history and said there is no significant old tradition, old enough, of -- of sentencing facts.  So really when you raise the sentence that's like an element and you should have a jury trial.  Now, the argument here, one of them, the government stresses -- and Ice is the same -- is that there is no -- the tradition's different where fines and where multiple and concurrent sentences were at issue.  If you go back to the 18th century or earlier, what you will discover is that the judge has always had a much greater role in deciding what the amount of a fine should be.  And therefore, insofar as that amount rested upon some view of the facts as to the manner in which the crime occurred -- and it always does -- it was the judge who traditionally found it, not the jury.  So those facts are not like elements of the crime.  That's what I thought was essentially the argument.  Ice and fines are on one side of that line and Apprendi is on the other.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  They are not doing that here.  What they are deciding is a fact of sentencing is how often this crime was committed.  No one can go against the statutory limit, but rather it allows a higher sentence when certain facts occur.  Now, I thought in Apprendi that the history is just what I'm saying it was in -- in the fine case, but the majority says to the contrary.  And so here it seems, even if I was wrong in Apprendi, that at least there is enough discretion here to say, look, this is traditionally up to the judge.  Now why do you think that isn't so.   Stephen G. Breyer  My goodness, I think there's lots of statutes that say something like this, that within limits, there's a particular--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, leave that out because--   Stephen G. Breyer  --It says, the fine:  ""The maximum fine is going to be not more than the greater of the twice of gross gain or twice the gross loss. ""   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you are going to send that to the jury.  Let me read you the next phase, phrase:  ""Unless imposition of a fine under this subsection would unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing process. ""  I point to that next phrase to show you that Congress understands in an antitrust case, in a RICO case, in a corruption case of different kinds, in an environmental case, it is so complicated figuring out that kinds of things that they excuse even the judge who is experienced in this from dealing with that.  And under your theory, as you just point out, if Apprendi applies here, we are suddenly telling juries to -- they have to under the Constitution administer that section 18 U.S.C. 3571 which I just read to you.   Stephen G. Breyer  You know, I understand you could say: That's what the Constitution provides and if you jury can't handle it, well, too bad.  Okay.  But I think we are still in the business of trying to decide whether the Constitution does provide that in the case of fines.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that a tail?  Is that a tail that the jury proceeding is itself so unadministrable that even Congress says: We recognize even a judge couldn't do it.  All right, now, is that--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Is that an irrelevant consideration when you are trying to figure out whether an ambiguous history requires the jury trial?   Stephen G. Breyer  How, in general -- I mean, in the individual case, very offer a trial doesn't come up because 90 percent or more of the time it's just a question of the plea bargain, and therefore the defendant doesn't -- this is an added weapon for him, Apprendi.  But in your -- with your clients and others, there might be quite a lot of trials.  So how in a trial does your client or others in that position defend on the ground of: We didn't do this at all; but by the way, in case you decide to the contrary, jury, we want to tell you we only did it Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  [Laughter]  How is that supposed to work?  Do you have two juries?   ",11-94XX
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What about the other two?  I just -- I was very interested in your colloquy here.  You said, well, there were three cases in the 19th century where they did say the jury--   Stephen G. Breyer  --And one of them was a very brief opinion from Massachusetts.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, Massachusetts counts in its favor, but perhaps the brief opinion doesn't.  The -- what about the other two?   Stephen G. Breyer  Both Massachusetts.  Well, that's extraordinary.   Stephen G. Breyer  Do you need any more than that?  I mean, do we have to get into this?  Isn't it just a question of whether there is a tradition in the law that juries rather than judges would determine what used to be called sentencing facts; facts related not to the crime, but to the imposition of the punishment where that's a fine?   ",11-94XX
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  How do we deal with that?  That's what's -- I mean, it's in your interest to argue that -- tell me how to deal with this.  It's perhaps true -- I think it's true that a State doesn't have to allow companies to have wholly-owned corporations.  Under the Constitution of the United States, nothing says they do.  Or a State could say, wholly-owned corporations?  Well, there's no limited liability.  Or they could say in certain kinds of accidents, there's no limited -- et cetera.  You see, they have lots of choice.  So what really seems to have been going on here is the Ninth Circuit, from your perspective, just really misstated California law by out to lunch.  When they say when we want it to be as broad as the Constitution, they don't mean, because we could get rid of limited liability, that that's what we do.  So, how can we deal with a circuit court that seems to seriously misstate the law of a State?   Stephen G. Breyer  I understand that that's what you would like as the bottom line.  [Laughter]  I would like to know the chain of reasoning that gets--   INTERRUPTING ",11-965X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Really, suppose I think that this was crying out for an en banc.  After you got your decision, we decided Goodyear, didn't we?  And yet, even though there is no effort to reconcile the case with Goodyear, as there couldn't be -- we haven't decided it -- by the time we decided it, it still could have been taken en banc.   Stephen G. Breyer  I guess we have no power at all to force the circuit, although that's what they are there for, to consider such a matter en banc.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And they didn't raise these--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Now we're -- look at the odd thing.  It might not violate the Constitution.  I mean, it's the same question, but it is bothering me, too.  It might not violate the Constitution of the United States for a State to say we don't have limited liability in respect to the subsidiary corporation or the general corporation.  It's very unlikely to do that.  It's going to be a big problem to get investment in that State, but it might not violate -- it might not violate the Constitution as here, to say, you know, we are in California not going to have subsidiaries when a plaintiff comes in and sues on the basis of something that happened outside the country; but we will have it when, in fact, he sues on something that happened in California.  Now, a State could do that, I guess, but it's pretty odd.  And if you look what the -- what the Ninth Circuit said in its opinion, it never referred to California law directly.  It's all Ninth Circuit cases or Second Circuit cases.  The only thing it says about California is probably something that was quoted in that circuit case, something like that.  So, what am I supposed to do, because State law is up to the State?  How do I handle that?   Stephen G. Breyer  So you think, in other words, that California has abolished -- I mean, California says there is no corporate insulation?  A corporation, when it tries to work through a subsidiary, that subsidiary has unlimited liability from lawsuits in California.  Is that what you think California law is?   Stephen G. Breyer  The answer then to my question is yes.  You think right today, in California, the law is there is no -- there is unlimited liability for a corporation that is a subsidiary of another?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you can bring a lawsuit, unlimited liability.   Stephen G. Breyer  That is my problem, and I don't know what to do.  It's really -- Justice Scalia has been mentioning this problem.  You're seeing it through the lens of jurisdiction.  I'm not.  I'm seeing it through the lens of corporate law.  Five shareholders get together from outside California and they set up a corporation in California.  Why?  To insulate themselves from liability, particularly lawsuits.  Now, instead of those five shareholders, everything is the same, but now it's a German corporation and suddenly, they can't insulate themselves from the lawsuits in California.  I think it unlikely that California would have such a corporate law, whether it goes by the name of jurisdiction or some other name.  But that's a State law question.  So what am I supposed to do?  That's where we started this argument.  And that's what I--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, another thing we could do is we could say we've decided now two cases that seem to bear on this, and one is Goodyear and the other is Kiobel; and we could say we'll send it back for consideration of this case in light of those.   ",11-965X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You're right, that's the standard.  And so you said that -- I mean, I feel perhaps more calmly about this than I might feel is warranted, but the -- the question is, is there anything here that you -- so you said by definition, we're going to produce some new shoes, which new shoes are not -- do not have the appearance of any current and/or previous footwear product designs and any colorable imitations thereof.  So I would like you to refer me to the record where your president of your client or somebody else says we are intending to produce some new shoes that fall outside that definition, and of course, I will look at that.  Because your opponent says we can find no reasonable likelihood that they are going to produce anything or they have any present intent of showing, of producing something that falls outside that definition.  But now, you just said, oh, no, we're definitely going to.  So just refer me to those pages in the record that shows that, because, of course, you win if that's true.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but that isn't the point.  The point is, is the new footwear that you're designing footwear that is not -- does not have the appearance of any current or previous footwear product designs or any colorable imitation thereof?  And so to say you are in the business of producing new footwear, at least to me, suggests nothing, because the question is what the footwear looks like, not that you're producing new footwear.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not interested in the real world.  I am interested in the record.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And does it show anything at all in respect that would support the claim that you are going to produce new footwear that doesn't either resemble nor is a colorable imitation of anything that you have previously produced or is the subject of the case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Period?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So I take it that this case really boils down to, should you have -- should they have or you both have another chance to say what the new footwear will be -- look like under a new standard, or is there enough here already to say, well, really, the judges could conclude that there is no real likelihood that you're going to produce something that won't look like what's already been produced?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, maybe you could suggest to me that we should change what the law has been or not follow it here, but where I'm taking the law from is Friends of the Earth.   Stephen G. Breyer  And in Friends of the Earth it says a defendant, namely Nike, claiming its voluntary compliance moots a case, and what they're claiming is that this -- a covenant moots the case, moots the case, the covenant they gave.  There's the formidable burden -- you know, it's formidable, you're quite right -- of showing it is absolutely clear, correct, that the allegedly wrongful behavior, namely their suing, but their suing in respect to this kind of shoe could not reasonably be expected to recur.  And they say, since we promised in an enforceable promise not to repeat this behavior ever, 100 years, how could it be expected reasonably to recur?  How could our behavior, namely suing for infringement in respect to a shoe like this, be reasonably expected to recur given our covenant?  And your response to that is?   ",11-982X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is it -- I would like to know.  I mean, I assume you ask them, do you have any current or future plan to produce a shoe that would violate our mark--   Stephen G. Breyer  --or that might, which does not look at all like the present -- your present shoe, and isn't even colorably like your present shoe, do you have a plan to do such a thing, are you in the process, is it likely?  And they say, no, it's not likely.  That's the end of it, they're just as if they manufactured cell phones.   Stephen G. Breyer  But if they were to say, you know, we make new shoes all the time--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and this is some kind of thing we might well consider, and we have people working on it; and they are considering whether to do it or not, it's well in the works -- they win.  Okay?  What did they say?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What they say is that they changed this at the rate of a mile a minute.  You know, they have -- they have stuff they put out, and we have the YUMS and the sweet, whatever it is and the Jelly Bean and so forth, and we keep changing it.  And so I don't know.  I mean, it doesn't seem clear one way or the other.  If it is -- if I come to that conclusion, is it the case -- I thought perhaps in looking at this that the line I quoted, remember, which puts a lot of burden on you, from Friends of the Earth, is not quoted in the district court, not quoted in the Court of Appeals, so perhaps the thing -- I think the SG wants something like it.   Stephen G. Breyer  So you say, okay, this is the standard; it's tough for Nike to show this; you seem to have conducted this case without that standard quite in mind.  It's tough for Nike, but they can do it, you know, depending on the facts, and you have these protective orders, da, da, da.  So send it back, use the right standard, and give Nike a chance and give them a chance, and that way we--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What about that?  I would like to know what the answer to that question is here.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Excellent.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's your opinion, that you will win on remand.  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  I would ask Nike, I suppose, Nike could say, you know, I read the page 73 and you changed things at the rate of mile a minute, and we looked at YUMS and Jelly Bean and they're sort of like our shoe but we didn't think enough, but you did think enough, and are some of these changes that could happen at a mile a minute -- is there any reason to think, you know, that they won't look really colorably even like what you just did, but nonetheless is a pretty good point that they might infringe our -- our present trademark.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's a long question, I don't know if I'll get a good answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I see that.  But I thought your response to Justice Kennedy was a different one.  I liked it because it was that -- the concern that Nike can go and find out the competitor's plans is true, but it exists whenever a -- a -- a manufacturer brings a trademark infringement case, because that manufacturer has to show he is now making the product; or if not, he intends to.  And if it's a question of intends to, then the defendant can go and look and see if that's true.   Stephen G. Breyer  And your response, I took it, to that was there are procedures that deal with that, they're called protective orders, and so is that -- have I got that right with your argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what your argument is, yes.   ",11-982X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can you tell me when you come back where the money goes if you win?   Stephen G. Breyer  What he says is -- in the complaint, it says --  ""prays that the defendant be ordered to restitute any and all moneys for the purchases of its citizens. ""  All right.  Now, you look at the statute he quoted, the Mississippi statute, and it says there is the authority to have restitution to restore to any person in interest any moneys which may have been acquired by means of a practice prohibited.  So he says that sounds as if what you're talking about is you want restitution, though, given to the State, the restitution is for individual purchases of individual citizens, because there could be no other.  And, therefore, you have a list of people in mind, or you must find one, where there were particular individual purchases by individual citizens and get that restitution into the treasury.  Now, that -- I think something like that was his argument, and I wanted to know what you were going to say.  Are you going to give up these last five words,  ""and the purchases of its citizens?

Breyer  Yes.  All right.  So this is a State law case.   Stephen G. Breyer  I know your case is, but the one that settled previously?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So you have a double dip claim.  I guess my question procedurally is that here the State of Mississippi is the named plaintiff.   Stephen G. Breyer  And moreover, the State of Mississippi is suing in order to obtain money, is what we just heard, for its treasury.  And third, the State of Mississippi is suing because of their belief that the defendants injured the economy of Mississippi and they injured it by hurting the pocketbooks of many individuals in Mississippi, the names of whom they don't even know.  All right?  Now, they say, look at -- read the statute.  Read the cases which say if you are a nominal plaintiff, that's good enough as long as you are not suing as some kind of -- I forget the words -- quasi-sovereign, whatever it was, one way or the other.  You know the cases better than I.  But why isn't what they just said sufficient?   Stephen G. Breyer  I understand that, but why does that fall within this statute?   Stephen G. Breyer  What about -- see, I can understand a complaint where they have taken 100 individuals or 102, and they list them as plaintiffs, and they don't call it a class action.  And that would fall right within the meaning of mass action if the numbers are right.   Stephen G. Breyer  But if we take your approach and depart from that mechanical, but simple -- simply administered interpretation, what was worrying me, and perhaps you can help me with that, is that there are perhaps all kinds of State actions where one of the motivating reasons is behind the lawsuit is some person hurt our citizens.  And so now we will get into the instantly interesting, but very difficult question of well, when you say hurt your citizens, do you mean hurt them by giving them rise to an independent cause of action for each of them, who we don't know who they are and we don't know if the statute of limitations has run to some, and we don't know if others have other disabilities; but, nonetheless, we're not certain this suit is entirely for that.  It may be mixed up with other things.  Do you see the problem once I start down your road?   Stephen G. Breyer  I've departed from the clear and simple.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You can hold him to that, and I guess he can say, no, I don't want to be held to that or -- but that seemed to be not for this Court.  Once he says it, I guess--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But can we not take him at his word?  He said it wasn't.   ",12-1036

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  To go back to--   Stephen G. Breyer  --The difficulty that I'm having is the Ninth Circuit said the reason that your client won is because the -- the piece of grass between the road and -- and the sign was not -- it was subject to an easement and the government lacked the exclusive right of possession.  All right.  When I saw that, I thought, well, there -- there are thousands of different kinds of easement, as Justice Kennedy just said.  They're there for utilities.  They're for -- they're there for people who might want to -- I mean, I can imagine a million, as you can, too.  So not all of those would involve First Amendment anything, and -- and, yet, the -- the Ninth Circuit would seem to say that your client could go and demonstrate, as long as the utility company had an easement.  So how are we supposed to interpret the statute to avoid the First Amendment problem without getting into an interpretation that, to me, would seem ridiculous.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, why does the First Amendment allow a person to go to the heart of the military base, put on any demonstration they want, the statute doesn't apply for the reason that, once every four months, the PG&E has an easement to go out and read the meter.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, that's exactly -- I know you wouldn't--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and that's why I want to know what your position is as to the interpretation of the statute that avoids my absurd PG&E result, but, nonetheless, does what you want, which is to protect the First Amendment interests.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, that's what I don't understand.  Let me press -- at the risk of repetition, the reason I'm asking this question is the record is not developed.  I looked at the Google maps.  It looked to me like this area is sort of a suburban house with a lawn in front of it, and you drive along the street, and you suspect that the street may belong to the city a little way up the lawn; but beyond that, it probably belongs to the homeowner.  And when you try to see where does the green line cross that grassy area, you can't easily tell, and -- and it may be just a foot or two.  So it may have been inconceivable that your client didn't cross the green line or maybe he didn't.  I don't know.  So, therefore, you're back to a more basic test, and you say, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that, if they do not have exclusive control, the military can't enforce this statute.  But what do we do, which was my question, about instances where the military does not have exclusive control, but the reason it doesn't has nothing to do with roads, nothing to do with green lines, it has to do with thousands of other easements that have nothing to do with this case; therefore, I'm pressing you to get a definition of this statute that will serve your ends without getting into all these other kinds of easements.   Stephen G. Breyer  And what is that, in your view?   Stephen G. Breyer  It's more than that.  It says I mean, you know, if you wanted to take someone to school.  It said -- first, if you need medical treatment, you can just go in, and then it said you -- you have to receive prior written approval from me, the commander, or my designee, but if you get it.  So I suppose if he had a child at the school, he would ask and they'd give it to him.  I mean, it didn't seem to me an absolute bar.  It seemed to me a bar for purposes of going to that particular--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Do we have to get into any of that?  Do we -- just like I don't know where he really was physically.  I don't know whether that grass strip is within something, without something.  These all sound like First Amendment relevant matters.   INTERRUPTING ",12-1038

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why shouldn't there be?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, why shouldn't there be?  I take what you're saying is that their claim is, look -- you called it claim scope or something.  What did you call it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Claim coverage.  They say: We have a product and it doesn't violate the patent for the reason that the claims in the patent don't cover it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you want to call that a claim coverage.  I would call it no infringement.  Call it what you wish.  But the fact is there are -- and moreover, you couldn't bring a counterclaim because he's already agreed that if he loses his suit, he'll pay you the money.  So there's nothing to claim for.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, I know.  Now, all that's true.   Stephen G. Breyer  But nonetheless the fact is in many claims -- in many instances, though perhaps not yours, this kind of claim, i.e. that person's patent does not cover my product--   Stephen G. Breyer  --is actually a way of saying whether your product infringes the patent, one way of saying that.  So their point is, call it what you wish, but where you have a claim which amounts to a claim that my product does not infringe his patent, the rule that should apply is the person who owns the patent should have to prove that the claims do cover the product.  And there are a lot of good reasons, et cetera, that they put in their brief why that should be so.  It's easiest for the patentee to know in what respect it violates the claim.  Normally, a patent, being a monopoly, should not have too many advantages beyond the scope of the monopoly.  And we don't like false patents because that -- you'd have different results in the same kind of patent with different people depending upon whether in some other instance your client brought a suit or whether this was -- I mean, you've read the arguments.  So looking at those functional arguments, is there any answer that you have to their point other than cases in different subject matters where burdens of proof did shift?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, how -- what do you do with the government's argument here, which I take it as being on page 17, they make an argument which, as I understood it -- which is a big qualification -- the -- the -- some of these things are awfully complicated.  You might have a -- a claim or really, it's a set of claims that cover 48 pages with all kinds of symbols in -- in 42 different sort of division possibilities.  And then the -- the so-called infringer or the person who falls outside the coverage is looking at his product, and it's one of the most complex things you've ever seen.  And he has to think to himself, well, how -- how am I supposed -- how does the claim cover this?  And -- and it's -- there are many, many, many possibilities.  I take it that's what they mean when they say it makes sense to put the burden of demonstrating how the claim limitations map onto the accused product, because infringement may be found only when the product falls within the scope -- scope of the asserted claim or claims in every respect.  Your client, who's the patentee, knows that; otherwise, he wouldn't be bringing this infringing suit or the inside-the-coverage suit, or responding to someone who says it's outside the coverage.  But -- but the person who is the alleged infringer might not know it, and therefore, it makes sense to put everything in the same place; notice of infringement, burden of production, burden of proof.  And that way, it will be easier to focus on what's at stake.  That's what I take it their argument is.  If I've not got it right, you're certainly--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  But do they have to tell them?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They always do?   Stephen G. Breyer  So that's a good point.  So what you're saying is that page 19 or whatever I quoted is a made-up thing which doesn't ever never really exist in your experience.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because the first question would be, well, you tell me how -- how this infringes.   Stephen G. Breyer  So you're saying I don't really care about what is an action where there is an infringement action or there even could be one in the circumstances before us, that's not my case because they're going to pay me forever if they lose this declaratory judgment, so there's no shift.  And where there's no shift, you ought to follow the rules for where there's no shift, which is that the burden lies on the person bringing the suit.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's your argument.   Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I see.   Stephen G. Breyer  And your argument is that the horribles don't exist because the one on page 19 never has come up, and as far as the no -- no res judicata, I don't care because I'll come to the same result with a different means.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And any other -- is there any other -- is there any other practical point that they brought up that you want respond to?   Stephen G. Breyer  But you would agree with this.  You would agree that if that agreement of yours read a little differently, MedImmune -- if they had said, we are not going to pay royalties until your client brings an infringement suit, which you intend to do, at that point, if you'd made that promise, you would have the burden of proof, because you'd bring an infringement suit.   Stephen G. Breyer  And if they said either an infringement suit or a declaratory judgment action, then again you would have the burden of proof, even in the declaratory judgment action because then they would be totally parallel.  I mean, then you'd have, if you brought the infringement suit, it's yours.  And then in the declaratory judgment action, it could be true too, in your view.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean--   Stephen G. Breyer  --The answer is yes or no.  The answer is yes or no.  That is, am I right in understanding your argument that if that agreement had said you can bring either kind of suit, either we, yes, we the patentee, will bring a suit, in which case you will defend it; or if you bring it first, you can bring a declaratory judgment action.  Okay?  For the same thing.  If it had said that and the agreement had held up the royalties until one or the other was decided, then your client the patentee would have the burden of proof in either because it's exactly the same thing.  You could have brought -- are you following me?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Skip it.  [Laughter]   ",12-1128
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  How far do you want to go in your concession?  Would you want to concede this point that imagine the State has two groups of people and one group feels what the other is doing is terribly wrong.  And the second group feels, We absolutely want to do it.  And everyone is in a fragile state of mind, and they want to, if possible, at least one group wants to sort of shout as loud as you could at the other, Please don't do this.  And the other says, Please leave me alone.  And we are not saying which group is which; the analogy is obvious, but I keep all the titles out.  Does the State have the right, in your opinion, to say, It's tough to referee this, we see the potential for real harm on one side or the other, so we're going to have this kind of 35-foot boundary?  You want to concede that and say, okay, but the evidence here didn't doesn't justify it, or do you want to fight that, too?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But now you are into the details.  I want to know about the principle.  I mean, I can imagine the principle applying special care and need must be taken outside of hospitals for veterans, even though there are some who are very much opposed to the war, because these people will be coming out, they'll be in wheelchairs, it will be terrible.  And others thinking -- you know, we can think of many, many situations, irrespective subject matter, where there is a need for such refereeing.  And I just want to know if the -- if the concept is okay with you or if not.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  With the details.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you see now why I am trying to narrow it?  Because in my case, in Schneider, I thought it was pretty important that the demonstrators were behind a hill somewhere and the police restricted where they could go.  Many states have enacted similar laws, and I thought that's important, because maybe it would have come out differently.  I mean, you could argue about it, and I could.  So I'm trying to narrow it.  I'm trying to see to what extent do I have to look at this particular set of facts, in which case we are into the hearings, et cetera; and to what extent is there a matter of very broad principle here, and any help you can give me on that would be appreciated.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So that -- now, at this point -- that was a better way of getting what I was trying to get at.  Just assume that there is -- let's look at the narrow part of the case, and let's assume that the Colorado case is right.  And this particular restriction is more a restrictive than Colorado in two important respects, which you've gone into.  Now, the reason that they did that is they had hearings in Massachusetts, and they discovered that the Colorado law didn't really work very well.  And so, what are we supposed to do?  Are we supposed to now go look at -- as long as those hearings are -- are legitimate hearings and they have good explanation on something like whether the zone is 8 feet and consensual or whether it's 35 feet and different amounts of sidewalk, depending on the nearness of the facility, when doesn't it become just up to them?  We can't -- we're not legislators.  We don't know the situation in Massachusetts.  We can insist upon a reasonable record.  But how can we do more than that on this detail?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you understand that.  We all understand that.  It's one thing to try to prove an intent on such matters, particularly when people are, in good faith, they're trying to explain it, and it's another thing to actually stop the congestion and to protect the interests of the woman who wants to have the abortion, may be in a fragile state of mind, and this kind of thing could interfere with her health, et cetera.  So there are two interests, one on each side.  We know 8 feet with the bubble is okay.  We're not sure about 35 feet, and they have an evidentiary record.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's why I just asked you that question.  It just happens that the police testify with some evidence and examples that the 8-foot bubble doesn't work.  And it also -- they have some evidence and reasons for thinking that if you want to have a conversation, you have to convince the woman to walk 10 feet.  I mean, the difference is about half -- you know, if you were near me, Price is near Colorado.  If we're over to where the first row is, we'd have Massachusetts, and -- and they have some evidence that we can't enforce this Colorado thing very well; it doesn't help.  Now, go ahead.  I want your answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not trying to put words--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I'd hear you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not denying the difference.   Stephen G. Breyer  I am asking you, we've now heard different characterizations of the record.  I didn't mean to characterize it.  I want you to explain what it is in the record, from your point of view or lack thereof, that means that the Constitution intervenes to prevent Massachusetts from doing it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What kind of--   Ian H. Gershengorn  Justice Kagan, the testimony is 22 feet from the entrance in Boston, 22 feet from the edge of the doorway to the edge of the -- of the buffer zone.  It is from me to the marshal.  It is not to the back of the courtroom.  It is -- it is an NBA 3-point zone.  I don't -- it is not the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But I understand you're saying the reasonableness of it.  [Laughter]  But go back to Justice Alito's first question.  Maybe we can make some progress here.  The regulation of labor is up to the NLRB.  All right.  Now, the NLRB does regulate picketing.  It does say what you can do and can't do, and the courts have reviewed that.  And you -- what standard do courts use when the NLRB decides, in its wisdom and expertise, well, the pickets can go here, but they can't go there.  You can do this, but you can't do that.  All of which have speech implications.  What standard of review do the courts use?   Ian H. Gershengorn  --Your Honor, I am not aware of the standard they use, but it is a--   Stephen G. Breyer  Are you aware of any case -- I'm putting it -- loading it because -- only because to show my ignorance of it -- where the standard has differed from the ordinary APA standard?   Ian H. Gershengorn  --I'm not, Your Honor.  I'm not aware of cases one way or the other.   Stephen G. Breyer  Should we create a new standard for reviewing this kind of regulation?  I think that's actually a serious question.   Ian H. Gershengorn  I don't think so, Your Honor.  Thank you.   ",12-1168
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I'd just like you to go back to Justice Scalia's question for one second.  I didn't hear the -- as he was saying that this case is not a protest case, it's simply about calm conversations.  And that is what I want to know if the evidence showed that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, the evidence upon which Massachusetts based its decision to go to 35 feet instead of 8 feet.  There were hearings.  Did the evidence show that what was involved was calm conversations between one person trying to counsel another or did the evidence show something else?   Stephen G. Breyer  What?   Stephen G. Breyer  Rather -- I note there's some people who are peaceful, in which case I would accept Justice Scalia's suggestion this is a counseling case.  But you've cited some other evidence that suggests there were other people who were screaming, pushing and shouting, which sounds like, in his characterization, a protest case.  And the reason that Massachusetts found it difficult to write a statute that distinguishes one from the other is?  Why do people write statutes that sometimes do not make these fine distinctions?  Why did they in this instance?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Could you have written such a statute that would have worked?   Stephen G. Breyer  To go to -- go back for a second.  I see that.  Is there anything in the record -- the obvious reason for a legislator, I think -- I did work in the legislature for a while as a staff member -- that you don't write these fine statutes is they won't work.  They have too fine a distinction.  The activity is commingled.  The activity -- all right.  Now, I knew you were just going to nod my -- your head as soon as I said that.  So I was trying to get you to say it in spontaneously if it's true.  Is there anything in this record that suggests that this is one of those cases where it's just too tough to say whether they're counseling somebody or whether they're screaming at somebody, whether they're pushing somebody or whether they're standing near them peacefully?  Is there any evidence in the record I could turn to that would suggest that?   Stephen G. Breyer  She can't say yes if it isn't there, because I'm going to ask her where because I want to read it.   ",12-1168
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  It's all right.   Stephen G. Breyer  What they are saying, I think the government's point is -- the other side is saying, and I don't remember the term of my property law.  What's the right term?  It's -- you grant to A, black acre to A and his heirs; it's a fee simple.  But it's subject to a shifting; it's subject to divestiture, subject to a condition subsequent.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It shifts the -- it shifts it back.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It could be.  There was a technical term they used to have.  But anyway, that's what they're saying.   Stephen G. Breyer  And they are saying that that's, for purposes of who owns the land, the mineral rights, it's treated as an easement.  But for purposes of deciding who it reverts to, it's treated as a fee subject to a shifting use or whatever you call it.  Subject to -- what did you say?  Subject to--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it's different in this respect.  It's different that there they were talking about who owns the mineral rights.  So for those purposes they say it's treated like an easement.  But for who gets the reverter, it's treated like a shift of the fee.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  We filed a brief here for the cities, and they point out that -- that, of course, there is reliance on your side; you're -- I believe you are absolutely right.  But they say there is also a lot of reliance on the other side, because cities have built highways, and they've -- or States have, and they've converted it to use under patents or under statutes that the United States gave them that right.  And all those are going to be invalid if you win.  So what's your response to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why -- why?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what about when 912 says when the railroad abandons a piece of the right-of-way, okay, it then says that the interest of the United States, with all right, title, and interest in the state of the United States shall be vested in the town that builds the highway.  But your point is, that's true, but where they previously -- where they have previous -- where they have given -- where they conveyed it to a private person, they didn't have any right, title, and interest, because on abandonment it was simply an easement.  And on abandonment, that goes to the property owner who owns the -- the land on either side.  Is that -- I mean, your point is that the United States didn't have any right, title, and interest on the abandonment unless the United States continued to own the property.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So that is your point.  They can't convey what they don't have.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, it would be the private parties that would have brought it up in Great Northern, wouldn't it?  And do you have any light to shed on the comparative amounts?  I mean, they're saying -- for all we know there are billions of dollars worth of takings claims that will come out where the highways run, and you're arguing, of course, any reasonable property lawyer would have relied on Great Northern to think it was just conveying an easement.  But, you know, I'm not a property lawyer, and so what actually happened matters.  And the amounts matter, at least to me.  And do you have any light to shed?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about on your side?  What about the possibility that millions of acres has been conveyed and there are tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of abandoned railroads that property lawyers thought went to the person who bought them, and run through somebody's house?  I mean, is that a figment of my imagination?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And you would say no, it isn't, and therefore I'm asking you is there any empirical support anywhere for how property lawyers have treated Great Northern, how much was conveyed, et cetera?  Anything you can say on that would be helpful.   ",12-1173
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I got that point.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Let me put it this way.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what are the numbers?  I mean, look, this is what I'm thinking.  This is property law.  It's not just a question of trying to work out what the case could or couldn't have stood for.  If I try to remember my property class, it vaguely was -- which was a great class, A. James Casner, real expert.  And he -- he, I think, said that when you convey subject to divestment, the -- something called season under the common law went to the recipient of the conveyance.  But if you conveyed an easement, season did not pass.  So in holding that it is an easement, you're holding there was no season, and therefore, it couldn't be a divestiture.  Now, whether that's true or not or I've misremembered it, I'd go back to Justice Scalia's question.  Is there a single example since the Doomsday Book, since Dadonis, since the Bracton on little to whatever it was.  I mean, in the history of the common law up to the present where a court has interpreted an ambiguous phrase, which doesn't say to grant an easement for one purpose, but not for the other.  There may be some, but I didn't notice any cited in the government's brief.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I said in any case at all.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, yes.  What is the case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is the case?  I'd like to read it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, but they had -- they had a different view.   Stephen G. Breyer  They didn't say it was an easement.   Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't read what -- it did?   Stephen G. Breyer  Which case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where do I -- where is it roughly in your brief?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, all right.  Well--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm surprised that -- but the -- if you think there are some, I'll get my law clerks to look--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Can you imagine or explain to me why a property lawyer worth his salt since 70 years ago or more, 1942, wouldn't have read that case and advised his client, who was buying the land, if the railroad abandons it, it's yours.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where is some evidence of that?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, not reasons.  I want to know if there's any authority, and then you can give me the reasons.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I see that they do and I certainly think bicycle paths are a good idea, but the problem that I see here is just what Justice Kagan is bringing up; that is, as I read this, I think there might be millions of acres in the last 70 years that have been conveyed.  For all I know, there is some right of way that goes through people's houses, you know, and all of a sudden, they are going to be living in their house and suddenly a bicycle will run through it, which isn't so bad, but I'm concerned about that, and your answer makes me more concerned--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --because you haven't suggested anything that makes me think there aren't millions and millions of acres involved.  Now, what are you going to say that disabuses me of that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly, because the lawyer would think -- when he reads the case of Great Northern, you think it's an easement.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So how much is that?  How much roughly is that?  How often has it turned out that there was a conveyance -- after 1942 there was a conveyance of an abandoned right of way by the United States to land that had been previously been granted to a private owner?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How often?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know you don't have good numbers, but can you give me a rough estimate?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I will say ten times as much reliance on the one side than the other side, is that totally wrong?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true, but when you talk about -- I mean, I went and read -- when I read -- I thought your brief was very persuasive and then I read Great Northern and I thought they have -- they are really quoting it correctly.  Here's what they said about the cases that you refer to like Stringer, The conclusion of the railroad was the owner of a limited fee -- which was the conclusion of those earlier cases -- was based on cases arising out of the 1871 Act, not the 1875 Act, and the change of policy in 1875 was brought -- was not brought to the Court's attention.  And then they say that conclusion is inconsistent with the language of the 1875 Act.  It's history.  And it's early administrative interpretation.  We therefore do not regard this earlier case as controlling.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I thought they said in the Stringer case.  Is that same as--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yeah, that's the one you were--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --That's -- that's basically my problem.  I guess you just don't have any specific things of what property lawyers were saying.  But those two cases are from the era of Stringer, and at that point, apparently, the Court thought it was a limited fee.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then you get -- they were all -- was any of them after Great Northern?   Stephen G. Breyer  So -- so then in Great Northern it comes along?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can you think of anything I can do about this?  It's a case, in my mind at least, where reliance interests on -- on a previous case in the property law area are important, and yet none of the briefs here really gives me a -- a reasonably concrete idea of how much reliance there has been.  And -- and--   Stephen G. Breyer  --So I'm somewhat in the dark.   Stephen G. Breyer  Doesn't Interior or some -- I mean, doesn't the highway -- aren't there people in the government who keep track of where the highways are built?   ",12-1173
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, '97.   Stephen G. Breyer  Sir, I don't want you to -- finish your argument if you had something to say on what you started out with in describing the plan.  You said there are three aspects.  The first aspect was you cut out anyone, any State that's contributing less than 1 percent.  You said the second aspect was that you used a metric of $500 per ton of NOx reduced, and you applied that to the States still in.  And then you said there were three, and you never got to three, and I want to be sure you do if you had that.   ",12-1182
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, they don't know exactly how to do it.  I mean, this is a tough problem.  So it sounds as if what you're making is a procedural objection here to which the government's point was, you're right, we'd all been talking about this.  We wanted to see what the States would come up with, so we look.  The States haven't come up with enough in our opinion; and so now we go to the Federal process and we put out our thing.  And you comment on that.  And then if you feel that their thing is no good, propose your own solutions again.  That's what he's saying.  But it's supposed to advance the ball.  So there is a procedure for the States to come in if they can come up with a better plan, that's what you've just heard, and so do it.  So what's -- what's arbitrary or capricious about such a system?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, they objected to it once.  Now they think it works here.  I mean, all the time it happens that people change their minds about how problems are best solved or they cite this problem's better solved one way and better another way.  So if your only point is once they did it a different way, they'll say, well, what's unreasonable about changing our way?  We're trying to get the job done.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, years and years, the neighbor board, the labor board decided things in adjudications, rules.  One day they say, no, we think we should preside rulemaking processes like other agencies.  Does anything in the law prevent that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But they may not know, you know.  They may not know.  There's six States that contribute to the seventh State's pollution, and how much each State can cut back depends.  It depends on what it costs.  It depends on how much they contribute.  It depends upon what the other States will do.  It depends upon where the wind blows, and that changes all the time.   Stephen G. Breyer  So they have a tough problem.  They can't tell you exactly how much you should cut back until they know what they have in mind or what others have in mind for solving the problem.  So it sounds to me as if you're asking them to do the impossible, and they had a very good reason for not doing what they did before; namely, it would be impossible here to have a -- or not actually impossible, but very tough and very expensive.  So that's why, I gather, they went the way they did.  I don't know anything in the law that tells them that this statute was meant to force them to proceed in a way that would either be hugely more expensive and perhaps impossible.  What's your -- what's your reaction?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why is it wrong?  That is, I focused on your argument here in the briefs, which is very clear and very good.  And -- and the example that comes to my mind is we have an overgrazing problem in State A.  All right?  It's caused because cows come in from State B and sheep come in from State C.  The cow men and the sheep men are in different States.  They're not friends.  [Laughter]  Now, it turns out -- it turns out that EPA, which is in charge of preventing the overgrazing, discovers that if the sheep men build a fence, that will cure the problem, even though they only contribute half or maybe less.  Well, if we bury it -- you know, we divide it equally, you each have to pay -- you each have to cause half the problem because that seems fair, it's going to end up that the people in State A with the cows, they're going to starve to death.  So our choice is between taking two people, two States, each of whom cause half the problem and getting an overall plan where you solve the problem at minimal cost or just dividing it 50/50, which seems fair in mathematics, but leads to starvation, cost and death, et cetera.  Do you see what I'm driving at?  And that's what they've done here, the second method.  They -- rather the -- they're not treating each State alike, you are right.  And the reason that they're not treating each State alike is they know, one, all the States are partly responsible in more than 1 percent, and with this plan, we get the job done at much lower cost.  Now, where in the statute does it say they can't do that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  On that point.  Now, you remember, please, that -- that my cow/sheep example was meant to pick up precisely the disproportion that you're talking about.  And -- and keep that in mind, because I found it a helpful example.  Now, my point is: Did you find in Congress -- and I'm interested in legislative history -- did you find anything in the legislative history that suggests that where the EPA faces this kind of regional problem, and it's a regional, not just a statewide problem, that people in Congress thought they had an answer or a glimmer of an answer as opposed to taking this language which is pretty open and saying we're going to leave it to -- we don't know, we don't have a clue.  The EPA is there to figure this thing out and we're giving them the broad authority here.  Is there anything that cuts on your side that you see as opposed to the other side of reading this language?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but you're -- I mean, you want me to write -- look what I would have to write if I made it very specific.  Two units floats over the air from the cow State.  Two units floats over the air from the sheep State, or three.  It happens that if we treat them alike we're going to tell the cow State, your unit is the same as the sheep State's unit, both make the same significant contribution, and we have to say that even if for you to remit your unit causes death and destruction, destroys your economy.  See, and I have to write those words to accept your argument, don't I?  Because--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Of course.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I'm trying to use the most -- I'm trying to use the most extreme words I can so that then you will either have to draw a distinction or something.  That's why I'm--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right, so there's an ambiguity here.  Because I mean, when you use the word ‶ amounts ″, I think it does help you.  Add the word ‶ amounts ″ to ‶ significantly ″ and I think that Justice Scalia's point might be -- he knows it better that I -- an amount is an amount.  An amount is an amount.  That's what you want to say.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  It is.  And then the -- the response is: Well, not always, because you say an amount, you're talking about a specific amount coming out of a State, and is the one, the cow one, as significant as the sheep one.  All right?  And that's, I think, where -- I think you hit the nail as to what the issue is.   Stephen G. Breyer  As in the answer is that some one point--   ",12-1182
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I see that.  But look, what you listed in your brief on page 17, which I think was nonexclusive: Willful infringement, litigation misconduct, inequitable conduct by the patentee in securing the patent, vexatious or unjustified litigation, bad faith, the assertion of frivolous claims and defenses.  And then you cite cases which say all of those in different instances have been sufficient either alone or together.  Well, why don't we just copy that?  Isn't that your view?   Roman Martinez  I think our view is that those are the kinds of circumstances--   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Do you want to add to that list, or to subtract?   Roman Martinez  --I think as long as the Court makes clear that that is an illustrative list that I think captures the kind of bad faith--   Stephen G. Breyer  You don't think it.  Where it comes from, which maybe you don't want to say, is the Senate report on the bill, that is similar to this one enacted in 1946.  Still, there are some of us who think that's a highly relevant consideration.   Roman Martinez  --We are comfortable saying that and we do say that and we think it's especially salient and worth relying on here, not just because it's the legislative history, but also because that same legislative history and that same gross injustice language was repeatedly cited and talked about in the 1946 to '52 cases.   ",12-1184
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why does it always have to be objectively based?  I've read enough cases in this area to be able to approach it as a district court judge who's not expert.  I patent the following: For a computer, enter somebody's name.  Ask phone number.  And they'll give you the phone number if you put in the right city.  That puts a list in the computer.  They can patent that?  Well, you add a couple of things and they apparently -- you can have an argument that they can patent it.  Okay?  Because it'll be very abstract language.  It will be able to patent almost anything.  No, you can't finally, but objectively baseless?  Patent attorneys are very brilliant at figuring out just how to do this.  So we're never going to have attorneys' fees in a suit if that's your standard.  But you could couple that with just barely over the line.  What line?  This vague line, no one knows what it is.  In addition, all they did was say: We don't want to go to court and cost you $2 million.  Please sent us a check for a thousand, we'll license it for you.  They do that to 40,000 people, and when someone challenges it and goes to court, it costs them about 2 million because every discovery in sight.  Okay?  You see where I'm going?   Stephen G. Breyer  And so I do not see why you couldn't have an exceptional case where attorneys' fees should be shifted.  But if I'm honest about it, I cannot say it's objectively baseless.  I can just say it's pretty close to whatever that line is, which I can't describe and look at all this other stuff.  Are you going to say that I can't shift?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know, but I -- of course it may be a small slice of litigation, but it is a slice that costs a lot of people a lot of money--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and so I would like to know if I do run across that small slice why cannot I, the district judge, say, I've see all these things, taken together they spell serious injustice, and therefore, I'm shifting the fees.  Okay?  Why can I not do that even though, as I've just said and repeat, I cannot in honesty say it's frivolous given the standards for patenting that seem to be administered?   Stephen G. Breyer  Not nothing there.  It's highly abstract language.  I gather you, like I, have read some of these claims.  They are very hard to understand and when you get to the bottom of them, the abstract nature of the language, plus the fact that it has something to do with computer input, plus the fact that, you know, you suspect very strongly it's baseless, but you really don't like to say something that isn't true and you can say, well, I could see how somebody might think there was something to this claim, just in that tone of voice, which you can't write down that tone of voice.  You see?  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  You see the problem.  I don't see why--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, let's send it back and tell them that they were imposing a standard that was too narrow, that didn't take count of all the circumstances where something could be unusually unjust, and then let them, no clear and convincing, but it's up to you, district judge.  You're the expert on litigation.  You decide.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's true, but you could then appeal.  I mean, you're making an argument on the merits there.  And really the question is, is who's better suited to figure out whether this is a -- whether this is a really special case.  And if, you know, of course, you're right.  Plaintiffs are often right in these things, and sometimes they are wrong.  So it costs everybody a lot of money.  So you go to the Federal Circuit and ask them to review it for an abuse of discretion.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but the -- the difficulty here, I not -- see it from my point of view for a second.  Of course I think that -- that there's no plaintiff/defendant necessary difference of who can act badly.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And -- and so the question is really who is likely most to know.  And I think probably the district court.  But then if you give the power to the district court, there's a problem, of course, that you'll abuse it.  So I say, Well, then go to the Federal Circuit, and say they have.  You see, well, there's another way of approaching it, and that is have definite standards, which is what you want.  And then the difficulty with definite standards is I can't think of a set of definite standards that doesn't do what you don't want to have happen, that it leans one way or the other.  I mean, it looks as if, you see, the Federal Circuit's current standards leaned pretty much against the person who was sued.  And it looks like the -- the -- and so the government comes up, Well, we can't do better than this.  It's a long list.  And -- and nobody has been able to think of some, so then I say, Okay.  Let's try the first approach, which is what we do with the Lanham Act.  That's the whole long story.  And what you would like to say, I'd like to listen.   INTERRUPTING ",12-1184
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But suppose you have a--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Suppose -- I mean, we have a brief, as you've seen it, from the truck drivers, and -- and they say they don't give many of these benefits to anybody.  And suppose they do, though, give a benefit to a truck driver who has driven over a particularly difficult mountain pass, you know, where -- and gotten himself in some danger.  Now, the -- the -- the harm or the disability is lifting precisely the same.  It's just that the source was different.  You see, this came from taking a -- some truck that -- doing something special with it, and, again, it's a kind of most favored nation problem.  I don't know that source gets you out of it.  Is -- is what do you say about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I don't know that it's idiosyncratic, you see, because I don't know all the workplaces, and I can imagine that employers have all kinds of different rules for different kinds of jobs.  And -- and is -- are you saying as long as there is one job in respect to which, let's say, they give them benefits of $1,000 a week when you're hurt on this job but not on others--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --then do you have to give them to all pregnant women who hold different jobs?  Now, I think the answer to that must be no, but the problem for that and for you is how do you distinguish your situation from that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not a single.  There's a class of people.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I see -- I see that that now, it sound the other question I have, and it's the only other one, is it did seem to me there is a way, given your theory it's a quite easy way for you to win, and that would be to bring a disparate impact claim, and that's what I thought disparate impact claims were about.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you didn't bring the disparate claim and, therefore, what am I to do because I don't know that you want to twist the disparate, you know, intent claim out of shape when you have such a beautiful vehicle to bring a claim of the kind you just articulated.   Stephen G. Breyer  You can win your case with that argument, perhaps.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, assume that.  But that isn't going to help me, which I'm rather selfish about.  [Laughter]  Because my -- my job here is to write what this statute means for a lot of cases.  And writing the words, what it means is if you give a lot of benefits to a lot of employees, but not to the pregnant women and you don't give it to some employees and not to the pregnant women, and the employer says, look, pregnant women are like the few we don't give it to, not to the lot we do give it to, employer, you lose.  But by the time I've written that into the U.S. Code, nobody knows what I'm talking about.  Do you understand?  I -- I need to know how to interpret the words such that they would do, in your view, what you want them to do, which is just what I said.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But unfortunately, it takes out of what you just said the fact that you give them to a lot of employees.  Because you could have a most favored nation that was two employees--   Stephen G. Breyer  --including those who've only worked there for 4 years.  A huge seniority.  So -- so those are the words that I'm--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but you start -- you've got -- at the very beginning, you listed three things that you said were reasonable distinctions.  Because the word I'd like you to focus on is “ other workers ” and the problem is which other workers?  Because it is easy to construct hypothetical cases where the work -- the employer treats some other workers the same as the statute and doesn't others.  And which distinctions are reasonable and which ones are not, and how do we tell?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's the -- that's -- I used the idiosyncratic example, not because I'm interested in it, because I think it illustrates something that isn't idiosyncratic.  And what I use it to illustrate is the fact that, as here, employers will have classes of people and the classes may be based on all kinds of different things.  But this is a case where there are classes and some get the benefits equivalent to the pregnancy and some don't.  And how are we supposed to tell which are the criteria that are consistent with the statute and which are not?  That's what I found as the difficult question in the case.  And that's why I ask it using the idiosyncratic, simply to illustrate what I think is the problem.   ",12-1226
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But you don't know where the I -- would like just to go back on this very point to what Justice Kagan said.  Now, the McDonnell Douglas test, I think, should come in somewhere.  That is the -- the woman shows that, I'm pregnant, I couldn't lift, I wasn't paid anything, and other people who had comparable inabilities were paid.  And so we get to, was I qualified like they are?  And now a distinction is being made.  The employer says, no, you are not because you didn't drive over the mountain pass.  Or, no, you are not because you got it off the job.  And then we have to decide is that a pretext?  Is it legitimate?  And where they are giving it to everybody else and there are very few, it doesn't sound too legitimate.  But that test must come in.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so -- and so how does it and does it matter if we put it under the first socalled whatever, you know, intentional as opposed to disparate impact?  Will we muck up the law were we to say it goes in that part rather than the other part or both parts?   Stephen G. Breyer  But why not if it goes under disparate treatment?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?  Because, of course, the employer will always have a facially neutral policy.  It just turns out that this facially neutral policy happens to hit the pregnant women and four other people.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I mean, that -- that's the kind of thing that we're trying to stop in this statute.  So -- so why not bring it in there, in the disparate treatment part as you say?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So why shouldn't there be a trial on that or further proceedings?  If it turns out that they're right that there were four people who weren't pregnant, and that's all, who didn't get the benefits, that's pretty strong evidence that the employer is discriminating.  If there were 400,000 people who got the thing off the job and there were only, like, 19 people on the job who got the benefit, well, then you have a better case.  So why don't we have to look at the facts?   ",12-1226
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I'm just trying to get to what you're arguing about.  And I might be off base by now.  I feel like handlers, purchasers, raisins, like an old Abbott and Costello movie.  I just want to see if I'm right.  Tell me.  Just say you're wrong and I don't go into it further.  There -- there are some people, they've been -- they are either -- they have some raisins, all right.  And these particular people, whom the Department has said have acquired the raisins, it said they acquired the raisins.  And so they're there with some raisins, and then the Government says: Do this thing with your raisins.  And they don't want to do it, so they don't.  They don't do it even though the law says do it.  And then they say the law is unconstitutional and, moreover, you fined us a huge amount of money and we don't want to pay it because the law is unconstitutional, and we consider that money to be paid.  Call it a fine, call it what you want.  We consider we shouldn't have paid it and now we want it back and we want compensation and we think it's a taking and where do we go.  Can't we make that argument in the Ninth Circuit?  It's something like that; isn't that what we're arguing about?   Stephen G. Breyer  But not quite.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, okay.  So we shouldn't have to pay because this is all unconstitutional.  And -- and now what's your argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  And then the Ninth Circuit says go to the Court of Claims.  And you say no, we don't have to go to the Court of Claims.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All I was trying to do was to get you on the basic argument, which you started with, which is why is there -- why was the Ninth Circuit wrong when they said they had no jurisdiction to hear this, that rather, they had to go -- you had to go to the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   ",12-123X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, but there's a similar -- i mean, it seemed to me, again simplifying, that underlying this their clients think this whole raisin program is unconstitutional.  What it does is it takes raisins that we grow, in effect throws them in the river.  And in the thirties, that was done to raise raisin prices.  And they think as a matter of policy that just hurts people by raising prices, and as a matter of constitutional law it takes raisins from some people that belong to them and uses them for this bad purpose.  Okay, that's their view of it, something like that, isn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  So they're making that kind of constitutional claim.  Now, I would think if all you told me was that and I knew nothing about all these statutes, I would say that's the kind of claim that should be made in a Federal district court, period, not the Court of Claims.  Because their government isn't going to compensate them for anything.  That's against the whole point of the program.  Either this program is valid or it isn't.  And if it isn't, some authoritative set of courts should tell us that.  So I have a feeling this is somehow not a right fit with the Court of Claims.  Now, you explain to me why that purely instinctive feeling at this point is completely wrong.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The just compensation, I take it, in the program is supposed to come from the fact that raisin prices go up.  Whether the poor children with their noses pressed to the glass, because they can't pay the raisins, their parents are the ones who are paying the compensation.  And certainly not the taxpayer, he's not going to pay it, and maybe the other producers will pay some who get gypped or something, I don't know.  But I can't believe that Congress wanted the taxpayers to pay for a program that's going to mean they have to pay higher prices as consumers.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  No, it doesn't go to the merits.  It goes to whether or not it makes sense to think that the Court of Claims has something to say about this.  And suppose we did this.  Suppose we said, given the fact that you filed your thing, whatever it was, you know, late, and the -- and the light of this very enlightening discussion which has been helpful, we think that this is the kind of program and challenge to the program where there isn't going to be a remedy really in the Court of Claims and they ought to go ahead in the Ninth Circuit, and in light of all these enlightening things that we'll write, you just decide the merits of -- is that -- now, I'm sure you're going to say that's absolutely terrible, it won't work at all.  So tell me why not.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, we'd say -- we'll say given the way that we've talked about the program, perhaps it's best to consider this matter fully.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  What does the word “ acquire ” mean.  There is some opinion here which says these handlers acquired the raisins.  What is -- what's that about?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Like lessees or something, bailees?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I -- no, no.  I just wanted to know what the word “ acquire ”--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Now, can an acquirer of my car, for example -- I don't know.  Forget that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can they -- can they assert a takings claim attaches to the car?  It sounds like a standing question.   Stephen G. Breyer  But still, it might if they're acquirers -- but they are acquirers, okay?  They think this program is unconstitutional because it takes some other people's property, all right?  So those other people are in a very special relation to them.  Those other people are really close.  And it may be they have standing to assert those other people's claims.  And if they do have standing to assert those other people's claims, why can't they make the argument that way?   ",12-123X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So does this boil down to -- I mean, you have a one-year statute of limitations.  Now, I guess suppose Hurricane Katrina came along and threw all the documents away for two months.  I guess the Court could extend it, couldn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, I mean, don't they toll it when there's some -- when the courthouse burns down?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So you want to say, and that's also true when the person is actually innocent if you can prove that, delay it.  Is that what you're saying?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, he has his one year and he gives four criteria.  And the four criteria sometimes are not exclusive.  And you want to say yours is one of the times.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And a different one you say is when he's actually innocent.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If that's correct, then suppose that he purposely has delayed filing this until everybody's dead so they know they can't prove it anymore.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Breyer  The State is asking for a diligence requirement.  You admit that there's a requirement that -- that you have to not really use this as a sham device, so we're pretty close.   Stephen G. Breyer  But there is a sham -- there is a sham and deliberate delay requirement, not a diligence one, but there is a sham.  I'm not trying to trick you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What I'm trying to say is maybe we're arguing about something that we could solve.  That is, in fact, many of these people don't have lawyers.  They don't understand the statute of limitations, they don't understand what diligence might consist of looking later.  You agree that it's -- it shouldn't be a sham, shouldn't do it deliberately.  All right.  Now, if I'm thinking about that, how would you advise me to write it?   INTERRUPTING ",12-126X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So what do you say about the Twentieth Amendment, which says that that January 3rd was a meeting?  Are you saying they violated the Twentieth Amendment?  January 3rd.  This says the Congress of the United States shall meet on January 3rd every year, unless they appoint a different day.   Stephen G. Breyer  And they haven't.  And, therefore, they met in pro forma session.  Or do you think it wasn't a meeting?  And what do you think about the other part of the Constitution which says they can't adjourn for more than 3 days without the approval of the House, which they didn't have.  So are you saying that the Senate violated those other two amendments of -- the two parts of the Constitution, or are you saying that they have different meanings in the three parts?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So you're saying they violated.  But if that -- if they have pro forma sessions on January 3rd, they violate the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution.  You are saying that if they had a pro forma session on January 3rd, that since their meeting -- their recess was still on and lasted more than 3 days, it was a violation of that Adjournment Clause of the Constitution.  Now, that's one way to interpret it.  Over a long period of time, they have apparently met pro forma on those days.  Or we could try to make them mean the same thing, which would mean it was up to the Senate.  They consider that a meeting, it's a meeting.  What do we do?   Stephen G. Breyer  Would you write that opinion, saying the Senate of the United States has violated two -- two provisions of the Constitution?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Why not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Would it -- would it -- I mean, that's my basic question really.  Why is this an important case?  I see what you're saying on this one.  That's fine for an answer.  Thank you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What my really basic question is why is this an important case, in your opinion?  Now, you've said, oh, because there are thousands of recess appointments.  Not on the happen clause.  You've listed 7600 or so, really, on the recess part, but on the happen clause, you've only been able to find 102.  And moreover, we've had an example of -- where this Court, for better or for worse, said that two members of the board is not a quorum, and we got some more members, they dealt with the problem.  They ratified all those opinions, they dealt with it.  It didn't take them too much time.  So -- and we have different political parties taking absolutely opposite sides, it seems to me, or some members thereof, depending on the political party of the President.  And we have a clause that had to do with the Constitution and the problem of intra -- inter-session recesses when they were 7 months and nobody could meet.  Okay, that isn't true anymore.  So, explain to me.  I'm not saying you're wrong.  I just want to hear from your mouth why this is an important case?   Stephen G. Breyer  The most surprising thing to me that you have said, and it's important, is not just the view of language at the time of the framing, but what the purpose of this clause was.  I mean, this is a very well-briefed case, and I have looked at them.  I have read them, actually.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  I cannot find anything, so far, and I may have missed it -- I'm asking -- I can't find anything that says the purpose of this clause has anything at all to do with political fights between Congress and the President.  To the contrary, Hamilton says that the way we're going to appoint people in this country is Congress and the President have to agree.  Now, that's a political problem, not a constitutional problem, that agreement.  And it was just as much true of President George Bush, who made six appointments that happened previously, as it is with President Obama, who's made four.  All right?  So -- so where -- and he says this clause is a supplement, a supplement, to the basic clause to take care of the timing problem.  So, what have I missed?  Where is it in the history of this clause, in its origination, that it has as a purpose to allow the President to try to overcome political disagreement?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if it isn't a purpose, can you give me an example where the language, particularly that word “ happen ” -- I mean, your example is a good one but I don't think it applies, but that's a different matter.  I can't -- the language is over here.  The number of appointments on “ happen ” is few.  If you are worried about James Tobin, Congress has passed a law that can be taken as looking at a vacancy occurring when it occurs within 30 days of the beginning of the recess, which would have taken care of Tobin.  So look at the language difficulty.  Look at the comparatively small practice in that area.  Look at the other ways to get around the problem, and then give me another example in the Constitution where you have both language and purpose pointing one place and yet this Court because of practice has come to the opposite conclusion.   Stephen G. Breyer  “ Happen ”?  Of course battles happen.  That's because battles occur over time.  Give me an example with the word “ vacancy ”, where that word “ vacancy ” is used with the word “ is ” but not “ occurred ”.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But just give me an English example from its natural--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Your statutory example has to do with a battle, not a vacancy.   Stephen G. Breyer  A financial emergency, correct.  I'm sorry.  I'm asking you for an example with the word “ vacancy ”.  That's what I am having trouble with.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not talking about -- I just say, could you find an example, and I'm gathering from my answer you couldn't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and I couldn't either.   Stephen G. Breyer  One reason they could have put the language in is because they were afraid otherwise the president would have the power, simply, when somebody died two or three years before and they've had a big fight in Congress to save up all the controversial nominations and then put them through as recess appointments.  That could be one thing they didn't want to happen.  I don't know.  You see, it's the same problem.  Same problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's the end of it, exactly the same, if this all took place during the 9-month inter-session recess in 1835.     It would be the same unless the Senate chooses to recess.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no.  Exactly, same facts.  Same facts.     Right.   Stephen G. Breyer  And, therefore, in your view, the clause, even if they were all scattered to the winds in 1835, there would have been not possible for President Andrew Jackson, if I have that right, to make the recess appointments.     Justice Breyer, the executive at the time could have attempted to construct the same type of argument that the executive is trying to construct here--   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  But your view would be that the Court should reject it.     --Yes.  But -- but here, it is even a weaker argument because one of the oddities of the case is that as the Senate has -- and the country have all moved into the modern age, the rules of the Senate tend to provide for the Senate to be available at the drop of a hat.  If you look, for example, at Rule 9, you can always get, you know, the communications from Houses -- from the House or from the executive.  If you look at Rule 26 of the Senate, committees can meet whether or not the chamber is actually in session.  You know, the business of the Senate is ongoing; and therefore, in the modern world, it is even much, much, much different than even the hypothetical that you posited.   Stephen G. Breyer  You can say anything that would -- on this, if you want to, that would turn it back to the practicalities.  Imagine, hypothetically, that I would have thought President Theodore Roosevelt acted unconstitutionally when he tried to make all of his appointments, dozens and dozens, during a two-second--     In 1903.   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, yes -- inter-session--     Yes, constructive recess.   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, yes.     Well--   Stephen G. Breyer  And by converse reasoning, the Congress would not have been able, in 1835, to prevent recess appointments simply by having a nearby senator show up for a -- for one second, once every 3 days, over a 9-month period.  It seems to me what goes around comes around in this -- in this--     --Well, let me -- let me take that as an opportunity because I think it does raise, you know, the question to speak to the implication that the Solicitor General makes in his brief, that the Senate, as a body, doesn't have a view on whether it was in recess or in session.  For the reason that I started out by outlouding -- by outlining -- excuse me -- the Senate's official records do show that the Senate was in session on each date, and therefore, the Senate does have an official view.  But from the practical point of view, we do know that the Senate has a view on these things.  And how do we know?  The president's party controls the Senate.  If the Senate wanted to recess, Rule 22nd of the Senate says that's not a debatable proposition.  If a majority of the Senate wants to recess, even before the evolution of the filibuster, non-debatable proposition.  So the Senate says, which is controlled by the president's party, says, we want to recess, we want to go away, we don't care if the president has this power.  They vote for that.  House says no.  What happens then?  Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, the fight goes to the president, and it is in that event that the president gets to adjourn them until such date as he shall see proper.  So if the Senate had any view that it wanted to recess, they could have had a vote, and the issue would have ended up in the White House, in the lap of the president.  He had plenary constitutional power to give himself an inter-session recess by terminating the session and have a real recess appointment power if he could find somebody whose vacancy had actually arisen at the time.  But this is the cockeyed way of going about the instruments of the Constitution.  There is no power in the Constitution to use the Recess Appointments Clause to overcome the opposition of the Senate to the president's nominees.  And for all that we hear about today, which has to do with how the heaven will fall, and the parade of horribles, there is no parade, and there is no horrible.  The only thing that will happen is that the president, heaven help us, will be forced to comply with the advice and consent that the appointments power -- excuse me -- the Appointments Clause actually calls for.  That was not viewed as an evil by the Framers.  That was what the Framers unanimously agreed was going to be the principal means for appointments for the principal officers of the union.   Stephen G. Breyer  The question of reports.  There were reports, remember?  Sorry, I didn't mean to -- your six minutes couldn't be up already.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but I'm focusing on 30 days and the reason I'm doing that is this seems to me, hypothetically at least, a real matter for the political branches to resolve among themselves.  Now, we have to decide this, so I thought, well, why not look and see what Congress objects to the least?  And I got that 30-day thing from the Pay Act by analogy.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So I want to get your view on that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm really interested in how you think the 30-day idea, if practical, plays out in terms of your concerns.   Stephen G. Breyer  Briefly.   ",12-1281
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What happened in that period at around 1970 is that's about the first time that you have intra-session -- an intra-session recess that's longer than an inter-session recess.  And so now if we look from 1970 on, that's fairly common.  And so all that's happening is that the Presidents are appointing recess appointees during periods where they are out for a longer time.  Now, how are we supposed to go and say that this thing -- thousands of people on the recess part -- is unconstitutional?  I mean, it isn't unheard of.  What about the Due Process Clause?  Does that easily cover the language?  Substantive due process?  What about the Interstate Commerce Clause and the doctrine of, you know, the Implicit Clause there?  I mean, it isn't unheard of that over time language in the Constitution takes on a somewhat different meaning.   Stephen G. Breyer  How do we -- I mean, probably different judges have different approaches.  But if I'm concerned about the basic practicality and the basic objective here, why would I agree with you?   Stephen G. Breyer  What if I do place more weight on this?  Should we -- I mean, I do believe and agree with you on this point that this is basically a matter of politics for other branches basically.  That doesn't help me resolve this.  But it does lead over to this possibility.  Congress did pass the No Pay Act.  Then it passed the Pay Act.  And in that Pay Act on this “ happen ” part, which I think is the strongest -- very strong for your side, but it defines the vacancy in terms of 30 days prior to the recess.  That would take care of most of these.  You see, if vacancy could be defined as something that stretches, because Congress says it stretches in terms of pay for 30 days.   Stephen G. Breyer  What do you think of that?  And I would love to know what the SG thinks of that.   Stephen G. Breyer  The third question, by the way, and I just put in your mind, if you digress in your answer, put in your mind what would have happened in 1830 if someone, when they had a 9-month recess, close to 10 months, someone had the bright idea, well, you live near Washington; go show up at wherever we are holding our sessions and sit there for 5 minutes, and we'll stop President Andrew Jackson from making recess appointments.  What would we be saying then?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Actually, I think I remember what they were--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and they were 1483 and 1490-something, and then there was an asterisk that said “ obsolete ”.  [Laughter]  And in fact -- in fact, I couldn't figure out what they were talking about.   ",12-1281
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why, by the way -- I mean, I guess the ones that increase the statute of limitations, do they apply too?  It doesn't say anything about them.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can I just take exactly your words, and I fill in, instead of ‶ tolling ″, ‶ laches ″.  So?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  But I mean now what you're talking about is custom.  You're not talking about language.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because the language sounds to me like the same.  And so then I'm obviously going to ask you if the court -- courthouse burns down or fraudulent concealment or -- you know, there are dozens of -- not dozens, but there are quite a few such doctrines.  And why would we apply those and not apply the shortening ones too?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's not surprising, because to show laches, you have to show unreasonable delay plus reliance.  So normally, it won't be unreasonable within a limitation period, but this is a unique statute.  The uniqueness is not in the words, but in the facts.  And therefore, the uniqueness is that it's rolling.  And as long as you have a movie that's going to make money over 30 years, in year 33, they bring an action against something that didn't happen till year 30.  So when the government comes in and says, oh, we'll just allow it as a defense, you know, to law but not to injunction, law here has the same effect as an injunction.  If you just leave it up to the legal part, they can bring whenever they want as long as the movie is still making money.  And, therefore, it has exactly the same effect to let them -- they say, oh, you can't recover -- I mean, you can recover under law, you just can't have an injunction.  Who in their right mind would go ahead and make this year after year if a huge amount of money is going to be paid to this copyright owner who delayed for 30 years and didn't even seem to own it.   Nicole A. Saharsky  --Well, two -- two responses to that.  First, as a general matter, we think it makes sense for the laches defense to apply in -- in fashioning equitable relief because that is a place where judges are exercising discretion.   Stephen G. Breyer  I understand the words.  My specific question is: In the copyright area, as here--   Nicole A. Saharsky  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  --once you have given them the right to apply laches to an injunction, you have given them precisely nothing, because exactly the same thing will happen to them once you bring 15 legal actions, as if you gave them the injunction.  And if there is a difference there, I haven't been able to think of it yet.  So -- so I don't really understand the government's position in terms of the practice.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Okay.  In terms of the practical offense, the -- the Copyright Act statute specifies the particular remedies that are available and it's fairly clearly distinguished between legal and equitable remedies.  The legal remedies are actual or statutory damages, and those are limited to the past three years.  And then the equitable remedies are the profits of the defendant, the essentially unjust enrichment of defendant, and then as you mentioned, Justice Breyer, the injunction situation.  Now, we are not saying that if -- if a plaintiff has established copyright infringement, that it's an all or nothing on injunctions.  This Court recognized in eBay--   Stephen G. Breyer  You still haven't answered my question--   Nicole A. Saharsky  --I'm trying to.   Stephen G. Breyer  --which comes to the same thing.  You're giving me legal arguments.  You may be right in that.  I'll look into that.  But I'm saying in practice, no one in his right mind could go and continue to produce this movie when every penny is going to have to go to the copyright owner.  Not every penny that they spent, but every penny of profit.  And -- and who's going to do it?  Because every three years they face a lawsuit.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Well, that's what I'm trying to say is that I don't think that that would be the case if infringement were shown.  This Court, for example, recognized in the New York versus Kissimmee case, that in fashioning injunctive relief, it's not just that you give an injunction or you don't give an injunction, it could be the case that in a situation like this one, for example, the Court could say, I will allow the defendant to continue with these contracts that it has entered into to continue using this film as a derivative work, but I will pay a reasonable royalty or I will put forth -- call for a reasonable royalty to the plaintiff.  So there is some splitting of the difference available to the Court in fashioning equitable remedies.  So I don't think the Court--   ",12-1315
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I take it in the example that Justice Ginsburg gave, your position -- tell me if I'm wrong -- is of course the defense laches in principle applies, but the defendant will lose because the plaintiff did not wait an unreasonably long time.   Stephen G. Breyer  She waited a reasonably long time, for the reason that Justice Ginsburg gave.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I thought you might agree.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING ",12-1315
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  I mean, I could be your arbitrator.  I know exactly what I would do.  I would ask for five things, which will be admitted, and one thing that's going to be difficult for them to prove.  I don't see why an expert in antitrust would have to have this enormous report.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you want to concede--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, maybe.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you want to argue that stuff, which I -- then I guess maybe they're right.  Maybe you do need experts on that.  I don't know that we want to get into this, but I just want to know if you want to concede that there is no way to win this case in arbitration unless they spend $300,000.   Stephen G. Breyer  But suppose we answer--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --the question -- the answer is yes, a class action waiver can be enforced.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what are the circumstances here?  The record leaves us uncertain, we remand it for further consideration of what they are.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because that isn't the issue they decided, whether it could be enforced.  They decided whether you can -- whether the whole arbitration agreement could be enforced.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or you have to do without.  I -- you just said what -- I thought that the expert talked about litigation costs, not about arbitration costs.  So how is that handled?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You said you waived that point, whatever -- however it is.  You waived it.  Never raised it.  The Court of Appeals took it as if it were arbitration costs.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I believe you.   ",12-133X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Before you get to that, I have two questions.  One is on the point you've just made, because I -- I agree, I understand it is fairly well established, this doctrine, but I don't see quite how it works.  Suppose there's a Tyler claim, a Truth in Lending Act, you know, something like that, and the claim is a fairly -- it's worth about $10,000 or so.  And so the plaintiff says you violated the act, pay me the $10,000.  Now, he happens to come up with a theory that is really far out; and the more far out the theory, the harder it is to prove.  And the harder it is to prove, the more you need expensive experts.  And do we go case by case, saying, you know, you have a really weird theory that's going to require 17 experts and endless studies, you don't have to have an arbitration claim, or you don't have to follow it in this instance, but everybody else does.  Now -- now, is -- is that something, in other words, we're supposed to look at case by case, which would produce the odd result I suggested?  Or do we do it by categories?  How does the doctrine work?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, what I'll do, because I work with my own hypothetical, I'll have a far-out case, but yet not quite speculative.  In other words, what I'm trying to suggest is it's an odd doctrine that just says, plaintiff by plaintiff, you can ignore an arbitration clause if you can get a case that's expensive enough, and there we are.  I haven't seen it work, and I haven't seen enough to know how it does work.  And I guess you haven't either, but -- but I'm concerned about that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that sounds expert to me.  Now, Hovenkamp would be the person I would hire as the arbitrator.  So surely he does know -- or Phil Arita -- a blessed memory.  And they're under the instruction to get this done cheap.  Well, I think that might be possible.  That might be possible, because it's only the question of damages that's tough here, because if you don't have the double -- there's only one monopoly profit at the two levels, da, da, da, and we don't need to go through that.  But I can think of a way of getting it done pretty cheap.  But regardless, your expert here didn't talk about the cost of arbitration.  He did use the word once.  But as I read pages 88 through 92, it seemed to me he was talking about the cost of litigation, not the cost of arbitration.  And -- and I wouldn't proceed necessarily with all those reports he does to impress to the jury, or even the judge.  This is Phil Arita.  You don't need to impress him.  And -- so, so, so -- hasn't the Second Circuit looked, assuming your doctrine's in place, to the wrong set of costs: The cost of litigation?  Even though they use the word “ arbitration ”, that isn't what your expert told me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In arbitration or in court?   Stephen G. Breyer  Does he take into account the fact that the arbitrator can be him?  And moreover, could in fact work under an instruction to keep these costs down?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, that isn't the point.  If I were doing this offhand, I would say everything is conceded but for one thing: Since there is no double monopoly power, there is only one monopoly power at the two levels which can be exercised, the only way the person is damaged is if in fact you've raised entry barriers.  So you'd say to the plaintiff, how are you going to prove that?  And you'd read it and submit a report.  Now, I'm not saying this is the right way to go about it.  All I'm saying is it's hard for me to figure out on the basis of that affidavit, which talks about courts, why this has to be so expensive.  So what do I do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  One other thing which I didn't understand, and that's why I am asking.  What they chose as the remedy here was sever the arbitration clause if you want, it seemed to be, and go to court.  All right.  Now, I don't know where that power comes from.  So if you were going to improve this contract in the direction that you would like, why couldn't you sever the part about the confidentiality, or why couldn't you require -- you have some awfully big merchants.  Like, I don't know -- probably, you have maybe Costco, maybe Walmart, maybe -- you know, these people are not without money.  They're your client, maybe.  But -- go get these contributions.  Go for -- there are many ways you can treat this particular set of words in the arbitration clause, short of severing it entirely.  And -- and what about that?  What's your view on that?  What do you think?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There is no authority that I could find for the prop -- I mean, if in fact it costs you $10,000 to buy the arbitrator -- system, you know, you buy the system--  [Laughter]  Sorry.  But I mean, you know, hire -- whatever it is, if those are obstacles, it's pretty well established, I think, that that arbitration is not something that you can use to vindicate the Federal claim.  And the part that's bothering me about this, though, is that those aren't obstacles.  It's just you brought a very expensive claim.  And the real problem here is the reason they can go into court is they can get a class action in court.  And then this Court has said, you can't get the class action in arbitration.  There we have it.  So -- so the -- the question in my mind is, well, is there a way that some of the beneficial aspects of class action can be used in an arbitration that does not formally have a class action?  And there it seems yours is a good case, because a lot of them can.  You say, well, the one part that can't is getting this private information.  So maybe we should send it back and say, well, why do you need the private information?  On a good theory of antitrust, you're going to show that the price of the Tide product was higher than what it would have been had the entry barriers not been raised from the Tide.  That's a general entry question which I don't think you need private information from them to answer.  But that's -- and now we're really into the depths of the merits.  So I thought of sending it back and saying, let's -- let them explore this kind of thing about other ways of trying to get some of these advantages of class action into your -- you're going to say I'm too far out on this.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Expert costs.   Stephen G. Breyer  This is exactly -- I found no authority for the proposition that what hinders -- plenty of authority, you can't make the person go to arbitration if the fees involved are too high, because he's blocked.  But you're quite an advance over that.  You are saying the thing that keeps him out is his own theory of wrong, which will involve hiring a lot of experts and others.  Now, once that's adopted, it seems to me in practice we have reversed in many, many cases the proposition that you can in fact require Federal causes of action to be arbitrated, because all you have to do to get out of the arbitration is to allege a theory of your case which is hard and complicated to prove.  Now you are back in court.  Now that's a significant erosion, it seems to me.  So I want to know if you have any standard there, if we're just supposed to accept that, if in fact you are trying to reverse in practice what was the holding that you can arbitrate these Federal causes of action.  What is going on here?  And an addendum to that is if you are going to convince me, which you might, that, well, that's okay, do it, do it, do it, is it a possible remedy to monkey with the arbitration clause and provide for a sharing of costs, say if you win the loser will pay the expert fees, which is of course a much more pro-arbitration way than just throwing it out entirely?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's a long question, but do you see what I'm driving at?   INTERRUPTING ",12-133X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That comes under our basic thing -- as I read this, the difference was between this and Stolt-Nielsen, you have two parties here and they both say, arbitrator, you decide whether or not this language, that says nothing about it, did encompass class or not.  In Stolt-Nielsen the claimant, who wanted arbitration, agreed that the clause said nothing about it.  So, given his concession there, the only way it could have gotten in is if the arbitrator was doing some policy thing.  Given the lack of any similar concession here, the way that the arbitrator got it in is he read this ambiguous language, looked at the situation, and said, hmm, guess it's in.  Now, in the latter case, we should presume everything from the arbitrator's favor; former case, no, they've admitted that it wasn't in the clause.  Okay.  So, that -- now, what's the response to that?   ",12-135X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I don't think so.  I thought it said that -- that the award -- if the award displays manifest disregard, or words like that.  I mean, Misco is -- is not absolute.  Misco has a narrow exception, and that exception is where there's just no basis in the contract for the decision.  And so I thought you were arguing that here that's clearly not so, there is a basis.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's a different thing, that's a different thing.  It doesn't say whatever he says about the contract, he wins.  It says what he says about the contract, it is not just manifestly wrong, it isn't just plain language to the contrary, and et cetera.  There is language in the cases to that effect.  So I would be repeating myself, but are you saying there is no loophole no matter how tiny?  That's news to me.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Suppose I think, since I wrote the words in First Options, that something like manifest disregard or totally ignoring plain law is a ground for reversing an arbitrator, even an arbitrator.  Now, suppose I think that.  Then do I decide against you?   Stephen G. Breyer  Look, I'm going to say something and you are going to say, that's right, that's just what I wanted, and that won't do me any good if you don't think of it.  The arbitrator in front of me, so you better tell me why I'm wrong, because they certainly will and they are in the briefs.  Mr. Arbitrator, this class -- this language here says all disputes will go to arbitration.  It doesn't say they are supposed to be class or can be or can't be.  You decide what it means.  And the arbitrator thinks, hmm, all, hmm, it doesn't say, but I got to reach a decision.  So what kind of a case is it?  Small claims.  And then it says something about court suits where they have class.  Hmm, gets his magic 8-ball out and, whatever it is, he says, that's what it means.  It means it could include class, too.  Okay?  Where in our case law is that a manifest disregard?  He's looked at the language, there were two plausible constructions, he came up with one of them.  What's the problem?  Now, that's of course their problem, but if you just say yes and don't go into why they are saying no it's not going to help me.   Stephen G. Breyer  So -- obviously you don't.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Use whatever word you want.  Manifest disregard, stick to the law.  Now, suppose the arbitrator had said this: It doesn't say how to do it; I see how you do it; you get out a magic 8-ball.  Now, we would strike that down, because that is not relevant.  But he didn't say magic 8-ball.  He said class.  And there are many class arbitrations.  So it isn't quite magic 8-ball.  Now, you explain to me--   Stephen G. Breyer  --A magic 8-ball is you have -- that's a little thing, it's the -- it's a non-sportsman's equivalent of throwing darts.  [Laughter]   ",12-135X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Excuse me.  If you look at the history of it, it's certainly true that Congress did intend to get misdemeanor domestic felonies.  That's what they said.  And as it works out in the States, if you take the same definition in, there would be very, very few States with misdemeanors of domestic violence that would be covered.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I can't believe that Congress wanted to write a statute that did so little.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Some people who don't read legislative history don't know that, but if you did read the legislative history, you would see that they do want to have an effect with this statute.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, in your reading, what would it have accomplished?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I agree with you.  I agree with you on the tough -- what they were thinking.  But now what I want to know, and you've read all these briefs and -- and you've actually done a lot of work on this.  So -- so if you adopt your definition, you know, making them parallel, how many State domestic violent misdemeanor statutes, in how many States would this cover it, in your opinion?   Stephen G. Breyer  Please.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's true, and that's what I was trying to get at because it seems to me that some of the -- quite a few, actually, of the statutes that they cite have different categories and some of the categories would escape being covered by offensive touching and others wouldn't.  So I thought you might -- on that assumption, if you win this case, then how many States would be -- how many States would have written their statutes so generally that it wouldn't fall within the scope of the provision we are talking about in your opinion?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  When you say ‶ substantial ″, I mean, you've read all these and do you have he an idea of--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --You've thought about this question, so you must have some rough idea.  You could put a range on it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let's assume, just to help you for a change -- I mean, not for a change, you help a lot.  But the question in my mind is, can you imagine losing this case, hypothetically, just on a hypothetical, and that the Court were to say, just as Justice Scalia said, and the offensive touching does not fall within the definition of physical force, but touching that produces bodily injury does.  Now, were we to say that, then can you give me a rough answer to my numerical question?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  See, what we do is where it's -- where it's inseparable, where it comes in two separate clauses, then modified categorical approach applies.  And -- and that being so, the only States where domestic violence wouldn't be included would be those that have a crime and use general language that you can't divide in the statute and cover both bodily injury and defensive touching.  And are -- are there some such States?  There must be some--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, how -- now, just drawing on your criminal justice experience, say whether my sentence I'm about to utter is true or false.  That's what I'd like to know.  The -- the many statutes, which include in the same section, the physical injury and the offensive touching, such as Arizona, you intentionally or knowingly cause physical injury or knowingly touching another person with intent to injure, insult, et cetera.  What we will find when we look back at the record of the prior convictions, it will say charge Arizona revised statute 13-1203(a), pled guilty.  And we'll have no idea which it was.  And -- and that is a general problem with this area.  We'll have no idea.  Now, is that generally true what I've just said, or false?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then I don't see -- I think it is generally true, too, and I can't work this out.  I mean, we'll work it out, I'm sure.  But look, on the -- on the one hand, if you just can't know, as is often true, then on the one hand, you're not really picking up serious domestic violence.  You see where there was serious domestic violence.  And -- and although it was under a general charge and so the person has a gun.  Even did he really beat the spouse up and so forth.  Or on the other hand, you pick up the offensive touching, too.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what do we do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, yes.  So what is your view after all this practice in this area?  What would you recommend?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can you remind me of something which I -- if you interpret this broadly, to include battery, suppose you do it.  Then one consequence is that the person cannot later carry a gun, is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is it also the case that there would flow ineluctably an extra year 15-year prison sentence, or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  The only consequence is he couldn't carry a gun.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, you would say yes, contrary to your argument, the same words do mean something differently in the two sentence -- in the two sections.  Physical force means one thing for this purpose; the other for the other.  I'm not saying I would do that.  But just say if that happened.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if that happened, and you can defined the physical force in the misdemeanor section as much broader, would in fact there be a consequence for anyone, other than not being able to carry a gun?  I just want to have every possible consequence in my mind.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  It's different definition.  It's for the same word in the two provisions.  And that's what I want to be absolutely sure; there is no consequence other than the fact that you would not be able to carry a gun.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  There would be a penalty, but would it enhanced penalty.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It wouldn't be the extra 15 years you would get for violent felonies.   ",12-1371
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't -- I can't find -- it seems to me this has sprung, full blown, from someone's brain, but is not well embedded in any law that I could yet find.  That is the -- this is not meant to be rude.  I'm trying to figure out where this idea of the consent thing comes from.  After all, it apparently comes from our Korean treaty and maybe one other, but I can't find it in -- I can't find -- the question in the case is, is this particular agreement, namely an agreement to go to the court first -- shall we count it as that kind of matter as to whether this is arbitrable that goes to a judge?  Or rather is it that kind of procedural Howsam, Wiley type thing that goes to an arbitrator.  Now, we did our best I think to try to explain how to distinguish the one from the other in our precedent.  Now, you use different words.  You use these words about “ consent ”, which doesn't appear anywhere in this treaty, but I think you are trying to get at the same thing.  And if you are not trying to get at the same thing, why?  Why not?  What are you trying to get at?   Ginger D. Anders  Well, I think the reason that applying Howsam and its presumption that certain procedural-type requirements like notice requirements would be decided by the arbitrator, the reason that would risk subjecting a state to suit without its consent is that in investment treaties, what the states do is they say we will be subject to arbitration under certain circumstances.  But they also place limitations on their consent to that adjudication in order to satisfy important sovereign--   Stephen G. Breyer  So you suggest it was the State that said, Look, they don't say anything in the treaty, but it turns out, for purposes of counting time limits, filing a brief, they count Saturdays, but they don't count Sundays.  All right?  And the government says, quite sincerely: If we had known that they were going to do that, we never would have agreed.  I am trying to get an example of something that is as purely procedural as I can imagine, something no one in his right mind would think a judge, rather than an arbitrator, should decide.  But under your rule, you're going to say the judges decide that and not the arbitrators, and that is what is bothering me about your rule.   Ginger D. Anders  --Well, they decided them because the state sets forth in the treaty itself that these are limitations on their consent.   Stephen G. Breyer  By the way, in the treaty itself, you can have dozens of things, as was true of Howsam.  We will follow the UNCTAD, whatever that is, the UN or AAA rules, and you look up AAA Rule No. 1872(b) and it says just what I said.  Okay?  So now it's in the treaty itself, and why should that matter?   Ginger D. Anders  Because, for instance, what the United States has done in negotiating its treaties and free trade agreements for decades, in every one of these agreements is it has said: We need to limit the circumstances in which we.   Stephen G. Breyer  I have only found two, by the way.  One was Korea and I can't remember the second.   Ginger D. Anders  Well, we cited in our brief the Korea and--   Stephen G. Breyer  But in any case--   Ginger D. Anders  --and NAFTA.   Stephen G. Breyer  --you explicitly say, these are our conditions of consent, and you raise the question to me, you don't answer it.  Because suppose one of those conditions had to do with blue paper rather than white paper.  Suppose that they were just what I said.  Nobody still would think the United States was resisting arbitration on such a matter.   Ginger D. Anders  Well, to give you an example of a condition that we've actually used, NAFTA requires as a condition on the United States' consent to arbitrate that the investors, when they submit the claim to arbitration, they waive their right to pursue other remedies, and that satisfies a very important sovereign interests that we have and not being subject to parallel proceedings--   Stephen G. Breyer  So here you are putting yourselves, I gather, that the U.N. rules, the AAA rules, the scholars who file our briefs, the doctrine of competence-competence, whatever that might be, is in fact far broader than what they want.  It submits virtually every question of arbitrability to the arbitrator.  And the United States is taking a position quite contrary, I guess, to most of the world.   Ginger D. Anders  --I don't think that's correct, Justice Breyer.  What we are -- what we are saying is that when a position goes to consent whether it is fulfilled or not goes to whether--   Stephen G. Breyer  What's wrong with the House -- and I'm being a little defensive here -- but I didn't think there was the presumption you are talking.  I thought it said there's a presumption about that procedural rule, and I thought important language was the language that the Court has found the phrase, i.e., for the judge applicable in the narrow circumstance where contracting parties would likely have expected a Court to have decided the gateway matter.  Now, that, it seems to me, a little bit easier to work with then this notion of whether a state gave consent or didn't give consent or it doesn't mention it in treaty.   Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.   Ginger D. Anders  --I think in the treaty context, the state's parties are not agreeing, and they don't have expectations with respect to the allocation of authority between the court and the arbitrator.  What they do agree to are conditions on consent that limit the terms on which the state may be subject to arbitration.   ",12-138X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Everybody's getting to the same question, I think, but I haven't quite heard the answer.  Of course, you're right in many countries.  The question of arbitrability, that is to say, is there a contract is for the Court.  In an investment treaty, I can find a lot of authority that says whether this counts as an investment is a matter for the Court.  But the question in front of us, is this that kind of decision?  Is it one for the Court?  Or is it one for the arbitrator?  And to just summarize why it might be for the arbitrator, A, it's procedural but that's not sufficient.  B, it refers to UNC -- whatever it is -- UNCITRAL?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  It refers to their rules.  Their rules provide all matters of competence over the arbitrator.  The scholars have done exhaustive work saying most countries think that.  The Doctrine of Competence-Competence goes further.  And you also have the AAA rules which say the same thing.  So those are all against you.  For you is the position of the -- the item in the document, first and foremost.  All right.  I'm trying to summarize what I've got as the arguments for and against.  Now, what do you say to make me think there's even more for--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --So I agree that's not--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But those are not relevant.  I mean, those are relevant.  I'm saying they would farther.  And I think in what I've seen so far, it gives on certain kinds of procedural gateway questions, deference to the arbitrator, which is what is at issue here.  And now -- now I'm back to the same question.  What is your evidence from this contract that this is not the kind of gateway question that is for the arbitrator?   ",12-138X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  It is, but it -- really, if you have anything -- the definition is very broad.  I mean, it says  """"wages"" means all remuneration for employment. ""  All remuneration -- wages means all remuneration for employment paid basically for any service of whatever nature performed by an employee.  Now, I agree with you that it's the same definition for the withholding.  But Congress, it passes the withholding change with conflicting interpretations.  So it wouldn't be the first time that Congress passed a statute to say: We don't care what the conflicting interpretations are; ignoring that, you are going to withhold this money, period.  And it said, whether it's other than wages or not.  I grant you, they might have thought they had to pass it, but so?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We could also look at it as they didn't have to pass it.  It was subject to withholding anyway.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, no, there would have been a need, if different people think different things.  So you want to be sure.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, Congress does that quite a lot.  It -- it -- on certain, different people tell them different things.  They say, we don't care; do it anyway.  And that's what this statute basically says: Withhold anyway.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And maybe -- could we say that?  Could we say, well, in our opinion you are right.  Both statutes cover supplemental unemployment benefits.  It's never come up in the other context since this because Congress wanted to be sure it was withheld.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'll take it that you're right, that Congress that passed the withholding statute thought it fell outside of the definition of wages, but they were wrong.  Now, that wouldn't be the first time either.  So -- but Congress did think it.  So what weight am I supposed to give to what Congress thought then about what an earlier Congress, namely, the Congress that passed the wage definition in the withholding statute thought?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, yes.  But that was so much the more so, you see?  They had authority saying it wasn't wages.  That doesn't mean that authority was correct.  And -- and so that's why they passed the statute.   ",12-1408

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I see that.  But I don't understand why that matters.  That is, the -- I mean, I was thinking just what you said.  I was thinking well, I -- I dissented in the other case, but I lost, okay?  So I lost, I lost.  The -- the -- the point is that -- that you have a drug, and you say to the jury, well, if there were no warning here at all, then it would be unreasonably dangerous.  I think, yes, that probably applies to chemotherapy, it probably applies to Parkinson's, it probably applies to all kind -- but you see, says the defense, there is a warning here and it says how to use it.  And as you say, that would be not -- it would be despite or whatever it is, despite, not because.  But it seems to me in terms of -- it comes for the same thing, lots of drugs would be dangerous, too dangerous, unreasonably so without a warning.  Chemotherapy is what I'm thinking of.  But properly labeled they're not, and so that seems to be your case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because -- why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, in this case, they have to find that -- that no warning -- there is no such warning that could make a difference, that's what they're asked to find?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where is that?  That's -- I do see that distinction.  If, what you're -- but look, the complaint's filled with words about adequate warning, no adequate warning, no adequate warning, da, da, da.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now what you're saying is, is really what the jury found, nothing to do with adequate.  There is no warning in the world that anybody could have invented that would have made a difference.  I'll have to think about that one.  But in the meantime, where is it that that's what they said?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  How do I discover that you're right about this?  Because everything in the -- in the complaint that I've read so far seems to talk about the adequacy of warnings, not that there is no warning in the universe could possibly have made a difference.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How do I discover that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The second point is a different point.  The second point is, look, I have chemotherapy, it saves 100 and it kills 10.  All right.  If you have no label at all, a jury might find it was unreasonably dangerous, but once you put in the label explaining the whole thing, it doesn't.  It isn't unreasonably dangerous because of the situation, and they could perhaps wouldn't find it.  Now, you can call that diminishing or you could call it adequacy.  Call it what you want, but that seems to me to come to the same thing and is different from saying, no label in the universe would say it.   Stephen G. Breyer  We're talking about what juries could find and that's what -- and I don't know about Parkinson's -- I don't know what these drugs are.  That's why I said let the FDA say it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but then if you apply this -- what is deeply bothering me in all these cases, and it's why I came up with and said, the FDA has to tell us, you know.  Because just what you said before; what you say applies to sulindac also applies to 12 people who will tell the Mary Hitchcock Hospital up in Dartmouth that they can't use a certain kind of chemotherapy.  You see, you could in certain horrible cases find a very sympathetic plaintiff who really did suffer terribly.  And -- and -- and you are getting 12 people rather than the FDA.  So my solution to it, which you know, because you read Medtronics, may not work; but it's the best I can think of.  Now, what -- what -- you can tell me if you want, no, there is some totally different thing.  But what you are saying at the moment, what I do in my mind is I say, beware; because it's also true potentially of some of these life-saving drugs and that's what's worrying me.   Stephen G. Breyer  But even the compensation, suppose you had strict liability that Florida Avocado Growers could -- what they have to do, all they have to do since they can just be fined and the money would go to pay the consumers of California who have the unfortunate mixup sometimes of eating Florida avocados.  I mean, that would raise at least serious problems of -- commerce clause problems and preemption and so forth.   ",12-142X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's -- historically, I think, 40 States, many States have what was called a public action.  A public action is an action by any citizen primarily to vindicate the interest in seeing that the law is enforced.  Now, that's the kind of action I think that this Court has interpreted the Constitution of the United States, case in controversy, to say that it does not lie in the Federal system.  And of course, if that kind of action is the very kind that does not lie, well, then to say, but they really feel it's important that the law be enforced, they really want to vindicate the process, and these are people of special interests, we found the five citizens who most strongly want to vindicate the interest in the law being enforced and the process for making the law be enforced, well, that won't distinguish it from a public action.  But then you say, but also they are representing the State.  At this point, the Dellinger brief which takes the other side of it is making a strong argument, well, they are really no more than a group of five people who feel really strongly that we should vindicate this public interest, and have good reason for thinking it.  So you have read all these arguments that it's not really the agent and so forth.  What do you want to say about it?   Stephen G. Breyer  As long as you are on that, then I would like to ask you this: Assume you could distinguish California, suppose we accept your argument or accept Justice Scalia's version of your argument and that distinguishes California.  Now, let's look at California.  What precisely is the way in which allowing gay couples to marry would interfere with the vision of marriage as procreation of children that allowing sterile couples of different sexes to marry would not?  I mean, there are lots of people who get married who can't have children.  To take a State that does allow adoption and say -- there, what is the justification for saying no gay marriage?  Certainly not the one you said, is it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Am I not clear?  Look, you said that the problem is marriage; that it is an institution that furthers procreation.   Stephen G. Breyer  And the reason there was adoption, but that doesn't apply to California.  So imagine I wall off California and I'm looking just there, where you say that doesn't apply.  Now, what happens to your argument about the institution of marriage as a tool towards procreation?  Given the fact that, in California, too, couples that aren't gay but can't have children get married all the time.   INTERRUPTING ",12-144X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What the brief says is, of course, you can appoint people.  It's not just that you appoint them, it's that the State's interest, when it defends a law, is the interest in executing the law of the State.  So all you have to do is give a person that interest.  But when a person has the interest of defending this law, as opposed to defending the law of the State of California, there can be all kinds of conflicts, all kinds of situations.  That's what I got out of the brief.  So give the person that interest.  And that, they say, is what's missing here.  And you'll say -- I mean, that's -- that's here, and you say it's missing here.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why is it missing here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the argument--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What is the one -- look, a State that does nothing for gay couples hurts them much more than a State that does something.  And, of course, it's true that it does hurt their argument that they do quite a lot, but which are their good arguments, in your opinion?  I mean, take a State that really does nothing whatsoever.  They have no benefits, no nothing, no nothing.  Okay?  And moreover, if -- if you're right, even in California, if they have -- if they're right or, you know, if a pact is enough, they won't get Federal benefits, those that are tied to marriage, because they're not married.  So -- so a State that does nothing hurts them much more, and yet your brief seems to say it's more likely to be justified under the Constitution.  I'd like to know with some specificity how that could be.   Stephen G. Breyer  I know the principle, but I'm saying which are their good arguments, in your opinion, that would be good enough to overcome for the State that does nothing, but not good enough to overcome California where they do a lot?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the real cost right now would be you're asking me to write these words:  ""A State that has a pact has to say “ marriage ”. ""  but I'm not telling you about States that don't.  Well, I would guess there is a real-world effect there, too.  That States that are considering pacts will all say “ we won't do it ”, or not all, but some would.  And that would have a real effect right now.  And at the moment, I'm thinking it's much more harmful to the gay couple, the latter than the former.  But you won't give me advice as the Government as to how to deal with that.   INTERRUPTING ",12-144X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Language matters in a statute.  I mean, I do believe that.  And here the relevant language seems to me, what is material to the government says -- is the statute about selling or delivering.  Now, did this person -- was he the buyer, your client?  Was he somebody that they sold or delivered it to?  Well, he's a straw.  A straw purchaser is someone who doesn't purchase.  The person who purchases is the person who uses the straw.  Now, you can't say that about a giver, a benefactor is -- the person who's the beneficiary of the benefactor is not the purchaser.  But the straw purchaser is not the purchaser.  And it comes from ""straw bail"" where someone else put up the bail and it was called straw because the people who made a career of that used to wear straw in their shoes.  Interesting.  But in terms of -- in terms of this case, the straw--   Stephen G. Breyer  --No, I didn't.  I thought it came from the Wizard of Oz, but it doesn't--  [Laughter]  The fact is that is where it comes from.  I think in every legal context it means someone who is not the real.  So who is the real?  In this case it is the person for whom the straw purchased.  So we fit that within the language.  We can't fit the beneficiary of a gift within the language and that's the reason for the distinction, and so why not do it that way?   INTERRUPTING ",12-1493
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's awfully broad.  It isn't the language, I think.  The statute, it has to be material to the lawfulness of the sale.  Now, we look to see what section is it material to, and you say in your brief it's material to the section that says -- you have two of them, but they come to the same thing -- selling or delivering any firearm to any person.  All right.  Now, he says did they sell or deliver this firearm to what you call the real purchaser.  No.  They sold or delivered it to the straw, and that's the end of the matter.  And at least the statute is open to this interpretation, and it's a criminal statute.  And besides, the ATF for a long time interpreted it that way.  So what we should do is interpret it strictly.  Now, that's I think the basis of their argument if I understand it.  And so you have to get those words ""sale"" and ""deliver"" and explain how in a criminal statute they apply to what you're calling the real purchaser.   Stephen G. Breyer  But you also quote ""material"", the need for it to be material to the lawful ness of the sale.   Stephen G. Breyer  You seem to concede that in the brief.  It has to be material, and there are two sections and both come to the same thing, which is what I said.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If he was -- if he then -- if he is the actual purchaser, then he falls within the term of a person to whom the firearm was sold or delivered.  That's your argument.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, there's no question about that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but still -- look, what I thought was a very good argument on your side is exactly what I said.  The narrow interpretation would also apply to a straw man who buys a gun for Al Capone.  And so this -- this part of the statute would be virtually worthless.  Their response to that is don't worry about that.  There are plenty of other provisions that will take care of that.  Are there?  And if it's so obvious about the Al Capone, why did the ATF decide it their way for 20 years?  I mean, how -- how did they get into that?   Stephen G. Breyer  But it's going to be the same problem, which is the straw because the transferee, in context, probably refers to the person to whom the dealer transferred the weapon; namely, the buyer.  And does it apply, for example, if he knows that the buyer is going to give the -- the weapon to another person?  And you will say no.  Then he's not the transferee, the other person.  You admit that.  You say it.  And so why is the person to whom -- the one who puts up the cash is going to later transfer the weapon is the same question as to whether he is really the purchaser.  I just don't see a difference.  And, therefore, I thought -- but you can explain to me why there's a difference.  I'd like to know that.  And I guess I'd like to bring you back to the -- to that issue and -- and I'd just like to know how the ATF reached the contrary conclusion if it would so undermine the statute.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then what about the donee?   ",12-1493
1,Stephen G. Breyer  Is the chemical used here one of the chemicals that's listed in the annex to the treaty?   ,12-158X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  It is?  That's the part that I can't yet get my mind to these dramatic questions of whether here the local police power or in some other case some other inherently State power make a treaty beyond the power of the Federal government to enter into.  It's a very big question.  But I'm not there yet.  And the reason I'm not there is because there's some words in this treaty called “ other peaceful purpose ”, and we have to interpret those words and the same words are in the statute.  And my question to you is: What reason is there to think that those matters on List A fall within those words?  What is List A?  It's infinitely long.  A few things on it are in Holmes' opinion in Peasley, a great case on attempted murder where he talks about paying a small boy to move a barrel of kerosene with a candle in it alit, so that it will burn down a barn after a few hours.  The kerosene is a chemical.  He talks about a case where a person went to a racetrack and gave a horse a poison potato.  He talks about a case involving somebody else trying to light a match, which is a chemical, and setting fire to a haystack.  We can all think sadly of athletes, Lance Armstrong, at least accused of unlawfully taking drugs.  I mean, why do we think matters of List A fall within those words, outside the words “ other peaceful purpose ”, even though they're unlawful?  And by the way, did anyone say to the drafters of the convention -- I found nothing in this brief on the point -- or did anyone tell Congress that poison potatoes, drug-enhancing, performance-enhancing drugs, the example that Justice Alito used last time, you give vinegar to a goldfish -- I mean, these are all chemicals not in the annex, but they are chemicals.  And they are absolutely nothing to do with chemical weapons.  And why do we think that we have to get beyond that fact?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  There's an easy way out of that.  All we do is say the chemicals involved are the chemicals in the annex.  But you're not prepared to say that, I guarantee it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, we're outside the annex.  And I guess once we get outside the annex, we either have to draw lines or we have to say, well, this encompasses the poison potato, the poisoned goldfish, the small boy with the candle, the -- for performance-enhancing drugs.  I would say judges are here to draw lines, and between throwing all those things into it or drawing lines, it's better to draw a few lines.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  These are real cases, by the way.  The poison potato was in fact--   Stephen G. Breyer  --There's chocolate all over the place.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not -- I want your answer to the line -- my question was a question to get your answer.  And the answer that I wanted you to address yourself to is the problem of once you depart from the annexes in defining the chemicals, you throw into it a list a thousand miles long.  And we can tell joke after joke, but it's not a joke that it's so easy to make up examples that seem to have nothing to do with the problem of chemical weapons like the Syrian problem, nothing to do with that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what is your answer?  That's what I want to know.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why don't you tell us -- can you tell us what the line is that we're trying to draw?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, look, also if you' telling me I am attempting to draw the line.  That's just what I was going to do.  And if you're saying it's against the national security interest, which is the first time I've heard that, that it is the national interests -- against the national interests of the United States for me to attempt to draw such a line, then I guess the State Department better file a brief explaining why or you ought -- or why you -- why you want to push this case or -- I mean, I'm -- is that what you're telling me, that if I write the opinion that I think the law requires me to write that I somehow am hurting the national security interests of the United States?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're the one--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Oh, no.  That isn't the problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  That is the question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, it is.  That is the problem.  There is an underlying -- I don't mean to cut you off, but at some point you seem not to see a problem that I think I see.  And the problem underlying it, if you get into the treaty area is this: Given the power, as there is in Medellin's majority, to have some self-executing treaties, in principle your position constitutionally would allow the President and the Senate, not the House, to do anything through a treaty that is not specifically within the prohibitions of the rights protections of the Constitution.  That's Missouri v. Holland.  And I doubt that in that document the Framers intended to allow the President and the Senate to do anything.  Now, you ask us now to say whether the answer to that question is yes or no.  We still have a democracy, in other words, of which the House is part.  Now, if you carry it to an extreme, that's what you are, that's where you are, and I am worried about that and I think others are, too.  So I had asked you: Isn't there an easier way to deal with this case?  And you tell me: No, no, because we will interfere with some problem of foreign affairs that was never mentioned in any brief, or at least hit me for the first time when you said it.  Now, there you have an expression of my uncertainties at the moment, and any way you want to reply to that would be helpful.   INTERRUPTING ",12-158X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But that's the problem.  Is there a way of doing this, which I -- I don't see at the moment?  But the judge intervenes in a serious way and says, you go listen to your lawyer and this is a very harsh penalty and, boy, you are into -- okay?  A serious problem.  And now to track down whether that affected substantial rights, you have to try to track down the state of mind of the defendant and would he have pled guilty anyway.  And that's sometimes quite difficult to do, very hard.  But if you don't insist on doing it, and you have an absolute rule of structural error or something, then you suddenly discover these minor things.  The judge says, go to lunch, or -- or, you know, some really trivial intervention, and you are going to say that -- the guilty plea, he can just void his guilty plea.  So there should be a way of distinguishing the trivial from the -- from the really important in terms of how serious the intervention was, but I don't see any way to do that.  Have -- have you thought about that at all?  Do we have to go all the one way or all the other way?   ",12-167X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You want us to basically not apply the 11(h), the harmless error business, and you basically want to prevent bizarre results by making a tough definition of the word “ participate ”.  That's how I understand you.  And maybe you are right, but it sounds to me as you say it in reading the briefs that this is really a job for the rules committee.  This is a rule.  We don't normally have structural errors with respect to rules.  We have rules committees there to listen to this kind of complaint, to weigh it in the system as a whole and to come up with better rules.   ",12-167X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask you a particular specific quick question?   Stephen G. Breyer  As I read this, this concerns people arrested for a felony, a crime of violence, attempted crime of violence, burglary or attempted burglary.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so we're not talking about people who are driving cars and traffic stops and all these other things.   Stephen G. Breyer  The only thing we have to decide is whether a person, where there's probable cause to arrest a person for those four crimes, their fingerprints are all taken.   Stephen G. Breyer  And whether they also can take DNA, that's the issue.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Nothing else.  Thank you.   Stephen G. Breyer  That part surprised us.  Then do you think the States are wrong?  I mean, they all say in their brief, in footnote 10: DNA identification database samples have been processed in as few as 2 days in California, and although around 30 days has been average.  So I guess the technology is there now to process this in 2 days, not 9 days.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In the case of -- do you have any information -- are there instances with fingerprints where returns have not come back for as long as 30 days, or are they all, or almost all, done in 5 minutes?   INTERRUPTING ",12-207X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I would like to give a complete answer to what Justice Alito and Justice Kagan both were asking, I think.  To summarize that, if I look in terms of intrusion, I am not talking legally; I am talking practically.  It doesn't seem to me -- I can argue that it is certainly a much lesser intrusion than fingerprints.  You have to stand there, have the thing rolled; stick out your tongue.  I mean, it's hard to say it's more for me.  I'm not saying for others.  Accuracy, it's much more accurate, and that doesn't just help the defendant.  There is a whole brief here filed by the victims that have case after case where people spent 5 years in prison wrongly and where this system and the CODIS helped victims avoid being arrested and sent to jail when they were innocent.  So it works both ways.  So one, it's no more intrusive.  Two, it is much more accurate.  And three and four and five, how it's different and worse in practice, is what I would ask you to summarize.   Stephen G. Breyer  And by the way, when you talk about what information you could get out of it, there is a brief filed by leading scientists in the field.  And I came away from the brief thinking there isn't much more information, because fingerprints can be abused, too.  Of course, you can learn loads from fingerprints.  Photos, try photos; my God, you could learn a lot: Who he was, who -- you know, so all these things could be abused.  But I came away from that brief, frankly, to think, well, in terms of the possibility of abuse, it's there, but these other things, photos, too.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you tell me in light of that hostile question--  [Laughter]  --I would like you -- I would like you to tell me, okay, it's different from fingerprints and worse because of one, two, three, and I will write it down and I'll remember it.   Stephen G. Breyer  I think I can totally lose this because I have a confusion that you can clear up.  There is something to what you say.  I see what you are saying.  But what does this word “ identification ” mean?  It's used for identification.  We have a person who's been arrested.  He writes his name down, Mr. Smith.  Maybe he's lying.  We have his picture.  Well, his picture's pretty good.  If he turns up in a bar somewhere in the future, we can look, see, and that's awfully good.  And now you say, well, what is fingerprinting doing that photos aren't doing in terms of identification?  What does it do in terms of just identification?   Stephen G. Breyer  What does it do?   Stephen G. Breyer  What does that mean, confirming his identity?  We have, you mean what, what exactly?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, really?  I mean, do you think the fingerprints -- where do you go to find out if he's Alonzo King?  A lot of people have never had their fingerprints taken before.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But to determine what his name really is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  You want to determine what his name really is plus his adjudicated criminal history, and here we have the DNA, which I guess might or might not help determine what his name really is; and his criminal history, it does about the same.  And also fingerprints are sometimes used to -- for unsolved crimes, and they are sometimes used for unsolved crimes but your point really is more for unsolved crimes.  Have I got it?   ",12-207X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But now, look, still, the worst thing, the obvious question -- I mean, as a textual matter, but I don't know how you reconcile your position with the -- with the first words in 300aa-11, which is talking about a petition starts this whole proceeding and you want to interpret that word “ petition ” meaning a timely petition.  You mean an untimely petition doesn't start the proceeding?  I mean, that's the technical linguistic thing, but if you get to your -- to your basic worrying you, what is worrying you is this proceeding, okay?  That's what's worrying you, I think, the shadow trial.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, on that, Justice Sotomayor said, you only get into this problem when the attorney has filed this timeliness matter with a good reason to think his petition is timely, otherwise forget it.  Okay?  So you look at the complaint.  You see a complaint there.  He had a good reason for thinking it's timely.  It looks, on the face of the complaint, as if his client has a good claim, a plausible one.  Now, if the government wants to say, we want to present some evidence, let them do it.  And if they don't, the worst that happens is this person who thought she had a good claim, and who was reasonable in her timeliness will get some attorneys' fees paid.  Why is that -- why is that so terrible?  Why is that putting such a burden on the government that they have to go through hoops, I think, to try to get these words in the statute, too?   Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Then what's the law?  What is.  I mean, Joe Smith leaves a -- a blank in part of his tax return.  The IRS gets it, later it turns out to be relevant, and the prosecutor wants to say, hey, he left this blank.  Okay?  Now, Griffin doesn't apply, right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, isn't it -- you're not going to say that any -- any time you refuse to tell the government anything, and later on it turns out to be relevant to a criminal prosecution, that that's taken as an invocation of the Fifth Amendment.  I mean, do you want to go that far?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Then you need a line.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then what is -- then you need a line.  So where is -- there's the tax case; then we have a case they're selling tickets to the policeman's ball and somebody comes to the door and the policeman says, hey, I haven't seen you around before, and he doesn't answer.  Okay?  Now, that's probably not an invocation.  And then we have the clear line, which in custody, and now you want to extend that line.  And so what I want to know if I follow you and extend it, what line do I draw?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, yes, there's no doubt he was remaining silent, but the issue is whether he was trying to raise his Fifth Amendment right.  Now, suppose your rule were, whatever the situation, where either the individual expressly raises his right or at the least it's a fair implication from the circumstance that he was trying to assert his right, would that be a sensible rule?  And if so, how would your case stack up?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Depends on the circumstance.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Well, but yes.  The answer is going to be yes, because we're going to hear it in one minute, because, as you say, it follows a fortiori for Berghuis.  If you're going to have to make an explicit statement to invoke your Fifth Amendment right when you're not in an inherently coercive setting, I mean, that's going to be the argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're not in an inherently coercive setting as you are in the Miranda situation, you're not at trial, and outside those two situations, you have to say explicitly, I'm invoking the Fifth Amendment--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --or tap on the Constitution or something in order to indicate--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that's what's at issue and that's what--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  And that's saying because there we have a line.  It's called the in custody line.  Once you get outside of custody--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, I don't want to make the Government's argument for them.  They'll make it very well.   Stephen G. Breyer  So I think the argument will be, I think, at least in my mind, that if after sitting there for 45 minutes -- or maybe it was an hour and 45 minutes -- without saying anything, I'm -- I'm maybe taking a dissenting position, but if when the answer doesn't answer over that long period of time, but doesn't say, I want to remain silent, if that long period of behavior is insufficient without the express statement to show that he wanted to remain silent, so outside custodial setting, should it be insufficient to simply remain silent to show that -- you see, it's argument by analogy, I think--   INTERRUPTING ",12-246X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is that?  That is what I'm -- I'm uncertain about this.  And they cite page 468, note 37 of Miranda.  What is the law, in your opinion now, in respect to -- and what case would support this?  A defendant comes in, he is warned and given his Miranda rights.  He says fine, and then he proceeds to answer a whole bunch of questions.  Then they ask question number 432, he says nothing.  You then go on to 433, 434, et cetera, and he answers them all.  Okay?  At the trial, the lawyer -- the prosecutor wants to comment on the fact that in the face of that single question -- though answering many, many more -- he remained silent.  Does Griffin say he can -- the prosecutor can make that comment, yes or no?  And I'd appreciate the Government answering this question, too, because they're -- if they -- are they speaking here, or are you doing the whole argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's -- I'd like to get the same answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because I -- well, now they cite for the proposition, I think, that it -- that the prosecutor is forbidden to make that comment, note 37 of Miranda.  Okay.  I just read it.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I -- may be ambiguous on the point.  It says you have the right to maintain immunity in the face of an accusation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, fine.  But what's your opinion?  I mean, what is the law in respect to that single point?  And at least to me, I'd -- I'd like to know your opinion on that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any authority, or is it just your opinion that we have to go on?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So are you -- are you conceding the -- the point that they make?  I -- that -- that even if in the custodial setting he waives his Miranda right.  He answers 500 questions, but doesn't answer one of the 500, that the prosecutor cannot comment on that fact that he didn't answer that one?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Does it?

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why -- why wouldn't -- imagine -- there in Article II, it says that the President shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.  So the President has worked out -- I, personally, and for reasons in -- in my department, others think that this law is unconstitutional, but I have this obligation.  And because I have this obligation, I will not, I will continue to execute this law.  I will continue to execute it though I disagree with it.  And I execute it until I have an authoritative determination not to.  Now, how is that different from a trustee who believes that he has an obligation to a trust to do something under a certain provision that he thinks doesn't require that, but, you know, there's a debate about it, but he says, I have the obligation here.  I'm going to follow this through.  There'd be standing in the second case for any fiduciary, despite his personal beliefs, to continue.  We'd understand that and say there was standing.  Why don't we here?   Stephen G. Breyer  And that's the part I don't understand.  For -- if, in fact, as you agree, the trustee or other fiduciary in my example would indeed have standing to act according to the law, even though he thinks that that law is unconstitutional because of his obligation such as under Section 2.  You agree he has the -- he has -- there is standing when he goes into court in the first place, which surely he could interpret Article II as saying and you follow it through as long as you can do it, which includes appeals, until the matter is determined finally and authoritatively by a court.  If you could do the first, what suddenly stops you from doing the second?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, they're -- they're not in agreement about whether to pay the money or not.  They are in agreement about what arguments are correct legal arguments, and I can't think of a case other than the sham cases which -- which this isn't, where -- where you would find no standing or other obstacle.  And I can think of one case, which you haven't mentioned, namely, Chadha, which seems about identical.   Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe I -- as long as you have a minute, I -- what did you think of Mr. Clement's argument this way, that -- that the execution -- can I--   Stephen G. Breyer  --to execute the laws is in Article II, but where the President doesn't in a particular law, under those circumstances, a member of the legislature, appropriately authorized, has the constitutional power -- a power that is different than the average person being interested in seeing that the law is carried out; they can represent the power to vindicate the interest in seeing that the law is executed.  And that's a special interest, existing only when the Executive declines to do so.   ",12-307X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  This is what -- we have always had the distinction between the public action and the private action.  A public action, which does not exist under the Federal Constitution, is to vindicate the interest in the law being enforced.  Now, when the government, State or Federal, in fact has the interest, a special interest in executing the law, here given to the President, and they can delegate that interest to Congress, if they did, which arguably they didn't do here.  But to say that any legislator has an interest on his own without that delegation to defend the law is to import in that context the public action into the Federal Government.  Now, that -- it hasn't been done, I don't think, ever.  I can see arguments for and against it, but I can't think of another instance where that's happened.   Stephen G. Breyer  Chadha is really different because of course there is an interest in the legislature in defending a procedure of the legislature.  Now, that's -- that isn't tough.  But this is, because the only interest I can see here is the interest in the law being enforced.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's -- I'm afraid of opening that door.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  But think of another instance where that's happened, where in all of the 12 cases or whatever that what this Court has said, without any special delegation of the power of the State or Federal Government to execute the law, without any special delegation, a legislator simply has the power, which a private citizen wouldn't have, to bring a lawsuit as a party or defend as a party to vindicate the interest in the law being enforced, the law he has voted for?  Now I can imagine arguments on both side, so I'm asking you only, is there any case you can point me to which will help?   Stephen G. Breyer  You would say it would be the same thing if the State passed a law -- Congress passes a law which says, well, there's some States -- they all used to require 18 as the age of consent.  Now, a lot of them have gone to 17.  So if you're 17 when you get married, then no tax deduction, no medical, no nothing.  Or some States had a residence requirement of a year, some have six months, some have four months.  So Congress passes a law that says, well unless you're there for a year, no medical deduction, no tax thing, no benefits of any kind, that that would be perfectly constitutional.  It wouldn't be arbitrary, it wouldn't be random, it wouldn't be capricious.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I just want your bottom line.  The bottom line here is we can imagine -- you know, I can make them up all day.  So can you -- differences between ----  [Laughter]  Differences between States have nothing to do with anything, you know, residence requirements, whether you have a medical exam, whether -- we can think them up all day -- how old you are.  And Congress just passes a law which takes about, let's say, 30 percent of the people who are married in the United States and says no tax deduction, no this, no that, no medical -- medical benefits, none much these good things, none of them for about 20, 30 percent of all of the married people.  Can they do that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, there isn't any.  I'm trying to think of examples, though I just can't imagine what it is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So you're saying uniform treatment's good enough no matter how odd it is, no matter how irrational.  There is nothing but uniformity.  We could take -- no matter.  Do you see what I'm -- where I'm going?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, okay.  Fine.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine, but once -- the first part.  Every one of those cases has to be decided on its own, okay?  Now, what's special or on its own that distinguishes and thus makes rational, or whatever basis you're going to have here, treating the gay marriage differently?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  When you started, you started by, I think, agreeing -- maybe not -- that uniformity in and of itself with nothing else is not likely to prove sufficient, at least if it's rational basis-plus.  And -- and why?  Because we can think of weird categories that are uniform.  So you say, Look at it on the merits.  Now that's where you are beginning to get.  But so far, what I've heard is, Well, looking at it on the merits, there is certainly a lot of harms.  And on the plus side what there is, is, one, We don't want courts deciding this.  But of course, as was just pointed out, in some States it's not courts, it's the voters.  Then you say, Ah, but we want -- there are too many courts deciding it.  Now, is -- too many courts might decide it.  Now what else is there?  What else?  I--  want to -- I want to be able to have a list, you know, of really specific things that you are saying justify this particular effort to achieve uniformity.  And I want to be sure I'm not missing any.  And so far, I've got those two I mentioned.   Stephen G. Breyer  That means courts -- the courts, they do dictate in respect to time.  They dictate in respect to age.  They dictate in respect to all kinds of things.  And what I'm looking for is:  What, in your opinion, is special about this homosexual marriage that would justify this, other than this kind of pure uniformity, if there is such a thing?   Stephen G. Breyer  Then yet -- but here--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Or if there's no interest -- I mean, I'm back where we were yesterday.  It seems to me, forgetting your -- your preferable argument, it's a violation of equal protection everywhere.  Well, if it is, then all States have to have something like pacts.  And if they have to have something like pacts, then you say then they also have to allow marriage.  So then are you not arguing they all have to allow marriage?  And then you say no.  So with that point--   Stephen G. Breyer  What -- what do you think of his -- the argument that I heard was, to put the other side, at least one part of it as I understand it said: Look, the Federal Government needs a uniform rule.  There has been this uniform one man -- one woman rule for several hundred years or whatever, and there's a revolution going on in the States.  We either adopt the resolution -- the revolution or push it along a little, or we stay out of it.  And I think Mr. Clement was saying, well, we've decided to stay out of it--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and the way to stay out of it is to go with the traditional thing.  I mean, that -- that's an argument.  So your answer to that argument is what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I understand you do; I'd like to know the reason.  [Laughter]   ",12-307X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Where did it say “ material ”?  I thought -- I thought -- I think so far as I've read this, the argument is about the truth or falsity of the statement.  And you're saying that the Colorado Supreme Court should have said it has to be false.  Isn't that your argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, I've looked at -- I've looked at footnote 17 or footnote 6 or whatever it is on page 17, and I think that their characterization of the Colorado Supreme Court is right.  That is, the Colorado Supreme Court is going to be very surprised if we tell them that they never said it has to be false.  What they said here is:  ""In the determination of immunity, we need not and therefore do not decide whether the statements were true or false. ""  Correct?  Why not?  Because, they say,  ""The trial court properly submitted the case to the jury. ""  ""Accordingly, the jury was entitled to determine the elements of the defamation claim, including whether the statements were false. ""  So as I read that, which I think you'll hear from the other side in about a few minutes, the -- the Colorado Supreme Court says: Look, the jury found that the statement was false, so we don't have to worry about that.  We're worried about whether the false statement was made with reckless disregard of its truth or falsity or knowledge that it was false.  Okay?  That's how I read the footnote.  And they say something like that on page 30 and 31 of their brief.  So -- so if I'm right about that, what are we supposed to do?  Are we supposed to say that matters of truth or falsity are not for the jury?  Are we supposed to say that the jury went beyond what any reasonable person would go, would do here?  What is it we're supposed to do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I do.  I'd like an answer -- well, you can do it in your rebuttal, but I'd like an answer to my question.   Stephen G. Breyer  I accept that for the moment, accept all that.  What's bothering me, a picky little point.  But the picky point is that your statement of the question: Whether ATSA immunity may be denied without a determination that the air carrier's disclosure was materially false?  No, can't be.  But I read the footnote, Footnote 6, last sentence.  It says there was such a determination.  The jury made it, and we don't have to go back over it.  So what are you arguing?  Are you arguing that there should be like, as there is in free speech cases, you know, a special duty upon an appellate court to go back over such a jury finding?  Are you saying the Colorado Supreme Court was wrong in the second part of Footnote 6 when it says the jury made it?  What am I supposed to do in your opinion?   Stephen G. Breyer  They may have waived it, you know.   INTERRUPTING ",12-315X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But we have granted cert on this question.  So -- so given that fact, could we do this: One, yes, it has to be false; two, the Colorado Supreme Court, because of Footnotes 5 as well as 6, which I haven't picked up, and other things they've said, is at least ambiguous about the role the jury's finding played.  And given that fact, what we'll do is we'll go through and see where the parties agree about what happened in -- in the world, and insofar as they agree, we'll take it, you see.  Your side will get the underlying assumption and looking at it as it's agreed upon, we find either that it would be or wouldn't be within the scope of the immunity.  And on that one you might lose.  But is there -- is there -- what do you think of that procedure?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, it doesn't say that.  It says -- Footnote 6 has to be read with Footnote 5, which I hadn't picked up.  And once I put those two footnotes together, I have no idea what the Colorado Supreme Court says.   Stephen G. Breyer  All of us have had the experience, at least I have, if I get very angry at something, one of my children will say: God, he's mentally unstable.  See, I mean, that's -- people use that word in different contexts.  And what's worrying me is that some real threat comes along and the lawyers get involved and the people are going to report it to the TSA, start watching their words and they don't know what the lawyers mean exactly.  And you understand the problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  So why isn't the best thing to say is, look, there is leeway here, considerable leeway on the part of the airline or anyone else who's reporting, that are reporting things to TSA.  All it means is they are going to search him more thoroughly.   INTERRUPTING ",12-315X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What about -- what about the mob goes to a grocer and says, you know, you're dead or something if you sell Cheerios, and the reason is because they have a monopoly, some other grocery who's connected has a monopoly.  And they threaten him.  Now, does that violate Hobbs Act?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What he did was -- and he's -- he's not going to sell Cheerios.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now -- now, in fact, they're doing it to get money, and they do get money, but via the means of the other grocer.  And there is nothing in the words of this Act that says that the property has to be taken from the individual whom you coerce.  It's easy to imagine situations where the coerced individual has a relationship, direct, special and so forth, with the person who has the money.  So what happens when, say, the mob coerces the person without the property so that he will do a thing such that the person with the property gives them the property?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now just make it different.  What they do is they get the assistant bank employee and they threaten him to do such a thing such as shout at a certain time where they know that that shouting will lead them to be able to rob the bank.  I mean, you know, it's easy to think up.  What I can't figure out here is, is there some requirement that the person who is coerced has to be the same person as the person who gives them the property.  If the answer to that's no, then none of the Government's chamber of horribles is horrible, because there's a way around it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And you haven't found anything on this.  You'd be making it up now, is that basically it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is the -- is the one?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It has to be more property, more money, more money in return for less services or something than otherwise.  That's what you're saying.  But I don't think that's -- I mean, right.  But the answer -- go ahead, because I -- that's the qualification you're making, the McNally qualification.   ",12-357X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The obvious problem, which you might want to address at some point, is that -- that if you take your definition that this recommendation, legal recommendation, is property and the fellow said, you know, I'm going to fix you if you don't do it, if that's property, we're back to the honest services statute, because anyone in government and anyone in business, indeed everybody, has a job and those jobs always require you to do things.  So if every time somebody threatens a person and says, we don't want you to do the thing you're supposed to do, we want you to do the thing like this, well, then you're violating this property statute.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, that seems very far-reaching, hard to reconcile with the abortion case -- the abortion clinic case, etcetera, and it is easy to reconcile with the honest services case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean, that sounds technical.  You see, the problem I'm interested in is, by accepting your definition do we suddenly throw within the statute, which speaks of property, any time there is an appropriate threat which has as a condition the person doing the job differently?  That's true of whether it's a postman, you know, any public official, any private official, anybody.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That seems very far-reaching.  So--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, I understand that.  But I still would like an answer to my question, and it's well-phrased with an example by Justice Kennedy.  Every secretary in the United States who is about to write a recommendation for somebody to go to college or some other thing then is faced with a threat, you put in name such-and-such or put in yes instead of no, and is under your definition that person's property, that what she does the taking of property?  The answer is either you think yes, in which case I would like you to defend it--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Or the -- yes.  Okay.  Then what conceivable ground?  I'm not -- I don't want to -- that sounds a little pejorative, but I'll say: What ground is there for a definition that is so broad that it sweeps within it all working people in the United States in the performance of their ordinary jobs?   Stephen G. Breyer  As I think about it in terms of the New York cases, as you write them up here, it sounds as if someone was trying to get control of a business.  So I think business, land, labor, and capital.  All right.  I can see why somebody who's trying to get control of a whole business is trying to take land, labor and capital.  There may be no land there, but so what.  And -- but a person's trying to take control of another's job by just telling him what to do 2 percent of the time seems well across some kind of line.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  No attaining question.  I'm just thinking is it reasonable to call a secretary doing one job which takes 3 percent of her time that hour property, in a way is that different from taking control of Macy's--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and -- and it seems to me that probably it is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, I'm not worried about copyrights or other intangibles.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's not the issue.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why -- why, just as long as we are idly speculating, didn't you use 18 U.S.C. 875,  ""Whoever with intent to extort from any person anything of value? ""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You don't have -- you don't have property in there.  You have a thing of value--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --is there some -- I mean, it just seems obvious you'd be in a much stronger position when you say that the recommendation not to buy or to buy a particular service from somebody is a thing of value.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Have they in the Court been treated as a thing of value means property?   Stephen G. Breyer  So no.   ",12-357X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I know, but I don't see the answer, because I gather, if I -- if I've read it correctly, that when you have an R -- the messenger RNA does not have the same base pairs.  There's a U or something instead of an A or whatever it is.   Stephen G. Breyer  So when you actually look, if you could get a super-microscope and look at what they have with the cDNA, with their cDNA, you would discover something with an A, not a U.  Is it AU?  Is that the one?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So -- so you would discover something with an A there, you see, and you wouldn't discover something with a U there.  And there is no such thing in nature as the no-introns AGG, whatever, okay?  It's not there.  That's not truly isolated DNA.  But you can go look up the Amazon, wherever you want.  Hence the question.  Now, on that one, how?  How is that found in nature?  The answer is it isn't.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask a question, which I don't think will be taken from your time.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I have to ask you this.  Look, you say don't reach the cDNA issue and the reason is because of the nature of the claim.  Okay, I look at their claim.  Their claim says they want  ""the isolated DNA of claim 1 wherein said DNA has the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID No. 1. ""  Then we turn to that and the first thing it says right there is it says, “ The molecule involved is ” -- “ Molecule type: cDNA ”.  And then it has a long list and that long list is a list of the basis, okay.  So molecule type, cDNA.  So they say what do you mean they aren't claiming cDNA?  That's what they say they're claiming.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because of the word “ wherein ”.  So I go back to the “ wherein ” in Prometheus and the “ wherein ” -- you read “ wherein ” as in context, and in this context you mean to say that a person who makes isolated DNA that has lots of introns in it as well as the sequence is going to be an infringer under claim 2?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any support for that other than the treatise that you cited?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, I looked at that and it said read the “ wherein ” depending on context.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then depending on -- okay.  Then you got -- you heard what I said, so I want to know is there anything else I should read?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, I saw that.  I saw that.   ",12-398X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's true, but then you were saying something that I just didn't understand, because I thought the -- the scientists who had filed briefs here, as I read it, said it's quite true that the chromosome has the BRCA gene in the middle of it and it's attached to two ends.  But also in the body, perhaps because cells die, there is isolated DNA.  And that means that the DNA strand, the chromosome strand is cut when a cell dies, and then isolated bits get around, and there may be very few of them in the world, but there are some, by the laws of probability, that will in fact match precisely the BRCA1 gene.  Now, have I misread what the scientists told us, or are you saying that the scientists are wrong?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I probably misread it.  There's a better chance that I've misread it.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, which one have I not read--   Stephen G. Breyer  --So, in other words, you're saying that the Lander brief is wrong.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I want to know, because I have to admit that I read it and I did assume that as a matter of science it was correct.  So I would like to know whether you agree, as a matter of science, that it is correct, not of law, but of science, or if you are disagreeing with it, as a matter of science.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'd like a yes or no answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Was the answer no, you do not disagree with it?  I wonder, I disagree or I do disagree?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  As a matter of science.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Very well.  If you are saying it is wrong, as a matter of science, since neither of us are scientists, I would like you to tell me what I should read that will, from a scientist, tell me that it's wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I need to know--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  So, when you are on that, that's good.  A more basic question to me is when you use the word “ dangerous ”.  I had thought -- and you can -- I'd be interested in your view -- that the patent law is filled with uneasy compromises, because on the one hand, we do want people to invent; on the other hand, we're very worried about them tying up some kind of whatever it is, particularly a thing that itself could be used for further advance.  And so that the compromise that has been built historically into this area is: Of course, if you get a new satisfying process to extract the sap from the plant in the Amazon, patented.  Of course, if you get the sap out and you find that you can use it, you manipulate it, you use it, you figure out a way to use it to treat cancer, wonderful, patented.  But what you can't patent is the sap itself.  Now, in any individual case that might be unfortunate or fortunate.  But consider it in the mine run of things.  It's important to keep products of nature free of the restrictions that patents there are, so when Captain Ferno goes to the Amazon and discovers 50 new types of plants, saps and medicines, discovers them, although that expedition was expensive, although nobody had found it before, he can't get a patent on the thing itself.  He gets a patent on the process, on the use of the thing, but not the thing itself.  Now, that's my understanding of what I'd call hornbook patent law, which you I confess probably understand better than I.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I would like you to express your view on that, because that's the framework that I am bringing to the case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You are saying it gets past 101.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's -- that's the problem.  I mean, all parts of the human body?  Anything from inside the body that you snip out and isolate?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And it gets through 101?  Does it have to -- I mean, that's actually what's bothering me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Ah.  Then -- then watch what you're doing.  That's very, very interesting, because, really, we are reducing, then, 101 to anything under the sun, and -- and that, it seems to me, we've rejected more often than we've followed it.  And particularly with a thing found in nature doctrine, because, of course, it doesn't just -- human kidneys and so forth.  Everything is inside something else.  Plants, rocks, whatever you want.  And so everything will involve your vast taking something out of some other thing where it is, if only the environment.  And it's at that point that I look for some other test than just that it was found within some other thing.   ",12-398X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can you clarify something for me about habeas corpus law?   Stephen G. Breyer  I have to imagine facts, so let's take it as a hypothetical.  The U.S. -- the district attorney says: This lawyer was adequate and really two factors make that obvious.  The first factor is that the client said that she was innocent and, taking that into account with the other things, that could have justified adequately his withdrawal of the plea and not convincing her not to.  Second, the sentence that the district attorney wanted to give was more than a year greater than the guidelines for manslaughter, and that could have justified it.  Now, it writes -- the court then writes in its opinion only the second reason and never mentions the first.  Now we go to habeas and the habeas court thinks that second reason is pretty flimsy there.  Gee, she was exposing herself to murder, et cetera; it's pretty flimsy.  The first isn't so bad, but they didn't rely on it.  Okay.  So now what's the habeas court supposed to do?  Should the defendant have gone back to the State court first?  Is the habeas court supposed to have its own independent hearing and make up its own mind?  How does this--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm glad.  I would love to have an answer.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, are there rules in this area?  I didn't think -- are there rules?  I mean, doesn't every judge, whenever that judge is deciding a factual matter or the jury, take into account from every witness, whether that witness is making a pretty self-serving statement?  I mean, that's a factor.  And I guess we could have some situations, sometime, in some place, where a witness got on the stand and said something that was totally in his favor, but when you heard it, hmm, and you knew the case, hmm, he's right.  And then that could happen with this kind of witness, too.  It could happen.  I'm not saying it very often does, but it could.  So why should we have any special rule for these witnesses and not for any other?   ",12-414X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So the point is that there has to be some evidence.  You -- you are saying that the court was wrong when they said your client said she wasn't guilty.  Now, this affidavit doesn't show that.  I mean, paragraph 6 doesn't say who spoke first, but common sense suggests that the deputy sheriff wouldn't have made that statement unless she spoke first.  I mean, does he go around saying to everybody just generally, oh, you know, if you are not guilty, you shouldn't plead guilty  ""I mean, it says they had discussions and during discussions he told her she shouldn't plead guilty if she wasn't guilty. ""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where?   Stephen G. Breyer  Where -- approached her--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and discussions with her.  It doesn't say why he approached her.  I mean, I just don't think people normally do that, they go to every person in jail and say: You know, if you are not guilty, you shouldn't plead guilty.  I mean, somebody might, but something triggered that advice, and the affidavit doesn't tell me what triggered that advice.  So I could infer that what triggered the advice was her statement she was not guilty, or I could infer this is an unusual situation where, for some reason unknown, he brought it up.  I don't know from reading paragraph 6.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So whose burden is it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't matter.  Why doesn't it matter?  Because if she went, he -- she said, you know, I'm not really guilty, he said, well, you shouldn't plead guilty, she said -- but I have a lawyer that will get rid of your guilty plea.  If it went something like that, and then we assume the lawyer was told about this -- it doesn't say, but that's a reasonable assumption.  And then the court opinion of Michigan seems to make sense that that was a reason, that was one of the reasons that made his conduct in -- in withdrawing the plea or, you know, not strongly advising her against it.  That was one reason why that wasn't an inadequate assistance of counsel.  Now where have I made my mistake in this chain?   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought you were -- there is a reason that they spoke about, which was, well, she said she was innocent.  Now, as to that one, what they wrote is the record discloses that the second attorney's advice was set in motion by defendant's statement to the sheriff's deputy that he did not commit the offense.  Now, you say that's just contrary to fact as you point to the affidavit.  And the affidavit I read, I think it's a little -- rather ambiguous in that respect, and I can overturn that or a Federal court can only if this factual statement I just read you is clearly wrong, clearly.  So I have a tough time saying it's clearly.  And I know they overstated, because they said automatically, in this case.  Well, that may be an overstatement.  You have to read it in light of that sentence.  But then you're making a second argument, I take it, if this is right.  Your second argument is, anyway, he was incompetent for a completely different reason.  He didn't read the record.  And if he'd read it, he never would have made the statement that this is just a manslaughter case.  He would have seen that if she withdrew her guilty plea she'd be tried for murder, and then she'd get a really long sentence.  So that's an ineffective assistance of counsel.  Now, what does the Court in Michigan say about that?  Nothing.  So now I wonder.  Maybe nobody made that argument to them.  Or, maybe they made it and they rejected it sub silentio.  That's why I asked my first question.  Okay?  So -- and you heard the response.  Even if they had heard that argument and they said nothing about it, they don't have to -- they don't have to mention every argument made.  If they just deny, we assume they deny it, and what we do is see whether they were within their rights to deny it.  That's how we are supposed to look at it: Does it clearly violate Supreme Court law to deny it?  And there is going to be a factual part of that and a legal part.  All right, how do we deal with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  First of all, did anybody make the argument as clearly as you have made it?  I saw what it was, I think.  So, that's -- did anybody make that argument to the Michigan court?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, okay.  Well, that's the end of that, isn't it?  What you are coming for is you have to proceed by asking for reopening in the Michigan court and see if they say it's too late.  And then, you know, et cetera, they're all spelled out in this opinion which I can't remember, Cullen or Pinholster or something.  And this isn't an argument for us now.   ",12-414X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that doesn't mean that -- that's rather thin.  I don't know how -- I don't have the ability to assess that, the significance of it, empirically.  The thing I wonder, therefore, you said it's common in antitrust?  I'm -- I'm not up to everything in the field, but I know there's an existence of something called the per se rule, let's price fix it.  I know there's a rule of reason, and I know there's a sort of vague area that sometimes in some cases that Justice Souter mentioned in California Dental, there is something slightly in between, which as I saw those cases, they're very much like price fixing or -- or agreements not to enter.  And what they seem to say is, Judge, pay attention to the department when it says that these are very often can be anticompetitive, and ask the defendant why he's doing it.  I mean, is that what you want us to say?  It didn't seem in your briefs as if you were.  If you were asking us to produce some kind of structure -- I don't mean to be pejorative, but it's rigid -- a whole set of complex per se burden of proof rules that I have never seen in other antitrust cases, I -- my question is, when I say I've never seen anything like this before in terms of procedure, I want you to refer me to a case that will show, oh, no, I'm out of date.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And are there others?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any other?  Are you familiar with any other?  Because I want to be sure I read all of them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if there are few or none, then I would say why isn't the government satisfied with an opinion of this Court that says, yes, there can be serious anticompetitive effects; yes, sometimes there are business justifications; so, Judge, keep that in mind.  Ask him why he has this agreement; ask him what his justification is, and see if there's a less restrictive alternative.  In other words, it's up to the district court, as in many complex cases, to structure their case with advice from the attorneys.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's got guidance.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The same thing is appropriate as is appropriate in any antitrust case.  Are there anticompetitive effects?  I have 32 briefs here that explain very clearly what you said in a sentence.  It may be that they're simply dividing the monopoly profit.  I understand that -- you know, I can take that in and so can every judge in the country.  And what's complicated about that?  And then I have some very nice dark green briefs that clearly say, four instances, maybe five, where there would be offsetting justifications.  I think they can get that, too.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And they mention at least two others.  The first one they mention is because the person's already in the market thinks that the next year or two or three years is worth $100 million a year, and the person who's suing thinks it's worth 30 million a year.  And so he says, hey, I have a great idea, I'll give him the 30 million and keep the 70.  And -- and that, I don't see why that's anticompetitive if that's what's going on.  And the second instance they bring up is that it's very hard to break into a market.  So for the new generic to come in, he's thinking, giving me two years isn't worth much, because I'll spend a lot of money, it's very hard for me to do it.  But the defendant -- the defendant who wants this patent kept intact says, I will not only let -- I'll let you in a year earlier and I'll give you enough money so that you can start up a distribution system.  The second seems procompetitive; the first, neutral.  The problem of deciding whether other matters are or are not really payments for something else, a true nightmare when you start talking about five drugs and different distribution systems, and the matter of whether you're paying for litigation costs, a matter of great debate for the judge.  Okay.  That's the arguments that they make.  Go ahead.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I mean, Professor Areeda, who is at least in my mind a minor deity in the matter, in this area, if not major, he explains it.  He says don't try for more precision than you can give.  The quality of proof required should vary with the circumstances.  Do you know how long it took -- I mean, and I -- of course, I -- I know a little bit of antitrust.  But I mean, I think -- do you know how long it takes to take in your basic argument that these sometimes can be a division of profit, monopoly profit?  It takes probably 3 minutes or less.  And judges can do that.  So you say to the judge: Judge, this is what's relevant here.  And there's a rule of evidence: Don't waste the jury's time.  So -- so you shape the case as -- and this is what goes -- used to go on for 40 years.  You shape the case in light of the considerations that are actually relevant, useful and provable in respect to that case.  And district judges, that's their job.  So -- so what -- I'm not saying you'd lose the case.  They didn't side with the Eleventh Circuit.  They said there's no violation, okay?  I've got your point on that.  But -- but I'm worried about creating some kind of administrative monster.   ",12-416X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  But there, it's not -- their point is not it's per se unlawful.  What they want is they want to cut some kind of line between a per se rule and the kitchen sink.  And if you look at the brief supporting you, it is the kitchen sink.  You have economists attacking the patent system or praising it, da, da, da, and here and there and the other.  They don't want the kitchen sink.  Now, suppose I don't want the kitchen sink, but I have a hard time saying what the per se rule is.  So what's your argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Suppose--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Okay.  Suppose -- this sounds like an argument, a discussion that you have in the district court, so -- so why -- what's your reaction to this: Say A, sometimes these settlements can be very anticompetitive, dividing monopoly profit.  In deciding whether anticompetitive outweighs business practices without less restrictive alternatives, judge, you may take that into account; 2, do not take into account the strength of a patent; 3, do not try to relitigate the patent.  4, there are several possible justifications, ones I listed before out of the briefs, litigation costs -- the other products, different assessments of -- of value.  5, there could be, in fact, no anticompetitive effect here because of what you just said now in response to Justice Kennedy and Justice Kagan, but there could be.  We don't know.  Okay?  So, start with where we were.  Could be anticompetitive.  Give the defense a chance to go through five, 1 through 5, and if they convince you there is a 6, we're not saying there isn't, but we can't think of one on the briefs, let them have the 6th, too.  Now, judge, weigh and decide.  That's what we do.  So we've structured it somewhat to keep the kitchen sink out on the basis of the briefs given to us.  What's wrong with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  So why does it help you to say, if the Court says or the FTC says when you get one of these suits you can settle it by letting them in, but you can't pay them money, that that will help to stop strike suits.  It costs them nothing to get in.  They have to really want to enter or they won't bring lawsuits.  So why does that hurt you?   ",12-416X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I have an underlying question just for my understanding of this.  Now, the unions are on your side and -- I think.  And I wondered why.  This is my thought, which suggests that I may not understand this perfectly.  It seemed like, to me, a brilliant statute, because if in fact the unions, those they represent, the workers, don't want -- want to be paid for donning and doffing, all they have to do is not put something in the collective bargaining agreement.  But -- and if they do put something in the collective bargaining agreement, they can exert their bargaining power to get something else which they must want more.  So what you with your narrow definition do is you prevent the workers from doing that.  So I don't know why the ordinary worker would be on your side of it.  Now, I say that because I want you to explain what I'm missing.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I see, that's where the problem lies.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there a way around that that doesn't involve this case, the Secretary of Labor?  Or I guess you can amend the statute.  That's tough.  I mean--   ",12-417X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, what I think he's saying is this, that my puzzle was, why was this a big deal for the unions?  All they have to do is keep their mouths shut and the employer is going to have to go to them and say, we want this in the agreement.  But he says: You haven't read those words “ custom or practice ”, and if you see the words “ custom or practice ” you'll see that an awful lot of businesses or firms or manufacturing across the country actually has long had a custom or practice where they didn't pay for that or they didn't exclude it, or they didn't -- so in those circumstances, it's the union that's going to have to go to the employer and say: Please put some other words in the agreement so we get this out of the statute.  And now I have no idea -- I think that's what his point was.  And of course this is an empirical question in part of, that kind of point, which is logically sound, affects a certain number of workers in industries.  And I would next be curious either you or the SG or anyone has some estimate of what we are talking about quantitatively.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why would it be difficult?  Why not just say clothes, at least from your point of view, clothes are -- are those items that have, as a significant purpose, the covering of one's body.  That's not the purpose of eyeglasses; it's not the purpose of wristwatches; it's not the purpose of -- of cameras held around your neck; it's not the purpose even of an iPod.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, is there anything wrong with what I just said?   Stephen G. Breyer  What?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Opening your locker is not clothes.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's not -- but still, we're back to the statute which says “ clothes ”.   Stephen G. Breyer  And therefore, what's wrong with the definition I just proposed?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's -- that's up to them how they negotiate.  But -- but the statute says “ clothes ”, so we would have to pay for the clothes time.  They'd have to pay for the clothes time unless it's in the collective bargaining agreement or -- you know, if it's in the collective bargaining -- unless it's in the collective bargaining agreement.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or custom and--   Stephen G. Breyer  --No.  Why -- why does it include eyeglasses?  Eyeglasses do not have as a principal -- as a significant purpose the covering of one's body.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So maybe we can call them constructive clothes, which means they're not clothes.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you have any estimate on the empirical -- there are only two people that know, the Department of Labor and the AFL-CIO, and they didn't tell us, the latter.  So -- so what we're thinking of, I think, is workplace hazard clothing.  Okay?  And the problem, I think, that was raised is that the union can't stop -- can't -- can't -- can't make an agreement about this without a lot of trouble anyway.  They can't just shut up, in other words, and see that the -- there'll be compensation because there's a custom or practice in the industry of giving -- of not giving them compensation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you follow?  Do you follow--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, yes.  But they've had--   Stephen G. Breyer  --collective bargaining agreements in steel forever.  All right?  So if we go back to -- to 1949 or 1952 and they entered into some big deal agreement, I mean, what was the custom or practice at that time?  I don't know.  I suspect you don't know.  And I -- I wonder if the Department of Labor knows.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I wonder if anyone knows.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So there is--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Exactly.   INTERRUPTING ",12-417X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Then why not this?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well -- why not?  I mean, look, this is -- Thomas Reed Powell once said,  ""If you can think of a thing that is inextricably related to another thing without thinking of the other thing, then you have the legal mind. ""  and that seems to be this case.  All right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So somehow I have to get out of my mind the ex post facto part, the potential violation of due process part, the equal protection part, take that aside.  Now I've got to just think about whether it has, the Congress has the power under the provision that Justice Alito said.  I'm trying to do that, and I've dissented in other cases on other grounds.  All right.  But in -- in just trying to do that, I think, well, the military, suppose they found a certain number of -- of individuals, men or women, have unfortunate problems in the military.  They discover there is a mental illness problem; the person's out of the military.  But the law says you can go and tell the local mental health authorities about this person even though he's no longer there.  And suppose the person had a criminal problem in the military and was in prison and suppose the law said, you know, you're the ones who got the situation where he unfortunately got into that problem, and you, later on, can -- can go and tell authorities about his problems so they can take appropriate action.  Now, if they can do that, why can't they have the power under Article I to say really, you all have to register.  Now, maybe there are other things, but you got this problem in the military.  You were convicted in the military.  You did it in the military.  We turned you loose and there you are, and we want, as part of our military regulation, to be able to tell authorities about you and to make you register according to State law.  Now, no due process problem; I have to assume that away.  No punishment, bad punishment problem, none of those.  But it's a power, all right?  Why not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where you're leading me, because I'm not so worried about this case, but where you're leading me is down in Commerce Clause cases and all kinds of other cases, suddenly a distinction arises that Congress can, in fact, do all kinds of things having Federal authorities do this and that, but you couldn't make someone in a State -- you know, you can imagine a few that are coming into my mind -- and so what I'm worried about is following this distinction into other areas.   Stephen G. Breyer  But yet, now that's exactly the problem for me, because the -- the wilds of Alaska you think I think, and I think I think, that -- that sure, if there's a post office there -- there's a post office there, then what -- the military is all right, they can mail a letter to the -- to be delivered to the local doctor to say, look, he has a problem.  That seems to be okay.  But you say it's not going to be okay to tell him he has to go and make that registration.  At that point what you've done is like Madison.  I mean, it's an interpretation of the Commerce Clause that I think Madison might have wanted, which is you're reading a lack of power because of a civil rights problem.  I mean, it's -- the difference between the two cases is really not the need because we have to assume the need.  The difference is the restriction on the individual.  And it's that part that I'm suddenly worried about the Commerce Clause and every power in Article I being read with exceptions in the civil rights area even though we have the amendments to protect the civil rights problems.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, but it's the military -- look, it's the military that they are mostly -- that they're relying on.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So they say -- I mean, the famous statement -- I looked it up --  ""Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate and not forbidden are -- fall within the Necessary and Proper Clause. ""  All right?  The end is to protect the communities from those individuals in respect to those matters that they became dangerous with when they were in the military; okay?  That's the end.  And is the means appropriate?  They say yes.  They say, after all, the means here is, notify them when we're -- you're moving around.  And therefore, is it forbidden?  Well, we're not supposed to consider that part, but -- so leave that out.  But the -- the others, they say is okay.  So that's the basic.  Do you think maybe we should send this back to the -- to the Fifth Circuit?  The Government suggests that--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --because they didn't get it right in respect to what the previous statutes require.  What about all that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I just want to know what to do if I end up thinking they are right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's your recommendation there on that assumption?  I'm not saying I would, but I'm just saying on that assumption.   INTERRUPTING ",12-418X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I wanted -- I just wanted to hear what you were going to say in answer to the second part of Justice Sotomayor's earlier question.  And to remind you of that, you were going to explain to us, which I felt I needed, the second term, that second term.  And that just says FV for value.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I did notice, that if you take.23 times fair value, not quite by coincidence, it happens to be what the companies would have made over a period of 2 years in profit, had it been the truth that the value of such companies was, as valued by the market, 9 times their earnings.  Because a company that's valued 9 times its earnings earns about 11 point something percent per year, taking aside all other facts; and 2 years' worth is that.  And I don't know if I've got that part right, but if I do have that part right, then what this tax does is it takes the profits the firms actually -- actually made over 2 years; not quite actually.  It assumes twice the -- the value of the first year.  You see, so whatever they made the first year -- and if it's only 6 months, it's twice 6 months, you know -- that first part figures out what they really made over the first year and then multiplies it by two.  And you take that and you subtract from that the amount that they would have made over 2 years.  Now -- so it looked to me pretty -- this helps you, of course, but -- but it also, it's calculated on an average, the average of the first year's profit, they consider that the average; and therefore they are right in saying, you know, a firm that is only in business for 6 months will be taxed -- the whole 2-year extra will be taken away, even when there was no 2-year extra.  You see, so that firm would have paid more than their gross income.  Of course, there is no such firm and that's their problem.  But we come to that later.  But I want your view, if you can -- if I've explained it clearly enough so you get where I'm coming from.  And -- and -- if -- if I have explained that clearly enough, I really appreciate what you think about it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It will do that for firms that are in business for 4 years.   Stephen G. Breyer  Absolutely.  It won't do that for a firm that was in business 6 months.  And -- and--   Stephen G. Breyer  --A very different number.   Stephen G. Breyer  Indeed, a number that could exceed the money -- all the money they really make in the next 2 years.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, that's correct.  That's not true.  There is only one company like that; absolutely right.  And -- but -- but some, particularly on the other side, want to make quite a lot out of that fact.  And they want to make quite a lot out of the fact that for that single -- whatever it's called railroad something--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I know -- I know they didn't.  It didn't happen in this instance.   INTERRUPTING ",12-43XX
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  If they know what it really was, I guess they're all billionaires.  You've got triple billionaires.  I mean, if you could go and figure out what companies could really be sold at as opposed to what the market says, I think I have the solution for you.  I don't know why either of us is working here.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, since there is no real value, I -- I mean, maybe there is, because they did it in the form of an IPO, and the share then went the next day into the market, and when the it went the next day into the market, did the market pay a lot more?   Stephen G. Breyer  Really?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right, then you could use that.  You could use that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How does that relate to the number 9?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, yes.  But of course, in the -- in the past, we are making a prediction of about what efficiencies will be realized, and in the future we know.  So the one thing that we don't know, since life is risky, or we do know for sure, is whatever it shows up to be in the future couldn't have been the value that shareholders would have put on it in the past, because they know life a risky.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The reason that that is relevant here of course is this number 9 is a made-up number.  It may be made up by great experts, but since they are all not geniuses who are -- own the whole world, they must not be perfect experts.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Isn't that true?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, it was a number picked by whatever company had, what is it, the -- the lowest price earnings ratio or something like that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  But that doesn't -- that means whatever company that the shareholders thought would deviate the least from whatever the return was and that doesn't apply -- but you don't want a lecture from me on this subject.  What I want is an answer from you, and the answer I want from you is this.  As I read it and once understand that this number is a semi made-up number, I did look at that second term and I thought that.23 times 9 is about 2 years' worth -- about 2 years' worth of profits that would be expected, all things left out of it except profit.  So then once I saw that, I looked at the first term.  And the first term seemed to me to be their actual profit.  Their actual profit on an annual basis multiplied by about the same number, you see.  And so what we do is we take -- about multiplying, see -- so we take about two years' worth of profit that they actually made and we subtract from that two years' worth that our experts tell us they should have made on the basis of the original market price.  The rest is excess profit and we seize all of it.  For two years only.  And by the way, if a company had only six months' worth, well, then, you know, they might really be hurt, because after all, they only earned six months at the annual rate that showed something, and maybe they didn't really earn it over the next 18 months.  But the reply was there was no such company.  And, of course, because time periods vary, rates will vary.  But I don't know that that matters for an income tax.  It's not a question of the rate; it's a question on what you impose it.  And you impose it on income, because as he says, there are two choices here.  Number is really calculated on the basis of income and there is another number going on, the actual floatation value and this third thing, which is called the number 9.  But primarily it is the income that makes the difference.  Now, that's his argument.  What's your response?  That's his argument as I understand it.  I don't want to put words in his mouth.  But you -- you explain it to me.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I said, so what?  Now, you can answer that by saying, no, it's not so what.  I mean, isn't an income tax dependant upon whether it's a tax on income, not the rate?  And -- and whether some companies pay a high rate and others pay a low rate, even if that's totally arbitrary, wouldn't make a definition to the characterization.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  As long as you're not -- they actually have the gross income from which this comes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, it will.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  It is greater than the profit they earned during the year, but it is not greater than the profit that they earned during the two years, or whatever the period is that everybody's paying this on.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  So here, by good luck for them or bad luck for you or whatever it is, they have not taxed more than the gross income of the companies.  Is that--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Four-year period.  Well, that's -- well -- well, is it not going to be an income tax if what the U.S. Government says, though it hasn't said it, it could say, we want -- we want 35 percent of what you earn over six years.  Okay.  That's what we want.  Now, that's still an income tax, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you say whatever -- if they impose it on more than a year, any country that calculates the income tax over a period for more than a year is outside the tax treaty because it's essential to the nature of the American income tax system that it be calculated year by year.  You're hesitating to say that, but I think--   Stephen G. Breyer  --On that -- on the question of how to treat, I -- there isn't authority but, I mean, if I'm quite honest about how I think about it, I think the people in the tax court actually usually know more about it than the judges who are not on the tax court.  And so when I get an opinion and the tax court all thinks one thing and then the Court of Appeals is thinking something else and it's highly technical, I -- I tend to be tempted to say, Well, the tax courts deserve something.  Now, is there anything, really, or am I just doing that wrong if I did that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If the reformulation -- think of -- think that first term.  Put it in your mind.  That first term does have a number --.23 -- and let's do times 9, which is that valuation business.  And what you get is a little over 2.  Okay?  And you are going to get that every time.  That's not going to vary from company to company.  That varies as long as the universe is here.  So we know we're going to multiply.2 -- rather, 2 point something times that first part of the first term.  And that first part of the first term consists of nothing other than, for the four-year company, the average one-year profit.  So the only -- what you are telling people to do in that first term is simply multiply by a little over than 2, a little more than 2, the average profit earned over a four-year period.  That's what it says.  So there is nothing there but income.  It's average income, I grant you.  But there is nothing there but income.  And then what you subtract from that, what you subtract from that is a quarter -- is a quarter of the value, I grant you.  But it's a hypothetical value used with the number 9 of what one-quarter of the value of the floatation price taken in.  So there's an aspect to it that does have -- unless you do it the way I was doing it initially, there is an aspect to it that does concern at least a hypothetical value.  But the heart of the equation in determining this so-called present value is nothing other than taking average income over the four-year period.  Now, if I'm right -- am I right about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  It is -- the very first part of the first part is the profits, the average profit over the four-year period.  It says P.  And then P with all this day business, that's just times 365 because they want to annualize it.  So if you have a four years, what you are going to have is you will have 365 times -- and then it's going to wipe out and you will have divided by 4.  So you will take the total profit over the four-year period, and you'll divide it by 4.  That gives you the annual profit.  So now we have finished the first half of the first part.  And the second half -- and we are going to take.23 of that.  Okay?  No, we are not going to take any yet.  Taking.23 -- you're going to take.23 of the number 9, and that leaves you with the 2 -- that brings you to the little over 2.2.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what we are doing is taking the average annual profit over a four-year period.  We average it, and then we multiply it by two point something.  Okay?  And what that is doing -- then what that is doing is getting you just the average annual?  Two years' worth of average annual.  And from that, we subtract a quarter of what they received in the initial price, which happens to be what the market -- if it really was 9 -- about what it was expecting it to earn during a two-year period.  That's why I put in the last part.  But even if I am wrong about that, I am right about the first half, aren't I?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's why I said 50 percent.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that rate could be a problem for somebody at some time in some place.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It wasn't a problem here because all of these companies but one did have and did fit within the four-year category.  So as to all these companies but one, it did not exceed gross income; it did not exceed net income; it was 50 -- what the number that he arrived at.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Of the one year, you haven't calculated on one year, but it's 50 percent of two years, isn't it?  I'm sorry, I am now confused enough that I--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  I have said enough -- my law clerks would have picked this up.  They would have written it down and I will be able to go back with the transcript to study it, which I will do.  [Laughter]   ",12-43XX
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's right.  All right.  But now the question I have, which is, I think, for anyone who wants to answer it, particularly the government.  I absolutely agree with you that -- that a free market in price is at the heart of the Deregulation Act.  Given.  I also think frequent flyer programs are simply price discounts.  I also think that if you don't have contracts, you can't have free markets.  But I also think the State cannot, under the guise of contract law, regulate the prices of airlines.  If you allow that, you're going to have worse than we ever had.  It'll be 50 different systems, all right?  So, if I think those four things, what standard do I use to separate when a State is and when it is not using its contract law to regulate prices?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, good.  Then you'll give me the answer, because where I'm missing is what the standard is.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING ",12-462X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you would agree -- it's the same question I asked the government; I would like your answer.  I imagine that you would agree that a State says the following: We read into -- like common law courts used to do all the time, for a transportation company we believe the price must be fair and reasonable, and a contract in our State for transportation prices has to set a fair and reasonable price and I personally think many fares are not reasonable.  They are too high.  All right.  And therefore we have substituted the judges and the States for setting prices instead of the parties.  You agree that would be preempted?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, so what is your standard for distinguishing what is and is not preempted where the State uses its contract law to imply a fair and reasonable term?   Stephen G. Breyer  That isn't what your -- your complaint that I think -- paragraph 56, which I think is the key paragraph says, that the -- under the -- the law is,  ""The contract law that you want to enforce is even where a party to a contract is given absolute discretion, it must exercise that discretion in good faith in a manner consistent with the reasonable expectations of the other party or parties. ""  Now, that's, I think, what they're objecting to.  Because there, it sounds to me like I go in to, you know, get a ticket, my reasonable expectation is they're not going to charge me what they're going to charge, you know.  I mean, it's unbelievable.  But there -- but, you see, that's my reasonable expectation, and I'm the other party.  And so that clause sounds as if you could, under State contract law, govern the price according to my reasonable expectation, namely, the consumer, that might be a great idea, but I don't think that's the idea behind this act.  That's what -- what -- that's what I just read you.  So what do you say about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't see anything in the complaint about anything other than airlines.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there anything in your complaint that talks about anything other than airlines?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I know.  But I mean, what we are taking about is what Count 2 of the complaint says.  I think that's their objection.  But as far as Count 2 of the complaint says, it's about airline miles, I take it, and airline miles are used on airlines, etcetera.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if there is something else in this complaint, tell me and I will have to figure out whether we go beyond the complaint.   Stephen G. Breyer  Does it say that in the complaint?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And an airline partner, I take it, is another airline?   Stephen G. Breyer  So if I want to find out about that in the record, where do I look?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All there is, is the complaint and it doesn't talk about it in the complaint.  What I'm thinking about, obviously, is we might preserve that question for another day.   INTERRUPTING ",12-462X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  They do that, fine, done.  What we interpret the statute as saying under constitutional compulsion, it uses the word “ may ”, and if the magistrate concludes that there is -- after all, the basic principle of hearings is you don't need a hearing where there's nothing to have a hearing about.  So unless the defendant demonstrates that there is a sound reason to believe that the grand jury was wrong, they only heard one side of the story, and that there is no probable cause, you don't have to give him a hearing.  But the word is “ may ”.  And so, like five circuits, Mr. Magistrate, if you think that there is a good chance -- phrase that as you want -- that they can show that the grand jury was wrong and they want the money to pay a lawyer -- by the way, without a good lawyer, they're never going to make their case -- and then under those circumstances, the magistrate may.  Now, that's a narrow exception.  It preserves the lawyer.  It's consistent with the words of the statute.  It respects the grand jury, at least to the same extent that bail hearings -- and when you have -- oh, yes, and probably I could think of a few others or something.  But the -- it's not undercutting the grand jury.  What's wrong with it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, it leaves open -- it leaves open the question in Monsanto explicitly.  And the only change that I've made with that explicit leaving open the due process question in the footnote in Monsanto is, instead of turning it on the Constitution, I turned it on the principle of constitutional avoidance.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You say “ never ” is consistently, and I think it is consistent with the footnote.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It didn't actually.  What it says is, we reject the discretion in the context of Judge Widener having said that even where there is probable cause, we are going to balance a lot of factors, and what it says at the -- wait, I had it a second ago.  I'll find it again.  It says at the top of the next page, it says that the “ may ” thing refers to that.  I'll get it for you later.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Here it is.  It says,  ""Thus, it's plainly aimed at implementing the commands at 853(a) and cannot sensibly be construed to give the district court discretion to permit the dissipation of the very property that 853(a) requires to be forfeited upon conviction. ""  Okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly.  That's what it says.  So the claim here is this is property that 850(a)(3)(A) does not require the defendant to forfeit upon conviction, for there can be no conviction because there is no evidence and, therefore, I don't find that that sentence in Monsanto destroys the use of the word which Congress put in, “ may ”.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So far this is very conceptual, which is absolutely fine.  I just want to leave that plain for a moment, and if I leave the conceptual plain, what I find is that they have a pretty complicated case.  They are saying that this, the defendant, took some medical devices with permission from hospitals that were old and used, and he didn't return them to the manufacturer, who didn't want them.  And what he did is he figured out this way of selling them and making money.  Now, they are saying that's not that and you're saying it is that, and so to make the arguments is complicated.  You can't do it without a good lawyer.  He has some money here to hire a lawyer and you say, oh, but it will undercut the grand jury.  You say, this has been the law in five circuits and the government has not come to the end of its prosecutions, it hasn't injured prosecutions.  So as a purely practical matter, First Amendment, no real harm to the government that I can see.  And so let's impose some kind of statutory limitation on use of this, but where there is a good claim for it, let it be used.   Stephen G. Breyer  Has that happened in the circuits that have permitted this?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You know, I think in the circuit, you've now given us some statistics.  So in how many cases in the circuits that have permitted what they want or my version of it, the circuits that have permitted some form of allowing the magistrate to look behind the grand jury indictment in appropriate cases and find that it's there, there is no probable cause, so you can use this to hire a lawyer.  There are a bunch of circuits that have had rules like that.  In how many cases in those circuits has the government faced the serious risks that you're talking about?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can you give me a guess?  You are -- I mean, you make a huge point of how this will put the government at a disadvantage, so someone in your office, probably you, asked people in the Justice Department, do you have any examples?  Or how many cases have there been where these serious problems arose?  And you probably got some kind of answer.  So you probably have some kind of idea.   Stephen G. Breyer  How many anecdotes?  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  In a number of cases, several specific.  Is that more like four or is it more like 24?   Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask you a related question, since it came up.  I was curious as to how much of this forfeiture money gets to victims.  So the best we could do is looking up three years and on the basis of the figures that I got out of the DOJ on that, about 25, 20 to 25 percent goes to a category called third-party interest.  Now, the third-party interest includes mortgagees, it includes other creditors, it includes States, who want taxes, etcetera.  And if you subtract all those, a rough guess would be 5 or 10 percent goes to victims.  Now do you have a better estimate?   Stephen G. Breyer  That is what the -- if you look at the actual amount in general.  But the interests at issue here are: One, this money goes to pay for a lawyer so the person can prove that there is not even a claim against him; and the risks, of course, sometimes of depriving the recipients of the forfeiture moneys and those would normally be, almost entirely, the DOJ for the expenses of going to the forfeiture expense of the trial.  It would -- various criminal justice organizations on the prosecution side, States, who want taxes.  Very little is being deprived of victims.  Is that a fair comment?   ",12-464X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is -- is this a violation of Title VII?  I don't know the answer.  Smith works for Jones.  Jones' whole job is to supervise Smith and be certain that Smith, a well-known racist, has kept his racism under control.  He didn't.  Smith -- they fired someone -- Smith did -- did some terrible thing and got rid of somebody for racist reasons.  He tells his boss.  His boss knows it.  His boss does nothing about it.  All right?  Is the boss violating Section VII?  He -- he had no reason for doing nothing about it.  He himself wasn't a racist.  It was just his job.  But he didn't.  Is he -- is he violated Section VII?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The immediate supervisor does.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, yes, yes.  Okay.  So there what we have is somebody is guilty under Section VII.  Even though that individual did not himself discriminate on the basis of race, it was circumstances where the subordinate discriminated on the basis of race.  All right?  And yet the -- there's no doubt that m applies to that.  M applies to that, I imagine, unless you're going to start distinguishing within Title VII, are you going to say m doesn't apply to that.  My question's going to be, if m applies to that, then why doesn't it also apply here?  Because you see here, what you have is -- it's at one removed.  It is the individual who is retaliating been retaliated against.  That individual did not discriminate on the basis of race, nor did the individual in Farr read into it, but the whole thing is based on race.  And if sometimes under Section VII simpliciter, people are guilty although the race motive -- the race involvement is one level down.  Why wouldn't you -- that perhaps is too complicated a question, and if you only have five minutes left, so I will take your answer as being,  ""Judge, you better think this out on your own. ""  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  I would say you are better off keeping your time.   ",12-484X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I would just like to get to what I think is one of their arguments and I'm having some -- the argument is purely linguistic, all right?  And they say, read m.  M says race is a motivating factor in an unfair employment situation.  Now, we look to what the unfair employment situation is at the beginning unfair employment practice.  It is to dismiss a person because of race, all right?  So obviously, it applies.  Now we look to the definition that we're at issue in here.  It says it's an unfair labor practice to dismiss a person because of retaliation.  Now, retaliation for what?  For race, that's true.  But we're -- we couldn't care less about whether that race is part or a little bit or it's all -- it could even be totally unjustified.  What we're interested in is the retaliation.  So they say, you see, the words of (m) do not speak about race.  They speak about retaliation.  They speak about race.  So, whatever the policy reasons are, you can't do it any more than if you have a statute that refers to carrots and you try to put in a beet.  You just can't do it.  Now, that's the answer -- I -- I would like to hear an answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you have to say retribution for race is race.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now -- now, what I was looking for, perhaps without success, is some other example that has nothing to do with retribution, but where that's clearly so.  That's why the example came into my mind that it is possible that you could, under the basic unfair employment section, find a person liable of race discrimination even though that person himself was not motivated by race, but perhaps had an obligation to report a race discrimination, which he failed to do because he wanted to go to the racetrack.  You see?  I'm looking for some other -- is there any other example in the history of these statutes where we've said, you, Mr. Jones or Ms. Smith, you are guilty of race discrimination, even though that's because of your responsibilities, because of what you did or didn't do, it's not because you yourself held the motive, but you -- you'd attribute the motive to them for reasons to do with the statute.  Is there -- does that ring any bell at all?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I have looked--   ",12-484X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The question is this: Three situations.  I think it's the same question Justice Kennedy was driving at.  One, France opens up a casino.   Stephen G. Breyer  Two, California opens up a casino.   Stephen G. Breyer  Three, an Indian tribe opens up a casino, okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what is it that says that the State where the casino is located can sue France?  What is it that says it can sue California?  All -- they all object.  What is it that says it can sue the Indian tribe?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Was that a statute or common law?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  California?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  All those are common law.  Both--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Then what do you do about Kiowa?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You know, but the question specifically then -- I think we're driving at the same thing -- is, remember, you just cited to me two cases--   Stephen G. Breyer  --one involving France and one involving California.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I had assumed -- but maybe I was wrong to assume -- that when I read those cases, I will see, although a State can sue France, although Nevada can sue California, a private individual could not.  Am I going to find that when I read those two cases?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now I think the answer to Justice Kagan is I'm not going to find it.  So we're looking for authority, back to Justice Kennedy, that will support your proposition that the State could sue France, Nevada could sue California, but a private individual could not.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what you're asking us to do then, if the answer is what I now think you're saying, is to say it's awfully complicated that although a State could sue an Indian tribe for something that is outside the reservation, the State -- it's so complicated that I'd like some good authority for it, because a private person couldn't, but a State could sue and it's only in certain places.   Stephen G. Breyer  How about drawing the line with Kiowa?   Stephen G. Breyer  He's adding one thing, which is as you've just heard, that the Indian tribes are in the same Eleventh Amendment type position as the principality of Monaco before the treaty.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They didn't participate in the convention and the principality of Monaco was held to be immune, presumably, even from commercial activity.  Let Congress change it.  That's what Kiowa says.  And that I think is their basic argument.  And if it's a wash -- I mean, I hate to put it this way because it sounds like a joke, but it isn't meant to be -- in this case, if it's a wash, follow the precedent.   ",12-515X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but he was wrong on that apparently if that's what he says.  He was wrong.  That if we look at the cases, what we will see is it was the courts that said there's a common law abrogation of France's sovereign immunity when they go into business in downtown Iowa somewhere.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The same thing -- same thing with the State he says in Nevada and California and then he says it would be totally anomalous to think that an Indian tribe could go into downtown Des Moines and open up a clearly illegal business, and you could sue France -- the State, which was not Kiowa -- they could sue -- France could -- the State could sue France, it could sue California, but it couldn't sue the Indian tribe.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  What about the California and Nevada?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Kiowa is about -- Kiowa is about individuals who are not the State.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  I'll look at those with care.  But now, assuming you are right on that, is the question in front of us, on the assumption that these are Indian lands, does the Indian tribe have sovereign immunity?  Is that the question you want answered?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes or no?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you want us to say on that assumption -- now, on that assumption, I look at i and number ii under a, 7(a), and a quick reading of them suggests to me that they're in parallel.  That the Indian tribe can sue the State when the State won't open negotiations and the State or an Indian tribe can sue the Indian tribe when the Indian tribe refuses to follow the compact.  Now, what's your answer to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I know.  But you said to decide this on the assumption that it's on Indian lands.  If I make that assumption and then I look over and read Romanette i and Romanette ii, it sounds as if, as I said, Romanette i, the tribe can sue the State to get the compact.  Romanette ii, the State can sue the tribe when it violates the compact.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's why I want to -- I'm trying to get what question I'm supposed to answer.  If I'm supposed to answer the sovereign immunity question on the assumption that these are Indian lands contrary to what was decided below, I might get one answer.  But if I'm decide -- supposed to do it on the assumption that they're not Indian lands, I might get a different answer.  What assumption am I supposed to make?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you are prepared to live with the following.  Is it the case that if California opens a business in a commercial activity in 20 other States, at least one of which it is totally illegal, this other State, say Utah, cannot -- can sue California or not, what's the answer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what the opposition says in your view is absolutely correct, that a foreign nation opens up an illegal business in a State.  The State can sue them now because of a treaty, but previously because of the common law.  California opens up an illegal business, the State can put them out of business by bringing a suit.  Bust an Indian tribe, they can't?  That's the United States view.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm saying that is your view, I just want the bottom line.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why?  Because you are representing the United States.  You understand Indian policy.  This case has tremendous implications if we follow your approach.  It seems to me well beyond anything to do with gaming.  My belief is Indian tribes all over the country, operate businesses off the reservation, and businesses all over the country are regulated.  And does the State, I guess, in your view does not have the power to enforce the regulation against the Indian tribe.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not against the tribe itself.  Why is that in the Indian tribe's interest?  And is it a trap for the unwary lawyer?  And how is this supposed to work out in your view?   ",12-515X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What's -- what's your point?  If it's not part of the towing law, then it's further removed.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, I guess you could have thousands of claims across the country, millions of claims where there are all kinds of towing laws.  And, you know, it says in Cambridge, Massachusetts park your car here during a snow emergency, it will be towed.  Probably every northeastern country has laws like that.  I guess there could be millions of negligence claims when the thing is towed, the guy broke a headlight.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And are all those things preempted?  I would be amazed.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then what's the difference between this and -- and what could arise any day of the week?  I mean, as I read your brief, I -- are you saying that all the northeast statutes that say your car will be towed if you park here during a snow emergency, what happens?  I mean, do they have to go to the Department of Transportation?  Boston couldn't function.  I know that they do tow cars.  I don't know that firsthand, but I've seen it.  [Laughter]  So how's it supposed to work?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, all right, there isn't in this case, but I'm curious to know how it works, because it seemed to me from what you're arguing, all the abandoned motor vehicle laws and all the snow emergency towing and everything else that I see every day would be preempted a fortiori.  So you tell me how it all works.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, there's a lot of language in the majority pretty much along the line that Justice Scalia said.  And I might mention that point.  I mean, Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority, and she said the reference to regulatory authority of a State, which is a different reference, I agree, should be read to preserve, not preempt traditional prerogative for the State.  And Justice White said previously that you have to start with the idea that this is -- historic police powers of the State are not going to be superseded by the Act, unless it's a clear manifest purpose of Congress.  So I guess the problem is, with a lot of the other things, that you yourself are in an area that is a traditional matter of State regulation.  It is, in fact, regulated in a way that applies to everybody.  It is indirectly related to the transport itself, and that it takes place on -- about storage that took place after the event.  So you have all that working against you.  Now, the Columbus case does offer some hope for the other side, I would think.  But what do you think?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.   INTERRUPTING ",12-52XX
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, don't lose that.  I will ask you this question to, which favors you in a sense but I want the answer really from the Solicitor General who may know.  But I'm going to ask it to you, too, because you've probably both thought about it.  He may have -- they may have some experience on it.  If you start talking about significant effect, without those last words, “ deregulatory purpose ” I suddenly worry about the following: That every city in the United States depends upon towing to regulate parking within the city.  We couldn't function without it, although none of us like it.  We know that it's necessary.  And certainly a law that provides for towing does directly regulate the service of the tow truck.  It says do it.  And then it tells you when not to do it.  So what's the -- what happens?  Is every traffic law in the United States involving towing suddenly preempted?  I can't believe that.  How does this work?  So there is much more significance in this case than the words we write, perhaps, than in the particular case.  And now, do you want to, in light of what my concern is, add anything to what you say.  And you may not, the Solicitor General might, but I'd like to hear anything you have to say about that.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, you -- you can just rest on that, but I'm going to have -- or somebody's going to have to write an opinion.  And we could just say that, but I -- I don't see I can -- my own problem is not being able to have an intelligent answer to that without having some answer to the bigger picture.  And the bigger picture seems to me horrendously important.  And -- and I don't know what that answer is.  You seem to be getting there with the words “ deregulatory purpose ”.  And I -- and I was thinking how we might try to work with those, but go ahead.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, I think it's much harder than this case--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --because the relationship is -- is in the -- in the more general case is more direct to the tow truck.  It says “ go tow ”.  And that's -- that's why I need some kind of bigger picture.   Stephen G. Breyer  We have a statute which says, if you park your car here for more than 3 hours, you will be towed, okay?  And as part of that statute, though we don't see it, there is an arrangement for the service of the city with the tow truck company, which says when the parking person calls you and says -- the meter says red, yellow, purple, green, you are to go there and tow, okay?  Doesn't that sound as if it's regulating the service of tow trucks?  And I suspect across the country, there is some variation on that theme, but there are thousands of them.  And since the words -- I would be repeating it -- the words of this case may affect that situation, I want to know what you know, which may not be very much -- I don't blame you -- about that broader situation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or the opposite.   Stephen G. Breyer  And they're -- they're very attractive places except in the winter.  But a -- a motor carrier vehicle -- a service, transportation includes related to the movement of passengers or property.  Related to the movement of passengers or property.  So we have these words “ related to ” again.  I -- well, you've given me a couple of ideas, but I -- maybe they'll turn out not to be relevant, but -- but -- which I hope.   Stephen G. Breyer  It seems to me we have two choices.  In Morales, since I can mock my own opinions, I wrote at the end,  ""it's not -- when it's too tenuous, remote or peripheral. ""  That's singularly unhelpful.  [Laughter]  It seems to -- there--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes, you were right.  There are two directions you could go.  But first I would like to know, it seems my guess is it is universally thought by cities that this Act does not preempt their normal parking regulations.  Am I right about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Then we either have to take this tenuous, etcetera, this is too much, this isn't too much, da, da, da, or you've given -- there is another thought being thrown out and that is you relate it to the basic purposes of the deregulation act and you say that where the city is regulating something that never was, could not be, and is not part of a regulated or deregulated market, i.e., has nothing to do with the subject matter, then it is not preempted.  Now, do you want us to take that approach?  Should we punt and just use the words like “ tenuous ” or -- and if we take the implicit suggestion, what's the right way to do it?   ",12-52XX
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  How is that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, all these were there at -- but for one -- were there at the time of Buckley vs. Valeo, and I guess the Court thought something could happen like the following: Candidate Smith, we can only give him $2600, but he has a lot of supporters.  And each of them, 40 of them gets a brainstorm.  And each of the 40 puts on the internet a little sign that says, Sam Smith PAC.  This money goes to people like Sam Smith.  Great people.  Now, we can give each of those 40 $5,000.  They aren't coordinated, they're not established by a single person.  Each is independently run.  And we know pretty well that that total of $5,000 times 40 will go to Sam Smith.  Okay?  What does that violate?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  $5,000.   Stephen G. Breyer  $5,000.  So we all have is my $5,000 going to the PAC and there happened to be 400 <PACs> [= PACs].  So 5,000 times -- 4,000.  Five times 40, five times 400, how much is that?  I'm not too good at math.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  There is no earmarking--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --because earmarking requires that you write on a check or in an accompanying letter that you want the money to go to something.   Stephen G. Breyer  It does not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  They'll contribute to several because they'll get more than one contribution.   Stephen G. Breyer  All we're trying to do, because it's hard to do in oral argument.  But what we're trying to do in both, I think, our cases is that we looked up all the rules and the regs -- or my law clerk did -- and -- and what she discovered, and it may be wrong because I'll look at it again, is there has been no significant change in the earmarking rules, in any of the rules that you're talking about, but for one, change since Buckley.  The one change, the one change is the change that all contributions made by political committees established by or financed or maintained or controlled by a single person will count as one.  So what you're seeing in these hypotheticals is simply the construction of precisely the same situation that existed in Buckley while being careful to have not one person control the 4,000 PACs, which is pretty easy to do.  And if you want to say, is this a reality?  Turn on your television set or internet.  Because we found instances, without naming names, where it certainly is a reality.   Stephen G. Breyer  Here is the actual ad, the actual ad.  I won't name the candidate.  You see a picture of the candidate.  There is a sign that says “ Smith PAC ”.  That's what it says.  And then it says,  ""Make a donation to help Smith PAC support Republican. ""  if you like, or “ Democratic candidates ”.  Period.  And then they have an address.  All right.  Now, it doesn't take a genius to figure out what they're going to do with the money and that maybe Smith will get a pretty good share of it.  Now, if Smith has 400 people who figure this out, he will have 400 times 5,000 times one person.  Now, you say that really couldn't happen because of the designation.  We haven't found a designation rule that would stop it.  But then Justice Sotomayor is saying: I don't know.  And I don't either, because there's been no hearing, there's been no evidence presented.  There is nothing but dismissal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So -- So I read in one summer before BCRA, I spent several weeks reading the record before the district court in that very lengthy case on this.  And it was filled with testimony by senators and congressmen that a handful of people can give hundreds of thousands of dollars, they know who those people are, and that those people do have undue influence, which means in First Amendment terms that the individual who, in fact, has wonderful ideas and convinces others, even by paying three cents to buy the internet or something, hasn't a shot because it will influence people, not ideas, but the money.  Now, there was a record on that.  Here there is no record showing whether this aspect does or does not have the same tendency.  That is why I ask: How can I decide this on the basis of theory when the record previously showed the contrary of what's been argued, and in fact at least might show that even in respect to these limits?     Well, Your -- Your Honor, this case comes to the Court as an as-applied challenge.  Mr. McCutcheon does not want to go through -- does not want to go through the committees you're talking about.  He wants to write checks directly to the candidates and directly to the committees.  He is constrained by the aggregate limit.   ",12-536X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That actually does very much -- while I don't -- I'm looking for an answer here.  It's not that I have one at all.  It is rather basic, the point I think that's being made now.  I mean, as I understand it, the whole reason -- it is no doubt that campaign limits take an ordinary person and they say: You cannot give more than such-and-such an amount.  There are apparently, from the Internet, 200 people in the United States who would like to give $117,000 or more.  We're telling them: You can't; you can't support your beliefs.  That is a First Amendment negative.  But that tends to be justified on the other side by the First Amendment positive, because if the average person thinks that what he says exercising his First Amendment rights just can't have an impact through public opinion upon his representative, he says: What is the point of the First Amendment?  And that's a First Amendment point.  All right.  So that's basic, I think.  Now, once that's so, Congress has leeway.  And you are saying, and I have seen all over the place, that that's why we don't want those 200 people to spend more than 117 or 120,000 because the average person thinks the election is -- after the election all the actions are affected by the pocketbook and not by the merits of the First Amendment arguments.  Okay.  And now you say the person can do the same thing anyway; just call it independent.  And what independent does, he can spend 40 million.  He can spend 50 million.  And all that does is sort of mix up the messages because the parties can't control it.  Now, that's, I think, the question that's being asked.  And I think that that is a very serious question, and I'd like to know what flows from it.  Is it true?  So what?  What are we supposed to do?  What is your opinion about that question?   Stephen G. Breyer  So what would you think?  I was just listening to your dialogue, and you heard -- this is pretty tough, we try to construct some hypotheticals, and -- and the counsel says, oh, I've got this part wrong or that part wrong or the other one, and they may be right.  And we can't do this, figuring out all these factual things in an hour, frankly.  And they may be right; I'm not sure.  There hasn't been a full hearing.  It seemed to me there are things to explore in respect to the circumvention.  Who is right?  Should you change the hypothetical slightly, or what?  There are things to explore in respect to the question of whether being able to write a $3.6 million check to a lot of people does leave the average person to think, my First Amendment speech in terms of influencing my representative means nothing.  There are things to explore in terms of the relationship between what is permissible; namely, spend $40 million independently.  And what isn't permissible; namely, spending more than 117,000.  None of these have been considered.  They would seem relevant.  So what do you think about going into these matters in a district court where the evidentiary aspects of them can be explored at some length?   ",12-536X

Was there any other case in which the same pattern of facts and they said the same thing as Lynch?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, but we -- we have Lynch on one side.  Is there any case -- this is an intermediate appeals court -- is there any case in which the defendant says, I would like to raise it, the judge says no, convicted, appeal, and the intermediate court of appeals says: Defendant, you are wrong?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  And so all this period from 1973 until 1995 or whatever--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Carpenter.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  2001.  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  There is exactly one case on point which does favor you, and there are zero cases that favor them; is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, Mangiapane was a -- a lot of words, but the holding was not notice; isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  So we've got one.  That's -- I'm trying to find out what the state of the art.   Stephen G. Breyer  The state of the art is one for you, zero for them.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There were no others, and now I've reduced your one to nothing to like.01 to nothing, because it favors you, Lynch, yes, as the Chief Justice just pointed out, and now you've already said there were no other cases.   Stephen G. Breyer  But that's because -- everybody agrees with you, I think -- I agree with you on this anyway.  I agree the bar puts it in the instructions, and if the bar puts it in the instructions, people tend to follow it.  That's true.  So it's not surprising that a lot of people tend to follow it.  But as far as court decisions are concerned, we have no -- what I'm trying to think of is a pre-statute.  I give you a little credit on that.  That's Lynch.  Pre-statute, and we have what I might sort of exaggeratedly refer to as the great mentioner.  We've noticed the great mentioner is often wrong, and -- and here, even though there are judicial mentioners, they get something.  I don't know how much in the scale to -- to give them.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can you think of a Federal case where -- I see what we have.  I'm now adding up the something for Lynch, the something for the bar, which is a -- which is a something, and -- and then the fact that some courts have quite, not surprisingly, tended to follow it and there were others that mentioned it favorably, but not the Michigan Supreme Court.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So -- so we've got that.  Now, actually, that Kentucky case, was it?  Tennessee?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, Rogers.  That went against you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But can you think of any Federal precedent on this issue that's come even close to that being sufficient?  What's your best?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The alternative is you are going to allow the bar associations, helpful as they are, by writing instructions to determine issues that courts themselves have never determined, or at least not authoritative supreme courts.  And that's a worrying matter where you are trying to create coherent systems of law.   ",12-547X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  How does it not?  “ Partnership items ” is defined to include legal and factual determinations that underlie the determination, among other things, of income, credit, gain/loss.  Okay.  Whether there is a partnership at all does underlie the determination of whether the partnership return, which had all kinds of numbers on it, if it shows anything.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So therefore it's a partnership item.  Does this penalty relate to a partnership item?  I don't want to say that you are right for the wrong reasons, so you better be sure I'm right.  That is, the -- the -- does it relate to a partnership item?  I just told you what a partnership item was.  It certainly seems to because zero is what it relates to.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So what?   Stephen G. Breyer  So what?  That is, I mean, as I understand it, you agree that on the partnership level, the IRS could say the following in a hypothetical I'll now give you: The partnership says that this asset has a basis of $10 million.  We sold it for 8.  Therefore, the partnership has a loss of 2.  The IRS says the real value is not $10 million basis, it was a $2 million basis, and therefore, in fact, you don't have a loss of 2, you have a gain of 8.  Moreover, your understatement was more than 400 percent or whatever the percent is, you know, it was a -- it was huge.  It was an $8 million, you know, overstatement, and therefore, penalties of 400 percent attach.  Okay?  You agree they can say that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  At the -- I'm correct.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  I understand you're making this.  But what they've actually done there, since it doesn't say anything about inside/outside, is they're saying: Partners, to the extent that you use this on your own return, remember, there's a 400 percent penalty attached.  You agree they can do that.  Now, what they've done here is they've said: There is no partnership.  So, to the extent that you use this as your -- as a basis, as you use this on your individual return, remember there's a 400 percent penalty attached, because 4 times zero or whatever it is.  You understand the mathematics.  So we haven't got any reference to inside/outside basis here.  In both cases, it seems to me they're doing roughly the same thing.  And so where in the statute does it say they can't do it?  They're saying, indeed, a penalty attaches to--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --the use of this partnership by you, the partner, to reduce your taxes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, to the extent you don't use it, of course, you don't have to pay anything.  But to the extent you use it, you have to pay whatever it is plus the 400 percent.   Stephen G. Breyer  So then the question is -- the question is, do the words “ partnership item ” in the section “ scope of judicial review ” refer only to those items that the partnership in fact is concerned with?  Or do they consider the partnership itself?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's the issue.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We're interpreting the word “ partnership items ” in that statute, and you are saying the partnership itself is not a partnership item.   Stephen G. Breyer  What?  No?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, no, no.  But I'm -- that's just a question of how they use it on the return.  There are many ways in which a person could use a partnership item on the return.  If this is a partnership item -- I mean, a person might, for example, have no tax, in which case--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I understand how someone could be confused, and I am genuinely confused.  I have read this several times.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the reason I'm confused is this: That I -- I understand your difference between the outside basis and the inside basis.  Now what I'm trying to do is to figure out, via the statute, I think like what Justice Scalia was trying to do, I think, where does that matter?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I understand that, too.  I'm just trying to get the precise words of the statute that it would make a difference, because in common sense it doesn't seem to me to make much difference, but -- but maybe in this statutory language it does.  So I want to know what words.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now you just told me.  I said that, I thought, and you said, no, it didn't, those weren't the right words.  But if you say those are the right words, then explain to me why a partnership item cannot include a partnership itself.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Try with me again.  Again, just try once more.  Suppose that a person owes a gift tax and what he gave to his children or whatever was in part an interest in a partnership.  Now go back to my example, all right, because I want to get -- my example is everybody agrees that the 8, 10 million versus 8 million, there's a penalty attached.  Well, he -- he doesn't take that into account when he gives the gift.  Now, if he did give the gift, it would -- he'd have to pay a tax on the gift, on his gift tax return.  Okay?  He -- they assess that on the -- they would assess that, wouldn't they, even though it's a gift tax return, not an -- not an income tax return.  MR. GARRE.  Right.  I mean ultimately--  --Okay.  So no matter what kind of return you use, no matter what the tax situation, if the partnership real -- real value makes a difference, you have to put it in, don't you?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, yes, in individual gift tax return.  Maybe it's in a State tax return.  Maybe it's an income tax return.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So it affects the taxpayer differently, and I'm just saying, why does it matter?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --that the way this affects the taxpayer is through what you call his outside basis.  Why does that matter?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, yes, yes.  But of course any -- in my example, too, it will vary.  Of course it will vary.  Some people will use -- have no tax to pay, no extra tax, because their -- their income tax that they paid was zero.  In fact, the government owed them a refund, so it didn't matter.  It varies in many ways.  So since it varies in many ways and varies by many returns, it might vary depending upon whether it affected your outside basis or something else.   INTERRUPTING ",12-562X

To take your example, my question is this: There could -- you say there are many, many, many cases.  We could get this all mixed up if we don't follow your rule.  All I want you to do is cite me a few, but the few that I want you to cite me will meet certain criteria.   Stephen G. Breyer  For example, a college student goes into the bookstore, and it's also a pharmacy, by the way.  And he breaks his finger in the door.  It's his fault.  He says: I am going home; send me some bandages.  The store never does.  ""Send me some books; I just bought them. ""  They know his home address, all right?  Injury.  Now, what about those?  Cite me some lower cases where they say there is jurisdiction in cases like that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  ""Oh, I lost my billfold. ""  ""I lost it here in the store. ""  ""When you find it, will you send it back? ""  They never send it back, though they found it.  All right.  So just give me some lower court cases that finds jurisdiction in that kind of situation.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, the injury -- my goodness, he lost his billfold.  There was money in it.  And by the way, when he gets home, his parents are away, and he's not going to have any money to spend on food or even, like, CDs or anything.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There is no jurisdiction in those cases where he lost his billfold in the bookstore in the college town 1,000 miles away from home, and he's going home, and everybody knows he's never going to have any money, and they keep the money.  Okay.  What's the difference?  If there are no cases on those, what is the difference between that case and yours?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, give me the case that says that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is this is a case -- is this a case like -- I'll look at those cases.   Stephen G. Breyer  But is your case a case like where the credit card is used, somebody finds it in a bookstore and starts spending the money and did the agents here, who were outside Nevada and they were keeping the money, were they going and spending it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Was there a credit card that they were using?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I was trying to figure out just which cases I should read carefully and I will read those cases.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Well, there seems to be because it's hard to think of an internet case where a defendant wouldn't be having communications with people in the -- State, wouldn't be inviting business, wouldn't be doing all kinds of things.  So there are many kinds of internet cases, but I don't -- I don't automatically see in deciding this that we're deciding any on.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Like what?   Stephen G. Breyer  I wouldn't do that.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  What is the -- what are the elements of the second tort?   Stephen G. Breyer  And what is the element?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The other element?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How do I find that?  Because you see in the fraud case, the element includes the victims being misled.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But that's not necessarily true here.  I wonder--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --It has to be a misrepresentation--   Stephen G. Breyer  --material to.   Stephen G. Breyer  Material to?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not here, but material to -- normally it has to be material to the obtaining the, say, of property.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, where do I find the elements of the tort that you are alleging here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't see anything in the complaint that says anything like that.  It just says -- where do I look to see it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because one of the elements of the crime in the second case, no element of the crime or no element of the tort, it's only the injury which isn't an element of the actual underlying behavior that gives rise to and in the first case it's the other.  There is an element that takes place there.  That's what I'm looking for.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm looking for that.  I'm not saying that I have it.  That's why I asked you the question I did.   ",12-574X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Should we say anything about that?  I mean, one of the things he testified to, that is, the government expert testified to, to the defendant is one of those unusual people who was actually exposed to a variety of different people in his life.  He had people who were criminal types.  There were drug users.  He found himself identifying and looking up to people alternatively described as bad boys or outlaws, looking up to them, being impressed and awed by them, and in certain circumstances wanting to outdo them.  Well, that doesn't seem to have much to do with the issue that the defendant put into the -- wanted to put in, in the Federal court, which was he wanted to ask about his -- about his -- his words exactly are “ a defense of insanity ”, which can be interpreted broadly, namely whether you're insane or not.  So we both have the government expert saying no, he's not insane, and the government expert going on to give an explanation of why he shot the sheriff.  So is that -- is that, in your opinion, something we should say that's a serious question, whether that exceeds it, et cetera?  What should we say about it?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So your words would be because they have introduced what we'd say as, the defense has introduced an argument, that even if it's proper for the introduction of the government's expert witnesses under the Fifth Amendment, it still cannot be beyond -- go beyond what is -- what's your exact word, “ reasonably ”--   Stephen G. Breyer  --reasonably related to the defense of insanity that the defendant himself raised.  And then that would be an issue for the Kansas court to decide.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you'd bring up arguments why this is okay and they would bring up arguments why it isn't reasonably related, and Kansas would decide.   Stephen G. Breyer  I think what he's saying is that, look, in Simmons, there is a Fourth Amendment problem and the defendant wants to testify in a Fourth Amendment hearing.  And if he does, the State will take that statement and use it at the trial.  So because of the reasons -- I'd say the policies underlying the Fourth Amendment, the Court says, that's wrong.  He can go testify at the suppression hearing and then they can't use his statement later.  So by analogy he says, it's a similar situation.  He says, it's the policy behind the Fifth Amendment that says if you're going to go see the government under compulsion, the psychiatrist, you shouldn't be able to introduce that later.  I mean, I think that's, in my looking at them, because I'm trying to see if I got the argument basically right, which is what I wanted to find out, and now what's the response to that particular argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  You'd have to say then there's difference between the Fifth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment and that difference would be what?   ",12-609X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You're -- you're -- the State admits that all that they could put on was information from the psychiatrist that is reasonably related to the defense that the defendant raised.  Do you disagree with that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Then we both agree--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Fine.  You both agree that the test is “ reasonably related ”.  So we could simply say that.  They both agree.   Stephen G. Breyer  And now we send it back to the Kansas court and say: We are not going to go through the record here because you should do it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then why are we here?  Everybody agrees.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The authority for that is what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean, you know, the obvious, it's not a question of policy.  But one thing the Fifth Amendment prevents you from being a witness against yourself, you didn't take the stand.  So what you did was introduced three psychiatrists and they said, this man was totally insane.  He could form no will whatsoever.  Totally insane.  The government says, we have seven psychiatrists who would like to examine this man and they'll come to the opposite conclusion.  The judge says, okay, examine him.  Under compulsory.  And they say he is totally sane.  And they each have reasons.  Now, you're saying in that case, the government cannot put any of those seven on the stand.   Stephen G. Breyer  Really?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  But they -- they can base their testimony on an examination compelled by the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  So you--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --But that -- that puts the government in a -- in an impossible position.  The defense is allowed witnesses who've examined the defendant and -- oh, you mean you're only limiting it to the case where the defense witnesses don't examine the defendant?   Stephen G. Breyer  You're -- I'm giving you a hypothetical.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Psychiatrist A, hired by the defense, examines the witness.  He says he is totally mad.  All right?  That's his conclusion based on the examination.  Psychiatrist B, who works for the government, has examined the witness under compulsion.  And he's done it under the authority of 12.2, because the defendant, just as here, made a 12.2 motion and said that this was a -- all right, just like here.  He examines him.  He comes to the conclusion this man is as sane as -- whatever the most sane thing is.  [Laughter]  That's his conclusion.  You're saying the government can put on its witnesses, but the Fifth Amendment prohibits the -- sorry, the defense can put on its witness, but the -- the Fifth Amendment prohibits the defendant from putting on its own witness.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That means it's something -- I can't imagine how the Fifth Amendment can say that.  But go ahead.   Stephen G. Breyer  What is your argument?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  They put on my witness, my imaginary psychiatrist A.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that may be.  But does the Federal Constitution -- it's my example.  It's my example.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --What do we do with this?  The defense says, my defense will consist of the fact demonstrated by an expert that my heart is too weak to have made it up the stairs.  All right.  And I have Mister -- Dr. Smith who has examined my heart and he will testify it's impossible I could have been on the third floor.  I would have been dead.  So the government says: We would like to have you examined by our doctor, Dr. B, who we believe will -- and the judge orders it.  So now, Dr. B says, his heart is sound as an ox and he goes to it.  You're saying the government could not put that Dr. B on the stand.   INTERRUPTING ",12-609X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I would have thought you would have gone back to Calder v. Bull.  And Calder v. Bull, which this Court refers to all the time in these kinds of cases, has four categories and the only one that fits this case is a law that changes the punishment--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and inflicts a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when committed.  So whatever these other hypotheticals are, they do not involve -- they are not laws that change the punishment.  But yours is a law that changes the punishment.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I wouldn't concede that.   ",12-62XX
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  No, it isn't, but that I think is an undecided question at best.  If you won the case on that ground, I would say that what the guidelines and the Sentencing Commission are best at, gathering information from across the country and saying a typical person who commits this crime in a typical way should be sentenced to the typical range that applies, let's say 18 to 24 months.  That would be down the drain.  And I think that Rita, in fact, and the other cases have at the very most left open and maybe decided against you the question of when a court of appeals gets the sentence from a judge who does not apply the guideline because he doesn't like the policy judgment.  That's a different matter from when he applies it and when he thinks he shouldn't apply it because the person in front of him doesn't meet the policy conditions.  Those are different.  The commission has the expertise in the first, the judge in the second.  And so there is at least a question as to whether the court of appeals should give more leeway to the guidelines in the first and more leeway to the judge in the second.  Now, I think Rita is consistent with that, and I think every opinion we have written is consistent with that.  And I'd hate to see that suddenly decided and changed in a way I think is inappropriate in this case.  So have you all thought that through?  And is the position of the Government now that we think the guidelines, even if it's a policy matter that they have gathered evidence on, are entitled to nothing if they run across a district judge who happens to think, though he was an outlier, that the outliers were right as a matter of policy, which of course will always be true.  Every judge who is an outlier thinks the outliers are right.  Otherwise why would he do it?  You see?  Now, I didn't know that issue was in this case and that changes the case dramatically for me.  And I thought we could decide this just on the ground that this is a law that changes punishment.  It's a law.  It's a regulation.  And Justice Scalia I thought was completely right.  The question is whether it inflicts greater punishment.  And there is a test on that and the controlling inquiry is whether retroactive application of a change in a law that affects punishment created a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached.  All right?  And that's -- that's what I thought the framework of law was in this case.  Now, this is sort of tough for you on oral argument because I'm just, perhaps, bringing it all up to get it all out there and see what you think.   Stephen G. Breyer  I see -- I see now where you're going.  What I think you're saying is whatever the sentence is -- I am the judge, I read the guidelines.  Now, I may think that I am more likely to get reversed if I substitute a different view than the commission had on a matter of policy.  That's all true.  But still, I don't have to do it.  No matter what it is, I can not use the guidelines.  And if I get reversed on other grounds or the sentence is not reasonable, da, da, da, da, da.  But there's no legal binding nature there.  That's your point, I think.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If that's exactly your point--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But now I can narrow what the question I think is.   INTERRUPTING ",12-62XX
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Could I ask a different -- can I ask--  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  There's probably a perfectly good answer to this, but I -- I notice that in this Federal law in 7(b), it says what the registration form shall contain.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, there are four subsections and only one of those refers to a particular thing, and that is, identifying information.  It shall include a statement, including citizenship, saying -- that contains an attestation the applicant meets that requirement.   Stephen G. Breyer  And under perjury.   Stephen G. Breyer  It says that.  Then I look at the Arizona law and it says in Arizona, you have to include like in immigration, you know, a passport, a birth certificate, and then you have a couple of other things that show you're a citizen, correct?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, okay.  That's not my question.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm saying given these five or six specific things--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that show you're a citizen--   Stephen G. Breyer  --what use does Arizona make of that attestation under perjury?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't say it wasn't.

What use are you making of that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I know -- I'm sure you are and then my question is how?   Stephen G. Breyer  By?   ",12-71XX
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  His point is, he keeps making the point, your colleague, and he says, no, that isn't what it says.  What the statute says is it may require only such identifying information as is necessary to assess eligibility.  In other words, it's telling the people who write the form what they can put on it.  And they can't put other things on it.  But it nowhere says that the State can't do other things.  Now that's his point.  And when I asked him, well, how are you -- how are you using -- you have to be able to use, oh, he says, we use it.  We use the citizen part and these things on the form to prosecute people for perjury.  So we're doing what it says, we're using it and it doesn't say we can't add a few other things.  Okay.  Now, that's his argument.  Now, your answer, which would be very helpful to me, is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  On the form.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But his problem is how do you get to that conclusion?  He says you can't get there from the language because the language doesn't say that.  It says what the Commission can put on the form.  It doesn't say anything about whether some other agency, such as a State or sovereign, can add something.  Now, that's his problem.  And I would like to hear very succinctly, the reason he is wrong about that is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  26H.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Correct.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where you're going is this, as I heard you before: It is true that there is no specific language saying the State can't do this, can't add things.  But it does make a huge point approving citizenship in a particular way on the form.  What would the point of that be if the State could add things?  So we must look back to the purpose, not necessarily exclusively the language, of deciding what that particular provision B, in particularly one as you quote adding to, what could it have been?  And there the legislative history in my view is helpful because it makes clear, for example, in at least one place that Congress did think they shouldn't add a provision that allows the State to do just what it's doing here because that wouldn't be consistent with the purpose of the Act.  So I'm putting words in your mouth but don't accept them because I put them there.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that's the grand -- to go back to your -- I see that as your grand purpose.  That's the grand purpose argument.  And then there is the subsidiary purpose argument, which you started to make, which I wanted to hear, which has to do with (b).  It says may require only such identifying information.  So I thought, well, they could require less, less than what's necessary.  They could.  It says you can't require more.  They could require less.  But suppose they put a statement in and they say, in respect to this qualification, nothing to do with citizenship: This is what is necessary.  No more.  But we've done everything that is necessary.  Then could a State come along and say, we think more is necessary?   Stephen G. Breyer  And it's the word “ necessary ” that you thought -- that that would be dependent upon?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I know I'm not -- I'm just not quite -- the last step of what I wanted you to think of was this--   Stephen G. Breyer  --It does say “ may require only ”--   Stephen G. Breyer  --“ that which is necessary ”.  So if they said -- and this what is necessary.  Fine.  Pretty tough for the State to say I'm going to add some things.  But the very next subsection does use the words “ shall include ”.  So I wonder -- and that has to do with citizenship.

Breyer  What happens -- what happens if you brought suit before the exhaustion, while it was still going on, before it ended, but you said to the judge, Judge, we're in the middle of exhausting, so don't -- we don't want to hear the case until that's finished; can you do that or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  It's an open question.  So then if it were held that you could do it, you could file the lawsuit within the three years and if exhaustion had not taken place, well, just don't hear the case until the exhaustion is done.  That would solve your problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, it wouldn't solve your problem because you waited too long.  But I mean that would solve the problem of other people in the future in your situation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is it that stops that?  I mean, on that ground you would say these clauses are valid.  It's valid to say he has to -- you have to bring a lawsuit within three years.  Nothing wrong with that.  File a protective complaint.   Stephen G. Breyer  --our saying that, and what about our saying to the courts as a judge-made doctrine, exhaustion has to conclude in enough time so that they have time left to file a lawsuit?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Because isn't -- isn't exhaustion a judge-made doctrine?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It would be an unfair process that doesn't leave them a reasonable amount of time to file a lawsuit.   ",12-729X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I suppose the problem here is that we have found nine cases -- you know, we can do computer-assisted research, which my clerks are good at -- and -- and they found five cases in which the exhaustion period was actually longer than the 3-year statute of limitations; and then they found four others that there -- well, there was like 5 days left in one, and there was 5 months left in another.  And in most of -- almost all those cases, the judge got around the problem by saying the statute begins to run at the time the exhaustion is finished.  Now, I can think of other ways of solving the problem.  One was, you get a reg.  Another way was that we interpret the exhaustion doctrine to require leaving at least a year.  But what's your way of solving the problem?  Are you just going to let those nine people just -- they can't bring their lawsuit, or what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The question was, what do you want to do with those nine people?  Now, I know there are a lot of ERISA cases, but still there were nine people--   Stephen G. Breyer  --who will have this problem.  And my question is, what do you suggest we do about them?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  My question was, what specific doctrine or -- I saw three groups.  Now, you can name some others, and we do about those nine people precisely, not in some general terms, but we do what about them?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And now, I suppose -- so we could use equitable estoppel, even though nobody has said anything, even though nobody held out anything as a basis for estoppel.  But we could say use equitable estoppel.  I'll think about that one.  Is there any other thing we could use?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There, your opponent is saying: I have a simpler answer.  I mean, instead of having to worry whether 14 months is too long or 7 months is too short or a year and a half is adequate time, instead of having to worry about that in difficult cases, I have a simpler idea.  We will just run the three years from the time the -- the internal exhaustion is finished.  Then you don't have to worry about it.  You don't have to worry about equitable tolling, and you don't have to worry about all this other stuff.  That's their point.   Stephen G. Breyer  But if they do that, the question answers itself.  The -- the--  [Laughter]  The -- the question I would like to know is if you know empirically, roughly, what are typical statutes of limitations in this area?  The basic rule is State law unless contract; is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  And how long on average?  Do you have any idea of -- of how long people normally have to bring their action?   Stephen G. Breyer  It's the standard provision in contracts.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean -- in certain types of insurance contracts.  So ERISA is all over the place.  I wouldn't even know where to start.  Does the Department of Labor keep statistics on this or what?   Stephen G. Breyer  It's -- the doctrine of exhaustion is a judge-created doctrine.   Stephen G. Breyer  And therefore you cannot, in your contract, contract yourself around it.  You can't get out of it.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what this would require would be to say that that judge-created doctrine requires exhaustion to take place before the accrual of the statute of limitations, end of opinion -- for the reason of certainty, for the reason of uniformity, for the reason of avoiding, through hiring lawyers, et cetera, an interference with the voluntary nature, simple nature, and hopefully pre-legal involvement nature of that exhaustion process, all right?  Da, da, da.  Now, the reason -- what trouble would that cause?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What trouble in the industry would that cause?   Stephen G. Breyer  Look, you agree that we would overturn the plan term if the plan term was no exhaustion?   Stephen G. Breyer  The courts would overturn a plan term which plan term said no exhaustion.   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course not, because what we are trying to do -- and employers are very cooperative and we are trying to work out a system with the exhaustion thing that will not destroy ERISA plans or something.   Stephen G. Breyer  It -- it's which is the -- and that's why I phrased it in terms of an explanation of the exhaustion requirement.   ",12-729X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I think what he's saying, is there any good reason that they aren't liable for infringement?  Is that--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  And I thought the reason -- you have to answer it -- is because when you have many steps in a process, and this is a very similar process of the book I'm reading now about the Seabees building constructions in World War II, you know, they put some forward warehouses and they put some other stuff in some other warehouses and they make the eventual thing by shipping this from over there and the other place.  So it's tough.  Now, you probably want to insist upon a pretty strict relationship between the different parties in a joint venture or more before you hold them liable.  In other words, there's an issue I don't know about.  How close was this relationship?  And I ask you that because you're going to answer his question and I want to just see if my stab in the dark here is somewhere close to the -- to what you were about to say.     --Well, I think that's right, Justice Breyer.  I think if you look at this as a problem under 271(a), which, again, is not the question before the Court, but if you do, what everyone agrees, I think, is that you can use traditional, well-established tort principles of attribution in order to conclude that someone who has not personally performed all the steps of a process, nonetheless, should be liable for using the process because they have worked in concert with someone else.  I think everyone agrees on that.   ",12-786X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  My problem is I have no idea.  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I have no idea whether they should be liable or not on a theory of patent infringement themselves.  It sounds simple when you take the invention that you gave, but it doesn't sound simple to me when I start thinking about this one, because this one does seem to me a variation on a very old theme.  And that is a supplier who makes customized materials, some of which involve standardized materials and some of which have to be made fresh, and where the specialists are in crowded cities.  But -- and so it takes time to put it on the truck and get out of the city.  But the standardized parts can be shipped from anywhere in the country.  Has a system of phoning up standardized people and customized people and putting them all together, and it involves the customer.  And there are not just two steps.  There are 87 steps, and many of them involve very innocent things like taking a truck and driving it from one place to another.  Now, when we get into something as complicated as that -- and this is one is even more so -- and many of them are things that people do every day, and there are all kinds of states of knowledge, I become very nervous about writing a rule that suddenly might lead millions of people to start suing each other.  And that's what I would not like to do unless I have pretty thorough briefing on this subject.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And of course, my problem is a rule.  And if this is a simple case, it's hard to me.  Why do they have a patent?  Well, they do have some forward warehouses and they had -- phone up and say, which one comes from which place?  But, you see, I don't understand the underlying stuff.  So they probably have a valid patent.  I assume that.  But for some of them, could be 87 steps, and I don't have one rule for four steps and another one for 87.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I'd have the same question, by the way, as to 271(b), exactly the same question.  For X number of years, the patent bar and everyone else has lived with the statute and the interpretations which are different from this one.  And now suddenly we have a new one.  And I get the -- and now do you understand my question?  Can you apply it to this one, too, and explain why we should say the Federal Circuit is right to depart from a pretty clear understanding differently?   Stephen G. Breyer  And my question is one you probably can't answer, which is a problem because you have limited time, and the way -- you have such limited time in these complicated cases.  And my problem is, the question is this is so complicated.  And the reasons I found it so complicated is I can -- and I'll spare you the details -- think of so many different kinds of situations with so many different steps in method patents where so many rights and wrongs of it are differently at play that I become worried about setting forth any rule.  And it's under those circumstances that I say okay, let's go with what we've had for 30 years, and if Congress feels they should change it, change it.  And that's the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --that -- that is basically my idea.  And it depends upon the complexity, which I'm seeing in my -- as -- as I think about it.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it doesn't depend just upon that there were 4 steps in this case, because there could have been 104.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There could have been 104 different circumstances.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Well, anything about (a) and also about (b), because (b), if you're liable under (b), my goodness, you could become more easily liable perhaps or less easily in some circumstances, but you didn't even -- I mean, it's the same question for (a) and (b).   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Go with what you have because I don't understand it well enough to know all the facts and circumstances to which I would be applying a new rule.   ",12-786X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What do we do about -- I mean, I think the relevant pages are -- it's at 526 U.S. 328 to 330.  Probably read those 17 times.  All right.  When I looked at those, I saw they reaffirmed Estelle.  As they quote Estelle, they say its reasoning applies with full force.  Estelle says,  ""The court could discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of Respondent's capital trial so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned. ""  I marked five separate statements in those two pages that came to the same thing.  I looked at Estelle.  Estelle has to do with the right to note -- note the comment that he wanted in respect to a sentencing fact that the jury was going to decide; namely, future dangerousness.  Nothing to do with a fact about the crime.  A sentencing fact.  So then I said, well, what favors you here?  What favors you is the last sentence of the first paragraph on 330, which says,  ""Whether silence bears upon the determination of a lack of remorse or upon acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward adjustment provided in 3E1.1 of U.S. Sentencing Guidelines is a separate question. ""  ""It is not before us and we express no view on it. ""  Right.  It's, one, not just a sentencing fact, but a state of mind of the defendant, lack of remorse; two, it's in the sentencing guidelines; three, it is a decision for a judge, not the jury.  If it isn't confined as I just said it, then Mitchell overrules Estelle, what it explicitly denies doing.  Here we have sentencing facts, facts about his childhood.  He wanted the Estelle instruction.  The judge wouldn't give it.  That's the argument against you, I think.  And I would like to hear your specific response.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I thought the facts -- what was at issue here, he has put on witnesses that show that he had a bad childhood and he didn't himself testify about his bad childhood.  And in that context, he asked for the no silence/silence instruction.  The government did not object.  The judge then refused to give the instruction.  All right.  Now, what's the difference between the facts about how his parents raised him and the fact of future dangerousness in Estelle?   Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't see that in Mitchell.  But let -- let me go back, just elaborating on that, to Justice Alito's first question.  I want to see if this issue is still in the case.  You looked at the instruction, and the instruction is just a broad instruction.  It says no adverse inference may be drawn from anything.  All right.  So there seemed to be some objection you had to the breadth of that instruction.  So I looked at the instruction.  The instruction does say exactly what Justice Alito said and you have said.  It says the -- the instruction is --  ""The defendant is not compelled to testify, and the fact that he does not cannot be used as inference of guilt and should not prejudice him in any way. ""  with a couple of, here, irrelevant modifications.  All right?  The instruction I just read you is not from this case.  It's from the Carter case.  In the Carter case, the court said that instruction must be given.  It must be given at the sentencing phase.  So what they did was copy the instruction out of the case, the very instruction that the court said, in Carter, the Fifth Amendment requires to be given in the sentencing phase.  And that was a noncapital case.  So what's the objection to the instruction, on its breadth?  Not only is it the same, but the government never objected that it was too broad, and the only issues in the case were factual.  They were about what happened to him in his childhood, namely, sentencing facts.  And the instruction that you did read about what they should consider referred to facts and circumstances.  And where in Estelle does it say that matters at sentencing related to facts and circumstances, you don't have to give the very instruction that Carter and Estelle required?   Stephen G. Breyer  I see.   Stephen G. Breyer  Does it overrule -- does it overrule Estelle?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Does Mitchell -- Estelle talks about -- you apply the same rule to facts and circumstances of the sentence, in a capital case anyway.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, Mitchell doesn't.   ",12-794X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  A low IQ and a personality disorder, I take it, were the mitigating factors?   Stephen G. Breyer  So in a case where there are witnesses who says there are two mitigating factors, he has a very low IQ and he has a personality disorder, he says nothing.  The jurors go in the room.  They have to decide does he have a low IQ and personality disorder and what weight should we give that as mitigators?  This instruction says: Jurors, do it.  Just when you do it don't take account of the fact that he, himself, did not testify.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that -- that -- so that jurors are perfectly clear, I would think.  What I think is difficult for you is just what your friend raised.  It is true that the Carter instruction refers to guilt.  You took that instruction, word for word, and you've cut out ""guilt"" because this has nothing to do with guilt, right.  Estelle says, I would think, that you have a right to a Carter instruction in respect to some sentencing factors, namely future dangerousness.  The last sentence on the page of Mitchell says: We are not deciding whether you're entitled to that instruction in respect to other sentencing fabricators, namely remorse.  So the question for you is why does that thing -- that sentence about remorse in Mitchell, why isn't it at least ambiguous about whether your client is entitled to that instruction here?  And your response to that is what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What I say -- what we said here, what I've gathered from the record, as best we've been able to see it, is in that sentencing hearing -- you were there?   Stephen G. Breyer  But you know it pretty well.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  There were five matters at issue.  He had a low IQ, a personality disorder, the child with a troubled home, he had grown up in poverty, he had been sexually abused.  All right.  All of those things are basically factual matters about his background.  Now, in that context, this instruction, which was the Carter instruction without the word ""guilt"", referring to his failure to testify is -- doesn't mention those five things specifically.  It doesn't say testify about those five things.  But in context, was there anything else in that hearing that the jury could have thought failure to testify referred to?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there anything else any juror might have thought, oh, he didn't testify about this other thing, too?  Was there some other thing there?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's not what I'm thinking of.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm thinking of what is it that we -- is there an issue in this case about whether the instruction, on top of whatever other problems it had, was too broad?  So I'm thinking, if that was the only issue, if those are the only issues that this instruction could have been thought of as referring to, we don't have to get into the breadth matter.  That's why I ask you.  Was there something else in that hearing that the jury might have thought, oh, he didn't testify about it?   Stephen G. Breyer  He's got the point.  But you have to answer in terms of what the facts are at the hearing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But was his remorse an issue at the hearing?   Stephen G. Breyer  Then the answer--   ",12-794X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  My goodness.  Are there cases where they brought such things?  I mean, every State has laws that forbid fraud.  And mortgages are probably -- and loans are probably made in the billions every year.  All it takes is someone to say on his sheet of listing assets to have a covered security and say, don't worry, I'll hold these.  I'll hold them.  Or don't worry, I will sell this one and buy that one.  Don't worry, I'll buy another one.  I won't -- I won't put up the security of my sprinkler system.  I will sell the sprinkler system and use it to buy a -- a covered exchange.  I guess if those fall within the securities laws, we would have expected to see billions of actions.  Why not?

Breyer  Tell me a case where the SEC has ever -- there may be such cases -- but what is done is somebody has simply tried to get a loan and he put on that sheet of paper listing assets a covered security.  And he said, I intend to keep it.  Or he said, you know, I will buy some more or I'll sell it and buy some more or, you know, or put in your three things.  Just list the case where they've ever prosecuted that as a securities fraud or private people have.  After all, it's beneficial sometimes for private people.  What are the cases?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what is the case?  What is the specific case, private or SEC, that comes the closest -- I grant you there is none direct -- but comes the closest to Justice Kagan's hypothetical, if you marry me, I will sell my IBM stock?   Stephen G. Breyer  Try--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --is the SEC's closest case, but they may be better at answering this.  What is their closest case to the horribles that they foresee if you lose?   Stephen G. Breyer  But the -- the case that he says -- I'm quite interested in your reaction to which cases that you've ever brought this would, if you lose here would prevent you from bringing, and Line was the one that because mentioned.   Stephen G. Breyer  In Line, there is a broker who says to a client: Give me some money and I will buy some securities on the exchange for you.  And they gave him the money, and he didn't.  Well, that's directly related to a promise that is going to effect the purchase or sale of a security directly.  He's promising someone to buy securities for his account.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't think that that's this case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He didn't say: I will buy them for you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I can understand how a promise to buy securities for you is a promise to a person or a statement that would lead a person to take a position.  Whether it's this plaintiff or someone in the world, it would lead someone in the world to take a position.  What your opponents say is that is what is present -- not present here; neither the person who is giving the money nor anyone else, with the possible exception of the defendant, is being led by this statement to take a position in a market for, buy, against, sell, or even, if you like, not sell or buy, hold.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Does it matter if it's just purely Federal law?  I mean, think of a civil case involving a State on one side and private parties on another in a State court which has jurisdiction over Federal laws.  The State claims that the defendant has violated, civilly, a Federal statute.  There's an action also in Federal Court.  In your view, does the Federal Court have to abstain?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  There's no action for an injunction.  What they want is the judge to decide the case.  The private party wants the Federal judge to decide his case.  That's all.  It's a matter of interpreting Federal law.  Now, in your opinion, is Younger -- does Younger, not some other doctrine, does Younger require abstention?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Okay.  So on your review, we can never have a case proceed in Federal court even on a purely Federal issue if, in fact, there is involving this estate civil case on the same question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I can't think of a -- doesn't it often happen that there are such cases?  I mean, I -- I would think that wouldn't be too difficult.  I mean, either there never is one and you tend to be right or there are a whole lot of them and you tend to be wrong.  I've just never heard it put in that extreme way, and maybe you're right.

Breyer  If Younger only applies to -- to State proceedings that are brought first, then I guess we could have a -- a criminal defendant, who's not yet one, bring an action in Federal court to say that the law is unconstitutional or something or violates a Federal law.  And then the State prosecutes him criminally and the Federal court couldn't -- and the Federal court could enjoin the criminal proceeding.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose you have the -- shouldn't a supplier have standing to sue the competitor of the firm to which he supplies the where the alleged liable or slander or whatever it is, is directly about what the supplier supplies.  The example may be clearer.  Suppose that Bailey's sells ice cream sundaes, and the defendant has said the chocolate sauce in Bailey's ice cream sundaes is poisonous.  Now, the chocolate sauce does not compete with the defendant because he's an ice cream parlor, but nonetheless he is directly affected by the statement that he is suing about.  He is, therefore, different from the other suppliers who might have supplied Bailey's with cushions, heat, electricity.  But shouldn't at least that supplier of chocolate sauce have the standing to bring the claim against the ice cream parlor that competes with Bailey?   Stephen G.

He is directly victimized by -- he has not just lost sales but the comment is about him.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the answer to your question, if you're asking, is no, because the person who supplies labels is totally -- the statement that is sued about has nothing to do with labels.  So the people who have nothing to do with the statement wouldn't have standing.  But my -- you remember my question?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Well, why shouldn't that person who is talked about in the statement have standing?  A clear distinction.  Not every supplier could sue.   ",12-873X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  How do we tie that in?  I'm sort of sorry I used that hypothetical.  [Laughter]  But it nonetheless illustrates--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But it illustrates the point.  I mean, in my own mind, the standing question is designed to answer, are you the kind of plaintiff that Congress intended in this statute to protect against the kind of injury that you say you suffered?  Now, that goes back to Justice Brandeis and it goes back to saying, did you suffer a common law injury or do you fall within the scope as defined?  Normally Congress doesn't think about that and so courts decide, and we're right in the middle of that decision.  So if I think that basically you have a point, that at least the supplier who is mentioned in the defamatory statement by the competitor who bought the supplies, at least where he is mentioned explicitly, there should be standing, which means your side would win, I guess.  What do I write to tie that in to the three separate kinds of tests that the circuits have talked about?  That's what I can't quite see, because they talk about the reasonable interest test, they talk about the zone of interest test, they talk about some other kind of test.  How do I tie this into that?   Stephen G. Breyer  If that's so -- if you go back and you just lift the APA test -- because I believe Justice Ginsburg is absolutely right, that this is not an APA suit -- the word ‶ arguably ″ was inserted in the normal standing test by ADAPSO, which Justice Douglas wrote.  Now, if we take that and simply lift it, the first thing, the person who would get a new lawsuit, I guess, is a consumer, because the consumer could easily say: I didn't buy this product because of the false statement that the competitor of the person I would have bought from made.  And indeed you could have very big consumers and they could allege all kinds of injuries.  So if I simply lift the test, I rather worry that I am changing the law quite radically.   Stephen G. Breyer  But ‶ arguably ″.  Isn't it arguably in part to protect consumers?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But now does that -- just thinking of Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, that suggests that maybe the reasonable interest test is okay, because what that's trying to do is -- you have McDonald's that's allegedly made the false statement, and then there are a range of people in terms more or less distant in respect to being direct competitors.  There is, what you said, Burger King, direct competitor.  Then there are the health restaurants.  Then there are -- so you need something to cut off at some point the plaintiff, who claims to be a direct competitor, but really he's not going to lose much money and he's quite distant.  A health restaurant in a foreign city, you know, you see?  And the reasonable interest test I think is trying both to get at that and also to figure out what kind of supplier you are.  Are you one who falls within the scope of the false statement or the -- or are you not?  You don't want the electricity company to be able to sue.  So what do you think about using the reasonable interest test, but explaining it in something like the terms I've just stated.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about--   Stephen G. Breyer  --If it's who's affected, who specifically are we leaving out?  Look, you put in, I don't want to leave out -- you've read all the cases.  I haven't read them all.  But I see that you put in -- we put in the direct competitors.  They fall within it.  We put in certain suppliers, those who are disparaged.  We don't want the electricity company to be able to sue, according to you and the cases, and I guess we have the mirror case which we'd put in would be certain buyers like retailers or wholesalers and probably applying the same rule about their being mentioned in the -- in the false advertising or in the statement.  Who have we left out?  Who has been given standing in some of these cases that is left out of the description I just gave?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Who do you -- who do you -- well, who -- who has not been left out who should have been left out?

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What cases should I look up for that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That is to say, I thought generally in the criminal law a person who commits an illegal act is liable for the known consequences of that act.  That is the general rule.  I can't think -- I mean, people use all kinds of terminology, different kinds of terminology, but I thought that's the basic principle.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  When you say “ purposeful intent ”, He didn't want it, but he knew it would happen.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And moreover, he helped to produce the occasion on which it would happen.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Would you just tell me where in the brief they are, or whatever's easier.   Stephen G. Breyer  You use the word “ intent ”.  Some people used it in order to encompass the situation--   Stephen G. Breyer  --of the known but undesired consequence.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's language.  I am sure you will find language.  I want really an instance where the holding of the case is that a person who commits an unlawful action with knowledge that the other unlawful action will occur is not liable for it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You know, blowing up the carriage and you kill the maid, who you didn't want to kill.  You are liable.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Which one is it?

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I have one question here.  It seems -- because I start out for reasons I won't go into thinking, well, perhaps it doesn't matter, frankly; you can get to the same result under any one of these three approaches.  But then one thing Professor Sachs says does bother me, that if we take your approach then how do we deal with the problem of removal?  I mean, you can only remove a case to a court which is in the district where the person -- the plaintiff filed.  Now, if there is a forum selection clause, the defendant seems to me to be stuck, because he can't go to a -- he can't go to a -- to another.  He can't go to another court.  He can't go to the court within the district because of the forum selection clause, and he can't go into another court because of 1441(a).  So that argues to me that we ought to either take the 1404 approach or we ought to take Professor Sachs' approach, unless you have an answer to that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You didn't really explain -- I'm sorry.  I'll read it more carefully later.  But how -- it says you have to -- you have to remove to the court or the district or division where the place of action is pending.  So if it's filed in State court in Texas you have to remove to the Texas Federal court.  Now, how do we get -- and you can't go to the Texas Federal court, according to you, because of the contract.  Okay.  Now, how -- now, you explain how -- how this provision over 1390(c) gets around that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you -- in other words, you can remove to the Texas court even though it says you can remove -- you can remove to the district court despite the contract.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Despite the contract.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what the court should say in Texas is: We have a contract which says you have to go to Virginia, but because of 1390(a) we forget about the contract and we remove it here.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what you're saying Texas should say.   Stephen G. Breyer  No?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what about -- suppose the plaintiff says: Please dismiss this immediately because of 1406, or, you know, because 1406 says you have to dismiss it; venue isn't proper here.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  The contract says you go to Virginia.   Stephen G. Breyer  They filed it in Texas State court.  You tried to remove it to Texas Federal court.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And they say: I'm very sorry.  The contract that he loves says we can't remove it to Texas Federal court.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what is the problem with this?  You admit that if he goes to Virginia -- well, he files his suit in Virginia.  All right.  Then he says, judge, everything's in Texas, please remove under 1404(a), you know, go -- send it down to Texas.  And you agree that -- that in an unusual case you say, because you give a lot of weight to the contract, he could win and go to Texas, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's your position, fine.  If that's your position, what conceivable difference does it make if he goes to Texas in the first place and then you say remove it to Virginia?  I mean, it should work out the same way.  It should work out that the balancing under 1404, you know, it gives you the -- the factors should be the same, shouldn't they?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's a terrible thing.  You have to say 1404(a), and the other case he has to say 1404(a) and it -- I mean, maybe it makes some tremendous practical difference.  But if it makes not much difference, I have three routes that seem to me all should work out the same way, and in favor of their route is the absolute language that Justice Kagan pointed out before, plus the footnote.  Okay?  So I'm thinking, hey, this doesn't make -- it's important to have a rule.  It's important to have one clear approach.  But as between the three, it shouldn't matter, and they should all reach the same conclusions.  So let's go with the language of Stewart.  All right.  What about -- now, what's the answer to that?   ",12-929X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So why -- why then couldn't you go to Virginia with all these factors?  I mean, maybe the jury has to take 42 visits to the bottom of an oil well shaft.  I don't know.  I mean, there could be something that would weigh in your favor.  I don't know the case.  So why not go to Virginia and then file a 1404 motion?  And it should reach the same result, whether you -- you go to Texas and ask to stay there or whether you go to Virginia under 1404(a) -- you win this case, let's say -- or whether you go to Virginia.  It should get to the same place, shouldn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  So it's actually your expense because you would have to go to Virginia and you would have to file the motion.  Maybe you can do it by mail or you'd have to -- but I don't know.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  They are not saying -- they said that you could make the 1404 motion in Virginia, and they think it would only be granted in an exceptional case, but that's their opinion in that, and so it should come to the same conclusion.  They aren't barring you from that on their view.  But my thought is that if all these come to the same result in the end and you just need one ruling, we have something pointing on their side -- your side, which is the Stewart footnote and the language of the -- you know, the absolute language of the venue statutes, and you have something pointing in their side, which is, if we count by numbers, five circuits are in their favor and only three in yours.  All right.  Help me.   Stephen G. Breyer  That argues, then, it might be slightly against you.   Stephen G. Breyer  The -- if in fact you specify a State court, if in fact you specify a foreign court, if in fact you specify arbitration, you agree in those instances you are going to use forum non conveniens or you are going to use 1406.  But you are saying where you specify a court in a different State, namely a Federal court in a different State, there you use 1404.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, it was forum non conveniens.  Oh, you use forum non conveniens in all three?  You don't use -- I mean, they specify a State court?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They say venue is a State court--   Stephen G. Breyer  --use forum non conveniens in all those?  Okay.  Use forum non conveniens in all those, but you use 1404 if they specify another Federal court.  That's what -- that's what -- that's what you're--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  You use 12(b)(3), okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  But my point is you're using something else, so they would say, well, let's have it the same -- you know -- okay.  I see the answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Forget it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Do you know the answer, this is another -- I keep thinking they should all come to the same conclusion.  But, then, what about this point Justice Sotomayor raised.  Suppose you sue in Texas.  You know, you get there, but the contract, let's say, was a different contract from yours, but it just was made in Nevada.  Everything about this concerns Nevada.  Are they really going to use Texas law to interpret the contract rather than Nevada's?  I would have thought that the choice of law question is a different question, and where you sue should be irrelevant to the choice of law question except insofar -- I don't know.  Maybe you looked--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Are -- are you finished?  All right.  I'd just like, if you'd want, to give you a chance to take what I've -- I think Professor Sachs says, look, there is a way which you can both follow the statutes literally and say, well, venue is here, and also get the place to the right forum respecting the contract.  Just say it is an affirmative defense, which Justice Ginsburg says the First Circuits follow this approach.  You put it in the complaint.  The answer, and once it's in the answer, the judge can put it front and center.  Indeed, in case he forgets to do that, the defendant will remind him and say you've got to get it to the right court and let's decide this affirmative defense thing first.  And -- and now we're back in the same place.  What do you think of that?   ",12-929X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can you give me an idea of how -- just to follow up on Justice Alito.  Can you -- I don't know if you asked the IRS -- the INS this question; you may; something like it.  Let's look at all of the derivative beneficiaries in the (f)s, (f)(1), (2)(A), (2)(B), (f)(3), (f)(4).  And for the most part, they're grandchildren, they would be, or children, sometimes nephews and nieces.  And now think of the set of all those people who age out.  Okay?  They started out as children, but it's 15 years later -- they're now aged out.  Now think of that set.  It's -- call it a certain size.  What percent of that set do you think are accounted for by the F2A people, who are the only ones on your interpretation that 3 would apply to?   Stephen G. Breyer  Any idea, any rough idea?  Because if you just look at it, one's natural instinct is just what Justice Alito said.  This is a minuscule component of a set.  It's much bigger, and therefore, it's just unlikely that Congress meant (3) to apply to a -- to a -- to a little molecule when there's the whole ocean.  Now, that -- that's the kind of argument you're up against, I think, so I wanted to ask you that empirical question.  If you can give me any idea of the empirical.   Stephen G. Breyer  Did you ask -- anything that would give me -- that's the total global picture.  That's the 2,000, 3,000, sometimes 10,000 aging out.  All right.  But -- but the real relevant thing is if we can get some idea, which seems in the paper, that your interpretation applies to -- only to a subset of those people.  And just from reading it, that it's qualitative reading it, it sounds like a tiny subset of those people.  Now, we can argue about whether that's for you or against you.  I think it's against you, but nonetheless--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That's F2A.  But we want F2B now.   Stephen G. Breyer  F2A.  You're right.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So it looks like it's between 10 percent and sometimes it gets it up to 30 percent--   Stephen G. Breyer  --We don't have numbers on separation from parents.  We do know that these people, the ones that would be caught on the broad interpretation, have also been waiting for years and years and years and years.  They've all been waiting for years and years and years and years, and it becomes hard to choose among them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You can find sympathetic stories all over the place, and I mean -- all right.  Go ahead.   Stephen G. Breyer  What do we do with a reasonable reading of the statute?  I looked at the board's opinion here, and it seems to me in the two paragraphs just prior to Section 5, at the end of Section 4, they have as a critical step in their -- in reaching their conclusion, their belief that the legislative record demonstrates a clear concern on the part of Congress to ameliorate the delays associating with the process of the visa processing.  And they say the same thing in the paragraph just above that.   Stephen G. Breyer  So that's what they think this statute is about.  But that statute -- that problem is taken care of in (1)(b).  And so the question would be, if that problem, which subtracts all the days that there was a processing delay, is taken care of on (1)(b), they can't be right that that was the purpose of 3.  So unless you can say to me how that could possibly be right, that reasoning, then what we should do, I guess, if we think that you have authority in the government to interpret this minor part of the statute, which I do, is generate.  Send it back.  And -- and maybe give them -- say you ought to do this again because the reason you gave is not good.  Or why not?   INTERRUPTING ",12-930X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But how does -- can I try an example because I think it's easier to--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  Imagine Steven is a citizen.  His brother Charles is not.  So under 4 -- and Charles has a son Joseph who is not.  That will help you think about it.  All right.  So we're under F4.  Steven files a petition, the beneficiary is Charles.  Charles has a minor son Joseph.  Visa is granted, et cetera, for -- not visa, you know, he's given -- everything is in order and now Charles has to wait about ten years or so.  By the time he gets -- at the time his number becomes current, the number becomes available for the alien, namely for Charles, at that moment, we calculate Joseph's age and it's 24.  So your idea is that Charles is current.  Everything is fine.  He goes to the port or the office, wherever he's supposed to go, and he brings Joseph with him.  At that point, Joseph, since he's no longer a child, has to come in under another category, and that category is going to be, I guess, 2B because Charles will be now -- and Joseph will be unmarried over 21, right?  Am I right so far?   Stephen G. Breyer  This is an imaginary -- he spells it with a V.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, if I have it right--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  But there is one thing missing.  Charles has not filed a petition for Joseph.  So what do we do about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  And doesn't -- doesn't Charles as a lawful permanent resident have to file a piece of paper called the petition--   Stephen G. Breyer  --in which Joseph is named primary beneficiary?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But there is no -- there is no F2B petition, because Charles never filed it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, yes; right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I want to know.  You don't need--   Stephen G. Breyer  --We do all this, and--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Can I ask you a quick question--   Stephen G. Breyer  --about your alternative argument with you and Justice Scalia.  I take it your argument is: Look at the words; the part before the comma defines a group and that group is not in dispute.  It's all the F derivatives.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Then look at the first part.  It says the petition shall automatically be converted.   Stephen G. Breyer  See, if I lose on that, then look at the second part.  It says, the alien shall retain the original priority date.  And you say as to that, that has an independent life.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, it's either A or B.  And we think we win on A and B, but if not we at least win on B.  Now, has the agency ever expressed a view in respect to whether you are right or wrong about your independent B.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  So wouldn't the right thing to do there be, in respect to B, send it back to the agency so that they can express a view in respect to that?

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Now, the reason for the formula -- of course, part of the formula looks back to what happened in 1965.  And it says are you a jurisdiction that did engage in testing and had low turnout or -- or low registration?  Now, that isn't true of Alabama today.   Stephen G. Breyer  So when Congress in fact reenacted this in 2005, it knew what it was doing was picking out Alabama.  It understood it was picking out Alabama, even though the indicia are not -- I mean, even though they're not engaging in that particular thing.  But the underlying evil is the discrimination.  So the closest analogy I could think of is imagine a State has a plant disease and in 1965 you can recognize the presence of that disease, which is hard to find, by a certain kind of surface movement or plant growing up.  Now, it's evolved.  So by now, when we use that same formula, all we're doing is picking out that State.  But we know one thing: The disease is still there in the State.  Because this is a question of renewing a statute that in fact has worked.  And so the question I guess is, is it rational to pick out at least some of those States?  And to go back to Justice Sotomayor's question, as long as it's rational in at least some instances directly to pick out those States, at least one or two of them, then doesn't the statute survive a facial challenge?  That's the question.   Stephen G. Breyer  But this is then the question, does it justify?  I mean, this isn't a question of rewriting the statute.  This is a question of renewing a statute that by and large has worked.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if you have a statute that sunsets, you might say: I don't want it to sunset if it's worked, as long as the problem is still there to some degree.  That's the question of rationality.  Isn't that what happened?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know what they're thinking exactly, but it seems to me one might reasonably think this: It's an old disease, it's gotten a lot better, a lot better, but it's still there.  So if you had a remedy that really helped it work, but it wasn't totally over, wouldn't you keep that remedy?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or would you not at least say that a person who wants to keep that remedy, which has worked for that old disease which is not yet dead, let's keep it going.  Is that an irrational decision?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm sorry.  The old disease is discrimination under the Fifteenth Amendment, which is abridging a person's right to vote because of color or race.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Don't change horses.  You renew what is in the past--   Stephen G. Breyer  --where it works, as long as the problem isn't solved.  Okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  But there is this difference, which I think is a key difference.  You refer to the problem as the problem identified by the tool for picking out the States, which was literacy tests, et cetera.  But I suspect the problem was the denial or abridgement by a State of the right to vote on the basis of race and color.  And that test was a way of picking out places where that problem existed.  Now, if my version of the problem is the problem, it certainly is not solved.  If your version of the problem, literacy tests, is the problem, well, you have a much stronger case.  So how, in your opinion, do we decide what was the problem that Congress was addressing in the Voting Rights Act?   ",12-96XX

I just want to be sure that I hear your answer to an allegation, argument, an excellent argument, that's been made, or at least as I've picked up, and that is that: Yes, the problem was terrible; it has gotten a lot better; it is not to some degree cured.  All right?  I think there is a kind of common ground.  Now then the question is: Well, what about this statute that has a certain formula?  One response is: Yes, it has a formula that no longer has tremendous relevance in terms of its characteristic -- that is literacy tests.  But it still picked out nine States.  So, so far, you're with me.  So it was rational when you continue.  You know, you don't sunset it.  You just keep it going.  You're not held to quite the same criteria as if you were writing it in the first place.  But it does treat States all the same that are somewhat different.  One response to that is: Well, this is the Fifteenth Amendment, a special amendment, you know?  Maybe you're right.  Then let's proceed State by State.  Let's look at it State by State.  That's what we normally do, not as applied.  All right.  Now, I don't know how satisfactory that answer is.  I want to know what your response is as to whether we should -- if he's right -- if he's right that there is an irrationality involved if you were writing it today in treating State A, which is not too discriminatorily worse than apparently Massachusetts or something.  So -- so if that's true, do we respond State by State?  Or is this a matter we should consider not as applied, but on its face?  I just want to hear what you think about that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but his point, I think the point is this: If you draw a red line around the States that are in, at least some of those States have a better record than some of the States that are out.  So in 1965, well, we have history.  We have 200 years or perhaps of slavery.  We have 80 years or so of legal segregation.  We have had 41 years of this statute.  And this statute has helped, a lot.  So therefore Congress in 2005 looks back and says don't change horses in the middle of the stream, because we still have a ways to go.  Now the question is, is it rational to do that?  And people could differ on that.  And one thing to say is, of course this is aimed at States.  What do you think the Civil War was about?  Of course it was aimed at treating some States differently than others.  And at some point that historical and practical sunset/no sunset, renew what worked type of justification runs out.  And the question, I think, is has it run out now?  And now you tell me when does it run out?  What is the standard for when it runs out?  Never?  That's something you have heard people worried about.  Does it never run out?  Or does it run out, but not yet?  Or do we have a clear case where at least it doesn't run out now?

So therefore Congress in 2005 looks back and says don't change horses in the middle of the stream, because we still have a ways to go.  Now the question is, is it rational to do that?  And people could differ on that.  And one thing to say is, of course this is aimed at States.  What do you think the Civil War was about?  Of course it was aimed at treating some States differently than others.  And at some point that historical and practical sunset/no sunset, renew what worked type of justification runs out.  And the question, I think, is has it run out now?  And now you tell me when does it run out?  What is the standard for when it runs out?  Never?  That's something you have heard people worried about.  Does it never run out?  Or does it run out, but not yet?  Or do we have a clear case where at least it doesn't run out now?  Now, I would like you to address that.   ",12-96XX
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what about that?  That's what I -- I mean, in my mind, of course, there should be judicial review.  There is of everything just about.  But the issue is how much.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, what's your view on that?  Because as I -- we just had a case where when an IRS official wants to subpoena some material, all he has to do is say it's in good faith.  Ah.  But there could be an unusual case where we want to get more than that affidavit.   Stephen G. Breyer  So we wrote an opinion, and probably you've read it, and we said, well, judge, yeah, if it's unusual and you really have some thought here that the IRS is in bad faith, you can go a little further.  Well, that seems to me to be the kind of thing that would apply here.   Stephen G. Breyer  And then -- okay.  So you're perfect satisfied.  I take it the closest to this is the Fourth, Sixth, and Tenth Circuit, a minimal showing of good faith, that's the end of it, but you're never going to say never.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what your -- well, maybe there will be agreement on this.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Aha.  You're going a bit further.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe that's confidential.  I don't know.  Minimal good faith?  Hey, I have an affidavit, I'm in the agency, I sign it.  We called him, he came in, we discussed the matter, I tried to persuade him--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --and he's not persuaded.  Thank you very much.  In the absence of some -- in the absence of some showing that there is something like we tried to get a bribe or something, goodbye.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's at the moment what I have in mind.  So what -- what is it--   Stephen G. Breyer  --No, we didn't persuade him about not to commit suicide.  What we did is we tried to persuade him that our suggestion that you reinstate the individual, whatever it was, is a sensible way to go.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it'll be good for him and good for the company.  You understand.   ",13-1019
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You know, this is a -- this is Hornbook law, I thought, use it till this point.  But everything is reviewable.  Now, that isn't quite true, but if you want to apply for a visa at a foreign embassy abroad, at our embassy is not reviewable.  Okay, and maybe there's a military thing, but even the even the -- even the things like the Panama Canal toll, where they said it wasn't reviewable, Davis says it should have been.  And the answer to your problem is it's not -- it's not reviewable, the three cases or so where we said it wasn't.  The answer is the agency has broad discretion, and because they have such broad discretion, the court can review it, but unless it's very unusual, they have to decide for the agency.  Now, eight circuits have roughly followed that; three, more detailed than others.  And I haven't found anything in your brief that says in the last 40 years, the EEOC has, as a result, found its functioning seriously hampered.  And -- and so why -- what's -- that's why I'm -- I'm wondering.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So that's what -- that's where we are.  I'm trying to -- what I'd like you to do, I'm going to get you to focus on just what you want to say, that the framework in which I'm putting it is of course there is review, but of course at the same time, there is very broad discretion given to the EEOC.  So courts do not intervene; be careful, it's an unusual case.  Now, that's what you want.  Now, I want to know how to say that.  And the case that comes to me the closest was the case that we had with the IRS where, in fact, of course the IRS says, we're in good faith.  And the court says, that's just fine, unless of course there is an unusual situation.  Now, one can write those words.  In that kind of opinion, I've noticed it works best if you also give an example through the use of the case.  Now, that's where I am.  And since I think that's what you want -- something like that is what you want to argue, I'm asking you for help how to write that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about that analogy with that IRS case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So could we copy that, you know, just copy that, making appropriate changes, and say, look, Judge, you have to see -- you have their affidavit.  As long as you think that affidavit really was the bottom line, we could conciliate it unless you have good reason to think that isn't so.  That's the end of it, unless there is evidence of an abuse of process that we'll allow you to go further because conciliation, mediation is really a matter that Congress intended to leave up to the agency.  And even what sounds minimal, minimal, at least the agency has to make an offer.  Maybe they don't.  Maybe the best way to conciliate it is you sit there and say, well, you know, that can be in some circumstance.  So you -- you -- what about some?  Is that not possible?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What?   Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I'm not a conciliator or a mediator, but those I know who are might be able to create such rules.  On the other hand, they might not.  It might be that conciliation is a process that in part is intuitive.  So to require the agency to set forth rules of consideration is to invite judicial review of compliance with those rules.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that is, I think, your point.  And I don't think it's a minor point.  I think it's rather important.  If the conciliation process is actually to work, let it go.   Stephen G. Breyer  They're called conciliation -- what are the three words?   Stephen G. Breyer  And persuasion.   INTERRUPTING ",13-1019
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Wait, wait.  How does it -- how does it I've missed this.  I I'm missing something.  Why -- why do you lose the case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, I -- I assume that -- I assumed as you said -- what -- what are you fighting here?  I assumed, as you said, that -- that the words--   Stephen G. Breyer  --relating a controlled substance as defined in Section 102 concern any law or regulation.  And--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --You deny that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I understand that it's not.  I thought that was not your argument to deny that.  Your argument was that this -- where -- where you have a -- a State law or a foreign law or something, and it does relate to the regulation of a controlled substance, but a lot of other things as well, that that falls outside.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Suppose it relates to the State law, there -- there are 36 802 substances and here it has -- it relates to 37.  That's case one.  Case two, it relates to 4,037.   Stephen G. Breyer  And both of these statutes contain the 36 that are in Section 802.  One contains 4,000 more, and one contains one more.  How am I supposed to analyze those two statutes?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So your -- your argument is, it relates to 4,036, and 36 are 802s.  And so what we do is we read the statute.  It doesn't tell us what this conviction is about.  We look to the documents in the modified categorical.  If it lists one of the 36, that's the end of it, goodbye, he's deported.   Stephen G. Breyer  If it doesn't, we don't know.  If we don't know, he wins.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   ",13-1034
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But what second -- second--   Stephen G. Breyer  --What about, you said second?  You said two reasons.  You got your first out and I'd like to hear your second.   Stephen G. Breyer  She didn't.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now I got the second one.  Now I do have one question, and it's right related to Justice Scalia's, and it seems to me that that -- what he said, if I understand it correctly, makes this not too difficult a case, but you won't like it: That -- that we have long -- yes, it modifies law, but we have long, if we go back to the seminal case, Taylor.  There is a Massachusetts statute.  It forbids a burglary of a boat, a car, and a house.  So what Justice Blackmun said -- I think it was he who wrote it -- go back to the documents to see whether he was charged with burglary of a house, a boat, or a car.  So we have a tradition of looking back to the charging documents and maybe a couple of others to see what part of the statute.  Now, this statute is a statute that first penalizes many, many things, packaging -- packaging is relevant here.  What kind of packaging?  Packaging of drugs.  What drugs?  It doesn't say drugs.  It says controlled substance, so you have to cross-reference.  Then we look to cross-reference, and it says controlled substance means a substance included on State schedule 12345 or part B, so it incorporates that.  So then we go look to those documents, and those documents will have a long list.  And we look to see here which of the documents on the list which is incorporated into the statute is he charged of packaging.  Very simple.  Happens it's not that simple to do, but that is absolutely traditional given our holdings on how to apply the categorical -- modified categorical system.  So why not just do that right here?  Solves every problem that's raised.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's -- it wouldn't make that law a nullity.  Indeed, the person would be deportable provided when you went through the State charge, the State charge was you violated the packaging for use statute, packaging a controlled substance, in respect to Item 13 under Schedule II, which they could say, anyway, and that happens to be heroin.  And if, in fact, when you went through Schedule III, Part 4(a), the word there was “ alcohol ”, then it wouldn't.  Now, that's simple.  And if the State's charging practice is such that they don't tell you, that's equivalent to a State charging practice that in Massachusetts didn't tell you whether you were accused of burglary of a boat, of a house or of a car.  And if the State wants to do that, I guess it might be up to them if you get a guilty plea and then you could not deport the person.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I want a lot of people but they can't control the State charging practices and the States are likely, for reasons of information, to put in the charge the whole thing, including the correct reference on the schedule.  So is that the only thing you find wrong with it?  And I agree with you that that is a slight problem, that -- that we'll read back the conviction of four years ago in Missouri and we will see that it doesn't tell us what item on the schedule.  That's the problem that you see.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Any other?   Stephen G. Breyer  You have to choose.  As you well know, the problem you just mentioned is a problem that we're just having a terrible time with in respect to the violence add-ons.  And it's -- stems from the fact that State laws differ one from the other enormously.  So we either have that problem or we have the problem of you have a general statute and which does it apply more to and so forth.  Or you have the problem of do you look -- as I think Justice Kagan's approach -- do you -- you look at the individual facts of the case and require them to prove it out again.  I -- I don't see how we escape one serious problem or another.   INTERRUPTING ",13-1034
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I'm rather surprised sorry to wake up so late.  But the -- yes, you said yes, yes, you give the same degree of deference whether it's a legislative rule or an interpretative rule.  Where it's a legislative rule, Congress has, through interpretation of the statute, said to the agency, you are to expand on the statute through rules.  They're exercising delegated congressional authority.  And, of course, we have systems for deciding what deference we'll give and it's usually quite a lot.  Or if it's an interpretative rule, it's just what you said.  The agency's giving its interpretation.  And in that kind of case, the deference that a court will give to it, the answer has to be, though not except -- everybody on this Court might not agree with it.  It depends.  Very often you give them that deference because they know more about the statute, about what went on in its enactment and what Congress meant.  If that's the reason and they change their minds, I would think the deference sinks quite a lot, something it wouldn't do with a legislative rule, or after all, they have the authority to decide either way.  So I agree with you.  We needn't go into those matters in this case and I surely hope we don't.  But if we do, is there anything I said you disagree with?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's called Skidmore very often.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We have to really get into this, because I think it's fascinating and probably we could each write, you know, like a new treatise on administrative law in this subject.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What should we do?  We have a, you know -- that is, I concede, a more difficult and interesting question.  But the question presented, your reading of it is whether notice and opportunity for comment are required where an agency issues an authoritative interpretation of a regulation that squarely conflicts with the same agency's prior authoritative interpretation.  All right?  That -- that is the question presented.  Okay.  So we can answer that pretty quickly, I think.  Now, if I'm right about that, we can leave all this for another day.  And, you know, you've been quoting Auer nonstop, I would quote Mead, and I would say Mead suggests that, in fact, there are different levels and it depends and it's much more complicated than some are willing to suggest.  And there we are.  [Laughter]  It did command a majority of the Court, it is authoritative decision, and there are obviously different views among different judges about the extent to which they are the same or not.

Breyer  What's the difference between saying that they have to warrant their product, which is an opera house, to be safe, to say that they have to warrant their trains safe for -- for passage? I can't see a difference.  And it seems to me it's very normal in a contract to say that the seller of the product is implicitly warranting fitness.  Isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's -- that's the problem.  I take it to go back to the questions you were asked, from your answer, you have found no case in any country where a waiver of sovereign immunity based on commercial activity supports you.  And if so, what is that case? Switzerland and Britain -- or rather, Netherlands, say no.  The EU Treaty says no.  The UN Charter says no.  And they have all these lists of language which, while not absolutely against you, leans against you. So I want to know what is there, in the law of sovereign immunity particularly, that leans in your favor.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  But I'm taking your answer to my question being we have none.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Okay.  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  I see our interests, but I'm thinking there are 190-some-odd countries in the world.  Many of them do have governments that run various kinds of enterprises.  When they come to the United States, perhaps not being totally conversant with American law, they might think if my commercial activity in the United States really gives rise to some problem in the United States, I expect to be sued.  But where what really gives rise to it -- you see, I have to use language like that -- takes place in my country, I expect it will be my courts that will deal with it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, he has a paragraph in Nelson, one sentence of which helps you, that he says the Nelsons -- you know, they negotiated with the Nelsons in the United States.  They entered into a contract in the United States.  The Nelsons are heard aborad.  I take it that's the basis of it, and this helps you. But he says before even taking each of the Nelsons' allegations about the recruitment and employment is true, those facts entitle the Nelsons to nothing under their theory of the case, which isn't contract.  But, he goes on to say, it's these torts, which happened in the hospital abroad and not the arguably commercial activities that preceded their commission that formed the basis for the Nelsons' suit.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The basis for.  You see. And so --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- that's why I'm thinking it does not help you.   Stephen G.

How does that work? They move -- well, how does it happen?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know that, but I mean where does the -- where does the --   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, yeah.  Does that not come up as to what law applies, as to a factor in forum non conveniens.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, it doesn't? How do you decide what law applies? The contract doesn't say.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Ah.  Most significant relationship.  I see.   Stephen G. Breyer  And does it matter whether it's -- is it to the formation of the contract or is it to the breach?

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm -- I'm simply pointing out that these kinds of problems are not unique to the international context.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Breyer  Am I right about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- the weight of the -- I don't know.  You're the one -- I'm not very knowledgeable, and I -- I tend to believe you're more knowledgeable.  Therefore, I'm asking you the question.   ",13-1067
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is there another -- is there another reason -- I think both briefs are good briefs and you each have good arguments.  And so if it's an open question, why does the government oppose this?  That is to say, compared to contracts, people who are suing on contracts usually have a lawyer and they have had lawyers, they're dealing with the government, not all.  But this is about torts.  And people who are hurt with torts are frequently badly hurt, they could be anyone in the world.  The government could have treated them very badly.  Lots of things can happen.  Hurricanes.  The lawyer gets deathly ill on the way to the courthouse.  The clerk mixes up the papers.  Somebody steals the lawyer's briefs and runs off to Chicago.  I mean, all kinds of odd things can happen to a victim of a tort caused by the United States.  Now, if in fact you throw them out on this thing, which I would call a technicality, he has to go to the Senate and he has to ask them for a private bill, which is a drain on their time and somewhat random.  So those are the real choices.  Now, why other than, well, we read it and that's what the law is -- I got that part and that is not a bad argument on your part.  But is there anything else?  Is there any sort of functional reason why the government doesn't just say, look, where this person's been hurt and can win his court, fine, we won't throw him out on the basis of this.  If the hurricane happens, et cetera, then let's proceed anyway.   Stephen G. Breyer  That there's nothing else?  That's a good reason by the way.  That's a good reason, yes.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you want to -- I think it is quite funny, what I said.  I'm sorry.  Of course, the question is the law, all right.  I think what I said before is relevant to the law.  But the question here is a slightly more subtle one in my mind.  I agree with you, the legislative history, et cetera, does show they used “ jurisdiction ” nonstop.  Those are the words.  But “ jurisdiction ” at that time did not have the Irwin meaning.  And so later on, there comes a case, which case Irwin now treats this quite differently than it did before.  And isn't the question -- or is the question from the legislative history point of view a pretty hard one to answer: Did Congress or would those who passed the bill looking at the reasons wanted this statute to pick up the later interpretation of jurisdiction or they wanted it to have stayed the same in the face of that later change in how the courts treat the word.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's actually right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  But you see, the question is -- I mean, normally, it arises in a much grander context.  Normally, it arises in the context of changes of terms of the Constitution and so forth.  This is not that grand context.  But still, in this minor context, why isn't the question the same?  How did Congress -- or would because it's hypothetical -- they didn't know?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They didn't -- they had the tolling.  They didn't pass it and normally what they didn't pass isn't something that's really great strong evidence in light of the meaning of what they did pass.   ",13-1074
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I take it from what you have both argued so far, that there is nothing direct in terms of a report or a hearing or a statement on the floor that shows that anyone in Congress, staff or member, ever thought about this problem.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what we're doing then is we are, however we do it, creating a number -- not creating but following a number of legal rules, court developed, which seek to determine what the, quote, intent of Congress was on the basis of other things, not necessarily what they said or what they -- that's the situation?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Didn't -- I mean, the -- sorry, but I get -- I mean, what about many statutes existed saying -- inferring a certain use of the word about men sitting on juries.  And the statutes that say those things were enacted long before anyone thought a woman would ever sit on a jury.  But when they're interpreted by the courts, by and large, they're interpreted to include both genders.  All right?  There are many instances.  So certainly Justice Scalia is right in my opinion that that is a rule that -- the one he enunciates, but neither an absolutely firm rule nor the only rule.   INTERRUPTING ",13-1074
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you know, I'm quite interested in the government's view of this case, and I hope you will calm me down.  The reason that I find it interesting is because it seems to me there are hundreds, maybe thousands of organizations that set standards for the industry.  And some of them operate under government memoranda or authority that ask them to do it, most noted being ICANN which sets all the standards for the internet.  Now, it also seems to me very possible that a member of such an organization that fails to follow the standard could run afoul of other government rules or other agency rules or other laws, for example, by stalling the internet delivery of services and being delayed, and violating some FCC requirement.  And since I know that there are about 2 or 300 international organizations that we belong to, to do such things, I just wonder what the implications would be if you lose this case.  That is to say, if this Court held here that if a government, say, Congress, agency, Commerce Department, says to a group of private people set standards, and then if they fail -- or if they do so and a member fails to meet a standard, it runs afoul of a different rule, such as a rule that you have to have a certain speed on the Internet or some such thing.  Were we to hold that unconstitutional, I have a feeling -- this is what I want assurance on that I'm wrong -- that it would work havoc, possibly with the Internet, possibly with industry throughout the United States, I know not where, possibly in communications, possibly with the 200 or so organizations regulated by treaty.  Now, you've looked into this more than I and, therefore, I want you to calm me down and say no, this isn't a big-deal case.  Don't worry about it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  The ruling is narrow.  It just says the following.  It says, these are standards which equal legislation and as a result of these standards being legislated by this, I think, Quango or something, or whatever, by -- by this particular entity, bad things happen to freight trains when they fail to meet the standards or something and they violate some other law and that's all unconstitutional.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Going back to Carter v. Carter Coal.   Stephen G. Breyer  We could go back to Lochner.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So doesn't this show something?  Actually, the sentencing guidelines are a pretty good example.  You do have the Model Penal Code.  We have law professors telling judges what to do all the time.  We have judges who receive information in briefs.  We had lots of guidelines promulgated by the states.  There are all kinds of systems, and judges do use them, and some of them do have a practical effect and make a difference.  But once this Court starts down the road -- and it would be starting, because I am aware of no precedent -- once we start down the road of saying Congress cannot tell even a private agency to go and make some standards, which we all know will be followed, once we start down that road there is no stopping place and, therefore, the measure has nothing to do with separation of powers.  It is exactly what Justices Cardozo, Hughes, Brandeis and Stone said in Carter Coal, the measure is the due process clause, and we're all off on something of a wild goose chase in this case.  That's what is suggested to me by the sentencing guideline analogy.   ",13-1080
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Just like the Department of Commerce acting under authority from Congress gave Icon the power to write standards for the internet.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not saying it's a dire consequence.  By coincidence, I happen to be reading about the internet.  I'm trying to learn about something.   Stephen G. Breyer  You don't have to answer this question, but have you thought through what this means -- what I think is called the Baal conference where you have groups of regulators and banks meeting together to determine what they are going to do about interest rates, money supplied, et cetera.  You have not, is the answer, and I don't know enough about it, so skip it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can the government -- what is the due process violation?  That is to say, if the Department of Energy under delegated authority says that the makers of the bulbs that are energy efficient must use, and they may choose any one of the five methods that produces green light or white light or whatever it is, and they are -- they are to choose the method, and that's just it.  Now, that puts at a disadvantage those competitors who do not use energy-efficient bulbs.  Is that a violation of due process?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  It gives them considerable leeway as to make subsidiary decisions.  I was trying to make it realistic.  They make subsidiary decisions as to how they go about fulfilling the basic energy efficiency mandate.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I just described it now.   Stephen G. Breyer  They have broad authority but they have to meet certain energy-efficient mandates and they can prescribe standards and so forth that will allow them to do it.  Does that violate due process because it hurts the manufacturers of ordinary energy bulbs?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It applies.  They don't have to meet it.  What happens is it gives them an advantage the way they choose over non-energy efficient bulbs.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then what is your violation here?  I'm trying to figure out what your violation--   Stephen G. Breyer  --The what?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I was -- I'm trying to get at -- I started with the statement, I think, that due process -- your argument -- it didn't matter whether you called them private or public; am I right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, let's imagine they're just a company, not the Department of Energy.  The Department of Energy has a broad energy efficient standard.  It delegates to the people who make that kind of bulb all kinds of minor interstitial standards to make.  They make them.  They hurt the energy bulbs, the ordinary energy bulbs.  Is that a violation of due process?  If so, why?  If not, how is yours different?   Stephen G. Breyer  It will hurt the other private organizations.   Stephen G. Breyer  My reaction was the way you deal with that normally is the statute would be interpreted not to give them the authority to write anticompetitive regulations and you'd attack it under the antitrust laws.  There may be other ways to do it.  I've never heard of an example where the due process problem really was a constitutional problem under due process.  Now -- now, maybe there's some cases I've overlooked.  The only one coming close, it seemed to me, is Carter v. Carter Coal, which I always put in the same box as Lochner.  Now -- now, are we supposed to resurrect that?  Is there other authority for that proposition?  What is it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But your due process, I want some authority for your due process point on the private agencies.   ",13-1080
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I know that, but the reason that you -- the reason I think these questions are being asked, my impression is exactly what Justice Scalia said in respect to a Fourth Amendment case against a police stop.  But my impression also is that where you have a First Amendment case and it's not against the policeman, against Secret Service, this Court has not said that.  Am I right about that?  And the reason that your position, if I am right, is relevant is because I think maybe we shouldn't say that for the first time in a case where the government hasn't even argued it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now -- and what is the answer to what I just said?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Am I right on part one, and am I right on part two?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, we all know you don't need to win on that question.  The question is: Should, in your opinion, the Court reach that question.  And my hesitation would be that it is one thing to talk about ordinary policemen.  It is another thing to talk about First Amendment matters where we are engaged with a kind of special protective force, and certain residences there that make -- residences that may make a person hesitate to extend into that area.  And so what is the government's view?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We understand that and I think that that's the problem, and I think you're being sort of picked at for this reason in my mind, and I don't know if you have an answer to this.  I know everyone understands the importance of guarding the President in this country.  Everyone understands the danger.  You can't run a risk.  At the same time, no one wants a Praetorian Guard that is above the law, and we have examples of history of what happens when you do that.  So everyone is looking for some kind of line that permits the protection but denies the Praetorian Guard.  And if you have anything to say that we're immersed in details about how to get to that general objective, I would love to hear it from either side.   ",13-115X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The question is, what is -- there are so many different theories floating in this case that I've had a hard time trying to figure out what you want me to decide -- on what theory you want me to decide.  Is your allegation that the Secret Service agents were motivated in part by security reasons and in part by bad -- what you would say, bad viewpoint reasons?  Or is your theory the Secret Service was motivated only by viewpoint and zero by security?   Stephen G. Breyer  It's the latter.  Okay.  So then if it is the latter, I think you're hearing the government saying, yes, that is clearly established, that they could not in fact be motivated only by bad viewpoint reasons and zero by security, and therefore, you have stated a claim, if your complaint does say what we both just agreed you wanted to say.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Maybe they didn't.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Then I would have to decide is it the case that if the Secret -- if the Secret Service was motivated not at all by security and a 100 percent by viewpoint, does that state a claim?  Now, we are running into the Bivens problem, et cetera.  But leaving all that out of it, the next question would be, which I haven't heard argued yet, which is why I raised this, what more do you have to do than state a claim?  5 years ago, I would have thought nothing, that if you have an absurd claim, I'm not saying it's absurd, but if it were absurd, a district court could deal with that.  They would deal with it by giving you 5 minutes of discovery and then saying hum, or 10 minutes plus summary judgment.  Or have you really certified this under Rule 11?  Are you kidding?  Be careful.  Or you know, they have five or six different weapons.  Now, that is what you're arguing, I think.  But then along comes Iqbal.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, it's a long way of focusing you on that question.   Stephen G. Breyer  You say in your complaint,  ""The Defendants claim that Defendant Secret Service agents told Tao and the police defendants that the reason for the Secret Service's request or direction was that they did not want anyone within handgun or explosive range of the President. ""  ""To the extent the agents, in fact, made such an assertion, the assertion was false, and the Defendant Tao and police defendants knew or should have known that it was false. ""  So you think it's false.  They think it's true.  That's called a dispute of fact.  And the normal circumstance is that the judge has various weapons at his disposal, legal weapons, to try to prevent -- to try to prevent court's time being wasted, officer's time being wasted and other's time being wasted on factual allegations that are unlikely to be true.  That was true before Iqbal as well as after.  That's your position, isn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  How do you do that?  Because I want to follow up on just what the Chief Justice said.  Imagine that what he just said is the real case.  You have a client, imagine, who's quite sincere, absolutely sincere, and really feels he was very badly treated, and you can sign a Rule 11 statement, but suppose that the facts are just what he said.  Then suppose that Iqbal were not the law.  Forget Iqbal for the moment.  Now, you've got my hypothetical.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  What weapons does the district judge have, which I have so blithely been assuming, to prevent a waste of time by the Secret Service, a demoralization of the service leaning in the direction of being overly careful and therefore risking the President.  What procedural weapons does the present law, absent Iqbal, give him to dispose of a case quickly without disturbance if the true facts are what the Chief Justice said?   Stephen G. Breyer  But what about -- what about the--   ",13-115X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  How do you do that?  Because not -- not all of us can look it up themselves.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  The rule does say that the clerk, once the -- once the judge denies all relief, he says to you or somebody, I deny all relief in your case, then the clerk is supposed to just enter the judgment.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So how -- how is the judge supposed to not do that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why not just answer what I just asked you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, I get it.  I see.  So he says don't do it.  But we have seven -- I mean, I am moved by this.  We have a group of federal district judges--   Stephen G. Breyer  --who actually don't have to look these up because every day they work with them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And tell us your rule -- if we agree with you, we are going to produce a mess.  And then they have about seven different ways in which it will produce a mess in various cases.  And so, obviously, I do pay attention when the district judges do say that.  And so I'm not a district judge, but I don't want to produce a mess for them.  The MDL is trying to do the opposite.  So what's the answer to what they say?   Stephen G. Breyer  Has -- has that happened to a lot of district judge?  Your rule is the district judge, despite Rule 58(b), et cetera, says, I deny all relief in your case, Mr. Smith, everyone out, good-bye.  Then you say to the clerk, Clerk, don't enter the piece of paper called the judgment because I don't want them to take an appeal.  And then they ask for mandamus on the ground that must be an abusive discretion.  What happens?  Or has it happened a lot?   Stephen G. Breyer  What?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So I see.  Your rule will, in fact, win your case for your client.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then in the future, no one else is--   Stephen G. Breyer  --54.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but what they tell us, these judges, who are experienced, I stress, on pages 12 and 13,  ""District courts have evaluated the Third Circuit factors. ""  that is 54(b) factors,  ""in deciding whether to certify one among several consolidated cases for appeal. ""  Footnote, and then in the footnote they have several cases which I take it, since they tell us that, are cases where they were consolidated cases, they used 54(b) to say that one of the cases could go ahead on appeal.  Now, I took that as saying that judges are using 54(b) to accomplish the end that we seem apparently everyone wants, giving them the flexibility, and not the system that you propose.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So are they wrong or I'm not reading it right?  Probably the latter.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In 54 -- in -- in the majority of the country judges have said, when we have four cases in front of us, we have consolidated and we wish to dismiss one but keep the others going, they have said, we cannot use 54(b).  They have to have an appeal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not talking about MDL.  I'm just talking about consolidated cases.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Then talk about MDL.   ",13-1174
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But his last point, this in my mind is that if we take your route -- one problem with his route -- one problem with your route is you have to muck around with the word “ action ”.  Well, you do.  I mean, there's no doubt you do.  You have to consider it a single action while it's consolidated.  One problem with his route is that, A, nobody's ever done it, they've all thought you're right, and nobody's said much about it.  And one problem with his route is you treat consolidations where the multidistrict panel is involved and you consolidate it for discovery differently than you treat consolidations in an ordinary district court, has four cases and consolidates them.  That's the problem with his route.  So it seems to me a sort of balance there.  But one thing he said that I don't -- that did register is he said if we take your route, what happens when the multidistrict is over, see.  Eight months ago, his case was dismissed, and a judgment was entered in his -- in his case, which is now only part of the case, on your theory.  When is he supposed -- what is he appealing from?  When did the 30-day clock begin to run?  And suppose, by the way, it was never sent -- it was never really sent back because everybody else settled.  How does that work?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then you're just -- let's go back to my question.  I agree with you, I'd always learned like Hornbook rule number 1 is, there is a separate piece of paper called a judgment entered by the district court, and that is what you appeal from.  Now you have just told me, there isn't one here, in which case he can't appeal, okay, that's a separate reason.  I'm now assuming another case.  The case is, there is a separate piece of paper in his case called a judgment.  His point is, that gives me a piece of paper called a judgment to appeal from, it was entered at a certain time and now I know when the clock starts.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what I said Watts, some time ago, that I thought he had a point, is in such a case, if we treat the consolidation of approximate proceedings like we treat a consolidation of cases without the multidistrict, he cannot appeal from that piece of paper.  He has to wait in the ordinary situation, not multidistrict, until there is another piece of paper resolving everything, then he starts to appeal but at least he has a piece of paper which maybe he lacked here.  All right, now, he's saying here in the multidistrict situation, there will be a separate piece of paper, I can't appeal from, what is the piece of paper from which I know the clock on appeal begins to run?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's a red herring at the moment.   ",13-1174
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why not? I mean, what they argue is if we take your interpretation, has to be final to become a strike, all that takes time, and if you have a really real frequent filer during that year, perhaps you will file 38 more cases or maybe a hundred and there will be no way to stop you really.  You'll have to pay for -- you know, I mean, you see the problem. On the other hand, the evil that you're worried about, which is that there is a reversal of a strike on appeal, has happened precisely zero times. Ever.  So this sort of undermines the statute.  There's not a real need for it, your interpretation, and if there were by the way and it were reversed, he could proceed under Rule 60(b)5.  So that's basically their argument.  I would like to hear your answer.   ",13-1333
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What does it cost to file an appeal?   Stephen G. Breyer  Sorry?   Stephen G. Breyer  What do you think about the government's argument about the third? You imagine he has -- the prisoner has filed one, dismissed as frivolous; appeal, the dismissal affirmed.  That's one. Now he does it again.  That's two.  And he does it a third time.  District court dismissed.  And he says, I want to appeal that, and I don't want to pay the $500, 505.  The government has to say -- could say, sorry, you have to pay the 505.  That's the third, because he's a separate.  Then he says, but it says, ""on a prior occasion,"" and this is the same occasion.  And therefore he doesn't have to pay the 500.  What's your view of that?   Stephen G. Breyer  But that's -- that's the -- why I asked the question on page 25 of your brief; you say the bar goes into effect if the prisoners received strikes on three or more prior occasions. Now you say a prior occasion is not the district court dismissal in this third case.  That's not a prior occasion.  But when you look at the earlier two strikes, you don't consider it as a whole.  Do we consider this one as a whole, but we don't consider the others as a whole.  That's why I asked the question.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, it doesn't -- yes, it does.  Because the dismissal of -- by the district court of this lawsuit after it's done is a prior occasion. The present occasion is your appeal of that dismissal to the court of appeals.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not saying it's good policy or anything.  I'm just saying it's hard for me to see how you can say the one and not the other.   Stephen G. Breyer  Good.  And when we're in the second one, when you file the appeal from the first one, the new occasion hadn't started.  So we're still in the middle of the occasion.   Stephen G.

But you sound as if you're describing a forum of what used to be called the ""public action,"" of which there were no such examples in Federal law.  Most states have them.  And because you want people who aren't hurt in fact to be able to sue. And the example here is not just the Chief Justice's, which is one, but the more immediate example, which seems to be in this case -- I didn't think it was but it now seems to be -- are people -- perhaps not this plaintiff -- but people who in fact notice that someone like the defendant has filed bad procedures leading to false information.  And those people who were not injured bring a lawsuit, and they say they're following bad information.  That's it.  Bad procedure.  And Congress gave me a hundred dollars, so give it to me. Now, that's the person I didn't know was in this case, because this plaintiff seems to argue specific discrepancies in fact that, in all likelihood, hurt him.  Okay? But we're leaving him out of it. Now, I want to know what the government thinks of the case I've just put. Do -- does the government think a person who admits nobody said anything wrong about me, they did say something about me, it was all correct, but they are using bad, bad in -- practices for assembling consumer information -- In the government's view, does the person in my hypothetical, similar to the Chief's, maybe identical, does he or does he not have standing? Yes or no?   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  If you say he does not, then we are limiting this case to the case of people who are victims of not just bad practices but false information about them, and that's what the words ""with respect to any consumer"" mean.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They mean any consumer who has obtained -- who suffers from false information.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If that's the government's position, then it's not a public action.  It's a private action.   Stephen G. Breyer  You have to say, don't you, in answer to Justice Scalia, that the words, ""follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy in respect to any consumer,"" the one who can sue, means that the -- when you fail to do it in respect to a consumer, you say something false about that consumer.  It doesn't use those words, and we would have to so construe it in order to save the constitutionality of the statute.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right -- right here we have in the complaint, I guess, there were certain errors: A photograph of the wrong person; a statement that he's in his 50s; he isn't.  That he's married; he isn't.  He's employed in a professional or technical field; he isn't. That he has children; he doesn't.  That he has a graduate degree; he doesn't.  That his economic health is very strong; it isn't.  And his wealth level is in the top 10 percent; it isn't.  Okay? So that, I gather, is what he is complaining about.  Something like that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine. Now, for purposes of deciding this case, are we simply to refer to this and say, this is a case about a person who's complaining this? And is this, which I just listed, a sufficiently-concrete injury?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.   ",13-1339

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Where does all this come from? I mean, to me, when somebody uses the word ""constructive X,"" that just means it's not X and -- and it's a way of pretending that it's X when it isn't. So I start with that and say what you're worried about here -- of course, he doesn't have any possession of it.  You have possession of it.  And what he wants to do is he wants to put it somewhere so he can't get ahold of it as long as the law prevents him from having it.  And you took it from him.  You made him give it to him. So what's wrong with his saying, you go give it to somebody? Now, if it's too much trouble, the judge can say he can't make you go to a lot of trouble. If it's giving it to somebody who might really do everything he wants, we'll guard against that.  That's the job of the district judge.  End of case. Now, what -- what's -- what's -- simple, realistic, preserves the government's interest.  What's wrong with it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- things like that, and I don't understand any piece of it that has something in that like it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So we don't want them.  So we'll say to the district judge, Judge, use some common sense.  Don't let this gun get into the hands of the crime boss of the area.  Don't let the things that you were just talking about happen. And you look to see how much trouble it is, what's likely to happen, and where it makes sense.  And if it isn't likely for these bad things to happen, fine.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what is it you want to have happen; that is, the gun was taken away from him.   Stephen G. Breyer  He can't possess it anymore.  It's in the hands of the court, I guess, or the government.  Okay. Now, it's his.  It's a 1891 collector's item; he's a gun collector.  Nobody is claiming it's forfeitable, or anything.  Okay.  What do you think should happen?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that going to be your -- your position -- I mean, because I'm getting away from the -- what I call the legal mumbo-jumbo.  Looking at the word ""possessed"" there, fine.  It's a question of interpreting that.  And now where I thought, well, he can't just have it sold to anybody.  I mean, it could be sold -- you don't want it sold to somebody who's going to do his bidding every five minutes.  I mean, maybe he'd even agree with that. And that now you're taking the opposite extreme.  You're saying the only way to administer this, is the only thing really you can do with it, is you can sell it to a Federal -- through a Federal firearms dealer.  And there are probably intermediate positions. You know, I mean, somebody has a very valuable antique weapon the Normans used to shoot or something.  And he says, I don't want to sell it.  I'm going to be able to possess it again in ten years.  They'll forgive me for whatever it is, and maybe you should accommodate that, or maybe you shouldn't. I have no feeling for how important it is to have an absolute rule.  You've given some good reasons for it.  What am I supposed to do? Just say everybody agrees here you can't sell it your best friend who will keep it to you, so they're wrong on that rule.  The government's position's is now let's do something else with it.  Maybe absolute.  Maybe not.  Go work it out, Eleventh Circuit.  Go work it out, lower court.  What should we do?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is this Federal license --   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then why can't we do that here?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, your whole argument -- the reason I took it that the government wants this firearm thing, firearm dealer, is they say, look, there are a lot of guns and these guns should be safe and we're afraid he'll give them to a friend, and we're afraid maybe the gang boss will get them, and the only safe thing to do is really the firearms dealer. Okay.  But now we think of a similar kind of case.  It's just happened that the government didn't get the guns first, they're in his house.  And then you say well, the solution there is it's a reasonable time.  He has a reasonable time to do with them what he wants.   Stephen G. Breyer  What about just forgetting the words ""dominion"" and ""constructive"" and just look to the word ""possession"" and say that that sometimes includes control? And what you want to prevent is that he disposes of these arms in a way that allows him, possibly, to control them in the future or control them now in a way that likely puts them in the hands of bad people for the future. Now, that way, all we have to do is look at the word possession.  We have to add that it includes, for purposes of this statute, certain kinds of control. And then you have to say this is the simple rule, and this will prevent two bad kinds of control. Now, is there something wrong with that? If so, we then send it back so that you can argue to the district court why your rule is necessary to prevent these two bad kinds of control.   Stephen G. Breyer  I know, that's the part that it's hard for me to accept.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because you're willing to allow that control in the case that Justice Alito put where he was convicted and it's in his house.  And I don't see anything bad that flows from that kind of control.  And I don't see why you have to read the statute to include that kind of control to achieve any purpose that the statute has.  So therefore, I tend, tentatively, to reject that kind of control as falling within what the statute forbids.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What bad will happen?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why?     --Because--   Stephen G. Breyer  Why can't a person say, you know, there are things I want to say politically, and the Constitution says that the State does not have the right to abridge my speech, and I intend to say them.  And if I say them, there's a serious risk that I will be had up before a commission and could be fined.  What's the harm?  I can't speak.  That's the harm.  Right?  So why isn't that end of the matter?     --Well, the Court -- the Court -- the Court -- has repeatedly said that chilling effect by itself is not the harm.  The relevant harm in your hypo would be--   Stephen G. Breyer  Why shouldn't it be the harm?  That is, whatever -- has any case said when somebody says, you want to speak in a campaign, and we have a law here that if you do we will throw you in jail and you really do want to speak and the law really does prevent you from speaking, why shouldn't that be the end of it?     --Well, remember the test has to be a credible threat of prosecution.  What the Court--   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I'm saying is there a statute -- not a statute.  Is there a case which says the little syllogism I just went through is not the law of the United States?  Now, there may be.  That's why I asked the question.     --So I think the closest case would be Golden, for instance, where the Court clearly indicated, and I quote,  ""The constitutional question, First Amendment or otherwise, must arise in the context of a specific live grievance. ""   Stephen G. Breyer  What would you say as a lawyer -- you're a lawyer for the Commission.  You understand it better than I.  I'm just making up an example.  Do you think they'd prosecute this or not?  Somebody walks in front of the House and a political opponent has a big sign that says murderer.  No one asked.  You said but he voted for legislation that led to the death of many cats.  Would they prosecute that or not?     --Well, I think, Your Honor, it might fall within -- it -- it depends on the scope of the statute--   Stephen G. Breyer  I just want to know your opinion as the lawyer for the Commission, do you think that's going to be prosecuted or not?     --I think the -- I would say probably not, but -- but that's just my--   Stephen G. Breyer  Probably not.     --personal opinion.  Because they would say that you -- you would adopt the rule from the defamation context, that if -- if it can be interpreted under -- either as a hyperbole or either as a reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statement or were the -- but if -- if there's any interpretation of the statement that is ambiguous, where it's true, it would fall within the defamation rule that it can't be considered false within the meaning of the statute.  So the murder hypo, if it's actually he is a murderer of cats, it might -- it might mean that it's misleading.  But by--   Stephen G. Breyer  Why didn't they prosecute this here?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, we've heard in other cases, you know, just recently, a very major case, where people really believed about the same thing and they were sincere in their beliefs.  So why--     --The commissioner has now fully conceded that it would be a difficult proposition in this case, certainly.  But I -- I think it's the very nature of the probable cause finding that is--   Stephen G. Breyer  --I had a reason for asking what sounds like a silly hypothetical, but a possible one.  We understand how people take different views on that.  And then you have a hard time, it seems to me, distinguishing this case from that one in terms of their exercising their authority.  And so at least it must raise a question, a First Amendment question on the merits.  It seems pretty serious.  So if you lose on this procedural matter, how quickly can you get this decided?  I mean, there are elections coming up.  People would like to know.  They want to know what they're supposed to say.  And how long is all this procedural skirmishing going to take, which in and of itself is an obstacle to what they might say in the next election?     --So procedural skirmishing, you're talking about within--   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, you're saying, well, they don't have standardized -- you know, I was interested in this field, administrative law, and even my class, despite the scintillation, would sometimes go to sleep when I got to such questions.  [Laughter]  So -- so I'm saying that these seem to be preliminary questions on a matter in respect to which there seems serious doubt.  I'll repeat myself.  The elections are coming up.  And people have to know what they're supposed to say and what they can say and what they can't.  So how do we get this--     --Well, it seems to me your question is the -- your question is suggesting that the underlying law is -- is -- there's serious doubts about the constitutionality of the underlying law.   Stephen G. Breyer  --That--     And that provides -- that doesn't provide any basis.  The entire purposes of Article III's case of controversy requirement is to ensure that courts only decide constitutional questions in concrete cases.  And to allow the merits to slip into the Article III question fundamentally undermines the separation of powers--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, I would say one of the purposes of Stanley is to allow people who are really going to be heard to be able to be heard in court.  Well, of course, if they're not going to be heard, there's no reason.  And what the merits discussion is designed to suggest is that there are real people who would really like to speak in an election campaign.  And if they feel they can't, they are really being hurt.  That's what the other side is arguing.  And I've listened to the argument.  I'm curious as to the practicalities.  If they're right, when is this going to be heard and decided in your opinion?     --So the -- are you talking if there's a remand in the district court, or--   Stephen G. Breyer  You tell me how to do it.     --Well, I think that case should be dismissed, obviously.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm saying if you were to lose on the--     Okay.  If I was to lose?  Oh, you could -- frankly, if you remanded finding a concrete case here, you could instruct the district court to certify to the Ohio Supreme Court, for instance, which could give an immediate authoritative interpretation of the law and it could -- it could include all the relevant narrowing constructions that this Court has adopted--   ",13-193X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I just want -- before you get to this point, and my question reflects no point of view at all on my behalf.  I just -- but I took Mr. Clement, one of his points, which I thought was an important one.  He says there are some people here who strongly object to helping with abortions which include abortifacient contraceptives.  Everybody says, yes, they do object to that and that's sincere.  So he's not saying this, but I might.  But there is a compelling interest in women's health and in the health of the family, and they're not having a religious objection to taking it.  And so the government has said provide it.  Then he says, but there is a less restrictive way, and the less restrictive way is the government pays for it.  Says it wouldn't cost much.  You'd have to have another piece of paper that would go to the insurance company that would say, insofar as your employer has a sincere objection against paying this, the government will pay for it.  Now, what I want to hear, and this is not coming from any point of view, I want to hear your precise answer to that kind of argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not interested in whether they made the argument sooner or later.  What I want to hear from you is I want to hear -- and it's not -- you've thought about this.  I want to hear your answer to that kind of argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I want to be sure you have a chance to give it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Still, I want to get -- press this a little further, and I don't want you simply to just agree with what I'm about to say.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I mean -- I mean, after all, somebody, a taxpayer, might say,  ""I don't want to pay for this small war. ""  And it would be a religious ground, and it would be very, very little money, in fact, that you take from him.  Or the church might say,  ""I want a Sunday morning reduction in the cost of municipal parking. ""  And by the way, that will not only not cost the government anything, they'll make money because nobody parks there on Sunday, particularly with this high a fee.  Now, I'm thinking of -- I'm trying to figure out where this case fits in that spectrum because I think the answer to the first two questions is no.  And I know, so you're just going to agree, and that's what I don't want.  I want to understand your thinking on that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, the point that Justice Alito was making is that -- take five Jewish or Muslim butchers and what you're saying to them is if they choose to work under the corporate form, which is viewed universally, you have to give up on that form the Freedom of Exercise Clause that you'd otherwise have.  Now, looked at that way, I don't think it matters whether they call themselves a corporation or whether they call themselves individuals.  I mean, I think that's the question you're being asked, and I need to know what your response is to it.   ",13-354X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Indispensable.  Hardly anything is indispensable.  Where -- where does that word come from?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The Labor Department says -- they're here saying it's the correct test, which I think is -- well, perhaps more important, is there a close and direct relationship?  Which I understand a little bit better.  Isn't that labor?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, I see.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean, it can't literally mean indispensable, can it?  Because then anything at the end of the day, they're probably five ways of doing it.  The cash registers, you can do it this way.  You can do it that way.  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --If I can think of a way at the end of the day that the employer could have done it by saving a little more time or something like that, then it's postliminary.   Stephen G. Breyer  The one question I have for your side is this.  I would -- perhaps no one else would, but I a pay a lot of attention to the Labor Department.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, I understand that.  But this is a dismissal of a complaint and it seems to me normally what happens is you debate these facts on the summary judgment.  I don't know if they want to introduce something else.  I mean, in my own mind, I can think of five things I'd like to know about the activity and about other activities and, you know, is it more like the cash register, is it more like this or that.  So shouldn't we send it back so if they wanted to develop the record further, they can?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No matter what?  I mean, suppose it turns out that the warehouse thing -- you look all over the country and this kind of warehouse employee, of course they have security checks and they have a special kind of security checks, other people don't have them.  This is just normal that a warehouse employee does have a security check at the end of the day, and, boy, it begins to look a little bit more integral.  It begins to look like part of the job, just as he has to put the books back on the shelf.  He has to put the books back on the shelf and he has to get a security check.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then what's different about this?  What you do is you put it back on the shelf, you go get your security checked, and there we are.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That isn't really, I think, their main point.  I think this is -- this isn't really like they say, just checking out.  What it is more like is drug testing.  You heard the argument.  Drug testing--   Stephen G. Breyer  --a seminar that you'd have on the thing about sexual harassment, da, da, da.  Okay.  So what is your response?   INTERRUPTING ",13-433X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What you have here which you could address in this is -- he's quite right, Mr. Clement.  Steiner uses the words three or four times, the integral and indispensable, but they qualify activities that take place outside of regular work hours.  I think here it's conceded that it takes place outside regular work hours, it's indeed after checkout, etcetera.  So the question becomes integral and indispensable and they have gloss on that and so forth.  Okay.  So I'm in the situation probably I'd say go with the Labor Department.  They are the ones who are in charge of this.  And they are saying you lose.  They point to something in 1951.  And I have two questions.  The first one is, is there anything else you want to put in besides this very detailed complaint?  And the second question is, okay, why don't you lose?  What am I supposed to do with that opinion?  It's sitting there--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, that's true, but it's never seen in ad law in this area that -- okay, you can cite Skidmore et cetera.  But--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --But they are telling us now.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the answer to the first question, which was yes or no, there isn't anything else you want to put in the record.  You are perfectly content with our deciding this on the facts that are in the complaint?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What would the rule be -- suppose there weren't a special section about clothing.  Suppose that didn't exist and -- and suppose you had to change into a uniform.  Would that be compensable or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is the history?   Stephen G. Breyer  But if it's a uniform--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --So you're saying if you didn't have that special section, this is compensable.  If it were a change of clothing, it had to take place on site.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so this isn't really different from that.   Stephen G. Breyer  You're on site and it's no -- it's the same kind of burden that you might have to have protective clothes or some kind of special thing that you change into on site.   Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But suppose it is actually disputed, an expert -- expert -- a museum expert on an archaeological mission says, it is my opinion that those bones in that mountain are of a diplodocus and not a Trisopterus.  Now, wouldn't you have thought that at least he'd looked into it, that at least he'd seen the bones?  You see, it's absolutely open, it is a matter of opinion, but there's some things implied.  If you had learned later he'd been in a bar all night and had never even seen or heard one word about what the bones were like, wouldn't you think he had issued a misrepresentation?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  And I just produced an example because I knew that was your view, and what I looked for was an example where your view doesn't seem quite so reasonable.  And and that was why I said it doesn't seem reasonable there because I think any listener would think that the archaeologist had not been spending all night in the bar, but, rather, had at least looked at the bones or done some basic examination.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's now, that's the point I want you to address yourself to, why is that statement I just made wrong?   Stephen G. Breyer  It is my opinion it is right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There is an implied statement, I think.  The implied statement is that he's done some work to figure this out.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what about on a factual basis?   Stephen G. Breyer  Factual basis.  There has to be a factual basis for making--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --No, no.  I mean why wouldn't that work as the standard?  You're worried about the standard reasonableness is too open to speculation.  Okay.  What about just saying there has to be a factual basis for it?   Stephen G. Breyer  The person did have the opinion about the diplodocus, it was his opinion.  He's an archaeologist.  He, you know, looks around, sees the sky, the mountains.  There's some basis.  People all the time say it's my opinion.  Really, they haven't looked into it and so forth.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  A registration statement, you ought to have looked into it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm sure there are none involving the diplodocus.  But the -- the--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, don't say no.  Say don't say no.  You -- you leave it up to the judge or the -- depending on the fact-finder to say, is there a factual basis?  And just his opinion is something that depends on context, whether something is an opinion.  So factual basis in support will have, to some extent, depend on context.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I think Justice Scalia is right there, and there would be something like that, but -- and so your point is a -- is a good point, that it isn't so easy to figure this out exactly what the standard is.  The alternative, of course, is to issue registration statements that have statements in them of opinion, very detailed, very fact-based, and where people would think some work was being done, and, in fact, far less work has been done than anybody would think was plausible, and they just float right by without attack.  Now, isn't the law designed to catch those things?   INTERRUPTING ",13-435X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But assuming they're wrong about this, they said the Section 11 does not require a plaintiff to plead a defendant's state of mind, and a statement of opinion is actionable when it is ultimately found to be false.  Now, that, I don't think, is what you are arguing, what the SG is arguing.  The point is that the statement, it is my opinion that the warehouse will hold up in a 93-mile-an-hour wind for 17 hours as long as the windows are closed.  And that statement may be false, but it may also be true that the issuer before issuing the statement performed a variety of tests, in which case you would agree, I think, that it is not actionable.  And so -- so it isn't just that it's false, it's that there was no reasonable basis for holding it.  Moreover, whether the issuer has a reasonable basis is a fact about the issuer's state of mind.  It isn't whether there's a reasonable basis in the world.  It is about whether those people who issued this statement had a reasonable basis for issuing it or not.  I think that's about their state of mind in a sense.  But those two things, I think, do require reversal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, I don't see how that could be.  They said, in our opinion, we have X amount of inventory.  And you're starting out by saying, well, it is an opinion, but an opinion carries the implication that they would have some basis for it.  And they did have a basis for it.  In fact, they had a reasonable basis.  So how there can the plaintiff recover?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  You've given me those times.  What about the other times?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why wouldn't they just say, Look, the statement turned out to be false, we don't doubt that he did hold that opinion as his opinion, he was sincere, but he had no basis for that whatsoever, period.  That's what the complaint says.  Now, how can you avoid discovery on that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He never looked into it.  He had no basis for it.  That's trying to prove a negative.  What are they supposed to allege a negative, he didn't go to the law books, didn't go to the library, didn't talk to this, didn't talk to that.  I mean, it's pretty hard to do, isn't it?   ",13-435X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  To be specific, you live in California.  You have a hot dog stand in Hawaii.  All right?  It has a $1,000 income.  It comes back to California.  You pay 13-1/2 California tax.  Hawaii wants to charge another 12.  So you're paying 25 percent.  Can California say: That's fine; we give them no credit for the 11 percent they're paying in Hawaii?  So the bottom check that you get is $750, not a 1,000.  But if your hot dog stand were in California, the check would not be 750, it would be approximately 900.  Okay?  Now, is that constitutional or not?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  That's what I thought.  Then your answer--   Stephen G. Breyer  Here in my hypothetical the basis is identical.  It's called an income tax, okay?  And they run it in both States the same, and the problem that I would like you specifically and you are addressing with Justice Kennedy is what California says, open your hot dog stands in California.  You go and open them in every other State and any other State, but particularly Hawaii, you will pay $125 more in income tax, not some flat other thing, not property tax, not some other kind of tax, in income tax.  Okay.  Now, that's constitutional because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I thought that we held that quite a lot in respect to corporate taxes.  The three cases we found here, J.D. Adams, Gwin White & Prince, Hennerford, Central Greyhound of New York, all said that corporations, when they are taxed on their income by a state, that they have to apportion in a fair manner.  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Justice Kennedy asked a question I was curious about.  I wanted you to address that specifically, and you're just trying to say who's at fault.  I don't know who's at fault.  Switzerland has a tax on milk from cows that are pastured at less than 5,000 feet.  It's Belgium's fault.  They don't have any mountains.  [Laughter]  I mean, I don't know who's at fault, but that is a discriminatory tariff.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't see anybody at fault.  Actually in the corporate area it was a tax on gross income in that first case, and so I don't know why human beings well, no, I won't go into that issue.   INTERRUPTING ",13-485X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  When you do business in California and you live somewhere else, your hot dog stand is going to be subject to pretty high property taxes.  It's going to be subject to special use taxes.  It's going to be subject to taxes that they have for one time to finance the schools.  It's going to be subject to da, da, da, da, da.  Okay?  And so what they are really saying is, well, nobody claims that California can't do that and Maryland can ignore it for purposes of their income tax.  It's tough to do business in California, according to some.  Not to Californians.  But nonetheless, this is just one more burden that you have to suffer and that's because they're on -- you heard the argument.  So what's your response to that.   Stephen G. Breyer  What about a school support tax?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can you give me the right numbers in what you said?  We've heard different ones.  You just said how many States provide a credit such that a resident has to pay the higher of the foreign State's tax on its business there, or the State's tax on income.  You said 40 States impose some kind of credit like that, roughly?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So every other State.  How many are the every other State?   Stephen G. Breyer  42 States.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then fine.  Why don't you have a kerosene tax?  Everybody pays 8 percent except for railroads.  They have to pay 20 percent.  Okay?  Now, it turns out that the only people who use kerosene besides railroads are ice-cream wagons.  Isn't the comparison -- nobody else uses it.  So wouldn't you in that situation compare the railroads to the ice-cream wagons?  That's not the general.  That just happens that the State thought of a way of getting the railroads.  So -- well, I would say, I guess that last thing is to think, we know you're clever, State tax authorities, and you'll figure out a million ways to do this, but if whatever way you figure out discriminates against the railroads, you lose.  So why have a -- a general class, a competitor class or some other class that (4) is a catchall?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what about my case, then, when you say balance, et cetera?  Who wins?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because we look at all the tax, all the things, everybody pays 8 percent.  That's what it says.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But railroads.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So now we're comparing the two entities that use kerosene.  We're not comparing--   Stephen G. Breyer  --It's -- it's a wagon that uses kerosene to deliver ice cream.   Stephen G. Breyer  You think that when we send it back, if we did and you won, that suppose you win on the ground that there is no fixed group, it depends on the case who you compare them with.  So here, compare them with the trucks.  Now, you'll say, as you do say, that we have a very good reason for treating them differently.  The trucks have to pay this extra tax for the fuel, and railroads don't.  My guess is, and this is what I want to know, that they'll come back and say, but the reason that they pay that extra tax is to support highways, and railroads don't use highways.  And then you'll have to figure out whether that is discrimination or isn't discrimination, because indeed they do pay a higher tax.  But it is to go to highways, and does that count or not?  Now, my question, I don't think you can answer that -- if you want to, try.  I'm really just interested, is that likely to be the shape of the argument or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, wait a minute, wait a minute.  Why?  The obvious case which is right here is that the railroads say, you're taxing us at a higher rate.  The State's response is, true, but we do it because the trucks pay even more for their diesel fuel.  There's a higher tax.  Their response is, but the reason that they do that is because they use highways and we want to pay for those.  Now, in terms of just pure logic, that is a point; isn't it?  And so that -- that's what I think is one example of what Justice Alito was driving at.  And why -- why do you not have to take that into account, and if you do, how?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Breyer  And -- and ten years later, there it is, sitting on his docket and -- and nobody knows.  How are we any more -- how are we any more enlightened than the day before he filed the lawsuit?   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course not.   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course not.  But I'm just saying why pick the date that you file a lawsuit in -- in terms of the validity of the note--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Since the -- the filing of the lawsuit no more determines the validity of the notice than it was determined three days before.   ",13-684X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But what you have -- what were the numbers, if they're there, about how many people are injured as a result of possession of a short-barreled shotgun?   Stephen G. Breyer  So we have absolutely no idea?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's not what I'm thinking of.  I'm thinking of do we have a statistic that says how many people are injured, forgetting how -- whether it's possession or not possession or anything else?   Stephen G. Breyer  What should we do if we think that the reason that the legislature has made possession unlawful is because the legislature believes that possession will lead to a risk of physical injury?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it says -- it says if I use those words, I could repeat the same question and say the reason that the legislature makes it unlawful to possess a sawed-off shotgun is because the legislature believes that the possession, that's the crime, presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  That's why they made it unlawful.  What other reason could there have been?  And therefore, their judgment is the same words that the statute uses, but for the word otherwise.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What other reason would they have had for making possession unlawful?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm just saying what other reason could they have had for making this a crime, the possession--     INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, wait.  There are a lot of States that have guidelines and they're legislated and there are committees that decide it; there are judges on the committee.  So -- so I don't know that that's going to help us, or at least not me, too much. I do -- I have counted up the number of splits and so forth in your briefs and the others presented to us, and adding in the cases, I -- I think generously on the basis of what's decided -- what you've presented to us, there are 14 splits.  That's over a period of 20 years, and -- or so, 15 years, anyway.  And there are literally, really, there are hundreds of different crimes, thousands perhaps, by the time you get the -- So I can't -- I don't know how to decide whether 14 is a lot or a little.  I -- I'm really, I'm -- I'm at sea on this, because maybe 14 is just a few. I mean, after all, every statute has uncertainty at the edges.  Or maybe it's a lot.  Help me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, is there any example that you can think of where that was a basis for holding a statute unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I've never heard of that as a criterion.  I mean, the common law had a method.  I don't know -- and they even had crimes, you know.  There were common law crimes.  We -- we have statutes.  The government cites many which use such words as ""risk of harm"" or ""reckless"" or -- they use words like we have here, ""serious risk"" or ""risk of physical harm."" They've cited a lot.  There -- there are other statutes that involve words like that.  Are we holding all those unconstitutional?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know.  I understand you think that.  All I need is help.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, that is only the question that I have.  The first one is the one.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  But then, look, that -- that's -- you've got -- you've got that.  But it's not -- that can't be.  There's something odd about this statute that's causing the problem and I can't put my finger on it.  And what you've done is simply point out that courts have had difficulty with it.  Well, that isn't enough, I don't think. Why? The words seem clear enough.  What is it about this that's led to this difficulty? It certainly isn't a problem to identify many cases where there is a serious risk of physical harm.  But there's something that's given rise to this, and I haven't yet been able to articulate it to -- to myself.  You've thought about it more than I.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Extortion doesn't have that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any crime like that? What is the crime like that? I mean --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- in the first one, use, attempted use, threatened use of physical force, and you're simply adding to those -- to those three categories, you'd say, or risk -- or serious risk of what?   Stephen G. Breyer  Of?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I see.   ",13-7120
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  --unless they thought that possession presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another?  I'm not suggesting an answer.  I want to know what your answer is.     Stephen G. Breyer  Where did Congress say that?  Where?  I mean, a felon in possession has a gun, and you say he might keep it upstairs in his closet, in the back of a car, in his hand, many places he might possess it, and he might never use it for a crime.  Recognizing that, you say that doesn't fall within the statute.  Just substitute the words “ sawed-off shotgun ”.  In the closet, back of a car, glass case, maybe in his hand, maybe in somebody else's hand.  Maybe he just says to somebody: I have a sawed-off shotgun up there; give me your money.  All right?  All those things are possible with either.  And so since they're possible with either, on what basis do we write an opinion that says that you win with the sawed-off shotgun, but you lose with almost every other kind of gun.  What's our theory?  What lines would there be in that opinion?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  My goodness, stop right there for a second, because what we heard was there are 40,000 or more people in 10 States and others that don't even make it unlawful.  So how can we say it's more associated with crime than, what, a handgun or a regular -- or a torpedo?  I don't know.   Stephen G. Breyer  I realized you were going to say that, and all I put that in was to express my own lack of knowledge of which is which, and therefore I can't just speak ex cathedra and say this.  I would have to have some proof.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I don't -- I mean, I've seen a lot of movies.  James Cagney used to, but I can't use that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We couldn't say the same thing with a Saturday night special?   Stephen G. Breyer  They used to be.  A Saturday night special is a kind of pistol that was really used very, very heavily with robberies and crimes.  They were viewed -- that was one of the first things that people tried to get banned after assassinations and so forth.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  This isn't a machine gun.  It's a pistol, a handgun.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there -- the proposition then that I must accept I think for you to prevail is possession of that which is normally used or has a very serious risk of being used in a way that risks physical injury to another falls within the statute.  And instead of drawing a line between possession and some other use of the thing, we say sometimes possession is in itself within the statute, sometimes it's not.  If you possess those things that have as a predominant use participation in a matter that's likely to cause physical injury to another, that's within the statute.  If that's the proposition, is there any case where simple possession of anything has been interpreted as falling within this language?  I don't know the answer to that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Any, any case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I know -- you've won this issue in--   Stephen G. Breyer  --But it's this issue.  There's not some other area I could look at?   Stephen G. Breyer  There's a Fourth Circuit case and then this line right here.  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  What would you think, which I once suggested and certainly didn't have the nerve to follow through, that it's more likely that the Department of Justice, with the aid of the sentencing commission, could get the relevant statistics than it is that a defendant could.  So if no statistics appear, we should draw a presumption against the department.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, yes.  I realize that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But could you do something, that is to say, even without legislation?  Is it possible that the department, through its statistical gathering resources, and it has some, working with the sentencing commission, could help us more on the -- on the underlying statistical data that would give us a clue as to what was dangerous and what was not?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true, but you see, Begay sort of points to the problem in my mind.  There is no doubt that drunk driving does cause a risk of physical injury.  But could it be that Congress really wanted to impose a 15-year mandatory minimum penalty to a person who has two drunk driving offenses prior? It seemed outside the ballpark of what they're actually interested in, and that's why I've had such a hard time, I think we've had such a hard time with this in part because of the sentence -- you know, a 15-year mandatory minimum -- and in part, because there seems like they had something in mind, but it's very hard to figure out.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And it doesn't.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right, I see that. Now, wait, before -- because I want you to get back to the experience.  The thing also that sticks in my mind is that Indiana case.  Do you remember the one I'm talking about? Because -- because, in fact, you look at the words, but they're nested -- you see they're nested a set of other crimes.   Stephen G. Breyer  And really you'd like to know an empirical fact, how is this bit of a larger nest actually used in Indiana? It might be that it's really used against people who are involved in a violent kind of situation, or it might not be, because there are a whole lot of other ones around. And now you turn to experience and say, use experience -- you know, I have no idea whatsoever.  And Posner has suggested, I think I picked that up, go and do some empirical research; why doesn't the government do it? The Sentencing Commission has tried to do it. It can't start.  It doesn't know where to begin, there are so many statutes.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but what about extortion? I mean, extortion, that doesn't -- I mean, the other three I can see; burglary, arson, explosives, sure.  But what about extortion? I thought the -- it's like Hobbs Act, and I would be amazed if many of those involve violence, but you would know.  Do they --   Stephen G. Breyer  He's at the other end of a postal communication, or something.  I mean, they say, if you don't give me some money, I will, you know -- and I'm in New York, you're in Hawaii, I'm going to reveal such and such.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What are the facts on that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The -- the reported cases. The problem is --   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I want to just get to Justice Kagan's earlier question, if that's all right. Is it? Okay. Because for the reasons that you've heard, I'd just like you spend now or sometime before you sit down, a minute on the suggestion of limiting it through the use of the -- your appendix, which you heard described a minute ago.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because looking at the language, I think it is possible within the language to go to that interpretation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  What I'm talking about specifically --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- is you read the words, ""Otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another."" You look at the four examples.  You say in each of the four examples there was a jury determination that it fell within one of the four, and we should read those words, too, as requiring a jury to make a determination that there's a serious potential risk.  And the way you do that is that you insist that an element of the crime has the words, or the equivalent, of ""serious potential risk."" Now, that's roughly what the suggestion was on the other side.  I just didn't want you to sit down and -- at any point you'd like without -- without addressing that possibility.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm asking you as a saving construction.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I see.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Go back to Justice Kagan.   INTERRUPTING ",13-7120
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  To put it more simply, you think that the circuit abused its discretion by relying upon an improper legal reason.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's classic, right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, it isn't quite clear that they did, because they didn't say it.  But you think there's a good chance they did.  So then I guess that you would like us to say, if that was your reason, it's improper and wrong.  Now, we'll send it back to see if there is some other reason.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's your position.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There is nothing more to it than that.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  That's a different point.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What we reviewed is the word ""denied"", and the question of the word ""denied"" is we're not certain why, but we have a good suspicion.  Is that -- I mean, that's the argument.  Is there anything else to it?   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought your answer would be, of course, he is right.  But there is something unlawful about this decision.  Suppose the decision had rested on his religion.  Unlawful, wouldn't it have been?  Suppose they didn't tell us but the dissent told us.  So the question is you're arguing, yes, there was something unlawful.  The unusual thing about the case is the person who tells us what they were doing is the dissent.  Now, I don't know why the dissent says that was a reason -- as I read the dissent.  Maybe other people read it differently, but as I read the dissent, the dissenter was telling us that that was a significant factor in their decision.  All right.  As found in the other case, we find out what they did by reading the dissent, it doesn't sound to me to be totally unusual.   Stephen G. Breyer  You have different judges who possibly read different language in the dissent to suggest what the dissent is thinking.  So he doesn't say it literally, but when I read it, I thought that's what he means.   ",13-719X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You actually started out by saying 1447(d), which I thought had nothing to do with this case.  That is, I thought that they -- they were going -- the relevant statute is 1453(c)(1), which says a court of appeals may accept an appeal, notwithstanding Section 1447(d), from an order of the district court granting or denying a motion to remand.  All right?  So we are not talking about 1447(d); we are talking about 1453(c)(1).  Now, what they did is they said they have an order, and the order says, no, we won't accept it.  And the question is, is that order reviewed in this Court?  I didn't think there was disagreement that it is reviewable.  If they had said, We will not accept it because if we think that it only applies to stoppage in transitu cases, they would have their reason.  Their reason would have been wrong, and I guess we could review it.  Is that right or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes or no?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, we can't review any case when they turn it down, no matter what their reason.  Do you have any authority for that proposition?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  It doesn't adopt it.  It says notwithstanding Section 1447(d), a court of appeals may accept an appeal.  So please accept my appeal; court of appeals says no.  My question to you is, does this Court have the authority to review the order that says no?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, it doesn't--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --No matter how terrible the reason, it doesn't.  That's your answer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I'm saying my hypothetical is they do not accept the appeal.   Stephen G. Breyer  They say we do not accept the appeal because 1453 only applies to stoppage in transitu.  Okay?  A totally wrong reason.  Now, are you saying we do not have the jurisdictional authority to review that order which says ""denied""?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, denied for some clearly improper reason.  Are you saying that?  And if so, I'd like to know the authority for that because we have plenty of cases that go with the analogous certificate of appeal in habeas cases -- cases where we take it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If you don't have any cases, we might file the other way.  If you agree, and you don't -- all right, I don't know where to go from here because if you're going to say we can't take authority where they absolutely can't hear the case, where it's absolutely clear they're wrong, then I don't know where to go.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't do that, but, I mean, but I'm not going to get you to say anything more.   Stephen G. Breyer  Not necessarily.  I mean, it's the same as a complaint.  They allege paragraph 1, paragraph 2, paragraph 3, and the defendant comes in and says admitted, denied; admitted, denied; not enough information.  All right.  So you do the same thing.  What's the problem?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They have to allege the facts.  They have to allege facts.  They have to say the allegation is and so forth.  And you say they're not.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Isn't that a fact?   Stephen G. Breyer  Isn't 8.2 million a fact?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it's a fact.  They said in their view--   Stephen G. Breyer  --All right.  I don't know what a conclusory fact is as opposed to a regular fact.  That seems like a lot of money to me, but I--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Briefly, the Court has jurisdiction of cases in the court of appeals.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, when in fact a party appeals a district court's remand, he files that appeal paper in the court of appeals.  The case is there.  Before they decide it, we could take it.  After they decide it, and if they affirm it, or if they decide to hear it, we could take it.  It's there.  But suppose they say no.  Does that remove it from the court of appeals?  If the answer to that question, which is your position that you're arguing, is now this Court can't take it, then it can't take anything.  It can't take the same things down in the -- in the habeas cases.  It can't take the attorney's fees things.  It can't take anything, I would guess because it would say where a court has discretion and says, no, we are not taking it, it's not reviewable in this Court because it's no longer in the court of appeals.  Now, what's -- is that your position?  You can see I don't think it's a very good position from my tone of voice.  But if there's something else, maybe there's a better one.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, no, you -- I mean, I'm often wrong in these things.   ",13-719X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  And what is your view, given what you've just said, of the best way to narrow this statute?   Stephen G. Breyer  You still have the problem of the language of the statute covering the destruction of a document such as an EPA questionnaire that comes to the door asking about recycling, where you know that the EPA would like to have that back to help them do their official work of finding out how the program works.  You, believing that that's their business, not yours, tear it up and throw it in the wastebasket.  Now, does that fall within the statute?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It surely does within the language.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And your effort to narrow the statute has nothing to do with that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But my problem, of course, is reading the statute and taking your argument in the context that you mean it, which is we must look for a way to narrow this statute, which at first blush seems far broader than any witness-tampering statute, any obstruction of justice statute, any not lying to an FBI agent statute that I've ever seen, let alone those within Section 15.  So what I'd like you to focus on is not your problem, though they're connected, but my problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  I see where you're going.   Stephen G. Breyer  I see where you're going.  Let's follow you down that road: That you say in many situations it should not be a crime to retain a document, even though you know that the Census Bureau would like it back or perhaps the EPA.   Stephen G. Breyer  And perhaps it's nothing more than trying to find out information.  But where you end up at the end of the road is that this is void for vagueness, but not for any reason you have yet told us.  So what am I to do with the fact, if that is a serious problem, that it has never been argued in this case?   Stephen G. Breyer  The answer to that, if you want to pose it as a question to me ----  [Laughter]  --would be that the void for vagueness, if you look at Skilling, has two branches.  From Kolender v. Lawson -- Justice Ginsburg wrote it -- a penal statute defining the criminal offense, one, with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand.  That's what Justice Scalia has just talked about.  You can understand what is prohibited.  But then there is two: In a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  It's that second part, that the doctrine extends the doctrine to statutes that, while they may be clear, are far too broad, well beyond what any sensible prosecutor would even want to prosecute.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Then back to the question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but it wasn't raised below.  And these are very difficult issues and it's sort of flying blind not to have lower court opinions and the thing fully argued out before we get it.   INTERRUPTING ",13-7451

Breyer  Wasn't what the official, the government official was investigating a minor crime, catching fish that are too small?  Am I right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's a civil offense.   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  Then isn't there a statute that says that you cannot destroy evidence useful for a civil offense when you know that it's going to be?   Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, for many, many years before Sarbanes-Oxley, the Federal Government could not prosecute obstruction of justice.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where there was a civil offense involved?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not asking specific things.  I want to know the general criminal law, which I do not know all of it.  I had always thought there is a crime called obstruction of justice, and I always thought that a person who destroys evidence, where he knows it's evidence, he's been asked to bring it to the proceeding which may not yet have taken place, he purposely destroys it, I had thought that that was a crime.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But it was never was in the criminal system?  No one was ever prosecuted for it?   Stephen G. Breyer  What statute did you used to use?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, okay.  I guess I can look that up later.  But in any case, this is a -- what will you do with the problem that I put together?  That is my problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I know.  It's not just influence a proceeding.  It is, for example -- and here it's obscure, but it means to destroy something in relation to any such matter or case.  What matter?  In relation to any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency within the United States.  What?  [Laughter]  I mean, somebody comes to the door and says -- I've been through this.  He passes a piece of paper through the door.  It's the postal -- it's a postman.  He says, please send this back.  It's our proper duty to deliver the mail.  I say, I hate postmen and I rip it up.  20 years.   Stephen G. Breyer  And why wouldn't it happen?  It wouldn't happen because you'd never prosecute it, though I've had my doubts recently.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, I do.  I say, I hate postmen.  I don't want them to find out.  And I tell four people, I finally got even with the postman.  I have -- I have the intent.  And I'm using a ridiculous example purposely because, by using an example purposely, I'm trying to get you to focus on the question of how possibly to draw a line.  And if you can't draw a line, it seems to me that the risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is a real one.  And if that's a real risk, you fall within the vagueness doctrine.  There is the whole problem spelled out, and what I do not understand is the relation of this case to that doctrine or how to decide this case.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How do I know since there could be four ways of trying to limit it?  And one way to try to limit it might be what your opponent says.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true.   Stephen G.

Suppose I worry about Justice Alito's single fish in the case of a camper who kicks an ember away, knowing you shouldn't have built the campfire or picks a flower, knowing you're supposed to let wildflowers blossom.  What about that 20 years, and you could multiply those beyond belief.  So if that's the problem, does his client go to prison because we've just assumed that problem away from the case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How -- how do we handle it if, as you say, there is a genuine concern in that respect, but it wasn't argued here?   ",13-7451
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So let me try this and if you don't agree with it, just say no and I'll stop.  Okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought the classical distinction is pretty much what I think Justice Scalia was driving at, that there are a certain number of factual questions where the question is of the kind, does this label belong on this thing, this thing being not in dispute.  It might be a South African yellow canary up there.  The statute might use the word “ South African yellow canary ”.  But we are not certain whether that is a South African yellow canary.  If we call in a bird expert who looks at it and says it is, that is a question of fact.  If we call in a lawyer to say how are these words being used in the statute and does that fit within it, then it is a question of law.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  But we also have the Federal Circuit in the two cases where you disagree with the government accepting the fact that, in fact, the experts or the lawyer who talked to the patent guy did use the wrong words.  They accept that.  And then what they say is, well, in their view it is that that didn't really concern the Federal Circuit, but for the weight that the judge gave when trying to interpret the terms in the patent.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that at least is a legal question.  Have I got that right basically, what the argument is?   Stephen G. Breyer  And what do you say in response?   Stephen G. Breyer  What do we do when there's a bus accident on a technical thing and different people who were injured sue in different places at different times?  Same problem, isn't it?   Ginger D. Anders  I'm--   Stephen G. Breyer  Same problem.  I mean, you can think of a thousand cases like that where -- where you have a big bus accident, technical problem with the motor, different place -- people from different places who are victims and they sue in different places at different times.  Juries or tried to the bench, they could reach different factual conclusions.   Ginger D. Anders  --I think that is exactly right and I think--   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So what do we do--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, I was actually curious what we did, because I can think of examples in antitrust, I can think of examples in corporate law, I can think of examples versus every area of the law, where often it does happen, as the Chief Justice says, it could -- the different factual things have enormous public implications.  What I was interested in and asked because I wanted to know, what are the legal devices for dealing with that?   Ginger D. Anders  --Well, I would make two points.  I think that, first, because of the way preclusion works, it only runs against the patentee.  All right.  So if the patentee loses on an issue of claim construction or indefiniteness, he cannot then relitigate that issue, but other -- other accused infringers can relitigate it and try to build a better record.  We actually think that that -- that keeps this from being a policy problem, the possibility that you could have a subsequent decision that reaches a different conclusion.   ",13-854X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I think that Markman just dealt with judge/jury, not which court gets the fact up -- decides the facts basically, which is where I do start.  So if you want to -- but if I take that as a given, then I'd say why should you treat fact matters here any different than any other case.  The main reason for letting the district judge, I've always thought, decide facts as an initial matter in a technical case is because there are all kinds of facts, you know.  We happen to have some particularly odd definitional ones here, but there are all kinds of facts.  In technical cases, there are all kinds of facts.  And the traditional reason is you've seen the witnesses -- but there is one thing he's done that the -- that the court of appeals has not done, and in a technical case, it seems to me that makes an enormous difference.  He sat there the whole time and listened to these experts talk.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that, I think, is a very powerful reason for saying in a technical case, don't overturn the judge's factual findings whether they are -- particularly scientific matters, but no particularly here -- unless those three judges who will not even read the whole record normally and certainly won't hear those witnesses, don't let them do it unless they are convinced that it is clearly erroneous.  Now, that's the argument, and I would like to say that's different from a statute.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Whether or not it is different from the -- it's different from -- it's the same as any technical case.  Now, why is this different?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But I mean, that same thing, as we know, could happen in dozens of -- of technical cases.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And you go on importance, I could make up some important hypotheticals.  You want trivial ones, I'll make some of those.  You want to put a definition on a thing, fine.  You know, we can all both -- and you're probably better than I am at it.  And you say is that the only answer that patents are somehow different?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But normally, normally is not difficult to distinguish the one from the other.  Sometimes it is.  But in the cases where it isn't, which I think are vast, did that dial read 7?  I have 4 witnesses who said it did, and I have 3 witnesses who said it read 5.  And now let's complicate that, but it all has to do with what happened in a laboratory at a particular time.  Are we going to have the 3 people from the Federal Circuit going in and second-guessing the judge without giving him any weight on that kind of factual question, which I suspect, I have no reason to believe it won't, will turn up comparatively just as often?   Stephen G. Breyer  I want the answer.  I want the answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What happened in--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I mean, it isn't that I like it better.  It is that Rule 52(a) says that fact-finding of the district court should be overturned only for clear error.  And once I start down this road, well, that's true on some facts and not other facts, and -- and I get into this.  See, I'm not an expert.  I don't see where the stopping place is.  I don't see how to manage the system and I am moved by the fact that the lawyers here are pretty much -- who know patent law are pretty much in favor of district courts as far as amici are concerned.  They're pretty much in favor of district courts making the fact-finding.  So -- so I don't think where to go to start drawing the lines you want to draw.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know.  Rule 52(a) and that's the -- what do I do about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  How many patents do they issue a year, do you have any rough idea?   Stephen G. Breyer  How many patents are issued every year?  Roughly.  Do you have any idea?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  That may be true, but what you -- and I know I'm not going to get an answer from you, because I know what the answer would be.   Stephen G. Breyer  My question is, where are we going if we start carving out one aspect of the patent litigation, namely the construction, and say that fact matters underlying that, root facts, even when they are one witness versus another, are for the court on review to decide, but in all other matters, they're really clear error.  I don't know where I'm going with that, because I'm not an expert in this area.  But you see that I'm nervous about it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, you've seen the figures in here.  The figures are they followed the path and they reverse non-stop and it's, like, 30 percent or 40 percent of all the cases get reversed.   ",13-854X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So that's to Justice Kennedy's question, I thought your answer would be there isn't a one-way ratchet.  That's Cromartie 2, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Doesn't Cromartie 2 say if you're doing this for political reasons, because many, many African-Americans vote Democrat, all right?  And so what they're doing is they're trying to help the Democrats.  So, yeah, we're trying to help the Democrats.  Okay.  If that's what you can -- are doing and they can't really prove the contrary, the burden is on the one attacking the district, whether they are doing it by removing some African-Americans from this one or by putting more into it, it's the same issue.  Am I right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  Then it's not a one-way ratchet.  It is a two-way ratchet, which--   Stephen G. Breyer  --That's not our case because our case, they don't try to defend on that ground.   Stephen G. Breyer  To get there, we'd have -- you're talking, about, second, we construe the filings of the Black Caucus plaintiffs as arguing that the acts as a whole constitute racial gerrymandering, so we'd have to say that was wrong, they didn't get the complaint right, send it back.  So if we're going to have to send it back, I guess what you'd have to -- would there be anything wrong with saying this: Look, tell the plaintiffs please to point district by district to the fact that the primary motive here was racial.  I don't think that would be too hard.  We have loads of evidence on that.  Now, if the primary is racial -- and this is the crucial part -- they then to justify this have to show that they are making a -- and I don't know what word -- reasonable attempt, good faith reasonable attempt, some other word, to comply with the section, old Section 5 requirements, with the Section 5 requirements.  And now they have to do it over again anyway and so they do it over again, and if in fact some of the questions suggest that that is what they were trying to do; and you'd have evidence there that said, no, no, that isn't what they were trying to do.  They didn't even read the guidelines of the attorney general.  They didn't even look at what happened in the past.  They made no such attempt.  All right.  So would there be, from your point of view, anything wrong with that holding?   ",13-895X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose we, I don't know, I want to know what you think about the practicalities of sending this back.  Assume -- assume in the back of my mind just relying on State policy is this.  A State legislator gets up and says, in our State, there's a history of discrimination against black people.  There are very few black representatives in this body.  I would like to find a way of drawing district lines so that we have a few more.  Okay?  That's the normal way this case comes up.  This is an obverse and odd situation.  All right.  I don't know that that statement should automatically disqualify his plan.  Maybe we should look a little further into it and see what they actually did.  Suppose I start there.  And then I say, okay, you go proceed district by district.  I suspect they will be able to prove that at least in some districts, at least in some, the statement of the legislator here did prevail and did make a difference.  Now, if that's so, they don't have Section 5 to rely on as a defense.  So I don't know what the defense is possibly going to be.  And since we can't even think what the defense is, why don't they just redo this plan over in the legislature and save everybody a lot of time and trouble.  What's your response to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So my point of my question is you want to go to that lot of trouble before a lot of extra trouble in court proceedings, or do you want to go to that trouble right off the bat and get it over with?  I expect you'd have an answer to that, and I'm not taking a point of view.  I just want to know what your response is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Of course you don't, but my question is, is there going to be a defense left that could stop you from having to go back?   Stephen G. Breyer  What?   INTERRUPTING ",13-895X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That isn't de minimis.  That's -- I mean, don't you accompany a person as well when you stay with them in the room, and did he?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Wait.  So -- so a person -- does it make no difference that they -- they take the teller or they take the woman, you walk ten feet down to a room, he says, sit there, and he stays with her to make certain that she won't pop her head up so someone can see?  I think that's probably what happened here.  All right.  If that's what happened here, the accompaniment was not just walking, it was also staying and walking back perhaps.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's a very peculiar statute.  You kidnap a victim as a hostage.  You walk them two feet into the car.  You quickly disguise the car and have them lie on the floor, and -- and that isn't covered by the statute.  Or you have outside, I don't know, there is a closet, you go, you walk them in, and push them in the closet, that is not covered.  It is covered if you -- if you go 30 feet down the corridor with somebody else.  I can't -- I don't understand, then, how this statute--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --You want to know what, I mean, that's exactly the same question.  Look, substantially -- you tell the jury substantial, they have no idea in this context.  I mean, I wouldn't.  I would have thought yeah, moving a person -- I don't see what it has to do with her home or somebody else's home.  I don't see what that has to do with it.  And a few feet sounds, yeah, it sounds substantial to me.  I know nothing about it, you see.  So is there anything else you want to say in response to what Justice Alito said?  Because that -- think of my problem.  It's not your client that is the problem, but it's not the main problem.  The main problem is to write a standard so people can understand it.  And what do you want the words of that standard to say?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  To do that you had to cross State lines.  The kidnapping statute, you had to cross State lines, and you don't even argue you have to cross State lines.   ",13-9026
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The problem -- the problem--  is there is a set of cases where you can think it's serious and a set of cases where you just think it isn't.  The bank robbery there are more in the bank are the ones that concern me that it isn't.  The bank robbers are in the bank, there are a couple of other customers walk in and one of them says will you please walk over here with me for a second.  Okay?  They walk two feet to get him out of the way.  That doesn't sound as if that is a lot worse than pistol whipping somebody.  And you can multiply those cases.  And what is worrying me about it is, since it's a mandatory minimum, the prosecutors have a choice about whether to -- to indict or not on that ground, and a person who is coming in and who is represented and -- what is his choice?  You know, you either plead guilty or I put this in, too, because you moved one of the customers 10 feet.  Now, that's -- that's -- the it's the -- that's the nature of the mandatory minimum which is disturbing and calls, I think, for some kind of lenity when there is openness of interpretation.  But on the other hand it's very hard for me to distinguish how to separate the cases that seem comparatively trivial taking place within the bank from the ones where you really are injecting fear, special fear, into the mind of the person who is told to accompany you, and that could take place even if it's like one foot, because he's been singled out.  Okay.  Is there any way to do it?  Is there any way that you could reassure me that in these lesser cases this will not be used as an instrument towards a guilty plea or an instrument where these minor things that he's been talking about nonstop, your brother over here, that they'll certainly turn out to be charged routinely?   Stephen G. Breyer  --Yeah, I'm going to walk into a bank robbery where they have about--   Stephen G. Breyer  My -- my example was meant to encompass a polite, but armed, bank robber.  [Laughter]   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, of that -- why don't we say that?  Say that what this statute covers is forcible abduction, and there we are.  That's not perfect.  But it's -- at least my polite but armed bank robber who asks the person to move over hasn't abducted him and in many of these de minimis cases there won't be an abduction.  Why not just pick up those words and say indeed, the government uses that when it explains it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but you could say de minimis did because of the language that you point to, accompaniment.  That's what I criticized you earlier as just being too vague.  But where movements are small, this is -- where movements are small in -- considering de minimis you can consider that where movements are small, the absence or presence of the kind of fear that is connoted by the word abduction, which -- that's a little tough.  But I see your point there.  But the alternative is just this sort of vast discretion in bank robbery cases where where there has been nothing more like an inch or it really had nothing to do with the abduction concern and the distances were miniscule.   Stephen G. Breyer  Would you admit that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, that's true.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, 95 or over 90 percent of all the criminal charges in the country are pleaded guilty.  Isn't that the right number, something like that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And certainly you do read lots of criticisms of people pleading guilty because they are afraid that in the absence of the guilty plea the sentence will go way up.  I don't know how true that is, I haven't seen the studies, but I'm certainly familiar with literature that says that.   ",13-9026
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then what's the disagreement?  I mean, what's the disagreement between you and the Solicitor General?  Justice Brandeis said years ago, which I thought was a great statement of law which doesn't ordinarily appear: Before we can say whether an agency decision is right or wrong, we have to understand what it means.   Stephen G. Breyer  You get some piece of paper, you can't figure out what it means, well, then they'll send it back or they say no.  That's what judges do with administrative agencies all the time.  Your question says, do they have to have reasons?  Yeah.  Their question says can it appear in a separate document?  Why not, as long as the document is given about the same time?  So what's the problem?   Stephen G. Breyer  Sometimes it could, sometimes it couldn't.  It depends on what it says.   Stephen G. Breyer  But that's the -- I know.  You want -- that's what you really want to say.  You want to say the record here isn't good enough.  But it seems to me that the one thing we're not deciding is whether the record here is good enough.  Rather, the questions have been put to us in general terms; we can answer them in general terms.  We probably even might be able to write an opinion in three paragraphs, clear.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Ah, yes.  But to do that, I would have to know quite a lot, wouldn't I, about -- about the situation of your client, about the situation of the city council, about what was actually meant by what they said about the context.  You understand the problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  How does it work in -- in the ordinary agency, which I should know but I don't?  The Federal Power Commission, a blessed memory, is faced with an application by El Paso Natural Gas to add an extension in a little area of New Mexico.  The power commission denies.  There are five votes.  One person says I'm denying because we don't need the gas; a second person says I'm denying because it's ugly; a third person says I'm denying because it blocks certain animals from getting to their feeding place; and the other two vote to grant, all right?  That's arisen in the course of the last 100 years, something like that.  How do the courts handle that?   Ann O'Connell Adams  --In footnote 6 of our brief we describe some cases along those lines, where -- I mean, in this case we think that you have a majority, three of five given the same reason--   Stephen G. Breyer  But if -- I just want to know how it works in the case I put.   Ann O'Connell Adams  --Right.  In -- in the cases we describe in footnote 6, some courts have said and the D.C. Circuit did assume in one case that we cited that you need a majority, but other courts have said that it's okay as long as if everybody gives a different rationale, as long as you can get to a majority; you can conduct substantial evidence review of each of those rationales.  And we think that makes sense here because the statute gives reasons why you can't deny an application.  It doesn't say there are only certain permissible reasons why you can't.   ",13-975X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The facility placing -- everyone loves cell phones, apparently.  [Laughter]  Nobody likes towers, apparently.  So Congress passes a law.  It says: You've got to have towers, I'm sorry, and the local community can stop it, but they can't stop it for one of three substantive reasons; and in addition, they have to show that their decision was rational, which is done -- or reasonable, which is done by having a record with substantial evidence.  That's what this means to me.  Now, your clients and others aren't used to being agencies, but they're being treated like agencies and, therefore, the simplest thing is to read this two things together, just what Justice Kagan said, write the decision and give your reasons because otherwise there is no way to know whether there's substantial evidence or not.  It's in the same clause.  It's in the same phrase.  The words are right there.  It says “ decision supported by substantial evidence ”.  I know -- that's, I think, the basic argument.  The Solicitor General doesn't go that far, but if we don't have simplicity, we'll have 2 million different ways of going about this between different cities and counties.   Stephen G. Breyer  But then you're agreeing with your opponents, it seems to me.  You have the document, the document says “ deny ”, and there it gives the reasons for denying so people can see if there's substantial evidence.  You're just saying it was the later document.  They're saying it was the earlier document.  I don't know.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But do you agree with them on that, that one document--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --Well, I don't know if they should be called “ the minutes ”.  I'm not an expert on that area of city government.  I don't know whether you want to call the document “ minutes ” or whether you want to call the document “ written decision ”.  That seems to me not before us, but what is before us is whether the decision has to have in it the reasons so that we can tell if it's supported by substantial evidence.  You agree on that one?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why -- why do we have to say?  Why don't we take word for word almost what the -- what the court said?  What this statute requires is that there be a written denial -- well, we can forget whether it's separate or not -- describing the reasons for the denial and containing a sufficient explanation to permit the court to evaluate the evidence, period.  Now, that's what the city has to do.  And if they produce something that's a mess because it's a 98-page thing of minutes and the court can't figure out what it is, you'll get a decision like this.  If, in fact, somebody summarizes at the beginning, these are the reasons that we have denied and therefore we do deny it, it won't be a problem.   ",13-975X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  And on the briefs, I thought on the basis of the briefs that there are two separate questions.  One has to do with the state of mind and the other doesn't.  The one that doesn't has to do with what the person does.  What he does, and he has to do this or he's not guilty, is he has to communicate a true threat.  What is a true threat?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  A true threat -- you've seen the definitions, the instruction that was given is similar to ones that are well-embodied in the law.  What you have to do is communicate a true threat, and a true threat is a threat that a reasonable person would understand to convey a serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily injury or take the life of an individual.  Now, there is a second question which I find more difficult and that has nothing to do with what you do.  It has to do with the state of mind, and that is what I want to know your view about.  Because I saw nothing in the government's brief that says a person could be convicted through negligence.  Rather, what they say, and it seemed to me this is hornbook statement of criminal law, is that you have to know that you are doing those things that are the elements of the crime.  So you have to know that you are transmitting in commerce a true threat, as I've just defined it.  And if you don't know that, you are out.  You are home free.  Now, that I would say is Model Penal Code.  That is Brown Commission.  That is every sort of statement of criminal law that I've read, which may be only a few, but I don't know many that contradict that.  And so why isn't that the end of this case?   Stephen G. Breyer  He has to know that, and I will ask the government.  I will ask the government the same question.  I have in their brief things where I think what they are saying is the way I said it.  But they will say perhaps something else, but that is up to them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Forgetting their position for the moment, what do you think of the position I just took, which is my question?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, he does.  Just as if you go into a bank, you have to know certain elements for it to be bank robbery.  You have to know that you have a threat, you have to know -- et cetera.  Now, here one of the elements of the crime is to communicate, in commerce, a true threat.  So you have to know.  Communicate, in commerce, a true threat.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I wouldn't have asked it if I didn't want your view, so what is your view?   Stephen G. Breyer  In the example just given, I guess there would be a jury question of whether he knew that a reasonable person would take this communication as a threat.  The fact that he put at the top, rap lyrics, when he's not a rap artist and the fact that he put at the bottom, just kidding, just kidding, would perhaps, when well argued by the prosecution, convince the jury that of course he knew that.  If, on the other hand -- I mean, you know, I mean, we have many difficult factual questions as to knowledge.  Is this more difficult than any--   ",13-983X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But that's -- can you go back?  That's exactly the point that is bothering me.  I'm -- I'm with you down to forget the purpose.  I'm with you there has to be a true threat; we'll assume that.  And now the question is knowledge, and that's the general requirement for mens rea where there's just a general -- that's the normal rule, knowledge.  And you have to know those portions that make up an actus reus.  You have to know the elements.  One of the elements is a true threat.  So I thought: What do you say you have to know there?  And when I read your brief, you first said he has to know, he has to understand the meaning of the words he speaks in context and must intentionally speak them, and is showing that the defendant acted knowingly in transmitting a true threat requires proof the defendant knew he transmitted a communication and he comprehended its context and context.  Now, when I first read that -- you hear my clerks have disagreed with me -- I thought, well, that means he has to know that it is a true threat; i.e., that a reasonable -- why did I think that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You just saw people being sworn in.  Suppose someone comes from, I don't know, hears them say  ""I do, I do, I promise. ""  does he know the meaning of the words?  Unless he knows the action -- so a marriage is better.  Someone who has never seen marriages hears the bride say, “ I do ”.  Has the person understood the meaning in context, in context of those words, if he doesn't know that that means they're married and go through a lot of legal proceeding?  And similarly, can a person know the meaning in context of true threat unless he understands, just like the words “ I do ”, what a true threat is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In fear.   Stephen G. Breyer  A reasonable person.   Stephen G. Breyer  With knowledge.  I mean, forget -- I mean, I want -- Justice Kagan and I were just trying to get you to focus very specifically, I think, on -- forget the First Amendment issue here.  Take it to the side.  Forget it.  Let's look at ordinary Hornbook criminal law after the Model Penal Code.  There the normal -- as you say in your brief -- requirement is that the person know the elements of the offense.  That's normal.  If it is drugs, he has to know that this is a drug.  If it is a threat of force, he has to know that he has a threat of force, I take it, or that it's a bank.  So why shouldn't he, here, have to know what is an element of the crime; namely, that there is a true threat as so defined?  Just Hornbook criminal law.  Are we departing from it or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I agree with you, no specific intent.  That is, you don't have to have it to be your purpose.  That's why I use the Model Code term -- Model Penal Code terminology which, for me, is easier.  You don't have to have it as your purpose.  But you do have to know the elements of the offense.  You have -- you agree with that, I think.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  You have to know what you're doing.  What you are doing is you have to communicate a true threat.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly.  I -- I think that is the distinction.  I -- I'm thinking that perhaps a lot of these cases would come up in domestic relations disputes and in such a case, the question would be -- because people get into heated arguments -- do you have to show the defendant used some words that, in context, would be taken as a true threat, or do you have to show that the defendant used some words that do have that characteristic and he knew that they had that characteristic?  Now, if I'm right about this--   Stephen G. Breyer  --Hmm?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know.  You think the former--   Stephen G. Breyer  --and the real issue is, is it the former or the latter?   Stephen G. Breyer  And the -- if it's totally open in the history and so forth, I think, you know, people do say things in domestic disputes that they are awfully sorry about later, and -- and where the person didn't know that he was saying something that a reasonable person would take as a threat--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  --I'm -- I'm hesitating to say that Congress wanted or it makes sense to -- he is lacking something there.  Maybe it's his fault that he is lacking it but he is.   ",13-983X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  It's tough.  I mean, I find this pretty tough.  I think that there are five major cases: Three are against you; two are for you.  Deveaux is for you.  Osborn uses the word ""incompetent jurisdiction""; it's against you.  Not surprising, the Bankers' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the D'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It comes out the other way. And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it comes out the other way.  And so what I see going for you is one page of legislative history which says, explicitly, you're right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Do you want to deny that legislative history? It helps you, doesn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's true.  But these cases that you're talking about are not directly in point.  D'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this issue, and it used the word ""competent jurisdiction."" And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X, did say that the language, absolutely clear, this means -- because it refers probably to specific courts and isn't just a general statement of courts in general -- this means that they're giving jurisdiction. It's just not just authority to sue and be sued.   Stephen G. Breyer  I got that one.   Stephen G. Breyer  D'Oench, Duhme, my God, is the -- that's identical to the Bankers' one.  Identical. And they come out the other way, and all that's there is the word ""State and Federal"" --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Go ahead.  Finish.   Stephen G. Breyer  This is what's really bothering me here, and I don't know if you can help or not.  After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I would think you're right, if I were doing this afresh, and particularly when you have that page of legislative history.  I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave it to the senators, and they thought, we don't want Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all the time.  We just want them to have the right when they otherwise would be in Federal court. But when I finished reading the cases, going back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is something of a rule here.  It may not make too much sense, but it's even there in D'Oench, Duhme, and -- because it's -- actually, I do think it is more even stronger for the other side than -- than this one.  And then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there is add some old report that sort of seemed to support the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of legislative history here. But I see now it's jurisdiction.  And we shouldn't get things too mixed up.  They are hard enough.  And then that seems to say if you say State and Federal, you -- you see where I'm going?   Stephen G. Breyer  So I don't know whether to look into it deeply in this particular case where you're going to end up with a result that seems to be different than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it.  It was all decided.  Keep to the precedent.  Forget the page of legislative history.  It will be better for the lawyers.  And it will be better for the judges.  It will be simpler for them.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that's the dilemma that I'm in. Anything anybody wants to say to help me would be welcome.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, the one that used the word ""competent jurisdiction,"" ""having competent jurisdiction,"" was Osborn.   Ann O'Connell Adams  Right, but it --   Stephen G. Breyer  What do you do about that?   Ann O'Connell Adams  But in -- in Osborn, I think Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says, ""all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any circuit court of the United States."" So I think in that case what the Court said was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on all circuit courts of the United States.  It didn't use the language ""court of competent jurisdiction"" when it referred to the Federal courts.  It used that language only with respect to the State courts. D'Oench, Duhme did not use the language ""court of competent jurisdiction,"" Justice Breyer. It's -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae's charter used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked exactly the same as the FDIC's, which the Court said in D'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in 1954, Congress changed it to mean something different. One of the main rationales of the court of appeals in this case was that the -- the work that ""court of competent jurisdiction"" is doing is that it's telling you that you can't file suit in a specialized court, like a State traffic court or a Federal bankruptcy court.  Well, the reason why the phrase ""court of competent jurisdiction"" would tell you to do that is because you've got to look at the statutes authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the suit that's being brought can be brought in that particular court.  We are just asking for the same analysis to be done with Federal district courts.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, I guess language that hurts you is ""any court of law, equity, State, or Federal."" I mean, that's the D'Oench, Duhme one, and they say that puts you in Federal court.  And you -- you want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say ""competent jurisdiction,"" and we'd love them to be in State court; we want them to be in State court. Have you found any that say just something like ""in any court of law, in equity, State, or Federal,"" and you want them to be in Federal court?   Ann O'Connell Adams  Well, those -- those can be in Federal court, per the Court's decisions in D'Oench, Duhme and in Red Cross.  If that's the way --   Stephen G. Breyer  But what we have to say is, once you added these words ""in any competent jurisdiction,"" what they did, those words took the case out of Federal court unless it's some other basis for getting there and require you to go to State court, and to subtract words -- God, it's -- I mean, as a matter of the English language, it just seems a little tough.   Ann O'Connell Adams  No, no.  I think as a matter of an English language that's our strongest point.   Stephen G. Breyer  It is.   Ann O'Connell Adams  That natural reading of that phrase, a ""court of competent jurisdiction"" means that you have to look somewhere else to determine if the court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a ""court of competent jurisdiction."" The Court has observed that about various statutes --   Stephen G. Breyer  I see.  I see.   Ann O'Connell Adams  -- and -- and we are just asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal district courts. The Respondents refer to the Federal district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  You cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a Federal district court unless there is complete diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in controversy. So that language, ""court of competent jurisdiction,"" should just tell you, look at the statutes authorizing the Federal court and check whether this suit is authorized to be brought there. There's a few other textual points that I think reinforce the point we are trying to make.  One is that Section 1349 should be an important point of reference.  Congress established a general rule that having a government charter is not enough to confer Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United States owns 50 percent of the corporation's stock, and when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter jurisdiction.   ",14-1055
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I just want you to -- to talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of legislative history, which could not be more clear.  It says exactly what the government says.  It says -- they are -- they are asked, does it -- if we did this, aren't we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the right to go into a Federal court, although the matter may be purely a State matter? That's not what we intended.  All we intended -- then they say, well, you know, they have to look to see whether it's really a State case or whether it's really a Federal case. I mean -- and the words ""competent jurisdiction"" do -- she says do that.  That is their natural meaning.  I hadn't quite taken that in, but -- but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what's the point of having these here if the statute without them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court if you want?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let me give you that -- what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn't look at legislative history.  I'm not prepared to say that.  What -- what should I do?   Stephen G. Breyer  For this reason. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  Did you look it up? I mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it. It didn't just have computers write it.  I mean, there is a human being who wrote it.   Stephen G. Breyer  But who? Where did he come from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know?   Stephen G. Breyer  He was fired.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Are those words, ""competent"" -- you know, in any ""court of competent jurisdiction"" --   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, ""State or Federal."" You know, I've got that point.  I just want to know who did this.   ",14-1055
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That sounds like what you're saying -- I don't understand the point.  What Justice Scalia said seems right.  It's charged.  You have to find A and B.  Therefore, they must have found A. The indictment, superseding indictment charged A.  The statute says A.  Okay? So we know they found A. Now, what's the problem?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The problem seems to have been that they were also charged that they had to find B.  Fine.  They made a mistake. Did you object? No. Was it harmless? It doesn't seem to me how it -- how could it have been harmful. I mean, I -- I think your problem is the problem with the extra B in the jury instruction.  And so I would look to see what's your objection to B? Did you object? No.  Then it must have been plain error. Well, it was -- it was erroneous, but was it harmful? Now, that I could understand, but you're arguing something else, and it is the something else that I don't understand.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there anybody -- well -- well, I don't see the theory of it.  The jury is instructed.  You -- he is guilty of murder if he killed someone, da-da-da, and he had -- and he was looking at the ceiling.  Okay? Doesn't make any sense. Okay.  That was wrong. So now you're saying if the judge makes a mistake there, nobody objects, he says the wrong thing, and he was looking at the ceiling, you have to let the guy go because -- although he didn't hurt anybody, no harm, you still have to let him go.  And I just need the ""why.""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It was not a case involving a jury instruction.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why formal? I mean, we've been through this many times.  It comes up in all kinds of instances.  People are always alleging -- not always but often allege that their counsel was inadequate. Sometimes it would be possible to know that on direct appeal, but in the mine-run of cases, you want to find out from the counsel why he did it.   Stephen G. Breyer  And therefore I think every circuit -- I don't know what this Court has said -- has said that you raise IAC claims in collateral proceedings. Now, if we start making exceptions from that, you're going to get a jurisprudence of when the exception comes up --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- and when it doesn't and how clear does it have to be, and then we'll just add further delay because I guess if I were a court of appeals judge and I saw some obvious mistake, I would say, go file it tomorrow.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  You could, perhaps, treat it as we treated the $10,000 -- million in the --   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  And -- and say, yes, Congress did mean to pick up this definition, the jurisdictional part. But since no State explosives law will have that in the language, you can -- the government could, if it wanted, prove it at the -- prove that it was interstate-commerce related at the deportation hearing. That's what we did with the 10,000, isn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  The reason really is pretty similar here.  The -- the reason is there isn't a -- you know, there isn't a theft statute in the States which have a $10,000 thing in it, and so it didn't make really sense to think Congress wanted to exclude all those. And -- and -- and so here this is a big thing, explosives.  I mean, that's quite -- quite a major problem trying to have an explosive to blow up a building.  And I think if anything counts as an aggravated felony, it's that. But there is this jurisdictional problem. What do you think about that? I just --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The penultimate sentence of what?   Stephen G. Breyer  I just need to read it.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's 1101(43) --   Stephen G. Breyer  Thanks.   ",14-1096
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But I -- I thought -- I agreed with that when I came in.  And -- and then I thought, my goodness.  Of course.  It's an explosives crime.  My God.  Blowing up a building or a person, if anything's an aggravated felony, that must be. Then the first words out of his mouth, your friend's mouth, were, have no fear, read on, because there is a section that makes it an aggravated felony to commit a crime of violence.  And ""a crime of violence"" is very broadly defined.  So any human being who commits an explosives violation where that's a State law violation will fall within the definition of aggravated felony because they will have committed a crime of violence. So now, if that's right, I'm left with only half the problem I thought I was left with.  And the half I'm still left with is, if we follow your interpretation, what we will suddenly do is put into the category ""aggravated felony,"" which forbids the Attorney General to exercise her discretion and keep the person here even when she wants to, though the Mor case isn't a problem, because after all, she doesn't have to keep him here.  All right? We put in every tax fraud state, every racketeering, gambling.  I mean, you know the list.  And it includes an awful lot of trivial stuff.  So now I have removing the Attorney General's discretion when she wants to keep the thing here -- keep the person here in a whole lot of trivial stuff, if I accept your definition. And if I accept theirs, I don't have the problem I thought I had, which was that people who commit very serious explosive crimes are not in the category ""aggravated."" So what is the answer to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't think of it until I heard his first argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I have the list in front of me, thanks to my law clerk.  And I couldn't find anything on that list which either wouldn't fit within crime of violence or would be so terrible to leave out.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The basic point is I counted -- made an effort to count these.  I accept your argument there are about ten of these sections that -- you know, you -- you couldn't use that as a limitation.  But if I look at those ten individually, I will discover that I -- Congress did want to pick up State crimes there or they don't use exactly jurisdiction language like evade a tax imposed under this title.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it isn't really going to be the anomaly I thought it was.  That's your point.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It wouldn't be strange if those were things that covered offenses that it makes sense not to want to put in --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- to the definition.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I thought that some of them did, but --   Stephen G. Breyer  The tax one, for example, the fraud -- tax fraud, but he uses different language.   Stephen G. Breyer  But the only thing you've been able to think of, my guess is, that gets around his argument that arson and explosives will be covered by the crime of violence is that: What if a person sets fire to his own property? Now, when would a person set fire to his own property? When he wants to commit fraud.  And here we have a provision that puts fraud within it.  And moreover, it has the limitation of $10,000.  So therefore, serious fraud crimes will fall within this other section. So not even the case that you've really brought up is -- actually needs this provision if you prosecute State explosives crimes, because either they're against other people's property, in which case they fall within crime of violence, or they're against your own property, in which case they are a specie of fraud over $10,000.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what do you think about this? I mean, I -- I think I dread the suggestion, but when I got into that, I thought, God, there is no way to avoid just doing this section by section and saying, what did Congress want, section by section.  And then sometime -- you know, and then if we did that section by section, maybe it would be satisfactory to say, you know, let them prove the jurisdictional hook in the -- in the deportation proceeding. That gives the Attorney General considerably more discretion.  She can do it if she wants; she doesn't have to do it if she doesn't want to.   ",14-1096

They don't say that anywhere in the complaint, not even in paragraph 24, but you cite it, I read.  This is background.  They don't say anything about it, but is it necessary? Is it necessary for them to prevail that they prove a violation of Regulation SHO?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What do they --   Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't ask you that.

Let's go through this.  Let's suppose, for present purposes, that as I read through your complaint, I find words -- it's not the words we just said, but similar words somewhere, and I sink -- think, but there is nothing under New Jersey law unless New Jersey picks up SHO.  All right? Why isn't that good enough on that matter to get them into Federal court in arising under cases?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm doing it for argument because --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- I'm really concerned about I can't clarify in my mind the difference between somebody being thrown out in an arising under case, and yet getting back in under Section 27.  That's what doesn't make too much sense to me.  If this is necessary -- the Federal issue is necessary for the plaintiffs to win, there's arising under jurisdiction. Then I don't know what to do with the word ""exclusive."" But all that seems not to be in the case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So -- so then, if -- if it is not sufficient to get in under arising under, why in heaven's name should it be to get in under 27?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

And -- and don't tell me I'm right if you think it favors you, because maybe it does favor you, but I've got -- there will be other cases, you know, so sympathize a little with my problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm looking for a way to see if we really have to answer all these difficult questions that have been raised, which are pretty tough. And so I was thinking, look, here's what you look to. Judge, see if it is a necessary thing, and if so, whether it falls under 1331.  Okay? If it's an arising under claim under 1331, kick it out of State court and send it to Federal court. But if it isn't an arising under claim because it isn't necessary to winning for the plaintiff, forget about it.  Keep it in State court.  I don't care whether it's -- don't -- don't worry about whether the State passed it this way, or the State legislature referenced it by numbers or referenced it by -- don't worry about all that stuff.  Just decide one question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Does it meet the four criteria for arising under? If so, kick it out.  If not, keep it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's true.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  If you're going to elaborate on that, I would appreciate your -- in your elaboration, I've read that, and this statute is like the tax code more than it's like the Constitution. There are defined terms, and the words you just used concern a defined term. As I read the definition, there's a section, Definitions, and it says, quote, The term ""Exchange"" means, quote, an exchange established under 1311.  And 1311 says, An Exchange shall be a government agency, et cetera, that is established by a State.  Those are the definitions. So then you look to 1321.  And 1321 says, if a State does not set up that Exchange, then the Federal, quote, secretary shall establish and operate such Exchange. So it says, ""The Secretary is to establish and operate such Exchange,"" the only kind of Exchange to which the Act refers, which is an -- quote, ""an Exchange established by a State under 1311."" That's the definition. So the statute tells the Secretary, set up such Exchange, namely, a 1311 State Exchange.   Stephen G. Breyer  And there's nothing else in this statute.   Stephen G. Breyer  So that's throughout what they're talking about.  So what's the problem?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, it uses the same terminology that it's used in -- 15 times in this statute, namely, the terminology in the definition is ""an Exchange established by a State.""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's the phrase.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, it does.  But you say connote.  No, it's not a question of connotation; it is a question of denotation.  Now what does that mean? It means that the Federal government, the Secretary, is establishing a thing for the State.  And what is the thing? The thing that it is establishing for the State is defined as an Exchange established by the State.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, that person from Mars, who's literal, which I usually am not, but a literalist, I think would have to read it that way.  But if you -- if you're not a literalist, well, at least you could read it that way. Now you want to go into the context -- if you want to go into the context, at that point it seems to me your argument really is weaker.   Stephen G. Breyer  The Exchanges fall apart, nobody can buy anything on them.  You know the arguments.  You've read the briefs.  Nobody can -- there are no customers.  Employers don't have to pay penalties as long as they use just people from Virginia, but one Maryland person comes -- you know all those arguments. So how does the context support you?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Correct.   Stephen G. Breyer  I really want -- I really want to hear what you're going to say in your 5 to 10 minutes.  And if you want, only if you want, I would be interested in your responses to the government's brief, that if you read the words ""established by the State"" without reference to the technical definition as you wish, this isn't just about the taxes; it means employers in Virginia don't have to make policy, don't have to -- don't have to give policies, but if they have one Maryland worker they do; it means that they never can tighten up their Medicaid regulations, never, in 34 States -- but, of course, in the others they can; it means that there's no qualified person ever to buy anything on a -- an Exchange established by the Secretary for the State, and they have two or three other anomalies that have nothing to do with taxes, all of which supports their argument that you have to read this phrase technically according to the definition. Now, that's their basic point.  I've tried to summarize it.  Do it as you wish you.  I just want you to have 5 or 10 minutes to answer it.   ",14-114X

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, they are not totally bizarre.  It flows from the principle in Nevada that the State maintained the sovereign power to define the jurisdiction of its own courts, which is also an important sovereign power.  So if you look at that power, then you have to say, well, what is it in the Federal Constitution that limits or takes away that sovereign power? So that's, I think, where I'm left after Nevada.  And now you have a whole set of arguments, but they require us, for the most part, to overrule several cases.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I'd like to get your response to the second part of this.  Because your -- I mean, I -- I do -- that's -- I'm finding that rather hard, and it seems to me intuitively at some level correct that a State like Nevada should not be able to give less sovereign immunity to California than it gives its own officials. So I thought, well, where in heaven's name does that come from? And that's what's bothering me, and I'd like a theory.  I have -- all I have so far is this: Full faith and credit, two statutes, sometimes exist.  And there is also, when you're giving full faith and credit, the competing principle that, if you have a policy of your own State that cuts the other way and it's reasonable and so forth, you don't give full faith and credit. And here, if you're following that kind of principle, the same kind of principles in the Congress clause too, you would say, fine.  Nevada, since it doesn't give its own people the sovereign immunity, doesn't have to recognize California's because of the public policy it's following.  But as soon as they run out of sovereign immunity, which is at $50,000, I think, now they have no reason, and therefore they have to follow California's law. Now, I raise that because it's in the back of my mind.  I've been thinking about it.  And I don't find in the briefs either that theory or a competing theory about why you can't -- you -- you see where I'm going?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'd love your view on that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   ",14-1175
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  If -- if -- I don't want --   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I -- I -- I just want you at some point to give three minutes -- I mean, I will accept for argument's sake that the great issue in Philadelphia in 1787 was a division of power between the Federal government and the States, not questions of what States could do in respect to each other.  And they wrote what they wrote, but that's what they're thinking of.  And you're saying the second is what's at issue here.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And therefore -- therefore --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- we have two cases on it. We went through the whole thing.  At the very least, don't open it.  All right.  I'll accept -- or don't go back because it's at least not that clear.  And therefore, I'll accept that. Now, I would like just two minutes on what's bothering me.  And what is bothering me is I really don't see how Nevada can say, we're going to give immunity to our own State but we won't accept California's similar immunity. Now, that doesn't seem intuitively right, but if I look at the Constitution, I see it says this. It says: ""Full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public acts of other States."" California has a public act which gives immunity.  Nevada is not giving full faith and credit to that.  I think those acts can sometimes include statutes or common law rules or decisions of courts. So I say, how does Nevada get away with that? Answer: Because they have a strong public policy in not doing it; namely, the policy of they don't give anybody, including their own officials, that kind of immunity. If that's the answer, that answer runs out of steam at the very point that they try to give officials more immunity than California is giving. Now, you see how I've lined up that legal reasoning with what seems intuitive.  But I have no idea, to tell you the truth, about whether there is precedent for that; about what that might, in fact, get us into trouble on; or et cetera. So I would -- you must have thought through this.  If I look in the briefs, the answer to this question of equal treatment -- I can't find much.   Stephen G. Breyer  But the Full Faith and Credit Clause reinforced by it is the same policy there --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- that exists under the Commerce Clause too --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- and the Privileges and Immunities Clause.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Nevada's law is great. Nevada's law says if you're a Nevada worker -- State, you get -- you don't have to pay a dime.  In fact, you have to pay 50,000.   Stephen G. Breyer  But if you're California or some other State, you have to pay 40 million.   Stephen G. Breyer  I understand that.  And what trouble will I get into with precedents --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- in the Constitution or something else if I were to write the words that I suggested?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That once they go beyond their own immunities, they run out of steam and they have no reason for not following California's law.   Stephen G. Breyer  I know he doesn't think it's right, and I want to have the reason.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, but it marriages in all kinds of things.  I've seen the public policy language when -- when there is a -- a right for a State to ignore the public act of another State where there is some kind of -- it's a -- some kind of policy orientation.

This is water subject to the jurisdiction.  ""Within the boundaries of the National Park Service"" -- that's the tougher part -- ""including navigable waters."" That doesn't help us. So the question, I would think, would be is this portion of the river within the boundaries of the National Park Service? Am I right so far?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, now, you look at what they say about that, and you get, when they're defining the Yukon-Charley River's National Preserve, it says that that national preserve -- which is the whole thing, which includes the section of the river that we're talking about -- contains public lands.  It doesn't say it's identical with the public lands. And then in another place it says, ""Only those lands within the portion which are public lands shall be deemed to be included a portion of such unit,"" not that they make up the whole of such unit. At least we --   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm quoting from regulations which are 54 U.S.C. -- I don't know. I'll -- I'll have to show you later, because I'm quoting -- (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  We're going to get into numbers, and I -- I just thought this case is too complicated to ask anything, but you've tempted me. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  And so -- so you see -- have you got in your mind what I just quoted?   Stephen G. Breyer  And then once you have that, you have this regulation applying to this portion of the river. So now we look to the statute to see if anything there takes away what the regulations seem to give.  And the only part of the statute -- though it's an important part -- that supports you is the second sentence.  But as I read that second sentence, it says that, ""The regulations that apply solely to public lands within such units,"" you see, ""are the ones that don't apply to the private land up in Yukon-Charley. But I've just read you a regulation, which, on my reading of it, is the Hovercraft Regulation, and does not apply solely to public lands within National Park Service units, either in Alaska or anywhere else. And therefore, the statute doesn't stop it. Now, that's -- that's -- and I want to -- I don't know if I can do this orally; I just tried to, which is to put the argument against you as best I could, and I want to hear the reply.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why? I mean --   Stephen G. Breyer  As I read it -- as I read it, it's complicated, but in a sense it's simple. Yosemite has some private land within it and a lot of public.  You know, there's some houses in Yosemite owned by private people.  There are interior regs that apply to all of Yosemite, such as certain fireplace regs. There are some that only apply to the park but not the private people.  What this statute says is the latter. Doesn't deprive -- apply to that land that you gave to Alaska.  That's what the statute says. And what the reg says is that our hovercraft reg applies to everything within Yosemite, if this were Yosemite.  This navigable waters, whether the land around it is owned by James Jones, the private person, or whether it's owned -- whether it's part of Yosemite Park.  That's what it seemed to say to me. Now, there are two problems with what I just read.  One is the third sentence and the word ""unit."" And the second problem is the NPS, the National Park Service, is it really all of Yosemite, you know, with that private thing or is it just the public part? Now, that's at least a sorry.  I shouldn't have got into it.  It's too complicated.  Skip the question. (Laughter.)   ",14-1209
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Then -- then -- then I'm completely wrong.  Then what the right -- then -- then I was totally wrong.  I -- I thought that the argument was that -- just to go to my Yosemite analogy --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- that the hovercraft rule was like a rule that applies to all of Yosemite, say a campfire rule that applies even to John Jones's house.   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, it could be the navigable waters.  It wouldn't be John Jones's fireplace. But if that -- if that's your argument, I was wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought the navigable waters are not.  They're on John Jones's property.  But you still have the authority to regulate them, because the regulation that does it is not a regulation that applies solely to public lands.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that right? Because you just seemed to say the opposite a minute ago.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, navigable waters that are within the boundaries of the National Park Service.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's like John Jones's house in Yosemite.   Stephen G. Breyer  The fireplace reg applies to him, even though his is a private house, because it's within the boundary of Yosemite.   Stephen G. Breyer  Am I right or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Either way, you say you win.  Either they are Federal lands and this is part of a reg that applies to Federal lands; or they are not Federal lands, in which case this reg applies to both nonfederal and -- I mean nonpublic lands and public lands.  So it's not within the second sentence. Is that your argument?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's the whole --   Stephen G. Breyer  I read that first sentence. It's very interesting, because the tone of voice is the only way I can deal with this case.  Watch.  Imagine we have a valley that's a public land, and that valley traverses the boundary of the unit.  Some of it's inside and some of it's outside. Now, only those lands within the boundaries of any conservation system which are public -- within the boundaries of any conservation system which are public lands shall be deemed to be included as a portion of the unit. So the only part of that valley that it's a portion of the unit is that part of the valley that's within the boundary of the unit.  The part that's outside the boundary of the unit is not part of the unit.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that what it -- I thought it must mean something like that.  If it doesn't mean something like that, it means what Justice Scalia says.  And then they're -- Joe Jones' house, the Indian reservation, none of it is part of the unit.  But that can't be what it means, can it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you see what I -- are you following it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If it makes clear -- if it makes clear that private lands like Joe Jones' house are a part of the unit?   Stephen G. Breyer  Within the boundaries of it.  Ah, so distinction between being part of the unit and being within the boundaries of the unit.   Stephen G. Breyer  What --   Stephen G. Breyer  The regulation itself says, it says water -- ""Hovercraft regulation applies to, quote, 'waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States within the boundaries of the National Park Service.'""   Stephen G. Breyer  And then the National Park Service somewhere has a definition that equates it with the unit.  The National Park Service is defined identically to system units.  That's at 54 U.S.C. 100102 and 100501. So if we -- Justice Scalia's point is this seems to take the private land, the in-holdings, and say they're not part of the unit; only the public lands are part of the unit --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- and then the Hovercraft Regulation applies only to the unit.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that's -- that -- isn't that the point? Yes.  That's --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- the point.   Stephen G. Breyer  What's the response to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Ah.   Stephen G. Breyer  So you're saying it applies within -- it is within the boundaries of the unit, although the unit consists of just the public land.  Who drafted this? This is -- (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Are you satisfied with this holding -- imaginary -- but the Ninth Circuit's wrong. Two, the second sentence does not bar this regulation. Three, there are other possible arguments; we send it back for reconsideration as to whether those arguments are good or bad.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They -- they -- we're saying that the second sentence, which is what they're talking about primarily in the briefs, the second sentence of (c) --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- ""no lands which,"" et cetera, you're right about that.   Stephen G. Breyer  You're right about -- I mean I imagine --   Stephen G. Breyer  Then as to this first sentence, which I -- I don't think I focused on, particularly, we say go back and argue that.   INTERRUPTING ",14-1209
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Where is that? There's a piece of paper called ""the judgment"" somewhere.  What does it say?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's the end of it, isn't it? It was dismissed with prejudice.   ",14-1375
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You have abandoned it, was the question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes or no?   Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't care if it -- I mean, that's up to you, what you want to argue.  But I would like -- look, it says, can the dismissal, based on the failure to satisfy form the basis for an attorney's fees? I take that to mean, is the defendant -- can the defendant in such a case be a prevailing party?   Stephen G. Breyer  He has to meet the other standard, too.   Stephen G. Breyer  I would think the answer is obviously yes.  They won.  Okay? So if they won, why isn't that the end of it? It says judgment -- it says -- it says the -- the case is dismissed with prejudice.  Therefore, they won.  So why aren't they the prevailing party?   Stephen G. Breyer  Can't a plaintiff be a prevailing party? I don't know the answer, but I thought the plaintiff brings a suit charging, you know, serious discrimination.  After lots of litigation, the parties decide to settle, and they settle on terms very favorable to the plaintiff, really because of the litigation.  I thought in such cases, the plaintiff was the prevailing party.  A.m. I wrong?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, well, this is not interlocutory.  This ended the litigation.  So, I mean, I have the same question the Chief Justice had, where a defendant secures the end of a case, dismissed, goodbye, you win.  Now, maybe they can bring another case tomorrow; that's another case.  But they won this case. That's going to be pretty hard for them to get attorneys' fees anyway because there's a very tough standard.  But why isn't a simple rule the best rule? If the case is over, the defendant won, he is the prevailing party for purposes of that case. Then we could go on to take all the things you wanted to into account when we consider what kind of fee is reasonable and when we consider whether it's based on frivolousness.  I mean, the -- the plus of that, to me, is the simplicity.  And -- and I don't see how it would work any unfairness or serious harm to the objective of this statute.  So I'd appreciate it if you would address what could be my benighted view.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then they might -- I mean, unfortunately, I a.m. in the position of having to decide it. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  So I put the question to you.  And I'd say at first blush, the simplicity of this approach, its consistency with the language, its ease of administration, and so forth, in terms of prevailing parties has that to recommend it.  So now what is -- you don't like it, so tell me why.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, there -- because -- now, there's much to recommend what you're saying, saying at least if you come back the next day, at least if you could sue in another district.  But have you heard of the Hatfields and the McCoys? You see -- you see why I bring them up? Because they're going to be fighting each other for 30 years.  And if you tell them they can't sue in this district, they'll change the complaint slightly and go to a different district. So if I adopt the standard you're just suggesting, I will discover a whole host of questions: Is this really the same suit? What about the possibility that they could have sued in Tasmania? And what about the possibility -- you -- you see where I'm going.  And so I'm back, again, to that kind of concern, an administrative concern --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- versus the simplicity of saying, well, that ended this case.  If they bring another case and it's frivolous, we'll consider attorneys' fees in that one.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't say that.  I haven't read them yet.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then what is the argument? I take it your argument now is what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Buckhannon says that a plaintiff can't recover, even if he litigates to death and they find -- give up and pay him a billion dollars.  Unless there is a judicially sanctioned change in legal relationship, he can't recover fees.  And if he can't recover it, why should the defendant recover, unless there is a judicially sanctioned change in relationships and the only candidate for such a thing is a dismissal with prejudice of some form.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Got the argument. So if that's the argument, and that argument is correct, why don't we have the situation here? Because you heard the judgment being read.  It says ""with prejudice.""   Stephen G. Breyer  Just simply, No. 279, 10/1/2009, judgment in favor of CSRT against the EEOC?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Where is it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean -- but where do I find it?   Stephen G. Breyer  What does it say?   Stephen G. Breyer  The action is dismissed.   Stephen G. Breyer  Except -- it has three exceptions: Lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party.   Stephen G. Breyer  This was not failure to join a party.   Stephen G. Breyer  It is not improper venue.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't think it's lack of jurisdiction.  Is that what it is, lack of jurisdiction?   INTERRUPTING ",14-1375
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  His point really is that this is sort of like a trust but not very much.  And indeed, the key point, to me, is that the shareholders here have no beneficial interest in the property.   Stephen G. Breyer  And then you say in the section shareholders shall have no interest in the property of the trust.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know.  I didn't write -- I didn't write Section 6; your client did. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what it says, so how are we supposed to take that?   INTERRUPTING ",14-1382
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The problem, just from the point of view of the common sense of it, is you have an organization that has, A, the organization; B, the trustees; and C, the shareholders. So applying Carden, what you would say -- and Navarro: If you sue the trustees, you look to their citizenship.  But if you sue the trust itself, you don't look to the citizenship of the trust; you don't look to the citizenship of the trustees.  You go beyond that and look to the citizenship of the members. I mean, that seems odd.  Why do you look to the members or the shareholders, or the -- or the beneficiaries where you sue the trust itself but you don't in the identical situation where the law of the State allows you to sue the trustees? I mean, that seems such a sport, such a -- a fluke.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Look -- look at the other odd thing in writing this opinion your way.  You say, well, this isn't really like a trust.  I mean, it is sort of a trust, but there are important differences. They can sue and be sued.  The trust itself can hold the property, and the beneficiaries do not have an equitable interest.  And because they don't have an equitable interest, it's more like a private association or, et cetera, in Carden. But, of course, that means that we look to their interest.  We look to their property.  We're basically having them as part of the necessary parties because they have a property interest, the very people we just said that this is a different kind of organization because they lack an equitable interest in the property.   ",14-1382
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Their point is, the government says, fine, make that argument.  Make it under the rubric City of Sherrill.  Maybe you make it when you go down on remand or something, but it is workable to divide the issue into two parts. The first issue is what's the reservation, and the second issue is what can you do on the reservation? When you get to question two, if the Tribe has made no assertion of jurisdiction, nobody even knows about it for 150 years.  Maybe it's basically unfair to let them do what they want to do.  And that depends on a lot of factors, such as what Congress says. So what do you think of that argument? Let's leave it for later.  Nobody's argued it.   ",14-1406
1,NO QUESTIONS,14-1406
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Are you finished?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  I have -- You must have thought about this question, I suspect.  I'll assume, I want to assume for purposes of the question, that this isn't just a matter of signing a form with an objection.  Your -- your clients are involved in the health care plan in major ways.  They probably figure -- sign papers every five months or every day, and they choose insurers.  They do all kinds of things.  And it's the topping, the icing on the cake, that pushes it over the edge, which is that you have to fill out the form saying, I object, this is my insurer, you then can contact my employees, da, da, da, da, da.  It's a whole bunch of things. All right.  So the question is, putting that all together now, are they protected by RFRA? I think the reason that the Court went from Sherbert and Verner over to Smith was they couldn't figure out how to apply Sherbert and Verner.  And it's Sherbert and Verner that RFRA picks up.  And this is at least one difficulty with it, which is where I'm going.  And I've even read St. Benedict.  You know, not -- not for religious purposes, I'm trying to find out something about being a member of society. Sometimes when a religious person who's not a hermit or a monk is a member of society, he does have to accept all kinds of things that are just terrible for him.  Think of the Quakers, the Quakers who object to Vietnam.  Think of the people who object to laws protecting blasphemy.  Think of the people who object to shoveling the snow in front of the walk that will lead to the abortion clinic.  Think of the Christian Scientists who know when they report the accident, the child will go to the hospital or the adult and receive medical care that is against their religion. So there are loads of things.  I've just given you four.  Think of the taxes.  Well, there's no question that doesn't violate the religious clause.  But plenty of other things do.  So what's the line? Why do the Quakers have to pay the taxes for Vietnam, but you don't find the religious Jew or Muslim getting an extra day off during the week when the law says nobody can work on Sunday because their sabbath is on Saturday? What is the line? And I've been reading and reading to try to find a fairly clear simple statement of what that line is and how it works.  And to repeat the difficulty of Sherbert and Verner, which is what RFRA does, quite honestly, doesn't help me.  But you might.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then -- then tell me how to work it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, the Quaker, the Quaker. You think that wasn't a substantial burden?   Stephen G. Breyer  I see your point is that -- let's imagine a widespread government program filled with exemptions.  There are a smaller group of people who need an exemption for religious reasons.  We look at those other exemptions.  Some seem to have good reasons; some seem to have terrible reasons.  We -- really, under the RFRA or the First Amendment should exempt the religious too, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  I've just described to you the United States Tax Code where we know that you do not have to have an exemption for those who are religiously objecting, for example, to paying taxes because it would support a war.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So what -- that's what I'm looking for.  Same question.  And I'm not asking it to refute you; I'm asking it because I'm looking for what the distinction actually is.  And for the reason I just said, I don't think the distinction can be, well, you've exempted some people, so you have to exempt the religious people too.  But that would run throughout the government of the United States. So what -- we know there is a distinction, or at least you -- I believe you when you tell me there's a -- I want to know what you think it is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, they're not.  All right, well, go ahead.  You want to say that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I got where you're going with your exemptions, but that's not the thrust of my question.  The thrust is I haven't found it yet.  I want to find what the real distinction is, whether you call it RFRA or call it Smith, I don't care what you call it. I'm trying to find the basis for the distinction between those things that we do require people to do despite their religious objection and those things that we don't. And if you want to think there's no such difference, just read -- as you've read, Neuborne's brief.  Lists them all in two pages.  Some go one way; some go the other way.  He says it's because of other people being involved.  That might be the answer, but what's your answer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What -- what is the right line?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Give me a hint what the direction is. (Laughter.)   ",14-1418
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So that's why -- you see, that's exactly what I have found difficult, exact.  And I -- I read the briefs.  Neuborne said that.  Your brief said that.  We'll look to see -- it's not the kind of burden that counts for purposes of RFRA or the -- or the First Amendment.  Where the burden is of a certain kind. Now what kind? And would you say, well, a kind where it arises out of the fact that we have a program that affects third parties in a big way? Okay? Well, we have the Vietnamese church of the escapees in Los Angeles who are so poor they have to meet in the basement of a house, and the parking regulations stop their congregation from coming even if they want to meet only on Sunday.  Think about that one.  We can put that easily into the context of third parties being hurt.  So they can't practice their religion.  So -- so that one. I can think of a lot of counter examples. But maybe you couple that with what we have in the tax cases.  Administrate.  Widespread administrative rules the government has -- has leeway where third parties, widespread, administrative.  You see? So I'm -- I'm trying to get the thinking of the people who have thought about this, which are you and -- and the others here on what's the best way to treat that burden.  It's not hard to find in religious writing.  And the people when they go into society assume some burdens that they are going to find totally obnoxious.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then what do I do?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is this right? Is it that the reason I get that you don't want to have the women to have to ask for the coverage is because vast numbers of women will, quite a few who have religious objections won't, and then there will be that middle set of people who are inertia bound.  And since they are inertia bound, we can't say so what, because poor people who don't object religiously, if they get the contraceptives, that lowers the cost of health coverage later on. So the government has an interest in that. And therefore, there is an interest of some kind in not allowing a system -- in not having a system where the inertia bound have to take initiative. Have I got that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Do I have the other part right, which is this is not hijacking because there is a Federal regulation that says the infrastructure of the insurers' contraceptive-related plan belongs to the insurer, not to the person who buys the insurance? Am I correct about that?   ",14-1418
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I bet he would if he could.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What can you tell me, then, to help me which might not help others? But I don't think these categories are absolute.  I think they help, but they're not absolute.  So I would ask the question first, this isn't government speech in common English. It is the speech of the person who wants to put the message on the plate.  The plate's owned by the State. The State says we don't want certain messages to be displayed.  And my question is why? Why not? What is the interest that the State is furthering in keeping certain messages off the plate?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm sorry.  If the State -- then you have the Republican example, Democrats.  I mean, not every interest is a justifiable interest.  Some are not, and some are.  That's why I asked my question. They keep some off, and they let some on. What is their interest? Why -- which are the ones? I'm asking a factual question.  Why have they kept off the ones they kept off while letting on the ones they left on?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If they have no interest at all in making such a distinction, then I think since speech is hurt at least a little, they ought to lose. But if they have a justifiable interest, since you can put the bumper sticker next door, I think they win.  And therefore, I'd like to know what their interest is.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, yes -- I --   Stephen G. Breyer  I assume that Texas likes each one of these interests that they allow to be put on the -- on -- on the license plate.  They like Texas hamburger joints, and they probably would not approve a -- a Chicago hamburger joint being on the Texas license plate.  They -- they -- they like some of these messages; others they don't particularly like.  Isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'd like to get my answer. I was asking you what is the interest in Texas, and why does it keep off the messages it keeps off?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Not just this example. There are a set of things they've kept off.  Why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So go through this. Look, I can think of many reasons I could make up. Maybe they want to keep controversial political messages off.  I'd say they have an interest in that in suggesting to people Texas doesn't sponsor this -- I just want to know what -- what they really are.  And now you've said one -- what was the one you just said?   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  Then I think they lose.  The reason I think they lose is because I don't see a State could come in and say we keep off a private message, and we'll tell you the reason later. We'll -- we can do it for any reason we want.  There you're hurting speech, and I don't see Texas's interest in saying we can keep it off for any reason we want because that would be the Republican-Democrat, too.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what's the -- I'm -- same question, but I just think you have to have some kind of legitimate reason for keeping off the -- and it doesn't have to be much.  It could be just a little.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then why don't you tell us what they are?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, it doesn't.  I just want to know what they are.   INTERRUPTING ",14-144X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, that's in that context.  So you -- but I'm trying -- you say they can or they cannot have a standard which says we're trying to keep offensive speech off the license plate?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You say yes or no?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  They can do that?   Stephen G. Breyer  They can or cannot?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So now I see what you're saying.  But if I were to go back to sort of the basic underlying thought here, is speech hurt?   Stephen G. Breyer  The answer is, yes, it is. The private speech is somewhat hurt.  A lot? Well, put up a bumper sticker.  You can't say a lot.  How is it hurt? You don't get the official imprimatur.  Hmm, okay. Now, is there something to be said for Texas? Yes.  What they're trying to do is to prevent their official imprimatur from being given to speech that offends people.  People don't like it? Put up a bumper sticker. All right.  Now we have two interests in opposite directions in many, many cases.  We try to weigh those things if the other things don't tell us the answer.  And I would guess -- I don't really see the big problem -- that people who are putting up speech even that Texas considers offensive, in part, for reasons that Justice Scalia says, well, put up a bumper sticker. What's the problem?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I asked my question before, if you remember it, really, because I wanted an answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  It wasn't a statement.  It was -- it was -- I'm trying to get rid of all the conceptual basis here.  You just go back -- forget the public forum, et cetera, forget all that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Just go back to look to see is speech being hurt, and the answer is of course yes, but not much, because they can put a bumper sticker. Then you look at the other side of it, and you say, does the State have a legitimate interest here? And the State says yes, our interest is that there are messages we like, messages we don't care about, and messages we don't like.  And do we have a system for keeping the last off because it is the government speaking, which represents the citizens, and the citizens do -- its their government, and they don't want, just as in the examples Justice Scalia gave, to have their government associated with messages that this commission doesn't want.  And maybe there are limits on that, but that's the basic idea.  Okay.  Now, weigh those two things.  I think you'd say, little harm to speech, we see the other broad, da, da, da, et cetera.  Now, what's your response?   Stephen G. Breyer  Forum.  See, it's the conceptual part, and I can't tell whether a forum -- a license plate's a forum or not a forum, or if it's a three-part test or -- I can't get that.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm trying to go back to the basics of it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if you --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  When -- in Wooley, go back to that for a second.  I take it that if I object to the message on the New Hampshire plate, Live Free of Die, I have a right to be disassociated with that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Well, if the State, which represents many people in Texas, doesn't want to be associated with the particular message, why doesn't it have the right to say we don't want that event, we don't want that association.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, the State represents X million people.  They don't want to be associated with this message through their official organ.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The presumption -- but there are many ways of analyzing this case, so let me try to get you to focus on one that doesn't have to do with consent or any of these differences that you -- many of them that you've been discussing. One way to analyze it is you just ask: Is it -- there is no such thing as an exception to the Fourth Amendment.  The question is whether the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant in these circumstances, and it seems to me if it does, then you win.  And if it doesn't, then the State has considerable freedom.  It couldn't boil people in oil, but it might be able to do this.  All right.  So that's how -- what I'm thinking. Now, the question is --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I don't find this very much in the briefs, and it surprises me.  That's what I want you to address.  Why -- why isn't there a big difference between a blood test and a Breathalyzer? I mean, look, I look at a Breathalyzer; it's a little box the size of a cell phone.  It has a little straw on the end, and you breathe into it.  And what you breathe into it is carbon dioxide, which is going to go into the environment anyway; you're not going to keep it.  And moreover, it takes place quickly, so the evidence hasn't disappeared.  A blood test, you have to go somewhere else.  There is risk involved.  Time elapses, so you lose some of the evidence.  And it's painful in some instances. So, I immediately think, isn't there a difference? So encapsulated in what I'm saying is what is wrong with a Breathalyzer test when it can save lots of lives and is given to those people where there is probable cause, I take it, or at least reasonable suspicion to think they're drunk.  It'll clear the innocent; it'll inculpate the guilty, very little interference.  But a blood test, I mean, that might be a different thing. Okay.  I'd appreciate what your response is to that line of thought.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't say ordinary way. I said you blow hard into a little straw-like thing that's connected with what looks like a cell phone.  So using the word ""significant"" or not doesn't help me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, it is what it is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that -- that -- the question is why it is so intrusive that the Constitution insists on a warrant where that insistence could undermine in many cases the evidence that you are looking for? Now, that's -- that's a question of several factors.  And it doesn't -- just doesn't help me to say significant or not significant.  That seems to me the question, not the answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What does that have to do with it? I mean, after all, if in fact the person's eyes turn bloodshot when every time he drank four bottles of whiskey, you could look at his eyes, and that wouldn't be intrusive at all.  I mean, what you're looking for doesn't have much to do with the intrusion. It's the way you're looking for it that's the problem. That's the problem.  It's not that you happen to want to know it for a particular reason.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The right.  So what is the percent of tests of Breathalyzers that is given at -- by the car? And under what -- and what percent of Breathalyzers is given after the person has been arrested and moved to jail or the equivalent?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm saying what percent is which? Okay? I'm asking because I'm curious and think that might be relevant.  You may not know.  So if you don't know, say you don't know.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's an intrusion when you pat down someone having probable cause to believe he's committing a crime, and you pat him down, which is the worst intrusion, I would guess.  Pat-down is a much more intrusive form of search than saying would you blow into a straw.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But we allow it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why? That's -- that's really my unknown question: Why.  Why? That's why I started with that, because I really don't know the answer.   INTERRUPTING ",14-1468

Breyer  If --   Stephen G. Breyer  We're making law.  I don't want -- none of us want an answer in terms of law.  We want to know a practical fact.  The practical fact is, is it possible that you could get a warrant in 30 seconds? You have a button on the cell phone.  It has a big ""W."" (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  The policeman presses it. A voice comes on, and it says, what's the problem? You explain it in 15 seconds, and they say, ah, I got it. Okay.  You got your warrant.  Or there's something unusual, and he says no.  Okay? Now, if that were in front of us, it wouldn't take me too long to decide this case because I'd say why don't you use it? You might answer that's ridiculous.  It isn't 30 seconds; it can't be.  It isn't five minutes.  It isn't 15, even, in most parts, and it can't be without added expense.  Or you could say it doesn't make any difference and explain it.  I think you'd have a hard time with that one, but I want to know what your answer is on the facts.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why does it make enough of a difference?   Stephen G. Breyer  What -- why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because I see -- I see the -- the breath part is the part that sort of now gets me.  If you're taking them to the police station anyway to do the breath test, and it just requires a phone call to get the warrant, what's the problem?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Phone on the way.  Phone on the way.  You say --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  You can make it a crime not to.  That will force them.  Okay.  So --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I knew -- that was somehow missing in this argument.  I think what people are trying to figure out, at least me, is if -- first, forget the blood test.  The blood test is a separate matter, in my mind.  I'm thinking solely about the breath test.  Do you -- does the Constitution require you to get a warrant before you administer the blood -- the breath test, other things being equal?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The Constitution leans in that direction.  And so I ask you, why not? And now you've told me all the things that cut against you.  You say, well, before we give the breath test we take them to the station, and so then that seems to take 15 minutes, and -- and in the meantime why can't you just call the magistrate, and at least we have some kind of safeguard against total arbitrary behavior.  That's where you are.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there -- and so why is that bad for the State?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you -- I don't -- I don't know how to explain it more clearly than that. I'm not talking law.  I'm talking practical facts.  If you're prepared to come back and say to me, you know, if we have to get a warrant, 50 percent of the drunk drivers are never going to be caught, ah, I'll listen to that. If you come back to me and say, you know, if you say that a warrant is required, it will mean that 400 policemen have to spend ten seconds more than they'd otherwise spend on a telephone, I say well, that's a point, but not that much of a point. Now, do you see? I'm trying to get a fact.   Stephen G. Breyer  How long it takes -- how long does it take --   Stephen G. Breyer  No number.  A person is drunk.  He is 10 percent above the legal limit, whatever that is.  How long does it take to dissipate, do you know?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Normally, the defendant is the State in a voting rights case.  They are the ones that have the plan until someone attacks the plan. These were Intervenors because they were affected.  The Court said you could intervene.  Now the State's gone. I'm looking for some kind of -- of rule or some kind of workable standard such that a new plan that the Court puts in would allow some people in other districts to remain to defend it, but not everybody.  Or do you think everybody? I mean, after all, a plan in a smaller State that affects one district and makes changes likely affects people in every district, at least some of them.  Some people will find it easier to get elected, some harder.  I haven't found a case that supports you, but you'll tell me which one.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Good.   Stephen G. Breyer  Meese --   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm --   Stephen G. Breyer  And the distinction between, let's say, the best one is the split district, you know, the one you were just talking about, Representative --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- Forbes, right. If he has standing, who doesn't?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But, I mean, in the voting context, the standard for saying that a person in another district is hurt enough to be able to maintain a standing here, and these people aren't, which ones are and which ones aren't?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Harmed his chances for re-election.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Here -- here is the basic problem.  I -- I can't get the right analysis.  Look, normally a plaintiff is suing because somebody did something to him.  So the defendant is the person who did it.  And normally we're looking for the standing of a plaintiff, and there are all kinds of rules there. The person who did this to the plaintiff is the State.  They're not in it anymore.  So what -- of course the -- the difficulty comes from the fact that the congressmen aren't the people who did it.  I mean, these particular people aren't the ones who did it, but they're still in the case. It's rather like Smith sues Jones for a nuisance.  There's an order entered.  It is an injunction.  Jones's neighbor Brown says, this injunction is hurting me.  Now, does Brown have standing? And -- and at that point we're into a new kind of a case, and I'm sure there's law on it.  And -- and I just haven't got the right things yet.  And -- and these cases -- they have the -- they'll have the language, you say.  I'm just not certain of the way to analyze it.   Stephen G.

Political propaganda.  Okay.  So it's a harm to reputation.  I see that.  All right. If, in fact, this is a sufficient injury, the injury that now, the plan will make it harder for me to be elected, that should give rise to a claim by virtually every member of the State legislature.  And indeed, if it gives rise to their claim in their hands, why not in the voters' hands?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You have, in a State like Virginia, several million people who could attack any redistricting plan and any variation on any redistricting plan.  That's quite a lot to read into Meese.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Special because it's more severe in degree?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There is no case that -- the closest you can come is the case of a lobbyist who is complaining about his reputation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He was a State Senator. That's fine.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there anything better?   Stephen G. Breyer  I did.  I --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's the area District 5, District 5 in the State which is heavily African-American and so imagined racist legislatures changed the whole district so they couldn't possibly elect an African-American.  Does the African-American member of Congress have standing to contest that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And as a congressman, not.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I know it's different, but what I'm looking for throughout is the -- I understand that there has been no case which discusses this -- that I've been able to find.  They have the Meese case, which is in a different context, but why is that different? And what's bothering me about it, which -- I don't want you to just say I'm right; I want you to explain why, if I am, or why I'm wrong -- is that there are potentially dozens of remedial plans and there are hundreds of possible plans for a State, and every plan will hurt someone.  And if one district in a State is changed, suddenly you open the door to every legislature and every Congressman from every other district challenging the plan. That strikes me as a big shift in the direction of taking power from the legislature and turning it over to the judges as to what kind of districting plan you're going to have, and a mess to boot.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what's worrying me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I knew you thought I would be, given your comments. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING ",14-1504
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, no.  It actually said -- so I've been looking at this because it puzzles me what standard we're supposed to use.  He does say there's no evidence that the two eyewitnesses knew each other, had any reason to conspire and fabricate their testimony.  Next sentence: ""Therefore, in light of these identifications, the trial court's speculation"" -- this is page 128 -- ""the trial court's speculation as to defendant's motive for assaulting Nelson will be construed as harmless error."" Error.  And the judge who's dissenting doesn't deny that it's error.  He says it's error.  He just doesn't think it's harmless.  So now we have a case where it looks like the only words I can find on this in Illinois concede that it's error.  Or they say it's error.  Indeed, they say it's harmless error. Therefore, the issue is harmlessness.  What am I supposed to do? What standard do I apply out of 2254 if in fact they think it's error? Or even if they didn't decide it and we -- it's debatable, obviously -- we think it's error; we don't have to give them any deference, I guess.  How does it work?   ",14-1516
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But that's not what the State says.  The State says you read the relevant three sentences: The issue was you have a 17-year-old youth on a bike who is a drug dealer; who Larry Owens knew he was a drug dealer.  Larry Owens wanted to knock him off. I think the State's evidence has proved that fact.  You see? So two members of the Illinois Supreme Court say the words ""that fact"" refer to the sentence, Larry Owens wanted to knock him off.  And the sentence preceding that is the judge's speculation as to why. One judge in the Supreme Court says what you said, that when you read that together, it means ""that fact"" referred to the motive. Now, there we are.  And the question is what are we supposed to do? Is there enough here to say that they are clearly wrong, those two members?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, there we are, the Seventh Circuit thought, yeah.  There is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They're clearly wrong.  The -- it doesn't refer to the preceding sentence.  It refers to the preceding two sentences.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Have -- have I got the issue?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That seems to be the way that your -- your --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- opponents are looking and it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but you're assuming what their argument is.  But the question is what is the real issue.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We can get something further. Were you the trial judge -- trial lawyer?   Stephen G. Breyer  But you've read the record pretty well?   Stephen G. Breyer  So now, I think all of the witnesses skirted the real issue.  Okay? What did they skirt?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They skirt what they didn't talk about.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what was the rest of the trial about?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What was the issue in the trial?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And what is it about?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I understand that. But I mean -- what -- what he says is the witnesses skirted the real issue. If you will tell me that all they talked about was: We identify him -- no, your identification is no good; yes, our identification is good; no, it isn't; yes, it is -- if that's what it was about, then that couldn't be the real issue, so they're -- that they skirted, because they didn't skirt it.   Stephen G. Breyer  So something else has to be; therefore, motive.  But is that what happened?   Stephen G. Breyer  What happened?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  You don't understand my question, because it was favorable to you. My question was -- my question was what did those witnesses talk about.  He says they skirted the real issue.  I want to know what they talked about --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- the rest of the trial.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what you say, but what I want to put -- there's -- I'm trying to get the other side, so you have to answer that squarely.  And -- and maybe I'll put it this way: There's -- well, the judge has been sitting there through this fairly short trial.  He is annoyed at all these witnesses.  They've been pussy-footing what's going on.  They saw the murder.  No problem about that. But they're not explaining it because they're frightened of saying what it's involved in. And he's fed up, so he's going to say, I'm going to say what's really happening here.  What's really happening here is this is a drug deal that failed.  Or something like that. So that's the explanation of what he said. If you could bring him back and say, judge, did you mean motive played a role here? He'd say, of course not.  Of course not.  It didn't play a role in my decision.  All that played a role in my decision was what the witnesses said, which was, he's the guy.  I was just saying what's going on. Now, what's -- I think they're saying something like that.   INTERRUPTING ",14-1516

Or what you said, tantamount to all.

Zachary D. Tripp  I -- I think --   Stephen G. Breyer  All these lawyers that will be there telling them, don't get close to that, and the thing will work over time.  If we set a detailed test down, then all those lawyers will be trying to figure out how, in fact, they actually do the thing without quite infringing the detail test.   Zachary D. Tripp  Yeah, I -- I -- I think that --   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what worries me.   Zachary D. Tripp  I -- I think if you said that one was never enough and it needs to be a whole lot, we would be quite happy.  All that we're --   Stephen G. Breyer  End of the case.

Because I -- it's very hard for me to believe that Senator Mathias really wanted to interpret American patent law so that it runs the world when we've entered into a treaty which says British patent law runs Britain, French France, and so forth.  I mean, is there something in this history which says no, no, Senator Mathias had a different view; he -- he wanted whenever you send any component abroad that's in a patent, suddenly American law governs it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is it against the law? Which I don't know.  Is it against the law for a patentholder on patent X, which has 19 ingredients, to send one commonplace ingredient over to England and say, you know, I -- I don't mind.  Here -- here is what my patent's on here, but there is no British patent.  And I would love you to make this and sell it in Britain.  Is that against American law?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What -- what he does is just as I said.  You know, I have a great invention in America.  It's patented.   Stephen G. Breyer  In England, it's not patented.  And what I really -- I see no reason why you cannot make my thing over there and sell it over there. And here, by the way -- it's not mine, you know.  It's Mr. Smith's, my competitor's.  And -- and here, by the way, is the patent.  You see what it is, and go ahead. Sell it in England.  It's not patented there.  Can you not do that? Is that illegal?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If we leave the component out of it.  There are no components.  What he does is he sends him a list.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that illegal?   Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So then the question becomes one of what limits Congress wanted to put in an area where it isn't illegal.  Now, go ahead with your argument, because what they're saying --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's U.S. conduct, but you read the brief of the German companies, and they said it's a fairly common thing.

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So they are worried about it, in other words.   INTERRUPTING ",14-1538
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What we have here is a question that we agreed to review.  The question is whether the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in this case in holding it has no jurisdiction to review Petitioner's request that the board equitably tolled the 90-day deadline on his motion to reopen as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel.  We granted review on that. As far as what the Fifth Circuit said, among other things it says, it lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA's denial of Mata's untimely motion to reopen, and so it need not address the merits.  Now, it said other things, too, which tend to support you as going on this other ground, but it did say that.  And you read, at least somewhat possibly, you could say he did ask the board to equitably toll his motion.  And the board said, no, we won't equitably do that because it's not going to make any difference, basically.  You weren't really prejudiced. Okay.  Given all that, why should we decide a different question? Why don't we decide the question that we said we would decide? And if we're going to decide the question we said we'd decide, I would think the answer is pretty clear.  They did have jurisdiction to review it.  They can review it and say the board was right because they have a lot of discretion here, et cetera, or for whatever reason, because there is no equitable tolling, whatever they want to say.  I wouldn't guess that. But I've never heard of any precedent that would -- I can't think of one that would suggest that when an agency does something like this, requests equitably to toll, denied, appeal, that a court of appeals wouldn't consider whether they're right or wrong.  I mean, what -- what -- if we get to that question, is there any case? No, because I thought normally, courts of appeals do review that kind of question.  You may have a weak argument, but then they'll review it.  They'll say no.   William R. Peterson  Justice Breyer, as we understand what the Fifth Circuit did here, the Fifth Circuit has already established in its jurisprudence that equitable tolling is unavailable for statutory motions. I know Petitioner now takes a different view.  I point you to Petitioner's arguments before the court of appeals in his reply brief on page 8 where he asked the court of appeals to reexamine its holding in Ramos-Bonilla that motions to reopen are not subject to equitable tolling.  So at least before the court of appeals, Petitioner saw the Fifth Circuit's jurisprudence the same way that we did. Now, because, in the Fifth Circuit, equitable tolling of the 90-day deadline is unavailable, the Board of Immigration Appeals could have granted relief only by exercising its sua sponte authority to reopen.  That is the only basis on which the Board of Immigration Appeals could have reopened in this case. Therefore, the Board of Immigration Appeals' decision whether or not to reopen is a decision that is committed to agency discretion by law.   Stephen G. Breyer  But the problem that I actually have, I guess, at your reaction, is if we don't follow what I think is the fairly simple thing of the question presented, you announce two things that I think there's a huge argument about. One is whether there is court review of the sua sponte thing because, as you probably know, there has been a long argument for 40 years about the meaning of that first part of the APA in Davis; or somebody says, well, when they say there's no court review when you commit a matter of discretion to the agency by law, of course there isn't.  They're acting lawfully.  But you can still get review of whether they acted as an abuse of that discretion.  Of course.  And I think you can. But I understand there are different points on that.  Do we really want to open up that big question? And as far as the other question you want us to open up about whether this is statutorily forbidden -- you say whether -- whether equitable tolling is forbidden here, again there are two views. Lots of the circuits think, no, it isn't, and moreover the SG thinks that, moreover they're having a rulemaking on that in a year or so that could encompass that, but it's secret.  But nonetheless -- nonetheless it might. And -- and so we're getting into what's actually I think a tough question.  And maybe it's cowardly.  But I'm thinking why go into those two tough questions, when in fact we asked for the answer to a simple question.  There are -- you have written a very good brief and I understand what you're doing and -- but I still am sort of stuck on this, which I'll put to you.   William R. Peterson  Well, thank you, Justice Breyer.  I know it's the end of the term and I'm asking you to complicate the case --   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   William R. Peterson  But let me point out though that the Solicitor General might agree that equitable tolling is available, but agrees with us that every court of appeals other than the Fifth Circuit to have addressed the availability of equitable tolling has gotten its analysis wrong.  The Solicitor General agrees with us that the presumption of equitable tolling is inapplicable to these sorts of statutes. Every court of appeals to have reached this, as Petitioner does, reaches the result that equitable tolling is available through the presumption of equitable tolling.  And now the Solicitor General suggests that the administrative rulemaking might provide a solution to this.  Well, in at least two circuits, and likely more, that's been foreclosed.  If you look at the Second Circuit's decision in Iavorski, the Ninth Circuit's decision in Soca-Gonzalez, both of them note that Board of Immigrations Appeals' position is that equitable tolling is unavailable.  Both of them conclude that the statute unambiguously requires equitable tolling and reject deference to the agency. So to the extent that you have administrative rulemaking here, as best I can understand, the Fifth Circuit is the only circuit that would actually be able to even potentially give effect to it.  And --   ",14-185X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I somehow have the impression, I don't know, the AG is going to have some kind of rulemaking relevant to this.   Stephen G. Breyer  Rulemaking has to do with the existence or nonexistence of equitable tolling under this provision?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   ",14-185X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  How -- how -- suppose -- let's think of the first Teague exception.  Suppose -- substantive matters.  Suppose that many states had sedition laws, make certain conduct unlawful so there are a thousand people in prison.  This Court in a new rule holds you cannot criminalize that behavior.  All right.  What is the law that would make that retroactive to people in prison? It sounds to me that it isn't like some kind of statutory discretion.  Rather, there are human beings who are in prison, who are there without having violated any valid law, because it was always protected by the First Amendment. And if that's right, then it's the Constitution, the due process clause, that says they are being held -- even though they committed the crime 22 years ago, they are now being held in confinement without due process of law because you cannot criminalize their behavior.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you see where I'm going?   Stephen G. Breyer  That being so, it's a Federal Constitution rule, the exceptions of Teague, Teague drops out of the case.  The only question is whether to satisfy the two exceptions.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I've made it a new rule. For purposes of my hypothetical, I'm making it a new rule.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Danforth was the case saying that the states could be more generous.  It wasn't a case -- this is a case that's the opposite of being generous: Can they be more stingy.  And I cannot find anything in -- in Harlan -- maybe I'll read it again, but I can't find anything there, nor can I find anything in Danforth that answers the question. So I thought, it is a new question, hence, that question I posed to you because I wanted to get your response.  I don't think you can answer it by means of precedent.  I think you have to try to figure it out without the help of precedent.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's true.  But then we have Teague, and Teague is saying we don't like Linkletter -- and -- and --   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But you're saying that we have -- then maybe that's wrong.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, why doesn't it violate the Constitution to hold a person in prison for 20 years, for conduct which the Constitution forbids making criminal.   Stephen G. Breyer  That would be the reason.   Stephen G. Breyer  That would be the reason.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there anything else you can say? Because I can say, witch is being a witch. There were some people in Salem who were imprisoned for being a witch.  And low and behold in 1820, it was held by this Court that that violated the Constitution. Now, you see, I just make a more outrageous example of the same thing.  And -- and what I want you to say, okay, I got your point.  It didn't violate the constitution at the time.  I've also got the point you have some authority. Anything else?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How does it work? It -- it should be pretty elementary, but -- I mean, I looked at the Indian case, and that seems a little far out. The -- the -- the -- though it definitely gives you support on your statement here, suppose you took Justice Scalia's example: We have Iowa State Rule 56.  We interpret Iowa State Rule 56 the same way as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  That's our rule.  And now this is what it means in that case.  And they say, ""But we're doing it under Iowa State rule."" Now, you say we can review that because they said that Iowa State rule is the same as the Federal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I just -- how do you fit that in the words in 1257?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, they say in a particular case, it's guidance.  It's great guidance. We agree.  Our interpretation is the Federal interpretation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, can we review that because, in fact, it wasn't the Federal interpretation? But can we review it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes or no?   Stephen G. Breyer  So you say the Court does not, in the example of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that Justice Scalia gave?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  It's a thought.   ",14-280X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  We clearly have jurisdiction, don't we? I'm trying to figure this out. In my mind we have jurisdiction where there is a person -- that's the defendant -- and the defendant says the Court's decision -- that's your court's decision -- is contrary to the Constitution or statute of the United States.  That's just what they say.   Stephen G. Breyer  So we have jurisdiction to answer the question. Now, the question is how do we dispose of the case in which we have jurisdiction? And we have three instances, I guess, in which the Court has done in disposing of such a case what the Solicitor General says.  Namely, they have said, we are -- we are not going to say whether he's right in saying it's contrary to the Constitution.  That's because there might be an adequate State ground; there might not be.  Their adequate State ground was one that was -- was elucidated or explained as being flowing from a certain interpretation of Federal law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We will say their interpretation of Federal law was wrong, and now we'll send it back to see what they do.  Is that right? Have I got it right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But the Teague standard -- the Teague exceptions could well be constitutionally required.  The Teague exception --   Stephen G. Breyer  You were going to say -- at some point you started: Suppose you look at the watershed procedural change.  My -- my impression from the case you cited, Summerlin, is that deciding whether that's retroactive has to you parts. I think we were unanimous on this point. The two parts were: Is it implicit in the concept of ordered liberty? And here it would seem to be because it's applicable to the States.  And the second is, is it central to an accurate determination that life without parole is a legally appropriate punishment? And the -- the -- the rule that mandatory can't exist is central to making that -- that was the whole point of the Miller opinion. So if that's the correct analysis for watershed rule, procedural rule that's retroactive -- if I'm accurate about that, why doesn't it fit within that category?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But that's the language -- bedrock is, I don't think it is the right language, because that was the language he referred to in a sentences in Mackey, correct.  I've just been looking it up. And -- and but then in Teague itself, Justice O'Connor tries to get the right words, and -- which he ends up with here is that, the procedural is the first test, first part, is -- can be addressed by limiting the scope of the second exception -- that's the Watershed rule -- to those new procedures without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished.  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that's joined by the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and the fourth, I can't remember. But so is it seriously diminished? Now, we read through Miller, it's pretty hard to say.  I mean, my goodness, Miller is just filled with paragraph after paragraph about how a mandatory requirement for life without parole fails to take account of all the characteristics or many characteristics adherent in youth. And it's pretty hard to come away from that without thinking, Gee, accuracy under a mandatory life without parole does seriously diminish the accuracy of imposing life without parole when you apply the mandatory to a youth.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  But you have to say the accuracy is seriously diminished.  And she says, Then I don't think there will be too many such cases.   ",14-280X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you'd also have to look -- you have it at the top of your head, maybe forget if you don't, but what I thought I would do is I wanted to look to the aggravating circumstances, what were they.   Stephen G. Breyer  Let's call it ""he was the monster"" approach.  Reginald was the monster and Jonathan was the puppet or whatever.  I want to look at the aggravators.  I also want to look at the mitigators that Reginald said existed, and then see if this comparative monster, let's call it, fits into any of them. Do you know? Do you know the pages where they are, just by chance?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  I know where they are.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  On what page do you list them?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If, in fact, this gets in, then I guess what I have to do is go through this huge record on the sentencing anyway and see do I really think that this evidence that came in that the younger one thought the older one was the monster, et cetera, did it really have an effect?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I would have to do.  I don't see how I could avoid that if they are at all relevant.   Stephen G. Breyer  It would depend on what is was, wouldn't it? I mean, so I'm still asking the same question.  If the -- I take it that Reginald could not have introduced evidence refuting these brothers' state of mind that he was the monster.  That's what you're referring to by the bad influence. So the jury might have taken that evidence into account in trying to decide whether Reginald, for other reasons than in the statute, was a sympathetic enough character not to provide the death penalty. That's conceivable. But severance is very, very rare, and joint trials are very common.  And very common is the claim on an appeal in any kind of a case that it shouldn't -- it should have been severed. So do you have cases that you can think of that would be good precedent for you where a court, including particularly this Court, said, of course there might be a little prejudice here, some, but it's not enough to warrant severance? Because I think what I have to do is read the record on this point, and then I need something to compare it with.   Rachel P. Kovner  Well, I want to go back -- I'd like to answer the question and then go back to the premise --   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Rachel P. Kovner  -- because I am not sure I agree with the premise. But as to whether any prejudice is a problem, I think the best case for us is Zafiro.  Zafiro talks about the idea that what you need -- that joinder is presumably going to enhance fairness and accuracy. And what you need is substantial prejudice, even to have a statutory problem, and then -- even then we are going to presume that a limiting instruction would be sufficient to cure it. So that would be our best case on that point. But, Your Honor, I think the inquiry under the Eighth Amendment has to be would the Constitution have prohibited this evidence from coming in as to Reginald Carr.  And we think the answer is no.  Any evidence that's relevant to an individual defendant --   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, normally in severance cases, forgetting the death cases, seems to me the argument has been, look, they never would have gotten this piece of evidence in against my client.  They brought it in against the other client.  Now, go look at that evidence and you'll see how much my prejudice -- that my client was prejudiced by that. I do not know whether you call that due process.  Maybe you do.  But that's the kind of argument which seems for a quantitative weighing.  That's why I asked the question.   Rachel P. Kovner  I think I would go back to Zafiro again on that one, Your Honor, because I think Zafiro establishes that when accurate evidence comes in through a co-defendant that is relative -- that's relevant to the jury's determination, that's not prejudice.  That's information that may enhance the accuracy of what the jury --   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there -- to go back to the question that Justice Ginsburg has asked, as we say, this Court has never held that there is an absolute requirement that you give the reasonable doubt -- don't say it's no reasonable doubt in a mitigating case, just what you said.   Stephen G. Breyer  We send it back because, as you said, they just -- if the law in the State is different, they've changed it.  When they changed it, did they apply the change retroactively?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What did they say?   Stephen G. Breyer  But that court's held it's only prospective?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you very simply say, yes, have a new trial, that's how.  I mean, you simply set a new sentencing hearing --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There would be a need if Kansas law, as is now revealed by their pattern instructions, suggests that you do have to give the instruction that's -- that the -- that the defendant wants, and you'd have to have a new sentencing proceeding, wouldn't you?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes --   Stephen G. Breyer  My thinking is the following, so you'll understand why I ask this question. It, I think, could be the case that you're right, that this Court has never held that the Eighth Amendment requires giving such an instruction. Next question: Should it now hold it? Well, the answer to that question could be this is not a good case to decide that.  Because it may be that the Kansas court has held it as to the future and may apply the future rule as to the 9 people who are involved in the past.  Therefore, send it back. What do you think of that reasoning?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Probably not much, but I'd like to know your reasons. (Laughter.)   ",14-449X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But are you saying the severance rule is the same in non-capital as in capital cases?   Stephen G. Breyer  And you just look for prejudice?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So if you're right, joinder being among the most common kind of thing that gangs and drugs and so forth, why won't the same argument be made over and over preventing -- requiring severance in dozens and dozens, perhaps hundreds of cases where the government tries people together? Because they will say there are different relationships among members of the gang.  Those relationships -- some evidence would come in that would negative the relationship that would tend to show that this particular individual wasn't actually involved in this aspect of it, et cetera. That's why my experience on the Courts, lower courts particularly, leads me to think it's a very rarely accepted argument, severance.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's why I'm interested in -- I mean because if it would, you'd find it very unusual to try people together, which, in fact, is very usual.  And so when you told me there is no separate thing for the death cases, then I imagine it would affect every criminal trial of gangs throughout the country.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that is something that's concerning me and I am looking for an answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I'm looking for.  Why is it you believe that if I were to decide in your favor on this case and find the sufficient prejudice to warrant severance here, I wouldn't at the same time be throwing a huge monkey wrench --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- into the ordinary cases of gangs, drugs, et cetera, where joinder is very common and reversal is very rare.   Stephen G. Breyer  So this -- maybe you can, in your experience, cure what's bothering me about the case.  It's nothing to do with the facts, or for this -- this concern.  It has to do with -- with Zafiro.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that's the ordinary case of joint trials, right? And what the Court says is you can have the joinder as long as there isn't a serious risk that the joint trial would compromise -- it doesn't say harmless error, it says compromise -- a specific trial right, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment.  That doesn't talk about harmless error. Now, that's the standard that's used in dozens and dozens and dozens of cases. Or if, in this case, we start talking about harmless error, and that you can't have the joint proceeding if there is error that is not harmless. Well, what have we done to that sentence? And what have we done to the trials that are joint in hundreds of cases that don't involve murder or death? That is the legal problem that is worrying me.  And you will either cure that worry or say I've made some elementary mistake.  It has nothing to do with your case.  Say what you want, but I want to hear what you think about it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So we should not use the words ""harmless error."" We should quote from Zafiro and say could they make a reliable judgment? Now, that sounds harder on you, because if all you have to show is the error was harmful, it sounds like an easier task you have than to show that the juror -- jury wasn't reliable.  Or are they the same thing in your opinion?   ",14-449X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What about the problem that this is California law and a California court said that's what the contract means under California law? In other words, I can't find a case that we're supposed to say -- or we have the power to say that they're wrong, even if they were to say the words ""do not turn on the light"" mean turn on all the lights.   Stephen G. Breyer  So -- so -- and they may have done that in this case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Nonetheless, what do we do about it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I found no case ever that's done that.  And I have exactly the same problem that Justice Alito has.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, once we start with this case, even if this is not too difficult under State law, we've got every arbitration contract in the world where one lawyer or another will suddenly be saying, oh, the interpretation of the contract here by the State court judge is not favorable enough to arbitration or hostile to the act.  And suddenly we have Federalized, if not every area, a huge area of State contract law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, there's another way to do it.  We could just ask the California Supreme Court. Now, what about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or -- or come up with an answer to what Justice Alito just asked.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not ask.  No. Ultimately, it's a State law question, what does the contract mean.  And the contract, on reading it, seems to me that it applies to laws that are laws, not laws that have been held unconstitutional.  So what I've looked at, I've looked at civil rights cases, for all kinds of cases.  I can't find any.   Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe that's so.  But if the California Supreme Court had said this, I would look -- they would read the Contract as if it said, if there is a law in the State of California, a State law, or if there ever has been, whether that law is constitutional or not constitutional, whether it violates the Supremacy Clause or not, if they ever wrote those words in the State legislature into a law, there is no arbitration contract.  Okay? I guess parties have the right to do that.  And if the California court said as a matter of California law they did it right here, I don't know that we'd have a ground to stand on.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm back to my point.  I looked in civil rights cases.   Stephen G. Breyer  The South passed statute after statute like the city in the statutes and so forth to try to prevent the equal protection clause from being implemented.  So I looked at a few of those that my law clerk got.  In none could I find the court saying this matter of State law where it isn't itself unconstitutional, you know, what -- what is a trespass and so forth.  There -- it violates the Federal law, what they'd say is we interpret the State law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They've gone that far, because we think the State would interpret the State law this way.  But I can't find an analogy to what you're saying.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We'd have to say an interpretation of a contract where that interpretation is -- is what?   Stephen G. Breyer  What -- I'm looking for the standard.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You read me the words.  It didn't say what to do.   Stephen G. Breyer  It said they have to conform with Federal --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That looks like we're the supervisor of all State contract interpretation judges.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  My other suggestion -- we're not going to make too much progress on finding the standard, but California does accept requests from us, or other Federal courts, to explain what California law is.  I've looked at that statute.  And if this is so outrageous as a matter of contract interpretation of State law, why don't we just ask them?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They have not considered this case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Go back to Justice Scalia, please.  What I understood this to be is one reason this interpretation from your perspective is an unreasonable really weird one is because the statute basically says go to arbitration unless you are in a State where the law would require class arbitration.  And if that's the State you're in, dump the whole arbitration --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- business.  Okay. Now, one reason that's a bad interpretation is that probably what they meant is valid State law.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  That's one.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, is there any another?   ",14-462X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So if you said that --   Stephen G. Breyer  What he'll say, I think, is -- we certainly pressed him on it enough -- is that the -- read the sentence, the relevant sentence.  ""If the law of your State would find the agreement to dispense with class action procedure unenforceable, then the entire Section 9 is unenforceable."" All right. That's what it says. Now, would the law of California find the agreement ""dispense with class action"" procedure unenforceable? The answer to that question is clearly no.  Because they did have a law like that, but it was invalid.  So in order to read this in your favor, you'd have to say these words: If, however, the law of your State would find this agreement, you have to read it as saying, if, however the invalid law of your State would find this agreement to dispense with class action unenforceable, then. Now, nobody -- it's very hard to say that the parties meant if the invalid law of your State would find it and, therefore, contract interpretation is a question of law, this question of law was decided by California to read the word ""law"" as ""invalid law,"" there is no case in California or anywhere else, to our knowledge, that has interpreted contracts in such way out of the arbitration context, and therefore, this rule of law interpreting this word this way is discriminating against arbitration.  That's something like what the argument he's making.  Your answer to that is?   Stephen G. Breyer  But does California have a law, a valid law that would find the agreement to dispense with class action unenforceable? Does it or doesn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  It does.  In other words, California now has a law that makes it okay to dispense with class action procedures.   INTERRUPTING ",14-462X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  They benefitted, but the point is there is one court that says your Tribe can be a member.  Your -- your Tribe didn't present its claim to the contracting officer. And so why can they be a member? The judge addresses that question, and he says, normally they couldn't be a member, but they can here because this is the kind of case that is attacking general practices of the administration. Then okay.  Fine.  You got that. Then shortly after that or maybe a few years after that, another case comes along.  And the other case doesn't involve the situation of attacking the practices generally.  It concerns the individual contracts between the Tribe and the Indian Bureau, what -- you know, in the government. And there they say, you can't have a class action. So you'd think -- and this kind of case you want to bring now is the second kind, not the first kind.  So you'd say, why is it fair to let you bring this case? After all, if you'd read the opinion closely in the first one, you wouldn't have thought you should have waited.  If you had any doubts about it, the second one would have told you you should have waited.  And even beyond that, the administrator signs a piece of paper where they ask him: Do you have any claims under these contracts? And he says, none. So it doesn't seem to me you're talking about pure equities; you have very strong grounds. Now what's your reply to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  You probably wouldn't agree with any of them.  But -- but -- but --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're not making that kind of claim here, are you? I mean, you're not challenging the general practices of the government.  Rather, you're challenging the particular contracts and whether you got enough money under them.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If that's correct --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then the fact that the second case emphasized the general -- you know, the general attack, which lacks in your case, is more reason for thinking that we better file our claims quickly because what had -- they held in those two cases are not going to help us, who have an individual claim.  We better do what the statute says or the rules, and we better file our presentment to the contracting officer and certainly not write the words ""none"" when they ask you if you have any claim; am I right?

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what -- maybe you're doing that, but I would like to hear the precise answer to the question you've been asked several times.   Stephen G. Breyer  And to me, it takes the form, the opposite view has been the law everywhere for thousands of years among people who were not discriminating even against gay people, and suddenly you want nine people outside the ballot box to require States that don't want to do it to change what you've heard is change what marriage is to include gay people. Why cannot those States at least wait and see whether in fact doing so in the other States is or is not harmful to marriage? Now, that same question has been put in many, many ways in the briefs on our subject.  You've received it in three or four different ways.  I would like to know, so I can hear and understand it, just what your response is.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's called Congress shall make no law respecting the freedom of religion --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- but that --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- it leaves this question --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- open?   INTERRUPTING ",14-556X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know that that's -- I mean, leaving that to the side, I thought that I heard the answer to the question being given in respect to tradition of 2000 years, and to the democratic ballot box and so forth was quite simple. What I heard was, one, marriage is fundamental.  I mean, certainly that's true for 10,000 years.  And marriage, as the States administer it, is open to vast numbers of people who both have children, adopt children, don't have children, all over the place. But there is one group of people whom they won't open marriage to.  So they have no possibility to participate in that fundamental liberty.  That is people of the same sex who wish to marry.  And so we ask, why? And the answer we get is, well, people have always done it.  You know, you could have answered that one the same way we talk about racial segregation. Or two, because certain religious groups do think it's a sin, and I believe they sincerely think it. There's no question about their sincerity, but is a purely religious reason on the part of some people sufficient? And then when I look for reasons three, four and five, I don't find them.  What are they? So -- so therefore, I'm asking -- there I put a long question, but it gives you an opening to say what all of those reasons are.   Stephen G. Breyer  Good.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm sure that's true.  But I mean, the -- the fact is that -- that X percent, a very high percent of opposite-sex people don't have children and everybody knows they can't, and a very -- and a high -- certain percentage, I'm sure probably pretty high of those who get married, of same-sex people who get married do have children. So -- so where is this going? I mean, what are these two couples to do with it? I mean --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what -- what evidence --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- is there of that?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's fine.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'd like to go -- to -- to direct that.  I -- because I think we can accept that kind of definition, and simply point out that many gay people want to have children, and they do.   Stephen G. Breyer  So it's -- I'm not certain how that works here, but I'll think about it. The other thing I -- that you will have a view on, and will be helpful to me, is there is an argument being made, if not by the government -- and I'd like your response to it -- that after all, marriage is about as basic a right as there is; that the Constitution and Amendment Fourteen does say you cannot deprive a person of liberty, certainly of basic liberty, without due process of law; and that to take a group of people where so little distinguishes them from the people you give the liberty to, at least in terms of a -- of a good reason for not to, and you don't let them participate in this basic institution, that that violates the Fourteenth Amendment. Now, the reason that I'm interested in that is we don't get into this more scholastic effort to distinguish between rational basis and middle tier and some higher tier and so forth.  And it's not going to get into all these questions of balancing free religion rights versus gay rights and so forth.  We'd avoid that in this case.  And perhaps that's wise, if not legally required, which it may be.  And so I'd like your response to that aspect of the other side's argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It wasn't a right of privacy.  What I said was that the right to be married is as basic a liberty, as basic a fundamental liberty, not the right of privacy, the right to be married, which has existed for all of human civilization, that that is the right which is fundamental.  And, therefore, when a State offers that to almost everyone, but excludes a group -- I'm just repeating myself, but that -- I -- I want that question answered to the best of your ability, please.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Suppose I don't accept, for argument's sake, your notion that the right of privacy and the right to be married are the same thing.  Okay.  Now, we'll deal with my hypothetical, please.  And my hypothetical is they are different things.   Stephen G. Breyer  And on that assumption, I would like to know what you think of the argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's the same point.  What directly is your response to the fact that if we assume a basic purpose of marriage is to encourage an emotional and rearing bond between parents and children, that allowing gay people to marry will weaken it? After all, some non-gay couples have children, many, and some don't.  And some gay people marry and have children, and some don't.  So what's the empirical connection? That's what I have a problem with in your argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's the empirical part of what you just said? If you believe that marriage is -- you -- I just heard you say it, but I didn't follow it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But I've never heard of a State that said, it is our State policy that we don't like adoption.  I've heard of many States who say it's very important to treat adopted children the same way that you treat natural children.  I've never heard the contrary.   Stephen G. Breyer  So if your argument depends upon that, I'm stuck.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Should I read anything other than -- I'll certainly go back and read Windsor again and I'll certainly go and read Glucksberg again. I do recall the cases, at least generally, and I don't believe there's anything in those cases that says the basic liberty or right to be married is a right that extends only to opposite-sex couples.  Those -- those weren't really issues in the case as they are here, so I'm surprised if this Court actually wrote that, but -- but if it did write that and you can immediately call that page to mind, I'll doubly look at it.  And I just doubt it's there, but I'll look at it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  That's quite all right.  I'll read the whole opinion.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's the limitation, fine. Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How could the limitation -- the right has -- the fundamental right has to be a right to marry and you said it's the limitation --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Sometimes, you know, context matters.  I'll go in.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm surprised we have this case in front of us if that -- I mean, if it's been so clearly decided, but --   Stephen G. Breyer  He said -- I mean, I already have several cases to read.  I might as well get another one. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  What -- what is the case that holds that the State of New York has the right to recognize only marriages made in New York? And when -- if you marry in Virginia, New York has the constitutional right to say, we treat you as if you weren't married, whoever you are.   Stephen G. Breyer  Like New York.  For example, I happen to know has a law that a Federal judge from Washington couldn't marry someone.  I mean, you can get married to your own wife, et cetera, but you can't marry two other people, but the District of Columbia has the opposite law.  So if I marry two people in Washington D.C. and they happen to move to New York, you are saying that New York doesn't have to recognize that marriage because it doesn't comport with the marriage of New York; is that your point?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then what case says that? I think there are a few people going to get nervous about this. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  But here the policy would be we distrust Federal judges from outside the State. And even that, they would get away with, in your view, because I'm next going to ask, and what is the difference between that kind of policy and the policy that says, well, we don't recognize the gay couple's marriage for the reason that we fear that if gay couples get married, even if they have children and adopt them, and even if we allow people who are not gay to get married and they don't have children, despite all that, this policy, which I've had a little trouble understanding, warrants not recognizing it? Did you follow that question? It was a little complicated.   INTERRUPTING ",14-556X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the matter complained of here is a constructive discharge.  In a tort suit or many the matter complained of is negligent behavior leading to an injury.  I take it in the tort suit the statute of limitations doesn't begin to run until there is harm.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  I think that's generally true of tort suites --   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  If that's generally true in a tort suit, and my guess is in a contract suit for breach of contract, if the contracting party sent the ships out and you knew that it wouldn't be delivered, it's not actionable until it isn't delivered and I guess there are ways around that, but my point is generally in the law where the matter complained of is a certain kind of incident in the world, negligence leading to harm, action of a discriminatory, et cetera, nature that leads to a discharge, normally the statute of limitations begins to run when the harm occurs. Now why should it be any different here?   Catherine M.A. Carroll  In this case, the discrimination, the retaliation I should say, that was challenged was the forcing -- forcing of Mr. Green into the settlement agreement in December.  He alleges that that was retaliatory and he was harmed by that at that time, and he could have promptly initiated counseling on that complaint. Now, it is true that, as a consequence of that discriminatory retaliatory conduct, the stakes got higher for him at a later point when he decided --   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course, he could have, but we're talking only about the constructive discharge part.  I mean, sometimes defendants do seven bad things at once, or at least allegedly bad.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  That's correct, but --   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm only talking about one of them, the one that we're talking about is the constructive-discharge claim. So I go back to my question about negligence, because that was the first course I took in law school so I remember that, but the -- the fact is why should we treat this any differently?   Catherine M.A. Carroll  So, in general, we don't this should be analyzed any differently than any other kind of claim, which is that we have to identify what is the alleged unlawful practice and when did it occur.  Why is that? Because --   Stephen G. Breyer  Because you have to, as you said, in the a tort case it's not just that the person behaved negligently, but that negligence had to result in a harm.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  And --   Stephen G. Breyer  So I'm just -- that's the only simpleminded analogy I'm drawing and I wonder why it doesn't work.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  I think it does work because in this case there was retaliation alleged in December that harmed Mr. Green at that time.  He later suffered a more painful consequence, which under Ricks does not trigger a new construct -- a new statute of limitations. But I want to go back --   Stephen G. Breyer  Wouldn't it run from the date of discharge because there would be an intent at -- as of that date?   Catherine M.A. Carroll  But if I'm understanding the hypothetical correctly, that sounds to me like a case that would be analyzed under the Court's decision in Morgan, where you have an environment of hostility that is composed of many individual acts, some of which might not be independently actionable in and of themselves, joined with a discriminatory --   Stephen G. Breyer  That's the -- now, I'm getting this more clearly because your response to my question, which is now relevant to this too, is, look, the plaintiff was hurt on the very day that last act was performed, indeed he suffered because he saw the act being performed, and that was one of the things that led him later to quit. So let's count that as the injury.  And let's count the whole thing complete as of that time. That's basically the argument for your side, I think. And now the argument against you is that's going to be a nightmare.  Because there will be in fact a whole range of acts, a whole series in many cases and will then, in order to run the statute of limitations, have to get into the question of which of those acts -- maybe there were some he didn't know about -- which of those acts actually did produce harm and which did not. And he just really won't know when to bring his lawsuit as compared with the comparatively simple thing: He quits.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  Right, I understand that contention, but I think that the so-called difficulty is no different than the difficulty, so-called, that would arise in a hostile work environment case where there was no resignation.  You would still have to --   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, that's true.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  -- figure out what -- were there acts within the 45-day period that contributed to the environment.  Maybe that's going to be difficult on some facts, but that's a result of this Court's decision in Morgan, again, nothing to do with constructive discharge. Now, with respect to --   ",14-613X

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't understand it, either.  It seems to me that there is some circumstances where a guard is trying to punish someone, but there are many circumstances where a guard has something totally else in mind.  He's trying to keep order in the prison. A policeman might try to stop a fleeing felon.  That has nothing to do with punishment. And so what a guard -- normally, the provision that governs the policeman is the Fourth Amendment.  I would guess that if you're talking about trying to keep order in a prison, the Due Process Clause may have something to do with it.  This person who may be awaiting a lawyer is there, his liberty confined, and you cannot use excessive force. I don't see what punishment had to do with it.  But I -- but I did think, and I don't know the answer, but I looked it up in the Model Penal Code, that either the policeman who's trying to stop someone, or perhaps the prison guard who's trying to keep order, cannot use excessive force. Now, what is excessive force? It is force that is objectively unreasonable.  Now, suppose he does. The next question is: Is a state of mind required? We can imagine -- it would be a weird case -- but we can imagine a very weird case where the force is objectively unreasonable, but the policeman is totally innocent. Somebody told him, that is a Taser, but it's really a gun.  He uses it.  Objectively unreasonable.  State of mind, innocent.  Is he liable? As far as I can tell, the government thinks he should be.  As far as I can tell, you think he should be.  End of case.  We just say everybody agrees.  Is that where we are? Because I'm rather worried about holding the policeman in this weird case, where his state of mind is a hundred percent innocent.  What here happened is that they read in a little bit of culpability, the least onerous subjective intent.  It's called recklessness.  You have to be aware of the risk. So I'm rather tempted to say, yes, there should be something guilty about this policeman.  Now, there's where I am at the moment, and I'd like you to explain where I should go.   Stephen G. Breyer  At least in a prison, I would think a prison guard would have a pretty tough time thinking that if this person is in prison because he's been convicted of a crime, I can try to control his riotous behavior as long as I reasonably believe that what I'm doing is correct, even if it turns -- but now I have a totally different standard, where this person's in the same cell, doing the same thing, but he hasn't yet had his trial.  He's just there waiting for his lawyer or he's been there because bail has been denied. I -- I don't see how you administer such a rule.   Stephen G. Breyer  What's the answer to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Wait, wait, wait, wait. The first one, that's the -- I mean, now you've run -- just run -- I could say the objective part has to be objectively unreasonable force.  Now, the question is: Is there also some kind of subjective part? And at this moment, it seems to me, on the one hand, you say, yes, and on the other hand, no.   John F. Bash  No.  I'm saying no on both hands. It's --   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  No.  In other words --   John F. Bash  It -- it is --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- even though this man, the defendant, is completely innocent, it wasn't his fault in the slightest, he wasn't even negligent, the guard is nonetheless liable.  I can't find anywhere -- not even in Fourth Amendment cases could I find a case where that actually occurred.   John F. Bash  Because, Justice Breyer, that's not what we're saying.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   John F. Bash  I think the premise of the question conflates two different types of intent.  And this is exactly what the court of appeals did below. There's the intent to actually do the act.  So if I -- if he had accidentally Tasered him --   Stephen G. Breyer  Obviously --   John F. Bash  -- or if --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- you have the intent to do the act, that obviously --   John F. Bash  But -- but --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- isn't the problem.   John F. Bash  -- that was the premise of your question about --   Stephen G. Breyer  No.   John F. Bash  -- if you think it is --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- it isn't.  It isn't.   John F. Bash  Well, the Taser gun question -- I mean --   Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask my question?   John F. Bash  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  It is objectively unreasonable.  But it is an odd case where the policeman is -- or warden or whoever, is totally reasonable in thinking the contrary, and that focuses you on the question of whether there is some kind of either purposeful, knowledgeable, or reckless, that being the weakest, requirement in respect to the use of objectively unreasonable force, not the act, but knowing that it is objectively or reckless in respect to.  You see?   John F. Bash  Well, let -- let me describe how --   Stephen G. Breyer  I want to know what your view is on that.   John F. Bash  My view is this: One, it has to be an intentional act.  That -- that's the less --   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's --   John F. Bash  And -- well, and intent --   ",14-6368
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's true -- you know, what you say is equally true where you're running a jail, isn't it? And it's equally true where the person in the jail is -- has been convicted or hasn't been convicted.  The need for order is the same. So how would it apply in a circumstance where there's a claim of excessive force to someone who has been convicted, but it has nothing to do with punishment.  No one thinks it has to do with punishment. The situation was one where they were trying to maintain order, or the situation was one where they were trying to give medical treatment, or the situation was any one of a thousand. What I can't see is why the punishment standard should apply whether he's been convicted or not.  And I also can't see why they should be different whether he's been convicted or not.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But suppose you brought a lawsuit under the Due Process Clause? I mean -- and there are instances where people are seized in jail, so it was under the Fourth Amendment. I mean, why is punishment in these other situations? I can't figure that one out.  I can't figure out -- and then I looked at the Model Penal Code. The Model Penal Code seems to require both excessive force and some kind of state of mind, which could be recklessness, which is what the judge said here or maybe even negligence.   ",14-6368
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What do we do about all of the -- what used to be when I worked in the Senate Judiciary Committee? Every year we would get dozens, maybe hundreds, past dozens of private bills.  There were bills for one person, and moreover, at least some of them, to my recollection, involved that one person saying I tried to sue.  Maybe the case is still there, but I was met with a statute of limitations defense, for example.  I'd like the money.  And we'd vote yes, give him the money, he deserves it, if he does.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, considering the ones that do --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- very often the person sued.  He was met with some kind of defense, and he thought, and Congress might have thought maybe he should have the money.  This is a technical defense.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I understand you --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what -- now -- now, suppose it's a private person on the other side.  I can easily imagine circumstances where to take the money from private B and give it to private A might -- for example, a property without due process.  It might violate some other provision.  But if it doesn't violate some other provision, what in the separation of powers, unsaid principles, distinguishes between taking $10 from the government and giving it to the private person, or taking $10 from Joe Smith and giving it to the private person, assuming there's nothing unfair about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because I think --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, oh.  The defense -- the defense happened to be -- that worked -- an obscure provision in a court of claims act, that the government through Congress had once put in, and they decided it would be unfair to apply it now to this person, and so they repeal it in respect to that person.  And there's never going to be another like him.  Okay? Now, don't play.  What I don't want you to do is play on the potential unfairness, because there are other parts of the constitution there.  Assume it's fair to do that.  What stops it.   Stephen G. Breyer  The State law is what would apply, perhaps, in the absence of a congressional statute.  So the President goes to Congress and says, what I would like is you to agree with me about this. We've frozen $14 billion worth of assets of a country with which we are not friendly.  There are some people who would like some of that money.  We would like to take the assets which are currently being held in the 14th floor of the Howard Building in Chicago and use that.  Why? We want to use that because we've worked out that that's the best way to pay people we think should be deserving money, and we don't care about the foreign country in respect to those.  But our foreign relations are such that we don't want to get the others involved.  Now what's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I'll -- the hypothetical is meant to say just what Justice Kennedy brought up, which is the President, particularly when he acts together with Congress, is given the foreign affairs power to a very great extent of the United States of America.  And that foreign affairs power could often involve, for reasons of foreign policy, unfreezing a refrigerator and not unfreezing the stove. So I don't -- I don't know foreign affairs, but I do know that the President, together with Congress, certainly must have very broad power to decide what assets shall or shall not be kept frozen and not kept frozen.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's lacking in the integrity if you have an enemy country, let's say. We've had many wars.  You freeze a lot of their assets. There are people who would like to get ahold of some. And Congress gives the executive authority or itself goes through and says, we think these people should have this.  We think they should have that.  They should -- others could have the other thing. I mean, maybe it violates equal protection; maybe it violates due process, depending on how they do it.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is that the ground? I'd like you to perhaps repeat, but I think pursue what the chief justice was bringing up.  The example that I thought of is imaginary.  The SEC has a rule, and it says a winning plaintiff in a 10b-5 case cannot attach assets that are in a trust that the defendant has commingled the assets with his wife who's not a defendant.  Can you imagine that rule? I'm just trying -- it's something like a Spendthrift trust or what I'm trying to do is get a Spendthrift trust in the Federal context.  Now, Congress passes a law, and it says in case 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the petitioner can reach the mingled assets.  Okay.  Period.  Constitutional? If not, why not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I thought your answer to the hypothetical -- have you got the hypothetical in mind? All we have is a statute that says in case 1, 2, 3, you can, in effect, reach the assets, winning plaintiff in the two 10b-5s of the Spendthrift trust. And that's all it says.  It doesn't work for the future. It doesn't work elsewhere for the past.  It works for this case. Now, that might violate several things.  But I want to know what, and does it violate something, and does it violate this principle that they are bringing up about not deciding for a particular case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, can I do this? Can I say perhaps, the case I just gave you, Spendthrift trust, legislation for this one plaintiff, maybe they can't do that.  But if we're talking about Spendthrift trusts in Iran, they can, because that's the foreign affairs power and because the President and Congress both agree that that's an appropriate exercise of the foreign affairs power.   Stephen G. Breyer  If you want to be cute, Congress has 4,000 ways of being cute.  And I can't quite see this Court trying to police those ways.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and indeed, I think I'm right in saying we had hundreds of private bills that were written in all kinds of ways and weren't -- to benefit individuals, and some of them might have been subject to cases and others not.  The unusual thing about this case is it refers to a particular docket number.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can't anyone join? That is to say, if a person today, or if there is some person who has the appropriate judgment, an antiterrorism judgment against Iran, are they perfectly free to join into this case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I would --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can we -- would this resolve the case correctly, in your view on your side, were we to say whatever the general principle is, this is a case which is against you.  It refers to a case by number, the statute.  Before you is the fact that anyone can join, and there are hundreds or dozens of such plaintiffs.  And moreover, on the other side, it -- it refers to $1.75 billion worth of assets in all kinds of different securities and obligations, and now perhaps in cash being held in New York. So whatever we're talking about, though the number suggests a particular case, the facts of the case suggest far more generality than is true of most cases.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that true or not true?   ",14-770X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose it were true --   Stephen G. Breyer  Perhaps there is that larger question, that if, in fact, for whatever set of reasons, it's not you, you didn't purposely hide these other kinds of drugs, if there is no method of executing a person that does not cause unacceptable pain, that, in addition to other things, might show that the death penalty is not consistent with the Eighth Amendment.  Is that so or not, in your opinion?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is it -- now let's get to that -- I'd like to get --   Stephen G. Breyer  I'd just like -- since we're on the narrow question.  The narrow question that you want to present, I would like to hear the argument. As far as I know, we held in Baze in this context that if a person is not rendered unconscious where the other two drugs come in, there is a constitutionally unacceptable risk of suffocation and pain.  That's the holding. And in this case, the court of appeals says that the district court found that this drug that you're talking about, midazolam, will result in central nervous depression, rendering the person unconscious and insensate during the rest of the procedure, a sufficient level of unconsciousness to resist the major stimuli of the later two drugs.  That's his finding. You had an expert testify that that is not the case.  That expert said that -- I'm citing an article.  He said that it would not reliably put the person in a coma.  Isn't that what he said?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Then the other side produced the expert which just said the contrary. All right.  So you have to say that that conclusion, namely, quote, the 500 milligrams will be at a -- will make it a virtual certainty that he will be at a sufficient level of unconsciousness to resist the stimuli of the other two drugs.  So I'm sorry, you don't -- I've run out of your time.  Maybe I'll ask the other side the same question.  I want to know what underlies that sufficient to make you say, clearly wrong.  But the other side is just as good to ask that question.  And I want you to reserve your time.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   ",14-7955
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can I -- can I ask --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- the same question, which is I -- I've had this one question, and that is, as I read this record -- you remember what I said was the standard from Baze.  You remember what I said was the district court's finding.  You remember that I believe that what this is about is whether that finding is clearly erroneous.  And what I have are two sentences. The first sentence is from their expert. And he, quote, when you could be unconscious, he means that this drug, midazolam, is an antianxiety drug, like Xanax.  People use it to go to sleep every night, and it can render you unconscious and not reacting to minor stimuli.  That's their expert. But when major stimuli such as the introduction of the next two drugs that we're talking about here come into play, you are jolted into consciousness, and you are quite aware, and you wake up. Now, if we stop there, you'd lose, right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If we stop there.   Stephen G. Breyer  But he pointed to -- he pointed to two articles.  He based that statement -- but I'll look at the two articles.  It seemed to me he was basing the statement on medical articles, but, okay, we have to look at the support for that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now let's look at the other side, because your side then says -- he says right here that -- he says it will put you into a coma.  That's his point.  But his reasoning was that if you take enough of it, you'll be dead.  And then he says this is essentially an extrapolation from a toxic effect, by which he means if you take a lot, you'll be dead, but before you're dead, you're in a coma.  And that's his reasoning.  And I didn't find any other reasoning. Now, the obvious thing -- are two.  One, a lot of things kill you without putting you into a coma, such as the next two drugs.  Lots of things do.  And, two, he didn't point to anything in support of this putting into a coma.  It was just the extrapolation. Now, that's what I want you to focus on, because if what I've just said is correct, then I think there is no support in this record for his conclusion. If what I have said is incorrect, there might be support.   Stephen G. Breyer  What you have here, their expert saying, as I previously said, that this drug will not keep you asleep.  Once these two others are introduced, you will be jolted into consciousness; that is his testimony.  I believe he supported that with medical articles, but I'll look to see. If it turns out it is supported, we have to look to the other side to see what was refuting it.  And what on the other side is refuting it, on 327 -- and I agree with you that this ceiling effect is a big red herring here -- what actually he said that would go against it was that he said there is an extrapolation from his conclusion that 500 milligrams could cause death, and so if that much is likely to cause death, it's certainly likely to cause a coma.  And a coma would prevent the person from -- from pain. But his evidence for that was zero.  We know that, in fact, lots of drugs can kill people without first putting them into a coma.  And so we look to see what is it he thinks that if this kills you will first put you into a coma.  And when I looked -- or asked my clerks and others to look -- we found zero. Now, that's my question.  What can you point me to which will show that what I think is the key refutation of their expert rests upon zero, that's what I'm asking you.  That's what I've tried to ask, inarticulately, perhaps, but now it's more articulate, so --   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, well --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let me put it differently. Not the word ""coma""  I think what he was driving at, your expert, was that you were in a state such that you would feel no pain.  And the reason he thought you were in that state is because 500 mg will probably kill you. And if it's going to kill you, it must, of course, at least first put you in that state. So I'm asking the same question, but I am using the words ""that state"" in substitution for the word ""coma"".   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not asking you for even -- I really want to know where in the record does he provide support for that statement, that the, quote, that state, end quote, precedes the death caused by this drug.

Now, if my grandson tells me, I don't want to watch -- I don't want to do my homework tonight at 7:00 because I'm just so tired.  And besides, I promised my friend I'd play basketball.  And besides that, there's a great program on television.  And besides that, you know, I really -- my stomach is upset, but I want to eat spaghetti.  And so he's now given me five different reasons. What do I think of those reasons?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  One may be valid.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Which one?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, wait.  The point is he gave 40 different reasons.  And the very fact that he gives 40 different reasons -- and many of them are self-contradictory, obviously not applicable, totally different from -- you know, that's why I used my grandchild's analogy.  All right? And so I would say my answer to my grandchild is, look, you're not too tired to do your homework.  And I think any reasonable person looking at this would say, no, his reason was a purpose to discriminate on the basis of race. Now, tell me why I'm wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I want to ask you a different question before your time is up.  And I'd like you to respond to the question that Justice Alito initially asked.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that is, is there an independent State ground here? Now, you're familiar with the record.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I read on page 192 of the -- of your record the decision.  And the first paragraph supports your -- the view that you would like to hold, I think, that this is based upon res judicata, which is a State matter. And then there is the paragraph that was read to you on page 195 and 196 where the judge says, ""The reason that I reach that conclusion is because the notes and records submitted by Petitioner failed to demonstrate purposeful discrimination on the basis that the race was the basis."" Okay? That sounds like Batson to me. And then he goes on to say, ""And in addition there is no good reason given, now or then."" And then he concludes, ""Accordingly, the court finds the renewed Batson claim is without merit."" So if I read just that paragraph, I would think the reason that the judge found in your favor is he decided the Batson claim in your favor.  He didn't have to.  He could have gone on some other ground, but that's the ground he did go on. But at worst, why isn't it ambiguous? And if it is ambiguous, then why don't we take, you know -- I think it's what's in the -- Long, you know, all those cases.  If it's ambiguous, then aren't we required to assume that the judge went on the Federal ground? Okay? Now, that's both Alito's question.  It's what I think is the hardest point for you to overcome. And I want to hear your response.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's the end of it, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING ",14-8349
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, we might be -- when did they write? We're looking at, call it ""your section,"" which is (a)(4); is that right? Or what is it? It's -- for the three things in it.  The one you're interested in is -- let's -- I don't want a name for it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I call it ""your section.""   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  I'm going to call it ""your section.""   Stephen G. Breyer  Your section. Then think of several other sections, which are the one I hadn't thought about which Justice Alito raised.  That's really suspicious the way that looks there.  41, 42, 43.  Now, when you pull up 41, 42, 43, law or written before the relevant parts of your section were written.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  If that's so -- and I don't know if this helps you or hurts you, but it seems to me that there is a ready-made right there for a drafter explanation of why he uses these words.  Because we first look to 41, and that's aggravated.  And then we look to 42, and that's sexual abuse without aggravated. And conduct is just the same as contact, but the drafter is thinking maybe we should go a little bit bigger. Now, the difficulty is in each of the sections I've mentioned, there is a special related section for children. So the difference between the two for adults is the nature of the force requiring a person to perform a sexual act.  A threat of violence, et cetera.  That's one.  Right? And then the next section, abuse, it can be some other kind of threat.  Then we get to the way it deals with children, and it deals with children under the 12 -- under 12.  That's one.  And it deals 12 to 16. That's the next.  And then we have a section called contact, and that has to do with sex acts basically that really weren't sex acts but for a certain kind of conduct which is defined.  All right. So I read this, I say, hey, that's what they picked up.  They just -- a drafter just picked it up and changed a little bit, but that's what he had in mind. Then the question is: Your question.  And in your favor, I think, is the fact that each of these earlier sections does have a special section dealing with children under the same number. Now, don't tell me I'm right if I'm not right, but that's what I suddenly saw when Justice Alito asked his question.  Just tell me your reaction.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, she's saying why -- but they -- they do include the sexual abuse adult when you're talking about prior conviction of a Federal crime.   Stephen G. Breyer  And the answer, I guess, has to be that you -- the drafters know what they're getting into with the Federal crimes, and they have no idea what they're getting into when they're dealing with 50 State crimes.  Is that your response?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not trying to put words in your mouth.  I want to know what -- that's what I read in the --   ",14-8358
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What were the -- what were the other three? You said there were four reasons.  I started where I think Justice Scalia did.  Of course, I might more often than he think that the canons don't help us all that much.  And this -- this is a poster child, I think, for that proposition. And so you said, no, there are four things here that show that this isn't ambiguous.  You shouldn't end up that way.  Now, one was a redundancy, which I'm not sure what it was, and then you didn't get to the other three, which I'd like to hear.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, it wasn't.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  And the other?   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  And the fourth.   Stephen G. Breyer  Fourth, fourth.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So he'll say ""or"" is in this one and it's not in the other one for a reason. He'll say they're superfluous reading both ways.  He'll say that -- I can't remember the third -- but the fourth he's going to say, yeah, it's underinclusive versus overinclusive.  Yours is it would be somewhat under-inclusive for the reason you say, and you take your reading, it will be overinclusive for the reason he says. So if we're at -- this is the only place that -- if we are absolutely at equipoise, which I can't say we are now, but I think it through -- if we are absolutely at equipoise, before turning to the rule of lenity, I would like your comment on my temptation to say at least here, the legislative history helps.  And indeed --   Stephen G. Breyer  Indeed --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- it isn't just a letter from the Justice Department.  It is that the report, the way these are actually written is that a general idea is given to a person whose job it is to draft.  And that drafter tries to put in words the general intention that's been described, and the report is used to describe what the general intention was.  I'm not saying a hundred percent, but very often with technical statutes, that's how it works. So I read that report, and what do I discover? A repeat offender with a prior conviction under da-ta-da, or under any State child abuse law, or law relating to the production receipt or distribution of child pornography.  And it is only two years later after they pass that that the Justice Department writes its letter noting that the provision they just passed involved individuals with prior convictions for child abuse.  And recommending an enhanced penalty as well if they had a prior conviction for sexual abuse of a minor. Okay.  So I read that and said, short, but clear.  And that's what the drafter would have been looking at when -- the first one, anyway -- working with the staff of the committee when trying to translate general intentions of senators and representatives into actual language.  And I think it's not contrary to popular belief to say that senators and representatives do hire staff to do such things and do not sit there with pen and pencil thinking, where does the ""or"" go? Okay? So what is -- what is the Justice Department's response to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  You asked a really quite broad -- I don't know what the 4,000 people over there are doing, if -- if they're not entrusted by their principals to write words on paper that would reflect the general idea. You think they can't do that?   ",14-8358

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That is true.  That is true.   Stephen G. Breyer  That is true.  What you say is true.  Every reduction in demand for a unit of retail electricity is ipso facto a demand for a reduction of a unit of wholesale electricity, and vice versa.  So it's hardly surprising that anything they do in the wholesale market that adds to demand will add to demand in retail, and vice versa. But I thought that their motivation here is the following: On the 4th of August at 4:00 p.m., people turn on electricity for air-conditioning.  That's the peak hour.  The industry, leaving reserves out of this as a fixed matter, has to supply that.  So if there are not enough generators at 4:00 p.m. on August the 4th, they have to build one. And to build an additional generator -- I don't know what gas costs now, but let's imagine it's $500,000, and that will be passed on in the wholesale price, and then probably, though the States are free to do what they want, in the retail price. So FERC thinks I have another way of doing this.  For only $400,000, I can be sure that on the 4th of August at 4:00 p.m., the demand is not great enough to spend the 500, and so we group the people who will promise to fulfill their air-conditioning at other times. That way, the price of wholesale electricity falls.  And, therefore, we satisfy all demand at a lower price.  We are interested in wholesale.  We are interested in how to satisfy peak wholesale demand.  And we have worked out a way to do it cheaper.  Of course it affects retail prices, so does everything we do in respect to wholesale prices.  End of the matter. So I accept your characterization, but I do not see any law that prevents them from raising or lowering wholesale price despite the fact that that affects retail price.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It didn't affect -- it didn't try -- what it said was, we have a group of people who will put customers together, and those customers will, in fact, cut demand at 4:00 p.m. on August 4th.  As I say, that affects retail price; so does everything.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and what is the difference here -- and that's what you want to get at, so I'm letting you do it --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- the difference here and what I just said? Everything.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you're --   Stephen G. Breyer  I guess if you're -- if you're right, then I guess the FERC could not direct the grid approvals in a way that would, in fact, prevent certain retail customers from buying electricity at certain times.  I guess that FERC could not, in fact, allow large consumers of electricity to buy at wholesale, because that would take the retail customers away from the jurisdiction of the State.  I guess that FERC could not, in fact, insist upon a marginal capacity being generated from natural gas instead of from other things, because that will affect the price of natural gas, will affect the wholesale rate, thereby raising the retail rate, thereby stealing customers away from, let's say, Ohio, where it goes up, and forcing them to go to Texas. I mean, I have not been surprised that I have found no case in which FERC ever tried to do anything roughly comparable or even by the roughest analogy that would say that they cannot do this for the reason you suggest.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, all there were meant to be was three examples, and I don't know how good they are, but they come to mind.   Stephen G. Breyer  I was grasping your point, which I hadn't grasped previously.  And your point seems to be that the problem here is the way they are reducing the demand, and therefore the cost of wholesale electricity, is by taking a -- groups of people and preventing them from buying electricity at all at certain times, which, of course, affects their buying retail. Isn't that basically your point? And if it is, I was trying to think with that argument.  That's -- that's why I said that you can skip the whole thing if you want.   Stephen G. Breyer  They have to be reasonable in what they do under Chevron.  It's a broadly-phrased statute.  What they have to do is reasonable. And so really the question is, is what they're doing here unreasonable?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and I -- and we're not electricity regulators; they are.  It's pretty tough and technical. And -- and so that's why I -- I've been trying to figure out just what it is about this thing that, in your view, makes it unreasonable.   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought that the response was what Justice Sotomayor, and the way -- I wouldn't characterize it that way, but it's called the ""net benefits test."" And the net benefits test means this is not a one size fits all. And then in the order, at paragraph 17, 18, page 67, they go through a bunch of methodologies, and they say -- I mean, they say, we're picking this one. And the reason that they pick this one, I guess, is they think it's -- if you try a G thing, that also is a problem administratively. Okay.  Now, I'll just read those.  Is there anything else you're going to tell me that -- I'll read them and see what they say, right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Breyer  I thought -- you don't have -- I mean, I thought that he -- frankly the net benefits test was meant to dealt with -- deal with this problem. I will read Kahn's testimony, I promise.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  If you don't know -- I mean, I can't get anything out of the second sentence, to tell you the truth, because I think that a prison is usually within a single district.  And so when you're worried about a multiple filer, what he does is he files about 15 cases in the same court. And -- and therefore, it's perfectly understandable why Congress would refer to multiple fees, because they are going to be like ten of them. It's the people they are really worried about are -- are what's at issue.  So I can't get anything out of the second sentence. It's the first sentence that -- that is, it seems to me, both your strength and your weakness. There it talks about after payments of the -- the initial partial filing fee.  Okay.  It sounds as if it's talking about a case.  And so what do we do about that? I mean, there it is.  ""After the initial partial filing fee, the prisoner shall be required to make monthly payments of 20 percent,"" et cetera.  That's where you have the word ""fee.""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't mean it's exclusive.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm just giving you an explanation as to why they might have used the words ""fees,"" even though they previously defined a filing fee of $350.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you're clarifying it, $11, I guess you'd take a dollar.  All right.  I mean, what's unclear?   Stephen G. Breyer  They can't administer it that way.  I mean, is there somebody who is administering this that way?   Stephen G. Breyer  And they are really doing that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there a way of interpreting the statute, which I think would make -- I -- I would guess, not in every case, where this multiple thing is likely to arise is where: Files a frivolous case, it's dismissed by the district court, and then he takes an appeal.  Okay? There we have two. And so the question is -- he has to get the filing fee.  Then the next slot is going to be, like, 20 percent or 40 percent, right? But you should leave him with $10. Given the purpose of the statute, which is to stop these frivolous suits, or at least make it a little tougher, doesn't it make sense, say, what I just said: Leave him with the $10, but you can take the 40 percent: 20 percent for one court, 20 percent for the other? Now, maybe what I've just said doesn't make sense.  To me, it makes sense at the moment.  But it would -- it would both leave him with the $10, but allow the clerks to collect the 20 percent for the district court, 20 percent for the Court of Appeals. Is -- is that impossible to bring about?   Stephen G. Breyer  You can interpret it the other way, linguistically.  You say, you forward the 20 percent each time the amount in the account exceeds $10.  Well, the instant you write that check, you say, it -- it does not exceed $10, and therefore you can't forward it.  So you can't write that kind of a check. I mean, isn't that literally --   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, now we're getting into the technicalities of banking -- (Laughter.)   Stephen G.

What they say is that the right way to go about this is -- and they cite cases and so forth in the 19th century -- is that the defendant should not -- you're right.  It's not an offer of relief.  What they say is the defendant is supposed to tender the money. And when he tenders the money, if the plaintiff won't accept it, he goes to the court and he deposits the money in the court.  And the court then issues a judgment saying, this case is over. That's what I read here in the pages 9 to 11, and they have lots of authority, and that gets rid of the problem.  And there's no -- it seems to me if it isn't right, why isn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why -- who -- what the judge does is say they want $10,000.  What the defendant does is he says they won't take my check, which should be certified.  So he deposits it in court.   Stephen G.

And, of course, if that person now has all he wants, he can't certify this is a class because he isn't harmed.   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine.  Give him judgment on the merits.  Who cares?   Stephen G.

What -- why is that unadministrable?     Shay Dvoretzky  Your Honor, I think many, if not almost all Title VII cases do originate without any sort of admission by the employer about what the reason was for not hiring the individual.  And I think that the rule that places a burden on employers to stereotype and to raise these sorts of issues is one that will undermine the purposes of Title VII.   Stephen G. Breyer  Do you want to say a word about what I called his administrative argument?   INTERRUPTING ",14-86XX
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Actually, I didn't think that was the question.  I thought the question presented was that the Tenth Circuit had said, Employer, unless you know from the woman who is applying, from the applicant, unless you receive direct, explicit notice that what she wants to wear is based on religion and she wants an accommodation, unless you receive direct, explicit notice from her, you're home free to do what you want. Now, in their question presented, they say, in the last few words in describing it, we think that's wrong. Now, I agree that we have to say whether that's wrong and, if it is wrong, it would be helpful to say what they have to do.  So the SG says, here is what it is.  If the employer correctly infers, correctly understands, and I would add ""or correctly believes"" that a practice is religious and an accommodation is necessary, that's it.  Then he has to accommodate unless he has one of the excuses under the statute, et cetera. Okay.  What's wrong with that?     INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh no, you have to prove. This -- this is correct.  You have to prove he has a belief.  Now, we probably in 250,000 Federal cases a year, of those, say, 80,000 that go to trial.  Proving that somebody has a belief or other is probably at issue in 90 percent of them.  Now, I'm making that up, that number, but nonetheless, I don't think it's uncommon in the law that you have to prove that somebody believes something.  So we say, the standard of proving belief is like in any other case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Again, how we get into all that, if you want to add something to it, it seems we're in a kind of minutia.  What's wrong with saying if he correctly believes that she's religious and needs accommodation, fine, that's the end of it.  You're in the statute and prove an excuse.  Correct belief can arise in a thousand contexts.  Did he correctly believe that the drug that was being sold, that white powder, was heroin? Did the manager whom you're trying to fire and is saying you did, did he correctly believe that, in fact -- or didn't pay enough for college graduates? Did he correctly believe that this applicant graduated from Princeton? Did he -- that's Abercrombie -- did he correctly believe that -- that he had authority under the -- under the delegation of agency, to sign a check? I mean, look, there are thousands of things. What's -- why is it our job here to say what the right way of proving correct belief is? I mean, I think, we can say it's something wrong.  You don't have to formulate your correct belief just because she told you. I mean, you can argue that one.  That's the only way to prove it and I'm open to that argument, I'd like to hear it. But once we're beyond that, if I'm right that that isn't the only way you can prove correct belief, why do we have to say?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm with you with ""suspect.""

There it is, traceable to the --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  I got you.  Is this right? I've got, I think, your argument.  Your argument is it may sound odd to want a special rule as to when you have belief or so forth, but for administrative reasons, we have to have it.  There are millions of people who are practicing one religion or another where you get a clue of that from their name or maybe their dress or whatever it is.  And whenever we have such a person applying, if she doesn't say anything or he doesn't say anything, and we don't hire them or we don't do it, we're going to get sued.  And we don't want all those lawsuits.  And it isn't that big a burden to say to the person who wants the accommodation, tell us. We get into some administrative rule about how to elicit it from her without that simple rule, tell us, we're going to be in a real administrative rat mess getting sued left right and center.  Have I got the essence of your argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that isn't the end of the world, perhaps.  But you would say, look, we -- we have thousands of managers and -- and goodness knows they're going to get -- start getting resentful and dah, dah, dah, dah.

The reason the judge doesn't say anything is because in Rita we said that if you say nothing, Judge, then the appellate courts are to assume it was reasonable.  And therefore, the judge now says nothing. He just applies the Guideline. So we'd have to overcome about five cases in terms of what we said if we are going to rebut the common sense notion that of course using the wrong Guideline had an effect on the sentence.  If it's an unusual case, i.e. if it's the window washer, let the government show it was the window washer.  But the normal case, pitter-patter means rain, and the normal case is that the judge, when he uses the Guidelines, or even when he uses them as a basis and says I'm departing, that that made a difference.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There will be many.  And there are many cases involving rain.  Many.  I mean, I don't know how many thousands, but there are many common facts in thousands of cases where the government itself uses very similar kinds of evidence in order to show that it was really raining. And here, what we're doing is we're using very similar kinds of evidence, namely, that he used the wrong Guideline in order to show that, in fact, better -- more probable than not, or pretty probable, or whatever reasonable probability, that it made a difference.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Say -- I mean, it's -- I -- I don't see this as special.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The range --   Stephen G. Breyer  We're not changing -- well, you've heard the argument.  But I suspect -- and you -- you may know this empirical point better -- I think there probably are a lot of cases where the issue is the sentence.  And the appeal will be -- include something like this.  In some subset, there will be a plain-error question.  And all you'll really have is what the judge did. Now, of course, if the government has more, all you would be saying is that this, in and of itself, shows a risk in this circumstance, the reasonable probability, whatever standard you're using.  Of course the government's free to show that there is something different about this.  It wasn't harmful.  It might have been the window washer, you know? And the government is free to show that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So why is this so difficult?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you know, you --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you're saying it's a shift in the risk.  The government has the burden of proving that it was raining.  It's not a shift in the risk to say that the evidence that I've mentioned proves rain, and it's not a shift in the risk to say that the defendant can come in and show it was the window washer. The question is whether the burden, which lies with the defendant, is satisfied if all there is is that the judge applied the wrong Guideline. And given the continuous statement in case after case in this Court, that, of course, judges, whether they apply the Guideline or depart, the Guidelines play a significant part in the -- in the sentence that occurs.  If all you have is that, you've satisfied the substantial -- whatever it is, you know. What is it called? The substantial --   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course it matters what it is.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it doesn't say that in Olano.  It says -- it says in Olano --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- in Rule 52(b) --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It says ""a plain error that affects substantial rights."" And if it is the case, factually, as this Court has said it is, that applying the Guideline that you apply makes a difference to the sentence, that does affect substantial rights.  He's just borne the burden of proof by showing that.  That -- I don't see why that's different than any other problem of proof.   Stephen G. Breyer  What you have not put in your brief, I don't think, is that they have, in several circuits, created a system where there is a limited remand for purposes of finding out just what the judge thought about it.  That's not perfect, but it seems to be workable and not quite as expensive. But I think the real difference between us, in -- and you can -- I'm raising this because I haven't seen a reason you shouldn't address it squarely -- is I don't think this is a Rule 52(b) case.  You see? It's not about how to interpret Rule 52(b), or 52(a), or Olano.  It's a case about Guidelines.  It is a case about what the Guidelines are and how they affect a sentence.  And once we work that out, the answer will be obvious, because I'm not going to disagree with your interpretation of Olano or 52.  But I am going to disagree about what you think the effect of failing to apply the right Guideline is in the mine run of cases. And once -- if you agreed with me about that, this case would be over; or if I agreed with you. Between us, we'd end it.  But that -- that's -- so that's -- that -- that's where the -- I mean, the -- the others might have some views, too. (Laughter). But -- but do you see -- do -- do you see -- do you see why I'm -- do you see why I keep pushing you in that direction?   ",14-8913
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  This is a case --   Stephen G. Breyer  That's why I wondered -- I'm not certain how this works -- that I read the statute.  It says, ""The department shall award contracts on the basis of competition restricted to veterans.  If, if, if.  Okay? Well, what wouldn't be awarded according to veterans? I mean, what was surprising to me is that the goal was to have 3 percent awarded to veterans. But if I read this the way you read it, everything will be awarded to veterans.  I mean, maybe not literally, but there are millions of veterans. There are probably hundreds of thousands or millions of veterans' businesses.  So wouldn't everything be awarded to veterans? What wouldn't be?   Stephen G. Breyer  What wouldn't? That's what I want you to address.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How many are there?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It may be 15 percent of businesses, but the question is what does the Department of Veterans Affairs buy? And my guess is they buy lots of stuff.  They buy household stuff, they buy paper towels, they buy buildings, they buy all kinds of things.  And in respect to all the things they buy, if you read this, a contract supplies to everything.  I guess they'll buy it all from veterans.  Now, it's just -- or 90 percent, I don't know.  It's very surprising to me that Congress would have wanted the Veterans Administration to buy everything from veterans. Now -- now, that's -- or nearly everything. Now you explain to me -- I must be missing something -- and -- and you explain to me what I'm missing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, I understand that. I said they have certain qualifications, of course.  Do you think the veterans -- things aren't -- they have reasonable prices.  They -- they have -- they're qualified.  They do a fine job.  Let's say it's surprising that Congress would have wanted nearly everything to be bought from veterans, that's all.  And where am I wrong?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not saying they can't perform.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I want you to address what you're calling this natural cap.  You're saying to me you're wrong, it doesn't mean everything, it means like 10 percent.  Is that what you're saying? Or what -- what are you saying? Explain what it is.  I read it.  I thought it's everything.  Now you explain why it isn't everything or nearly everything.  I mean, if you're not a veteran, Congress wouldn't normally say you don't get a leg up, but to shut you out entirely? I mean, that's -- that's just my problem that I want you to explain.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Are you saying Congress want -- just wanted everything that veterans can supply to be supplied by veterans? And if I say, is that everything, it's not 90 -- it's not a hundred percent, probably not 99 percent, but it might be 80 percent.  I mean, I'm guessing.  You tell me.  You're the expert. What percent is it when you win?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I see many good things. People would enlist in the Armed Forces.  They would have careers assured after.  It still surprises me, but my question is not really aimed at you.  It's aimed at the other side, and you would have a chance to answer this question. I can understand.  I accept your argument, pretty much.  I don't know why there would be any exception to the SS -- the FSS, or whatever it's called. But I was rather stopped by the lower court's argument which they have given up, which is that right in the statute, not in a preference, but right in the statute it says, ""For purposes of meeting the goals,"" under Section A.  That, I understand. And then what you do is you'd have goals; they should be tough goals, and -- and if you're way ahead of the goals, then maybe you don't have to do it. That was their argument.  The government's given that up. So -- so I don't know what to do.  I mean, I'm going to ask them for help --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- and then -- the same --   ",14-916X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is this the case? Do I understand this? Am I -- there are three parts to this. Question one in my mind, is it the case that they lose because the agency does not have to apply veterans only where they way exceeded their goal? The answer to that in the opinion would say, we do not reach that question for there are no regulations that suggest that the agency has tried to take that approach.  Am I right so far?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Then we reach question two, left one open. Question 2 is do they have to choose the Rule of Two in the FSS? And there are two parts to that.  The first part is suppose two veterans qualified are already on the FSS list.  And there we might say, yes, you do in respect to them.  Or we might say, no, you don't.  But if we say yes, you do, at least we don't, in your opinion, wreck the system.  All right. Then we get to Step 3.  There is no veteran on the FSS.  Now what do we do? And there your argument is that, look, everyone on the FSS is a person who has entered into a contract, which contract says that when called upon for further supply, they will give it.  Am I right?   Stephen G. Breyer  So, therefore, it is that contract, not the contract within the contract that they're talking about.  And were we to say the contrary, we would have to take an architect who has 40,000 pages of things he's going to do, and we change the sentence on page 389 to read 300 rather than 400, and we say that's a new contract, or something like that.  I'm trying to make an argument for you.  It's not a contract within a contract, it is contract to which this refer. Am I way off base or is that what you're trying to say?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And don't just say it is because you think I'd agree with it, please. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Well, if it isn't that, look, these people on the FSS list have already entered into a contract, this is just implementing the contract that they've already entered into.  If you're not saying that, then how in heaven's name do you get out of his argument?   INTERRUPTING ",14-916X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but here we have -- I want to go back to Justice Kagan's question.  And this is something that -- it seems everyone is arguing this is as if this is an equal protection problem.  And certainly, the -- Reynolds v. Sims does deal with equal protection.  And it did deal with instances in which voters and everything else were malapportioned.  So I don't think the court really considered this. But if you step back from the Equal Protection Clause and say there are other parts of the Constitution that, in fact, are relevant here -- maybe it's the Republican Form of Government Clause.  But the words that Justice Kagan read are words about what kind of democracy people wanted.  And those words say if you look to other parts of the Constitution, such as those, or Republican Form of Government, that what we actually want is the kind of democracy where people, whether they choose to vote or whether they don't choose to vote, are going to receive a proportionate representation in Congress. And if you take that as a constitutional principle, that shows an objective of some of the clauses of the Constitution.  Then you have to retreat from the idea that the Equal Protection Clause, as interpreted in Reynolds v. Sims, solves this case.  And indeed, it argues against you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not making it.  I'm making -- I'm pointing at her -- she didn't quote the Guarantee Clause.  Maybe I shouldn't have thrown that in.  But it's the same point.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose Texas said here, we want children to be represented? That's all.  Children. See, they're not voters.  So suppose -- if we take children out of it, what's the deviation?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm just thinking that I'd like to know, before knowing whether this is mandatory or not, your position.  I'd like to know an awful lot more than I know about who these people are who are being represented on the representational theory, and who are not being represented on the voter theory.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now I don't know who they are from the briefs; and therefore, it's pretty tough for me to -- to tell.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Illegal immigrants.   INTERRUPTING ",14-940X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What we have -- and that's why I think Justice Alito's question is important -- is a table on page 9 of the Blue Brief. Now, just looking at that table, by inspection, I don't know whether the true -- whether this is true or false.  So I thought the major difference between the two here is probably that some areas of -- of the State -- there are a lot of people who are working and they have children.  I mean, it can't all be explained on the basis of illegal immigration or something.  It just can't be, given those numbers.  I don't think so. And if we accept the principle that it's voter equality, we are saying that the family of two of certain age that has eight children or whatever is getting no representation for those other people or human beings.  And if we accept the opposite, we have to put up with inequality of -- of power of voters.  You have to -- you have to say the one or the other.  And you could take your position it's up to the State. But I mean, that seems to me to be what's actually behind the numbers that he's -- that -- that are being quoted, but I'm not sure.  So I'd like your reaction.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That sounds an awful lot what they had in 1750 or something, where the British Parliament said, well, don't worry, America, you're represented by the people in England because after all, they represent everybody in the British Empire.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, that people are being represented through somebody else is a little -- possible, but tough.   ",14-940X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer   That's right.  I may be missing something, although this is quite a simple case.  A policeman makes an unreasonable stop and an unreasonable search, thereby violating the Fourth Amendment.  Now, you can sue him, assuming you overcome other hurdles. Now he takes you off and puts you in prison, either with a magistrate or without a magistrate, and you are therefore being unreasonably detained.  It's an unreasonable search/seizure pursuant to the Fourth Amendment; therefore, it's a violation. Then you have a trial, and using the same rotten evidence, you are convicted.  There you don't, though you could.  But the reason that you don't is because you are viewed as, by the law so far, being in jail now as a result of your conviction.  And the reason, I guess, is practical.  We don't want to look into all those convictions and their different standards.  Now, that's the -- the framework in my mind. Is it right?   Ilana Eisenstein   Absolutely, Your That is exactly the framework that the government puts forward, that it's not just the mere fact of being held in jail, but that the constitutional right depends on what process was infringed.   ",14-9496
0,"Stephen G. Breyer   I didn't think that was difficult question.  I thought that everyone agrees that if a policeman wrongly arrests you -- you know, maliciously arrests you, et cetera -- and there you are in his custody and he brings you over to the jail, puts you in jail, up until the point you see the magistrate, you have a claim for false arrest.   Stephen G. Breyer   And we said that that for false arrest is a constitutional claim.   Stephen G. Breyer   It violates the Amendment.  What time limit applies?  The false arrest time limit, because that's the most analogous.   Stephen G. Breyer   Then we get into the stage.  Now you're in front of a magistrate, and the magistrate says, stay in jail for two more months.  Does that violate the Fourth Amendment?  Not malicious prosecution.  Does it violate the Fourth Amendment? The reason that we tend to think it does is because all the circuits have said it does; that is, Judge Higginbotham said that in the Fifth Circuit.  A lot of the circuits picked that up.  I'm not saying every one.  But they said that, too, violates the Fourth Amendment.  Now we have a problem. What statute of limitations do we use for that one?  And there, the circuits seemed to have picked malicious prosecution not because they're going to follow every element, but because it's the State law that provides the closest analogy. And that seems to me where we are in this case.  You don't have to go much further than that. Am I right so far?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer   So you will accept -- will you accept for purposes of this argument that once this individual is brought by the policeman to jail and they go before a magistrate, and the magistrate using the same bad evidence says, stay here in jail for several -- for a while -- for a week, anyway, until we get to trial, that that period is a violation of the Fourth Amendment, assuming that they were all lying, et cetera.   Stephen G. Breyer   Yes.  Then the Do we use the malicious prosecution as an analogy, not all the elements?  And so now the question, great, this is fabulous, I get to the narrower question I have, why isn't it a good analogy?   Stephen G. Breyer   Why not? Look, the person is being held because the magistrate listening to the policeman detained him, and the magistrate and everybody was very unreasonable, da, da, da.  Okay?  Now he's there. Day one.  Can you bring a case?  Yes.  Why not? He's been under -- day two.  Yes.  And he's been held for 90 days.  And I can say the same thing, but I won't, up to each of the 90 days.  90th day, he's released.  It's now the 91st day.  Can he bring it? Yes.  But now we only have two years.  Why only two years?  Because we're looking for an analogous statute of the State to give us a -- a limit, and the analogous one, though not perfectly fitting, is malicious prosecution, and that had two years, and that's why. Two years after the release date is the longest.  You had better bring it before then, because that's two years since you were unlawfully held. Now, what's wrong with what I just said?   Stephen G. Breyer   What's your -- what's best one?  What's the best analogy?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer   What is your opinion? is the State law that does apply the best analogy?   Stephen G. Breyer   False arrest. So now, what is this -- what is the -- what is the statute of limitations for false arrest?   Stephen G. Breyer   Okay.  Fine. being detained for up to, let's say, the 90th -- 90th day.  He's still being detained.  So now we'll count the 90th day as the beginning of the two-year running.  And so now we run it for two years, and it's still May 12th or whatever.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer   Why not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer   Isn't he being held? isn't he being held unlawfully on the 41st day?  And after all, we're not -- we're not copying the State law. All we're doing is trying to find an analogous period of time.   ",14-9496
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Seven year -- sorry.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  Because the -- the necessity is not the necessity you're talking about. It's the -- as I read it.  I mean, you use words like ""critical mass"" and so forth.  It sounds like a cloud of sort of you don't know what they're talking, but as I read further into it, it becomes quite specific, that is, 75 percent of the students are at this university because they were in the top 10 percent of their class. And it doesn't take long before students and faculty in particular situations know who is who.  25 percent of the students in that class are admitted; they're good students, not in the top 10 percent on the basis of leadership, activities, awards, work experience, community service, family's economic status, school status, family responsibilities, single-parent home, languages other than English spoken at home, SAT score relative to school's average, and race occasionally, too. Okay? We're talking about that 25 percent.  And it won't take long before students in a class see that in that 25 percent, which means you aren't just in the top 10 percent of your class, in that 25 percent there is hardly anybody who is African-American or Hispanic.  And the -- and seven years of experience with that kind of thing led the faculty at meetings, administrators, and others to say, we should do more to see that that 25 percent has occasionally somebody who is a minority.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what their program is.  It isn't something like critical mass, et cetera. And -- and -- and if you have to say, it seems to me, why is that not a diversity-related judgment of what is necessary?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Every school is like that. Every school in the country that's a college that I've ever experienced is a combination of grades, class position, and a lot of other things.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So I'm talking about people who aren't admitted; 75 percent are, solely on the basis of class ranking.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, but that's exactly the question, I think.  I would -- I can put the same question -- or suppose we do send it back to the district court and, put in more evidence, we tell them. Suppose we did that.  And suppose they start with the basic plan where we want to use race is in the 25 percent of the holistic area.  We want to do that. Now, there -- you've seen the chart -- and I've seen the chart -- of the factors that are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.  You know, you've seen that chart.  I've seen the chart.  And at the bottom of the chart in my list is the word ""race."" It says ""race,"" r-a-c-e. Okay? What kind of evidence, in your opinion, could they or anyone else with any roughly similar plan put in that would show, in your view, that this is constitutional?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So we have one. But I'm looking --   Stephen G. Breyer  I have one.  I have one.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What you're saying is you should look at the two folders, and as a kind of tiebreaker, use race.  That, to you, is okay. Now, is there -- you said there is several others? It would be helpful if you -- if you can summarize them in a sentence, so I get an idea of what the others are.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's not to use race. I'm saying r-a-c-e, race.  I want to know which are the things they could do that, in your view, would be okay. Because I'm really trying to find out.  Not fatal in fact, we've said.  Okay? Not fatal in fact.  Fine.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  We know that -- can you -- can you say this? Let me read you two phrases from Fisher I.  The first phrase says this: ""The decision to pursue"" -- and Fisher I, obviously, put together a Court of people who don't agree necessarily on affirmative action.  Generally we agreed on those words. Words 1: ""The decision to pursue the educational benefits that flow from student diversity is, in substantial measure, an academic judgment to which some, but not complete, judicial deference is proper."" Okay? Now, words No. 2: The University must provide a, quote, ""reasoned, principled explanation for the academic decision to pursue diversity."" Your plan is pursuing diversity among the 25 percent who are not admitted under the Top 10 Plan. Your principled, reasoned explanation for that academic decision is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's right.  But there's --   Stephen G. Breyer  Just before, you -- you said -- I agreed with you, of course, that is what the Court said, the reasoned explanation.  And it also said that this is a matter to which this Court will give some, but not complete, deference to what the University decides.  What you're talking about is the need for the program. In addition to that -- and this is what I'd like you to focus on, because there could be a question of whether to send it back for more evidence or not.  So in looking through the record so far, on this specific point, I found an affidavit by a person named Walker, and that person named Walker described seven years of efforts to measure this stuff; described meetings of the faculties; described all kinds of discussions; described conclusions of the faculty members, and the admissions officers, and others, that you did need -- you did need affirmative action in the 25 percent of the not -- of -- of the holistic part. Now, given that that's there, and I found nothing to the contrary, is there a need for another -- I mean, this is a loaded question, but I am curious. If you say ""yes,"" because -- I mean, you know, there may be something that you should put in as well.  You may think it would help to put something in.  You may think it's not necessary.

Breyer  I -- as far -- as far as I understand it, his strongest argument on the other side would roughly go -- he didn't put it this way -- like this: On your side is the fact, well, why wouldn't a three-judge court decide a very important question of law in this area? On the other side of it is that, well, you just have left, in three-judge courts primarily, almost exclusively, reapportionment issues, which are specially political. And to put these all, you know, they are very -- because of the opinions you point out in Vieth, there's a huge variation of all kinds of different legal claims that might be made.  And if there is a set of cases where this Court should be careful as to when and how and which it enters in which order, i.e., discretion, if we accept your view, that set of cases where we should be particularly careful as to how we proceed will be the set of cases where we have no choice and we have to take immediately whatever variations on the theme of disproportionate gerrymandering, da da da, whatever order they happen to arise and whenever they happen to arise, because we have no choice.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, they -- they want to raise about as important a question as you can imagine. They want to say, reading Vieth, that the State legislators are forbidden to draw district boundaries the way that has been done here.  I take it that's their basic claim.  And if they are right, that would affect congressional districts and legislative districts throughout the nation. So what reason could Congress have had for saying, although we want three-judge courts to decide these kind of cases generally, where the single-most important issue that could possibly be raised -- I exaggerate only slightly -- is raised, that kind of issue is for a single judge?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Bailey is -- I mean, Bailey was the mirror-image case.  I mean, it was a case where some African-American plaintiffs were saying they have a constitutional right to travel without discrimination in interstate commerce, as I read it.  And they convened a three-judge court because they wanted to set aside Mississippi law to the contrary, in 1961.  And the court said, but it's absolutely clear that a statute that requires segregation is unconstitutional.  So this shouldn't have even been heard by a three-judge court because there has to be some kind of an issue.  And the words it uses are it doesn't require a three-judge court when the claim that a statute is unconstitutional is wholly insubstantial.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He's speaking nonexistent. And they said it's nonexistent because it's clear what the Federal law was.  I mean, that was the nature. So -- so I don't see how that helps you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's true, but I mean, they put down a standard as to whether or not a three-judge court is necessary.  And they say a three-judge court is not necessary when the reason for giving the three-judge court -- you know, if it's -- if it's insubstantial.  In that case you have to have a three-judge court, I guess, when there's some constitutional issue.  They said there is no constitutional issue, not because it was frivolous or from Mars, but for the opposite reason: The law was clear.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

I'll have an easier time if you can explain it. What the decree says is 50 percent of the retirement goes to the husband and 50 percent to the wife.  It doesn't say what the retirement is. Suppose that -- that ten years later, government raises the retirement.  Does the wife get more?   Ilana Eisenstein  So, your Honor, I believe, under your Honor's hypothetical, the answer is yes, but --   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Yes.  Yes.   Ilana Eisenstein  Yes, but it is up to a State court to determine --   Stephen G. Breyer  State court says yes. Okay.   Ilana Eisenstein  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  Now, second thing is, unfortunately, Congress lowers the amount.  Does the half go down to the wife too?   Ilana Eisenstein  So, once again, under -- it depends on State law. So --   Stephen G. Breyer  It depends on State law. In other words -- in other words, if you say that 50 percent goes to the wife, 50 percent goes to the husband, and you cut it, then more than 50 percent will go to the wife.   Ilana Eisenstein  That's right, because -- so let me be clear of what we think the role of the Spousal Protection Act is. The Spousal Protection Act instructs State courts how to calculate the disposable retired pay available for division, and otherwise puts disposable retired pay on equal footing at any other civilian asset so that it allows the State court to treat the disposable retirement pay as any other marital property in a variety of ways. One is it can equitably divide those assets in any way it sees fit, from zero to one hundred percent.   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose the statute, it said, following Mansell, that the wife cannot have more than 50 percent of the actual after tax income from retirement.  Then can the State do it?   Ilana Eisenstein  The after tax income from retirement.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Ilana Eisenstein  Well, I think that the state could do, in terms of a remedy, is all they could divide is the --   Stephen G. Breyer  I'll tell you what. There's a statute, a federal statute, says if taxes go up, or if the payments are reduced for retirement, under no circumstances can the wife obtain more than the reduced -- half the reduced payment.   Ilana Eisenstein  Right.  So if they could --   Stephen G. Breyer  And then can the State court do something about that?   Ilana Eisenstein  It couldn't if it limited it to any other sources of income.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not keeping that out of it.   Ilana Eisenstein  Right.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm saying can the State just say, well, we don't care.  There is a state statute which says that we have to keep the wife's share at no more than 50 percent.  But let's forget about that. There's a federal statute to that effect.  We'll have our State law.  Can't do that, can it?   Ilana Eisenstein  If I understand your Honor's question, which is that there's only military retirement pay, and the question is can the wife get more than 50 percent share of it --   Stephen G. Breyer  In a state statute that says no.   Ilana Eisenstein  The answer is no.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   Ilana Eisenstein  And that would be --   Stephen G. Breyer  So if that says no, then why, if it goes down because of the choice of the husband, who is protected in this choice by the exception, why is that different.   Ilana Eisenstein  It's different because there are other assets besides the military -- the disability benefits used to satisfy the indemnification order in this case, and so there's a very --   Stephen G. Breyer  Is that the only difference?   Ilana Eisenstein  I think that's a significant difference.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  That's the only difference.  So in other words, if it says, no, you cannot give the wife more than 50 percent of the pension, then what they could do is have the decree, and it says the wife gets 50 percent, gets -- sorry -- you can't -- you cannot give them more than 50 percent -- I'm getting mixed up in my thing. It says you can't give more than 50 percent, and then there's a statute says you can't give -- you can't give 60 percent, but the judge says, here's what I'll do: I'll give you 50 percent from this, and I'd like to give you more than 60 percent so I'm going to take 10 percent from something else.   Ilana Eisenstein  Well, I think that the economic equivalent is not the only test, and that's the test that Petitioner wants this court to adopt.  I think this Court needs to look at the legal basis for the award. And as the discussion highlighted earlier, there are many economically equivalent ways that a court can reach the same division of property and total financial transfer from one party to the other, some of which are legal under this federal law and some of which are not.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose it turns out that in time one, we enter a divorce decree.  The divorce decree says and in addition, you're going to get half of what Uncle Joe gives Sam, the husband.  By that time, it turns out to be -- I mean, from the beginning, Uncle Joe leaves property in a form that it's illegal to give to the woman.  I can imagine cases. I mean, can the State give money that later on it turns out that it was absolutely illegal to give that person that money? I don't know how that works.  I would be very surprised if res judicata in divorce cases says: Okay, I'm sorry, we have a decree here, and then we're going to violate Federal law because the decree violates Federal law, as it turns out.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe it's too complicated.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm saying there's a Federal law here, and the Federal law says: I'm very sorry, you cannot give this money to the spouse, for good reason or bad, perhaps bad.  But it says you can't. And is the fact that you gave that money to the spouse ahead of time, why does that matter? That's his argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, there is.   Stephen G. Breyer  There is a disability.  The disability is that if it turns out that what you are giving over time is money that was turned in to get the disability, it is illegal for you to do it.  Now, that's what's there at the time of the decree.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  That's not what it says in the statute.  It says in the statute that it is illegal to treat disposable retired pay as property of the member and his spouse.  That is what is now legal. That's legal; right? With an exception. The exception is the result of a waiver of retired pay.  That, you can't do.  So you can't do it on day 1; you can't do it day 20; you can't do it day 30. And what they are saying is a well-known property interest.  It is an interest that you do not get till day 40.  But you can't divide it on day 1.  Just like it's a -- like, you know, they're used to be these property interests that you received on a contingency.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true.  So it's given to her, but it's subject under Federal law to a contingency.  We used to have our first-year property class filled with this kind of stuff.  I mean, you know, somebody would get a horse, but he'd only get the horse on the contingency that Uncle Joe died, which doesn't happen for 30 years.  But, nonetheless, say something that happens to that property subject to the contingency on day 1.  That's what this sounds like to me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's fine.

And -- and they said that the employee -- did they hold -- end up holding that the employee could not bring the suit?   Stephen G. Breyer  The employee could not bring the suit.  And one of the reasons is because the Bivens action, which that was, is excepted from the Westfall Act, or is excepted -- there's an exception from the -- there's a preface of some kind.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why would it have had to come out the other way? If the Act didn't apply, if the whole thing didn't apply, if the Chapter didn't apply, if the FTCA didn't apply, including the exceptions from the FTCA, then how could the employee have -- why would it have come out the other way?

Breyer  -- but by the time you get through these statutes -- okay.  I read it.  I'll read it several times.  I will absolutely take it in. Suppose I come to the conclusion that Smith, like so many of our cases, deals with a certain number of issues, and maybe there were alternative grounds and we didn't get to them, and I conclude that Smith, in fact, is not a bar to the argument that the other side is making.  On that assumption --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- is the case over, and they win?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I understand you think Smith is the end of it, and all I am saying is one of the things I'm paid to do it is read those cases, and then I have to reach a conclusion of whether Smith is the end of it.  If it's the end of it, you win.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, if it's not the end of it, do you lose?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  This is the language that's sort of hanging me up.  ""The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to cases that are based on the exercise of performance of the failure to exercise and perform a discretionary function."" ""Shall not apply to."" Okay. Looks pretty good for you. But over here it says, ""The judgment bar shall constitute a complete bar."" That's very good for you, but just said it didn't apply.  It says this -- this chapter does not apply.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's in the chapter.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why is that bad? So -- I mean, look, as I read it simply, if I can, you look at the top of 2680, ""The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to."" And then we have a long list.  One of them is an action rising a claim based on a foreign country. So I bring a lawsuit.  I was hurt in Mexico. This says the FTCA doesn't apply.  And so you say, you know, if it doesn't apply, that means the definitions don't apply.  So I say fine.  It doesn't apply.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if I say -- you say the Rules of Civil Procedure don't apply.  Fine.  Nothing applies.   Stephen G. Breyer  You don't have an action.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What about --   Stephen G. Breyer  I can see that, but -- that is, imagine a plaintiff and the plaintiff brings a lawsuit against the Post Office for negligence.  The government's defense is that this is a discretionary function, a particular thing.  And the plaintiff says, you're right, it's a discretionary function.  And now it's dismissed.  All right. Now, if that last thing he read doesn't apply because it was discretionary function and fell within 2680, they then could see the Post Office on the basis that the Post Office has independent authority to sue or be sued.  And it's hard to believe, he says, that Congress somehow, when they passed these words, ""does not apply"", suddenly wanted to revive all kinds of suits against, for example, the Post Office, which otherwise would have been barred by that last provision that he read.   Stephen G. Breyer  So we don't have to worry about the Post Office, the example that he gave.  But there may be others.  Sue and be sued is a fairly -- I mean, do we know what we're talking about? I like to try to know what I'm talking about.  And do we know here what the reach of exempting that last provision from -- just erasing it in a discretionary action suit will be?   Stephen G. Breyer  So -- so you're -- can I -- are you saying this, in essence? Even if there are other provisions that aren't erased, even if there aren't, this particular erasure means that in an action that is dismissed -- an action against the government -- for the reasons listed in those exceptions -- for example, a foreign country, a discretionary exception -- in such an action, you can sue the employee where ordinary principals of res judicata wouldn't bar you from suing the employee after all.  It's a different party.   Stephen G.

You could have a dry cleaner or you could have a magazine that writes about successes in integration and wants to write about this community before it got wrecked or whatever. Clause could be absolutely clear. Absolutely clear.  15 Bishops testify was totally causal-related.  I mean, do they all have suits?   Curtis E. Gannon  Well, if not -- I -- I think that what we are saying --   Stephen G. Breyer  And you heard -- you heard what the question was -- the question before and it still is -- if we get into it -- we may not need to, but if we did -- it would be somebody in Alaska who writes magazine articles about successes in integration is going to be wrecked because they don't have the integration.  And it's a prime example, absolutely clear, of the causal connection.  Can he bring this lawsuit? I mean --   Curtis E. Gannon  And I -- we -- we think -- no. We think that -- we think that that is further afield, and we think that --   Stephen G. Breyer  You think it's further afield --   Curtis E. Gannon  Yes.  And the --   Stephen G.

Otherwise, it wouldn't be doing anything different from traceability analysis under Article III. And here we think that the reason why this is sufficiently closely connected to the conduct that the statute prohibits is that this statute prohibits discriminatory housing practices, and those practices include things like the terms and conditions of the sale of rental property; things about the real estate-related transactions; things like block busting, which was specifically prohibited by 3604(e)  And block busting was a practice by which somebody would go into a neighborhood and induce artificially low-priced panic selling by saying there are minorities coming into this neighborhood.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The argument the other side, which I think is the more difficult part, I absolutely see your point.  In both instances, whether you or the other side wins, we're talking about something that happened where there's a lawsuit in the United States and there was a restriction that the patentee imposed.  He said anyone who buys my widget cannot resell it to Smith or Jones.  Or anyone who buys my widget, if they resell it, has to put a big red sign on it, some kind of restriction.  If somebody fails to do that, so they sue likely in the United States, but in any case, they're suing under American law; right? Either way.   Stephen G. Breyer  Either way, they're suing under American law and this person has violated the patent or he hasn't violated the American patent. And when we start talking abroad, you are quite right, I think, that Lord Coke and his great principle of no alienation on chattels is being laughed at.  All right.  That's your argument.  But on the other side, they have just received money for that first sale under, let's say, a German patent, and they have not received any money on this American patent.  So they say, well, how could you be subjecting us to a rule that that first sale exhausted our right to money under the American patent when we never received any money under the American patent? Now -- so there's one thing one way and there's one important thing the other way.  So how do you react?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All sales were authorized. In the one sale, it was sold in Bavaria under a German patent.  And not only was it authorized by the American, but he said, I love it.  And so what I want to you do is whenever you use it, you put a big red sign with my name on it.  All right? There's a condition.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  I'm saying do sales under foreign laws in foreign countries -- that's the question -- once there has been such a sale, does the patentee still have the right under his American patent to restrict the use of that widget, that particular widget, bought by the buyer in Bavaria.   Stephen G. Breyer  I know your submission is no.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I'm just trying to get your answer to their argument --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- in saying whatever you think of the U.S., there's a big difference here.  They haven't gotten any money back on their --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about Justice Kennedy's question? I mean, Lord Coke had that very question in mind, I think, that -- that one of the problems with restraints in alienation of chattel is that the buyer may not know, and -- and moreover, it stops competition among buyers.  Those are the basic two things that have led that as a kind of underlying principle.  Well, what about it?   Malcolm L. Stewart  Well, he have --   Stephen G. Breyer  Does he have to put a sticker on every toy? Does he have to put a sticker -- how? How does it work?   Malcolm L. Stewart  Again, as -- as I say, if what we're talking about is a sticker that warns -- if the product is sold in Germany and the patentee wants to warn consumers in Germany they can only use the product in the following way, he can put the sticker on.  And whether it's enforceable, and if so, by what means is a matter of --   Stephen G. Breyer  So in other words, the answer is yes.  Every widget has to have a sticker.   Malcolm L. Stewart  No.  The answer is, as a matter of U.S. law, the legality of the import -- the original act of importation will be governed, on our view, by whether the patentee has explicitly reserved its right to -- with the --   Stephen G. Breyer  You mean you don't have to -- I didn't understand.  Where does he reserve this right? It's a right that he wants to enforce against Joe Smith, the consumer, who bought from a German grocery store 14 patented bouncing fountain pens.  Okay? Now, that's who he wants to enforce it against.  That person comes back from Germany into the United States, and that person says, I do not know what you're talking about.  You say, don't worry, there had to be an express reservation.  So the question I thought was, where? Is it a sticker or not?   Malcolm L. Stewart  Typically, I think it -- it would be an express reservation in the sense of a ban on importation.  And so the express reservation would be communicated to the buyer.  You could additionally require that --   Stephen G. Breyer  Where and how would it be communicated to the buyer?   Malcolm L. Stewart  Well, the -- the initial buyer from the U.S. patentee would enter into a contract with the U.S. patentee, and presumably --   Stephen G. Breyer  And that -- and you agree you're for that, but that is very much contrary to what 300 years of restraints on alienation had in mind. One of the problems was that people who buy these things, namely, those who go into grocery store or whatever, don't know that they can't bring it back to the U.S., or they don't know that they can't do this or they can't do that or have to have the red sign or whatever.  And you don't have an answer to that, I take it.   Malcolm L. Stewart  Well, if you wanted -- first, at a certain level, anyone who buys patented products takes the chance that the person who sold those to him has no authority to do so or has transgressed the limits of his authority.  And so, if the patentee's buyer, the direct purchaser was told no importation, and that business in Germany then conveyed the goods to a consumer and failed to pass along to the consumer the restriction on importation, then that's not different in kind from the chance that the -- the consumers take regularly that there is something wrong with the chain of patent title that the initial authorization was not good.   ",15-1189
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why can't you enforce the contract downstream?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then why don't you require the person who sells it to just resell it with the requirement that they promise not to, you know, whatever it is?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Sure.  And one of the reasons that it's hard to get away with that is the antitrust laws in the contract area.  And another reason is because Lord Coke said 300 years ago, you know, it's -- you get into a lot of trouble when you start trying to restrict this buyer who's got the widget and he would like to use it as he wishes.  Now, that's been the kind of basic legal principle for an awfully long time.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  This is the reserved question.  I see your point there.  If you want to continue to make it for others, go ahead.  Go ahead. Finish, because I -- I think I interrupted you.   Stephen G. Breyer  There -- there -- there are quite -- I mean, I agree that there are all kinds of exceptions. But to go back to your basic point underlying this, of course, any monopolist, including a patent monopolist, would love to be able to go to each buyer separately and extract from each buyer and user the maximum amount he would pay for that particular item.  Dentists would pay more for gold perhaps than someone who wants to use gold for some other thing. Okay? They'd like that.  But by and large, that's forbidden under many laws, even though it does mean slightly restricted output, and it also means a lower profit for the monopolist. All right.  Now, it's against that background that I think the law and economics professors, who are telling what is correct, that -- and the argument that you're making has to be evaluated. That's what I think on the first part.  All this precedent is very hard for you to get around.  And I'm not talking about just Lord Coke; I'm talking about the Supreme Court precedent.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, there's a -- there a -- Nike, two things.  When they say well, people have authorized dealers, and anyone who's in business knows you want to be safe, buy it from an authorized dealer. That isn't a big problem. On the other hand, if you are a consumer enured to do, it isn't -- I don't think I followed quite what you're saying.  If there is a first sale rule, no -- you know, first sale, no problem.  The only problem is you bought it from a guy who didn't have a patent in the first place.  So go buy it from GE, or buy it from Amazon, or buy it from somebody you know, you trust, and that's the end of that. But if there is no first-sale rule, there we are, got to have the red sign, got to have -- can't sell it here, can't sell it there, can't sell it some other place.

We also have a treaty that says there will be a line down the middle of the culvert, but the culvert will be maintained by Mexico and the United States jointly.  And there are many documents, including the Treaty of Hidalgo -- you know, that famous treaty which I'm drawing a blank on, but --   Stephen G. Breyer  Hidalgo, yes.  Right.  It's referring to the river as the border. So it has not taken place in a foreign country.  It's taking place on territory that jurisdictionally, of course, is Mexico's, but which is a special kind of -- you -- you started talking about the curtilage.  Is there any other word?

Now, if I want to say, this is a special kind of physical place, what words do I use?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We are responsible for maintaining it, not by ourselves, but with Mexico and the reason we are maintaining it is because at one time the whole river and now the line down the center are the boundary, and we don't want the river to jump its banks and create new boundaries.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  If Boumediene had control, who controlled the base? And here we know that this culvert, at least as far as paving it, keeping it up, spending many millions of dollars, seeing that trade, if it ever is filled with water, goes across and ships are free, et cetera, is a joint effort of Mexico and the United States.  So this is not just like a fence.  It is an area of two fences, and between those two areas is joint exercise of border maintenance authority. So I guess it's like nothing I've seen before.  But if it's like nothing I've seen before, what's the problem with taking Justice Ginsburg's approach and applying it to that kind of area where, I might add, 500,000 people walk across it every day and it's a fair inference that -- perhaps that American citizens, adolescents, play in the culvert, too.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We'd have to take as a fact here that the children were playing.  A jury could find to the contrary, but we have to take that as a fact.   Stephen G. Breyer  We know from Boumediene that the word ""sovereign,"" and even the legal concept of sovereign, which in Boumediene belonged to Cuba, is not necessarily the line that distinguishes where the Fourth Amendment does or does not apply.

And here, the control is significantly diminished compared with the base at Guantanamo.  Absolutely correct.  But the point is -- there are other factors which we've heard for half an hour at least, you know, here that, no, suggests maybe the Fourth Amendment should apply.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We do two things.  We do at least have a commission that draws the boundary and with Mexico also repairs the culvert.  And that's expensive. So we do two things with Mexico there.  And the fences are on either side of the culvert.  And it is a border.  And all -- and those things, taken together, either are or are not enough to apply the Fourth Amendment.  That's why I say add Justice Ginsburg's point and add the fact that Mexico would like the Fourth Amendment applied.   Stephen G. Breyer  No --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It would be -- it would be -- and that's why we use their analogy.  It would apply when the action that violates the amendment takes place in the United States and where the victim is at the border.  And ""at the border"" is defined as including those areas that are jointly administered as part of a border set forth in the treaty, where administration means spending significant amounts of money on the upkeep of those border positions; where, if you want some additional limitation, where both American children and Mexican children might play. And why do we do that? Because without such a rule, the people of the United States who might play there, too, are not secure in -- from unreasonable seizures such as this one. I mean, I made that up. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  But he has quite persuasive analogies in the law with curtilages, cannon shots, joint administration, and the purposes of the Fourth Amendment, which is to protect the people, we can say maybe American and maybe beyond, from unreasonable searches.  Okay? There is a set of arguments. Limitation, absolute limitation.  No worry about drones. Flows directly from Boumediene and carries out the purposes of the Fourth Amendment. Now, that's a whole long argument.  What do you want to say?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why -- why -- why do you use words like ""create,"" ""extend,"" et cetera, ""fashion,"" if, in fact, a Federal policeman, a Federal agent violates the Fourth Amendment and seizes someone unreasonably in Alaska, does the victim have a Bivens remedy?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Of course.  Now, if he does it in Puerto Rico, does the victim have a Bivens remedy? I'll tell you by making this up, but there never has been a Bivens action in Puerto Rico.  It's the first one. Does he have a Bivens action?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, let's see where I've gotten -- I'm trying to go somewhere with the question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why creating? I would have thought if you want to say in there --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Wait.  Extending.  You see, there those words assume the answer to the question. I can absolutely see you're saying that if this Court fashions a civil remedy for a violation of the Third Amendment or the Second Amendment, you would be extending Bivens, but I thought Bivens made absolutely clear that where a Federal agent hurts someone by violating the Fourth Amendment, there is a Bivens action.  Now we have an exception.  And the exception is the military. So I think you can look at this either way. But I think the -- the more -- I would tend to look at it as saying, of course there is a Bivens remedy if there is a Fourth Amendment violation unless you're in the military, which no one says this is true. So that's how I've been thinking about the Bivens action.  I've been thinking the answer to that question turns on the answer to the Fourth Amendment question. Now you can tell me why it's better to use the words you've been using.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, yes.  In, like, Puerto Rico?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's Eighth versus Fourth.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm saying that's Fourth in Puerto Rico.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If it -- but that's the point.  If, in fact, all that mattered were the existence of a well-recognized boundary line, this case is over.  You win. But that well-recognized boundary line was present in Boumediene, and certainly Boumediene suggests, while it is a factor, it is not the only factor that determines the reach of the Fourth Amendment.  So there -- there we are.  We're in court, because it is not the only factor. And now you add in all the stuff about the culvert and who's playing there and who might be playing there, and the 500,000 people who cross every day, and the joint maintenance of the culvert, and the fact that all this conduct happened in the United States, that's what your opponent brother over there is trying to do.   ",15-118X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  There's a lot of complicated things, but the question I think is, think of the child.  The child is born out of wedlock.  Now, if his mother was an American, he becomes an American if she's lived here for one year.  If it's his father who's an American, she becomes an American only if he's lived here for like eight years or ten years.  Now, that's the difference, and why does that make a difference? What justifies the gender discrimination?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Two -- two wrongs don't make a right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Perhaps.  Yeah, yeah, I accept that no one is challenging, but I'm not asking that question. I'm asking the question of what it is -- I would repeat the question, which you heard, which I think is the equal protection question at the heart of the case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the answer that you give in your brief was some endlessly -- I mean, it was very well-written and brilliant -- (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  -- and -- and -- but it went into this thing about statelessness persons, and -- and then we have, like, 17 briefs that say, no, no, that wasn't what the situation was with statelessness persons.  And so I guess the question would be there: Was it enough of a statelessness person justification to warrant this gender discrimination? There is no point in you repeating that.  I think I've taken in that argument.  I'll have to make up my mind about it. Is there anything else?   Stephen G. Breyer  Wrong -- wrong residency requirement.  I did have Justice Kagan's question in mind when they read it. Why don't they ask the child if it would like, when it reaches the age of 21, to be connected to the United States and see if the child votes in American elections and lives there a while? Why are they so worried about the child's parents?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, in any case, you don't have to answer that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Lived here for 14 years and so forth.  All kinds of stuff.  But --   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't want to argue with you on this point.  I want to know if I've got the reason for saying the mother, if she's the U.S. citizen and he is born out of wedlock, he only lived here for a year, but the father has to live here for, like, ten years or eight years or something like that, the real justification for that you've been able to find and the only one you've been able to find has to do with this thing about statelessness?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm going to make an example where they never married.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They -- they like living together without being married.  Now what's the justification?   Stephen G. Breyer  One I could think of -- one I could think of, possibly, but I'd like your opinion about it: How many, do you think, unmarried fathers there were in 1952 who couldn't qualify under the long period of time -- eight years, you know -- and that's not so hard to do, if you're in the Army, because all your active duty counts.  But they would have qualified under the one year.  Now, I use the numbers in your brief, which were brilliant of you to try to find.  I don't know how you found those. But I -- I -- that 4,000 number kept coming back.  I thought maybe there were a couple of thousand a year.  But do we know that there are more than a couple of thousand a year?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, and there were the untold numbers, but that's -- that's true, they're untold numbers, and then that's not told.  I'm trying to find the -- (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm trying to find how close we could come to a guess.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, let's go back to '52.   Stephen G. Breyer  Let's go back to '52, and the couple is unmarried and it's a father who, in fact, would qualify if he only had to live here for a year, but he wouldn't qualify if he had to live here for eight years before the baby's born.  Never marries the baby -- never marries the mother.  Okay. So I'm thinking, who could those people have been? They would have been -- they would have been people maybe working for American businesses or something, and there weren't that many at that time.  So I -- I used your 4,000.   Stephen G. Breyer  That perhaps was not right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  What if the --   INTERRUPTING ",15-1191
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  On this, but -- I would say at some point, the problem that worries me the most is, assuming this is unconstitutional, do you put the 14 years or whatever it is, ten years, on both, or the one year on both? And I -- I want to -- because he does have a point.  You put the one year on both and then you have, when the parents are married, it's the ten years, and when it's the -- they're not married, it's the one year, and that really doesn't make much sense.  But the -- the -- so I'm -- I'm -- hope you'll get to that. And in the course of that, I read an amicus brief that bothered me a lot, and it said, actually, the one-year requirement is tougher.  And the reason it's tougher, it says that the State Department administers it.  How they do this, I don't know, and I want to know if that's really true. But they administer it to say that if you are living in the United States you have to live here for one year.  And if you set one foot across the board to get a drink of water at -- at Niagara Falls, you don't qualify.  And, moreover, you have to prove that you never did set one foot to get a drink of water. Well, nobody could prove such a thing.  So -- so I'm interested in that word ""continuous"" and how it is actually administered. Those are the two things that are worrying me in respect to remedy.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So I -- I -- that question.  That is your answer.  And maybe, if the Solicitor General has time, he could simply confirm that answer by saying yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why -- why -- why did you use the word ""today""? I thought what we were supposed to do is go back and figure out if they had known that it was unconstitutional to give the unmarried woman a year requirement to live in the United States, but to give the unmarried man where he is a citizen eight years' requirement, suppose they had known that was unconstitutional then, what would they have done then? Is it then or is it now?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's a lot easier for you if it is now, I think.   Stephen G. Breyer  But -- but -- but which is it -- is there anything -- I mean, you know, you are not going to help me if you just say that because that's in your interest to say.  Is there anything that -- that you could -- you could point to that would say it's now and not then?   Stephen G. Breyer  Did you find any case which supports that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Did you find any case against it?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's true.  But you can ask, what would they have wanted if they knew they couldn't make this discrimination? That's why I thought, well, if you have to go back to '52, they're going to either have to take the benefit away from the woman or give it to the man.  And the two principles that support you is Congress hates taking away a benefit they give anybody.  They get into a lot of trouble when they take benefits away. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  So that would move them in one direction.  And it would also move them in the same direction if there are just a handful of them who might really benefit.  That's why I asked that question.  But nobody -- but if there were millions of men who might benefit, then they might get a little worried about what they're doing, particularly since they're discriminating even more, you know, the other way against the married couple. So that's why I was interested in those questions.  But I take it you have said pretty much what you can say on that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Where is the legitimation requirement? I see 8 U.S.C. 1409(c)  It doesn't say a word about legitimation.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, 1409(a) doesn't apply.  It says ""notwithstanding subsection A.""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It says: ""Notwithstanding subsection (a), somebody who is born outside the U.S. out of wedlock shall be held to have acquired at birth the nationality status of his mother if the mother is a U.S. citizen and had been physically in the United States for one year."" So I don't see anything that says they have to be legitimized for the mother to get that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In 1409(a)  And what the first words of (c) are, ""notwithstanding the provision of subsection A."" Anyway, I guess I could figure it out later.   ",15-1191
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is -- what was your answer? Which I forget.  A statute prohibits a convicted sex offender from being -- spending more than five minutes at a children's playground.  Is that constitutional or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If that's constitutional, instead of what most of the briefs do, is interpret the statute as broadly as possible, this is a facial challenge.  What about trying to interpret it as narrowly as possible? And as narrowly as possible, it seems to me a necessary condition is that a violator cannot go to a site that facilitates the social introduction between two or more persons, and these are -- these are children they're talking about, I guess -- for two or more persons for the purposes of friendship, meeting other persons, or information exchanges.  So we have to say ""or related information exchanges."" And now we have a definition that sounds as if they're talking about dating sites, or it sounds as if they're talking about related play group sites, if you take younger children.  And is it possible to read it that way? And if you do read it that way, is it constitutional?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  But that's what I -- I wanted to be -- I wanted to get your answer, and I think I have that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But I'm really interested in the narrow possibility of interpreting it narrowly, as I said.  And on that basis, it's facially constitutional, though it could be applied unconstitutionally.  That's what I want your answer to.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're not -- you're not attacking the statute.  You're only attacking it applied to your client?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's -- then we're back to my question.  So I'm treating it as an as-applied challenge.  I don't want to just repeat the question.   Stephen G. Breyer  I want to get your answer to the question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Wait.  Don't you see, all I'm doing is reading one word before information exchange.  And the word I'm reading is related information exchange.  And as so interpreted, that clause, too, which you're much more familiar with than I am --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- seems to be talking about dating sites or the lower age level equivalent.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If -- if that's -- it does what it says, facilities the social introduction between two or more persons for the purposes of friendship, meeting other persons or related information exchanges. I've now got it a social dating or equivalent site.   Stephen G. Breyer  I think I can say that. Now, if I say that, is it constitutional? That's what I'm trying to get your answer to.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So then the answer to this would be they have not applied it that way here, and given the way they've applied it here, they can't do that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, we're going to have 40 other cases involved.   ",15-1194
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe those have the same problem.  I mean, why -- why? Why are we trying to limit that? People all the time want to speak to 18-year-olds, 17-year-olds.  It doesn't -- it doesn't limit this even to those that have sex problems with children.  All right? This is -- this is everybody who's ever had a sex offense. And you're not -- you're, I take it, you're rejecting any effort that I might have hypothetically made to narrow the statute, and you're saying, hey, nowhere.  Nowhere, really, because children are everywhere.  And I don't -- what is the difference? I want to go to a park and I want to talk to 16-year-olds about helping get some petition drives.  You know, I can make endless examples. So what's the basis here? The State has a reason? Yeah, it does.  Does it limit free speech? Dramatically.  Are there other, less restrictive ways of doing it? We're not sure, but we think probably, as you've mentioned some.  Okay.  End of case, right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about all the orders -- about all the ways you just listed that they have all the statutes would say you can't approach children and say certain things.  You remember you started that way.   Stephen G. Breyer  What's the difference?   Stephen G. Breyer  Can you have a statute says convicted swindlers cannot go on Facebook -- or cannot go on the Internet on sites that tell people -- that tell people where to gather to discuss money?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, I can multiply these examples.  Convicted --   Stephen G. Breyer  We can think of -- you know, pretty soon, you're going to have everybody convicted of different things not being able to go anywhere and discuss anything.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I exaggerate.  Let's just stick with the -- we can't have convicted swindlers going on Facebook to discuss money.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Does that make a difference?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   Stephen G. Breyer  Look -- look: The case books are filled with cases where to allow certain groups of people to speak is actually dangerous.  Like the communists under -- you know, years ago, they said it was a good idea to have a revolution.  And all kinds of people have said dangerous things. Here, you take a group of people who've done something wrong, been fully punished, and you're saying that they might say something to somebody which would be dangerous.  And you're right; it might be.  On the other hand, your remedy from that is to cut off their speech. Now, I suspect my law clerks, in the space of half an hour, would find many cases that put it the level of generality I've just put at, say it is hornbook law that you can't.  You can't unless there is at least a clear and present danger, you know, homes.  There are lots of qualifications. So why don't you tell me when my law clerks are going to look all these up -- and I think I have a few in mind -- what case we should look up to be sure we get the opposite, which is what you're arguing, I think.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why -- why -- the thing -- I'd like to go back to the Solicitor General's last point, and that's where I'm having -- I have a puzzle. I'd like to hear what you have to say. I mean, for the purposes of this question, I'm assuming all the text, which sounds to me, if a person came from Mars, that's what he would expect a legal argument to be like. The -- the number's all over had the place, and I will also assume that for every chef salad there is a countervailing strawberry shortcake; all right? So -- so everything balances out.  Assume. Now, it seems to me that this exception here is saying this.  We have the Secretary of the Treasury. He has five assistants.  Each is a presidential appointee.  One day, secretary -- Assistant Secretary of the Treasury number two dies, and now the President can fill that role with any one of three people on an acting basis: His first assistant, some other assistant secretary or deputy in the treasury department, or a GS-18. Have I got it right so far?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm using examples.  All right. Now, what this statute as you read it would seem to say, if you appoint whichever one you choose, put any one of those three people in, go ahead, do it. Now, if you nominate those, one of those three to a presidential position roughly, they are out.  All of them are out.  Oh, wait.  There's one exception.  The first assistant is not out if he served for 90 days as first assistant. Have I got the statute right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  I would just wonder, were I from Mars, what's the point of such a statute? (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  Why is it you're perfectly willing to have stay there and do the acting job the first assistant, if he served 90 days before, but you're not willing to have served the acting job this guy who was a GS-18 in the same department, or the person who was an assistant secretary of the Treasury, number two. Why? I can't think of an answer given your interpretation. I can think of an answer given their interpretation.  I say what they were worried about on their interpretation were our friends number two and number three, the GS-18 and the Assistant Secretary number two.  They can continue to serve, on their interpretation. Hey, why did they do this? The name of that explanation is called Bill Lann Lee.  Because that was the problem that gave rise to the statute, and on their interpretation they passed some words that solved that problem.  So there we are. I get an explanation for his, assuming that you like purposes more than you like numbers.  I get an explanation on his, and I don't get an explanation on yours.  So that's what I would like you to respond to.   Stephen G. Breyer  You -- you have been -- and I understand -- you've been concerned about instances in which there is controversy over appointment.  But there are thousands of jobs in the government where they have to run departments where there's no controversy, you know. And people leave, or they die, or something happens; there's a vacancy.  And the main institutional imperative is keep the job being done.  Keep the office working.  So an obvious person is to say Mr. First Assistant, you carry on.  Okay? And maybe you bring in somebody from next door.  And maybe you look for a GS-18 in the department.  You know, the guy next door has a presidential appointment.  So you put him in the job. That's all.  No problem. And why all of a sudden Congress would, in these thousands of instances where there's no problem, or hundreds anyway, Congress would say, if you decide to appoint him permanently, you have to take him immediately out of the acting position, and there's more disruption in the department.  Why would anyone want to do that? Now, I could see they might want to do it with the first assistant where it's a runaround, and they have an idea that it's a runaround when he hasn't served as first assistant for more than 90 days.  Then you might say, well, why him? Maybe they were just trying to get this controversial guy in. In other words, as -- as an administrator in noncontroversial matters, I can understand their interpretation more easily.  But you will tell me that I'm wrong because?   ",15-1251

Now, it doesn't say what law.  And, moreover, you heard your brother here say, well, the Colorado supreme court said that this wasn't a question here of whose property it was, it was a question of the remedy.  The property belonged to the criminal defendant. Now, so, one, what do you say about those cases? Two, what did the Colorado supreme court say as a matter of property law?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't say ""can."" It says the law raises an obligation to the one who's received the benefit of the erroneous judgment to make restitution to the other party --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Breyer  This Court was the one --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In 1832.  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm more interested in what does the -- did the Colorado supreme court say, this is his money, but we don't have a remedy? Did it say, this is our money and we don't have to have a remedy? What did it say?   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose we go by the -- what this Court said in 1832, which seems like historical tradition.  Suppose I take that, unless you give me a reason not to, as stating what the law is. That's what it says. So what's your response to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  So what happens then? I mean, you -- I grant you have a tough side of this argument.  It doesn't seem very fair.  But the -- the -- the -- (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  You have a corporate criminal defendant, you can't put him in jail, and -- and so what they do is they fine the corporation $15 million.  And then the State says, by the way, why appeal? If you win, we're not going to give you the money back as the Chief Justice said.  We'll assert sovereign immunity. Now, there's something wrong with that.  I'm trying to put my finger on it. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe they were right in 1832 and then they went off on a wrong track. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe those cases were wrong.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  In talking about that, I guess that's why I say I was the problem. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  What I wrote was in a case such as this one.  And then people can argue: What does that mean, ""in a case such as this one""? (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  By the time we reach the Alabama case, there is a need seen by a majority of the Court to try to bring clarity.  We're speaking as a Court.  Not every individual gets his own way, or should. And so if we go back into an area and try to reconcile the cases and try to come up with, in a complicated area, a set of standards that will prevent us from being -- turning into the nineteenth court of evidence to consider some highly detailed matters and so forth, you know, all the problems here, I would take that -- or at least I'd start taking that last case, the -- the -- the Alabama case, as at least trying to set the way in which a district court should go about deciding a case such as this one.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do I not do that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I understand the problem of Cromartie II.  I understand it.  Believe me.  And I -- I think that the problem in Cromartie II is it doesn't say in all cases.  I mean, it's pretty clear.  It's -- I write that for a purpose.  You know, the Court writes, when it says in a case like this one, it's a little ambiguous, but it means it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  By the time as time progresses, as time progresses, we face what you see and I see as the problem right now, which is a set of standards that district courts can't apply, which will try to separate sheep from goats, without us spending the entire term reviewing 5,000-page records.  Right? That is a problem that you have by the time we -- pretty clear, by the time we get to the later cases.  So I don't know. I understand your argument.  I understand your argument.  I'll go back and look at it.  You think it's absolutely determinative, the Cromartie II.  I'm not so sure.   Stephen G. Breyer  What you want me to say is even though the district court listened to the map drawer and believed him, and his statements are pretty much against you, and then they heard two of the State senators, and they were pretty much against you, and it's up to the district court to evaluate the strength of witnesses, and came to the conclusion on the basis of fact that, in fact, it was -- race was really the explanation. Despite that, everyone who comes in has to have an alternative map.  And, of course, if we have five intervenors and so forth, we're going to have five or six different alternative maps drawing 400 -- I don't know, a hundred State legislatures and so forth. That's what I'm supposed to say?   Stephen G. Breyer  But, what -- what exactly is going on, in part, is a very tough matter.  And years -- go back years ago.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  There were many States that had many black citizens and had no black representation, and there was a thing called -- let's have majority-minority districts. And the problem is, how does the law permit the creation of that, and at the same time, prevent the kind of packing that might appear in other cases, which is gerrymandering? And -- and no one, I think, has a good answer to that question.  There is just slightly better, slightly worse. So if you're too tough in this case in rejecting the notion that it was politics, which is correlated with race, then what's going to happen out there to a successful effort to create majority-minority districts where matters change, times change, oceans rise, you know, et cetera? And how do we keep -- how -- how -- how -- do you see the problem?   Nicole A. Saharsky  Yes.  I mean, we're very sympathetic to the States' interests.  And we think that the Court has tried to be sympathetic to the States' interests.  And we think the Court has done it in decisions like Alabama.  And there's two things in particular that the Court has done --   Stephen G. Breyer  It's not just the States' interest.  It's the constitutional interest in seeing that minorities have representation in reality in the legislatures.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Right.  And so what this Court has done, first of all, is to ask about racial predominance, the first question being, was race really the predominant motive; not just one factor, but the predominant motive? Show us your evidence.  And here, the district court had the evidence. But then the second thing is when we get to strict scrutiny, the Court has said, give us your justification.  And that's really, I think, the problem with the 1st Congressional District in this case, is that the State was operating on an error of law, first of all; and second, that it just did not provide the justification.  And that's what the Voting Rights Act Section 2 and Section 5 focus on. It's not just -- as you said in Alabama for the Court, not just picking a number out of thin air, but showing us there's a problem here with -- potentially with respect to retrogression.  There's a problem here with respect to vote dilution. And with respect to the 1st Congressional District in this case, there just wasn't evidence of a potential problem with vote dilution, because at the lower percentage, not being a majority-minority district, the African-American community was able to elect its candidate of choice, really, on a -- on a sustained basis over a period of many years and by wide margins, so -- and this is on page 49A of the District Court's opinion -- it said, look, the State just didn't make the case.  It also said the State was operating on a mistake of law. And so just getting back to your question, you know, we -- we -- we understand that this is a somewhat delicate balance, and we think that the Court has attempted to balance the important interests protected by the Equal Protection Clause against the concern that States have and the flexibility that States need by adopting these two different parts of the standard racial predominance, and then the strong basis in evidence for strict scrutiny.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Did they -- did they in respect to this district, District 12? Because when I go back to Cromartie II, I think he's right.  It does say that at least where the evidence is close, where it's a close question, where one side is saying it's racial, the other side is saying it's political, then it says the party attacking the legislature's boundaries has to show that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are equally consistent with traditional principles. Now, it does say that.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what -- what -- what is it that you suggest? My having been quite strong for following stare decisis in this, but what do you suggest about that? Are you going to say this isn't a close case?   Stephen G. Breyer  Are you going to say we should overrule that? What -- what is it you want to say?   Stephen G. Breyer  Explain why isn't -- not a map, but some kind of -- of evidence that they could have achieved their political objectives with less reliance on race.  That's what it seems to say.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Are you saying it doesn't really say that? You could say -- I mean, there are many things you might say.  I'm not suggesting the answer.  I want to know what you do say.  Or you could say, it doesn't matter because we have a -- a -- giving weight to the district court doesn't matter, isn't that important.  But I don't want to suggest something.  I'm not.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I want to hear what you think.   Stephen G. Breyer  I think they -- they did make the case.  They said, yeah, we did that, and the reason we did it is most of the African-American voters vote for Democrats --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- and we want to get all the Democratic voters in one district, so the 15 that are Republican.  That's just what the Democrats did last time.  And yet that -- that's the kind of argument that they make.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about that?   ",15-1262
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, each of those -- and I know there are several -- are related to the ultimate purpose of a trademark, which is to identify the source of the product.  So every trademark makes that statement. Now, what is -- what purpose or objective of trademark protection does this particular disparagement provision help along or further? And I'm thinking of the provision that says you can say something nice about a minority group, but you can't say something bad about them.  With all the other -- I know the others -- I don't know all, but I know many of them, and I can relate that.  You relate this.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   Stephen G. Breyer  I have it.  Right.  I want to get the answer to my question because that is the one question I have for you. The only question I have for you is what purpose related to trademarks objective does this serve? And I want to be sure I have your answer.  Your answer so far was, it prevents the -- or it helps to prevent the user of the product from being distracted from the basic message, which is, I made this product. I take it that's your answer.  And if that's your answer, I will -- my follow-up question to that would be, I can think probably, and with my law clerks, perhaps 50,000 examples of instances where the space the trademark provides is used for very distracting messages, probably as much or more so than the one at issue, or disparagement.  And what business does Congress have picking out this one, but letting all the other distractions exist?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's not disparaging; your answer was distracting.  And -- and -- and one of the great things of 99 percent of all trademarks is they don't just identify; boy, do they distract.  It's a form of advertising.  So if the answer is distracting, not -- you didn't provide an answer to disparagement.  You're answer is why disparagement was they don't want distraction from the message.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But that's where I have the question.  What relation is there to a particular type of distraction, disparagement, and any purpose of a trademark?   ",15-1293
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why does that --   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  It isn't quite like that. After all, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, this is more like a single bulletin board on the train station. The train station which has a thousand bulletin boards. People can say whatever they want.  But this bulletin board, one out of a thousand, is reserved today for people who want to say nice things about Shakespeare. This is not a general expression program. This is a program that has one objective.  The objective is to identify the source of the product.  It stops nobody from saying anything.  All it says is when you're trying to fulfill our objective, which is identify the source of your product, if you want, put a little circle with an R in it and write down beneath in tiny letters, Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  Anything you want.  But in that circle, not the thing that says the insulting thing about somebody else.  See? Very much like one Shakespeare celebration board out of a million.  Let me say 10 million to make the point stronger.  Do you see? That's -- that -- that's where you can't express yourself, so -- and then I said to them, well, why do you do that? And they said because, you know, the purpose of a -- of a trademark is to identify a source. It's not to get people into extraneous arguments.  And what this will do is it will get people into extraneous arguments, losing or diluting the force of a program that seeks to use a trademark to identify a source. Now, that's what I got out of my answer to the last question on the other side, and I would like to know what you think.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't care what their position is.  I want to know what you think in respect to the question I'm asking.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, not -- not conduct business.  They can insult customers.  Boy, you could have 50,000 insults on every physical item that you put out.  All you cannot do is when it comes to a little mark or a form of words, it is designed to say one thing -- I'm repeating myself -- I am the source of the product.  And you can do that in little letters, big letters, tiny letters, no letter, whatever.  But there you have to stick to business, and if you're going to go beyond business, don't use insults. Do you believe that they can stop trademarks from saying -- this is the trademark you can't use -- Joe Jones is a jerk?   Stephen G. Breyer  They could not stop that. They can't -- can they say Smith's beer is poison?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, my goodness.  I mean, there are laws all over the place that stop you from saying that a competitor is -- has bad products.  It's called product disparagement.  There are laws all over the place that stop you from saying Joe Jones is a jerk or something more specific.  They're called libel laws or slander laws.  But you're saying the government couldn't do that?   Stephen G. Breyer  But time, place, or manner, there is time, place, or manner.  In fact, you can use these words anywhere at any time in your performance. Just don't use them as the registered source of the message, I am the owner of the -- of the -- of the band. Time, place, and manner.  You have the entire universe where you can say what you want, including this. So why is this somehow not a restriction on time, place, and manner if the others were?   Stephen G. Breyer  How do you --   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it's back to really the Chief Justice's question.  I -- I wouldn't ask it, but I think -- except that I think you do have something of an answer that you haven't fully expressed. Look.  We're creating, through government, a form of a property right, a certain form.  That's a trademark.  It's as if through government we created a certain kind of physical property right that certain people could dedicate a small part of their houses or land to Peaceful Grove.  And in Peaceful Grove, you write messages, but peaceful messages.  And above all, you don't write messages that will provoke others to violence or bad feelings.  Okay? Anything wrong with that? I can't think of anything wrong with that.  There are thousands of places where they can express hostile feelings.  It's just in this tiny place, one-quarter of an acre, that you yourself have chosen to take advantage of that you can't because it will destroy the purpose.  It will destroy the purpose of Peaceful Grove.  That's why I asked my question. To what extent does interfering with viewpoints here serve a trademark-related purpose? As we can see how in Peaceful Grove or in Shakespeare, the messages that we were talking about did harm the government purpose.  And here, they're saying similarly, disparaging messages get in the way of the objective of this program, which is to identify the source.  Now, that, I think, is what I heard.  That's what I'd like you to think about and respond to.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I understand that. But now your answer -- okay, I've got your answer.  And now your other answers were worrying me, because what's worrying me is I accept what you just said -- suppose I did; am I suddenly saying no Peaceful Grove, no Shakespeare celebration, no normal restrictions on normal restrictions, no function -- you know, it's functional, can't have functional things in a trademark, da, da, da, all the ones we read.  If I buy into your answer just -- that you just gave, have I suddenly opened the door to striking down all those things?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why not?   INTERRUPTING ",15-1293
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  This went on for several months, eight months.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but weren't --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- weren't they held for eight months?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No I can --   Stephen G. Breyer  So I can understand after a bomb attack.  I can understand after a bomb attack and 3,000 people are killed.  I can understand that the first reaction of the law enforcement authorities is, pick up anybody you might think is connected, and we'll worry about the rest of it later. Now, eight months? Now, what they do allege is that Ashcroft and Mueller knew that the FBI had not developed any reliable evidence -- that's paragraph 67 -- tying the plaintiffs to terrorism, but authorized their prolonged detention, in restrictive conditions, and Mueller, it says, ordered that they be kept in INS custody, and including the restrictive conditions, even after local offices reported.  Ah, they don't say reported to whom, so that is a point in your favor, but that there was no reason to suspect them of terrorism. But I think, fairly read, they are saying -- they -- okay.  They authorized it.  They knew that some of these people had no information against them, but the answer is pick up anybody who might have a connection, and then just keep them there? I mean, that's what's worrying me a lot.  And why doesn't that at least state an allegation? Suppose it had been five years.  Suppose it had been ten years.  I mean, we all know the problems with that and -- and if you know it, I can see it for a day, two days.  Five years? Eight months? I mean, why isn't that an allegation that at least you have to real-deal with on discovery and so forth?   Stephen G. Breyer  How long after 9/11 did they adopt that policy?   Stephen G. Breyer  First months.   Stephen G. Breyer  How many months?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Was it more like eight months or more like --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I suppose that in 1942, there was a president or a secretary of defense who decided let's take 140,000 people -- 60,000, 70,000 citizens and 60,000 noncitizens -- and lock them up for ten years or five years or four years. All right.  You go with habeas right at the time.  You could understand how, in January of 1942, it would be pretty tough for a judge in a district court to start second-guessing people.  But several years later, people had the time to develop the information.  They understand what people knew then.  And they might find, that in some of those instances, there was no justification whatsoever.  And I look at the Bivens remedy and say, one, it has a cautionary effect.  It doesn't deter where necessary, where necessary, and then where a big mistake was made, it has the possibility of compensation later.  That's the whole argument, that beware of cutting off Bivens, you never know what will happen.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, not at all.   Stephen G. Breyer  I used a historic example and I'm not worried about this case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  I'm worried about --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And you say it in paragraph -- in paragraph 74, it says, ""Indeed, after a few months of interacting with the plaintiffs, the MDC defendants"" -- I take it those are the people we're talking about -- ""realized that they were not terrorists, but merely immigration detainees; yet the restrictive conditions and harsh treatment continued."" So what is that but an allegation that they did know about it and they did continue the harsh treatment?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It is their restrictive conditions and harsh treatment.  And elsewhere --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- in the complaint they have a list.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Anything about the hypothetical I gave, of course, is a real one, not this case.  But if you cut Bivens off totally, what prevents that from recurring?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- that was a pure hypothetical -- you get my point.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  This -- sometimes in Bivens, there are many, many remedies in the judicial system.   ",15-1358
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I'll ask you one other thing, which is, has this been fully argued out below? I mean, I think it is an enormously important and very open question.  And we can say on the one hand, just what was said.  I think everything the Chief Justice said is true.  There is a problem, in this time, of real national emergency, to overdeter people from doing what they reasonably think is necessary.  And they have the authority for security, not the judges. At the same time, the law of this Court correctly, I think is, but there's no blank check even for the President.  And if there's no blank check, that means sometimes they can go too far.  And if they have gone too far, it is our job to say that. Now, there are considerable advantages, as I pointed out, saying, at the time they're going to say yes, because there's a big frightening thing happening. But maybe they went too far too fast, and then this offers a remedy later and maybe the deterrence is good. Okay? You see both sides.   Stephen G. Breyer  Has that been fully argued in this case? If I go and look in the record, can I find a question that I have wondered about for quite a long time fully answered?   Stephen G. Breyer  In a set of cases.   Stephen G. Breyer  The FBI goes into a rooming house after having information there's a nuclear weapon on the floor.  They find it.  And there might be another.  Would they be justified in taking into custody every single person in that rooming house and looking into it? I mean, for how long? Would you say to them, no, you can't do it because we don't know, there are people on the floor, they knew nothing about them, actually.  They admit it.  We knew nothing about them. All we know is they're in the rooming house.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And we also know there was a nuclear weapon.  And that isn't totally fanciful; it could happen.  And -- and so what are they supposed to do and how long?   ",15-1358
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Excuse me.  Why -- why did -- look -- look at the first example of what Justice Kagan is talking about, Appendix B of the government's brief, 1837 U.S.C. 37(b), jurisdiction over acts of violence against a person at an international airport outside the United States if the offender is found in the United States. Now, that -- I can understand why they would make that a crime.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why would they put it in RICO unless they wanted somebody who was hurt to be able to get damages?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The injury is to somebody at the foreign airport.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Look, business is hurt. They blew up an airport in -- in Tasmania.  Okay? So -- so I guess that blowing up an airport there could hurt somebody.  But my question is, what was it doing in RICO, if in fact Congress doesn't intend a foreign person hurt to be able to get damages? It's already a crime.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's my -- and maybe this is the wrong example.  Think of -- they have a list of about 50.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So some of them, I can ask this question to: What's it doing in RICO unless they want somebody to get damages?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So your point granted is one word -- three words.  Your answer to my question is four words: It was an accident.  That's the answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then, if it was not an accident -- I mean, explain to me the same question. I don't want to repeat the same question five times.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Listen, let's look at the ones that were not, that are the seven, or if you want, the three.  Why would a human being -- now you've got my question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why is it in RICO if they don't want damages?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I thought this was the same question, but I'm elaborating a bit because it's both for you and Mr. Frederick's reading. I thought the answer to my first question would be that the government just wanted the forfeiture provisions -- that's why it put them in -- or the criminal provisions -- that's why it put these other things in -- and you say, that's right.  You say, but they didn't want the damages to extend abroad.  That's your position.   Elaine J. Goldenberg  Yes.  That's correct.   Stephen G. Breyer  You wrote it into your brief.   Elaine J. Goldenberg  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  And you're the State Department for this purpose, and you ought to know. But then they're the EU, and moreover, not only do they tell us that the 27 nations of the EU don't agree with you, but in fact, what's very confusing about this is, in the Alien Tort Statute case -- which, after all, involved torture, and not simply money laundering -- the EU countries, at least three, were in here with briefs -- I think it was Germany, the Netherlands and Britain -- saying, stay out of this stuff.  Not completely, but basically.  And you were on the other side.  Okay? So what's going on? (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  That is, I mean -- and it's not just a -- that's not a criticism.  We have to write this.  And I think what you think and what those countries think is very important in matters like this. And here they're taking what seem to be contradictory positions.  Who do you talk to? Who do they talk to? Is this the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing in Britain and in -- and in Germany? Is it that no one actually spoke to anybody except the lawyer at the EU, and then the EU never spoke to anybody in any of the relevant Ministries of Justice or Embassy? Is it that you actually went and talked to the ambassadors of England, Germany, the Netherlands and asked them why do you want us to take a different position in this case than -- it seems to be -- than you took in the other case? I mean, I have a few pages here.  I can't work with a few pages.  I have no idea what the right result is here in one important aspect unless I know what afterthought and consideration you, the State Department, and those other countries, and their ambassadors, et cetera, actually think. Do I have enough here to deal with it? What do I do?   Elaine J. Goldenberg  Well, I think you do have enough here to show what we actually think. Mr. Frederick --   Stephen G. Breyer  Did you consult with the embassies? Did the State Department go out and ask them to have their legal departments over in Germany look up what the actual effect would be of the damages? Or was it the EU that bore total responsibility for this matter without even consulting from Brussels what happens in Germany or some other place? I mean, how did it work?   Elaine J. Goldenberg  Well, to my knowledge, we didn't have those consultations, although I understand that the EU informed the Justice Department before it filed the --   Stephen G. Breyer  And did it consult with the other three? You see where I'm going, and I'd like your best answer --   Elaine J. Goldenberg  Well, I think that this is a very unusual case where you have foreign sovereigns as the private RICO plaintiffs.  I think that won't usually be true.  And the rule that we are coming in here to advance is going to be the rule for the usual case, as well as the unusual case. And so although it may be that, you know, the EU has special views about comity concerns here where it's the plaintiff, in the usual case the plaintiff is going to be a private party, and it's going to be a situation in which the conduct and the injury took place somewhere else.  And the country where that conduct and that injury took place may very well have its own interest in regulating, may not be appreciative of plaintiffs being able to come to the United States to get remedies here, particularly treble damages remedies, which, as this Court pointed out in Empagran, is something that often causes foreign countries a great deal of consternation --   ",15-138X

Now, it's been in league with six foreign countries, and they have agreements. And what the crime is, is money laundering, and the money laundering took place in Belgium, and you win. Now, can you go to Belgium and get the damages? You see? There are six Belgium banks.  They are not accused.  They are unindicted co-conspirators. And under this -- does this statute allow a -- the EU to come to Philadelphia, find RJR, accuse them of money laundering with unindicted co-conspirators in Brussels, get damages, and then go to Brussels and collect them from the other banks?   Stephen G. Breyer  But do they get a judgment against the foreign bank?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The EU -- the jurisdiction only against RJR unindicted co-conspirators or helpers, whatever.   Stephen G. Breyer  I think they are worried about something like this.

Breyer  Because I -- if I just think that's what happened, hey, there's a party at Joe's house, I would think the people who went over there, whether they knew Joe, heard it secondhand, thirdhand or whatever, are normally naturally going to think that Joe has a right to the house.

Parker  Well, because -- there are two answers.  One is that, I think, would be precisely the kind of bright-line rule that this Court has repeatedly said is not to be imposed in probable cause cases.  What I think instead is required is an analysis of the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the statement of a -- or the claim of an innocent mental state is --   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm saying what else is there here? And I don't see anything else. And maybe it's a question of believability, then let's have a trial?   Robert A. Parker  Well, let -- let me -- let me talk about the facts of this case, if I can turn to that. I think it's useful to think of this almost as like two sides of a ledger.  On one side, there's the condition of the home.  On the other side, there's the statements of the people who were there. If you think about the condition of the home, the police were responding to a -- a citizen complaint, multiple citizen complaints, that this was a vacant home.  Not only was it a vacant home, but they said that it had been repeatedly exploited to throw parties in the past.   ",15-1485
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The key things that I hadn't fully taken in, one, you put yourself in the position of the officer.  Two, people tell you this is a vacant house. So it is known, i.e., they knew, I guess there's some evidence of this, that there were vacant houses in this area used for parties. They know also that it is a vacant house.  And it doesn't -- and those are the things that -- and then they look around and it looks sort of vacant, not completely, but sort of. And so that together leads them to think, well, these people knew it was a vacant house.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and would a reasonable officer have concluded that the partygoers knew or they knew it was a vacant house? If so, that's enough.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because it is trespass to go into a vacant house, I gather.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's not? Well, but the other stuff they have, I guess, isn't it? Vacant -- you can't -- it isn't trespassing in the District of Columbia to go into a vacant house?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What if -- go ahead.   Stephen G. Breyer  This is important to me.  I'm sorry that it is.  I didn't know this. In fact, the house under D.C. law wasn't vacant?   Stephen G. Breyer  And, indeed, if the officers -- which is unlikely -- had known all these details, they would have known it's not vacant.  What it is, is not owned by or rented by the person who supposedly invited them to the party.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So then the question becomes did -- would a reasonable officer have believed that they were trespassing and they were trespassing if and only if there is some reason a reasonable person could have believed that they knew that the person who invited them, first, second or thirdhand, did not have a right to be there?   Stephen G. Breyer  And there's -- you think there's nothing to have a trial about?   INTERRUPTING ",15-1485
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What do you think of the idea suggested in Justice Alito's opinion that the word ""offense"" like the word ""crime"" both those words are ambiguous.  They can refer either to a category of behaviors that many people can engage in or they can refer to this behavior that this defendant engaged in on this particular instance. So he said, as I read it, let's back up. Can't be done.  Congress thought both in this statute and in the other statute, it wouldn't be that tough to categorize all the State criminal laws by their degree of risk of violence.  Can't be done.  Too many State criminal laws used in too many different ways, too many different words, no statistics are kept, the Justice Department can't get them, so we're left guessing.  So let's back up and look at what this person did on this occasion.  What is your reaction to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I think you argued it.  I just wanted to know what your reaction is.   Stephen G. Breyer  You'd have to have it argued.  But I think if you really did that, I just don't know if you thought it through at the SG's office about the pros and cons.  And in case -- you needn't have done -- but in case you have done, I'd -- I'd appreciate your telling us what you all think even if you're not stuck with it.  I know that's unusual for you to be stuck with it.  I'm just curious.   Stephen G. Breyer  But do you remember -- probably you do or maybe not, that several judges, I remember because one of them was me -- and some of the lower court judges said, why doesn't the sentencing commission or why doesn't that part of the Justice Department that keeps track of statistics go out and find out what is the typical way in which, for the ACCA provision, you know, the other provision, they're committed, and case after case went by, and nobody ever had the statistics. And I tended to think, well, they can't get them.  Otherwise, they would.  And so what's the story? I think it's a similar question to what is being asked.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, there were a lot -- in other words, we never had a case, that I can remember, under that other provision, where somebody came up with statistics, despite what I'd call pleading by a lot of --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There were? Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then there are some. Then there were some.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You think you could go back to Justice Kennedy's original question? If you don't recall it --     I do.   Stephen G. Breyer  -- what sticks in my mind, if I get it right, is let's look at the old ACCA -- the one we struck down in Johnson, and the difficult language was it involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  And then there were a lot of examples where, gee, it's awfully tough to figure out whether it does or does not fall within those words. Now let's look at this language.  It involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property to another may be used in the course of committing the offense.  Now, that would seem to be that if the offense is conspiracy to commit burglary, the conspiracy is finished, over, done with, long before they get to the property. And so that wouldn't be too tough. But burglary, which takes place on the property, or conspiracy under the first statute which would lead to the burglary that takes place, well, that becomes tougher.  Okay. Now let's look at our statute now. And give me some examples.  I'm sure there are many.  But I think it would be helpful where under this language, it seems, my God, what is the basic case? This is impossible.     I'll give you several.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.     First, Sykes, vehicular flight.  Okay.  How do we -- the Court was -- was mired in controversy about how you figure out whether vehicular flight is going to give rise to the right sort of risk and how do you -- how did the Court do it? It was looking at the moments or the long time frame after the elements were satisfied.  The moment you pull out, you are in vehicular flight. So ""in the course of"" certainly doesn't help.  And the distinction between physical force and physical injury doesn't help.  And the distinction between property and personal injury doesn't help.  You're still always imagining what is happening after you pull out? Okay, next one, residential trespass. It all depends upon, first, what do you imagine the ordinary case to be of residential trespass and then figure out how it plays out. Or car burglary, same exact problem. Or to take one example directly out of ACCA, extortion. It all depends upon the ordinary case analysis, which -- which goes back to Justice Sotomayor's question early on.  The heart of this problem is this ordinary case approach, and none of the -- the statutory differences that the Government has pointed to help you figure out what the ordinary case is.   Stephen G. Breyer  They're saying right now, what about conspiracy? I mean, you can have conspiracy to commit burglary.  It's over, once you conspire.     Right.  Well, that's a -- so that's an example, but I think the government said that that's in.   ",15-1498
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I see that.  The thing underlying this is -- which is a difficult case -- if we say you're right, what then do we say about moral turpitude, unfair competition, just and reasonable rates, public convenience and necessity, and there are a hundred others and they're all civil. Now, what you've suggested is -- well, what you say is this.  You say that the Constitution requires the creation of an administrative agency which will develop a tradition over time that will clarify, but will otherwise -- that kind of reasoning was present in the nondelegation doctrine.  So what you want to say is that which would -- that which would have saved a statute under the nondelegation doctrine, which is not fair competition, it's delegation of unriot, but which is -- gives meaning is also necessary to save a civil statute from vagueness. Hmm.  That's a very interesting holding. I'd rather read it in a law review article than I would write those words which will suddenly become real.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So I'm not -- I'm not -- do you see where I'm floating on this? I -- I see your point, it's quite similar, but I quite worry about the implications.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I was quoting Cordoza.  I'm happy to be confused with him. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is the principle of law that led to A.B. Small? No one thinks statutory words in the civil context, ""unjust or unreasonable rates,"" whether enforced by courts against railroads, or whether enforced by an agency, is unconstitutional.  No one thinks that.  A.B. Small holds that, but it holds that in the context of there having been an earlier case that struck those words down in criminal context. So what is the principle of law that it stands for?   INTERRUPTING ",15-1498

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I thought you could sue some -- but I may have it totally wrong.  I thought, suppose that in Georgia, there was some people who are drivers for the State and they go out and have an auto accident.  I thought you could sue the individual.  You can't?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let's take any State.  I'm using that as an example.  States have a lot of people driving, and one goes out on the road and gets into an auto accident.  I thought that you could sue the individual driver.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You cannot.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You mean you cannot because of the State law.   Stephen G. Breyer  Either they pass a statute or they have a State law.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so what's the --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- what -- what is our -- our -- we're deciding this as -- as a matter of what? As a matter of the Federal Constitution, aren't we?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Common law under the Indian tribe being a domestic nation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So are -- are there states that do allow you to sue somebody who -- who rear-ends you?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  But my understanding, which Justice Ginsburg said, is that, basically -- the Westfall Act is a complicated act, but, basically, if you're rear-ended by a postal employee, you can sue the government of the United States.  So a person who's the victim of an accident has recourse. Now, my guess would be that states do something similar, because it seems to me very odd that if I'm rear-ended or run over by some kind of State car which has a State driver that there's no remedy at all.   Stephen G. Breyer  There is a remedy.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  But here what we have is there is no remedy against the tribe.  And that's why I thought it would be odd to say there's no remedy at all.  And, therefore, the basic principle seemed to be that you could sue the employee, but not the State.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then they changed that through legislation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Indemnification in the Bivens actions, you say oh, those are constitutional actions.  I thought 1983 says violation of the law of the Constitution or laws of the United States.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But they are all constitutional.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So how do we deal with this.  Every tribe passes this.  You say great. Indemnify everybody.  You'll never have to pay because as soon as you do that, nobody can sue you.  And so, therefore, the tribe is totally immune from the most ordinary accidents taking place off the reservation, and the victim of now these missiles being sent out from the reservation because they run over people and there's no remedy at all. Now -- now that -- that seems to me pushing the notion of tribal sovereign immunity off the reservation into a place where there are just no remedies for victims at all.  Now, what is the answer to that?   INTERRUPTING ",15-1500
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's -- that's -- I don't know if that was the issue the Ninth Circuit thought it was facing.  You say, of course, brute facts are a question of fact. Legal standard is a question of law. But sometimes implying a label to the brute facts which are undisputed is a question of fact.  There's a good case in the Ninth Circuit you didn't find because it doesn't tell you the answer, United States v. Fifty-Three (53) Eclectus Parrots.  Is an eclectus parrot a wild bird? The statute says you can't bring in a wild bird. Now, they agreed on the facts.  If you, in fact, call in a zoologist, I would say putting the label on the fact is a question of fact.  If you call in a lawyer, ah, what does it mean, the statute, that's a question of law. And the beauty of this case is it's somewhat ambiguous.  And so -- so -- so which? What's your -- I mean, you know, is that a goldfinch over there? I made a mistake of no, it isn't actually there.  But if I had a problem with the label and called in an ornithologist, although we're agreed exactly on what it looks like, that's a factual question. You see? So -- so -- so we know that, what you're telling us so far, but what is it about this case that suggests what they were -- you and the other side were disagreeing in the lower courts? You both were agreeing about what's the -- disagreeing about what's the label, but it was a legal matter, not a factual matter of whether the well-known phrase ""arm's length transaction"" fits on these circumstances, which could be a factual matter.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's unknown among lawyers.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that's who you're dealing with.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's a --   Stephen G. Breyer  And how do they do that? I mean, you know, it might be important in some instances; in some other instances, it wouldn't be.  I mean, he lists five factors and then on -- you know, at the end of this appendix, he has about four or five more factors, and I guess he saw the people.  Did he see the people?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  He heard them. He saw them.  He thinks what is the nature of the relationship? And then he lists about nine different things. I mean, an appellate court won't see them.  An appellate court will have a cold record.  An appellate court probably can't go into the myriad details.  It will say in this situation whether it was as if between strangers or whether it wasn't.  What do you want them to do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, they can.  I'm not saying you can't.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why would you think it would be more accurate, why would it be more accurate about whether this is or is not, as if this particular financial transaction was or was not as if between strangers?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not doubting that.  I'm just doubting whether you could by having dozens of appellate courts starting to go through dozens of records and each one is a little bit different in respect to the relationship, in respect to the -- any one of these nine different factors, and that -- to think you're going to get uniformity.  That's -- that's what I'm doubting.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that an answer? Is that an answer? Didn't we just discuss that at the beginning of what I questioned? Didn't I just say sometimes, which you seem to agree, that applying a label like wild bird or transaction, applying a label to a set of undisputed facts is itself a factual matter?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You seem -- never you say?   Stephen G. Breyer  You don't agree?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Wait, wait, wait.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What is the --   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, I've not got beyond Holmes.  Holmes says that a regulatory taking violates the Constitution unless it's compensated when it goes too far.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, what you want us to do is to put some pretty clear lines in that word ""too far.""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  My problem is, I can't think of just what those lines should be, that -- that, perhaps, there are many different circumstances in many different factors. For example, in your case, I imagined that what the State was concerned about is they want to preserve a lake.  At the same time, people own some property around that lake and they used to be able to build houses.  So here's what they say.  You can build one.  One.  And it doesn't matter if you have six lap parcels not together or -- one.  One is what you can build because, after all, this Constitution is concerned about, to paraphrase Justice Warren, protecting people, not rocks. And so we look at the people and say, how does this affect them.  And in this case, you have a case, but there's some factors against you, and the -- the Federal Circuit and other opinions of ours have avoided drawing clear lines. And you see where I'm going.  And I just want your general response.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's what I'm objecting to.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, see that's -- now you're not getting my question. Because my question is: Why look for that? Is it relevant? Yes.  Is it determinative? No.  If we start making determinative rules, developers will take 500 acres.  They'll break them down into 500 different properties, State perhaps aiding in this, 500 different ones; three of them will be just wetlands, and they'll say, see, you took my three, when, actually, he started out with 500, and it wasn't a big deal. You -- you see the kind of problem? They're written about in the briefs.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I want your general reaction.   Stephen G. Breyer  But what about -- I -- of course, property is property.  But we are still dealing with a provision of the Constitution that, in the regulatory area, is designed to prevent takings that hurt somebody unreasonably.  It goes too far. So why isn't what you want to look at one more thing to look at? But we might look at others too. We might look, for example, at whether the individual who bought that property at the time he bought it knew about this restriction.  We might look at how, overall, he has hurt in any related way.  We might look, for example, at the kind of need that was there, and we might see two big questions. I mean, one big question is -- though it's awfully general -- is, is he being treated unfairly either because we're forcing on him the whole cost or a lot of the cost of something that benefits many, many others, or because we are interfering with investment-backed expectations. I mean, as you read the cases it seems to me there are a set of factors like that.  And my problem with your argument is it wants to take one and then apply a kind of mechanical test.   Stephen G. Breyer  Let me give you -- let me give you an example which might help me.  Let's go back to Holmes case.  There's a hundred acres.  There are 50 columns of coal to hold up the -- to hold up the ceiling.  That he says is okay.  No compensation.  But wait.  Suppose instead of one people -- one person owning all 50 acres, suppose 50 people each own one acre.  And in some cases, the column runs through the acre and some it doesn't.  Does that make any difference?   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't care if it's analogous or not analogous.  I'm trying to get my thinking clearer, and oddly enough --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- different things make my thinking clearer, and --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- this may be one of them. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  You opinion -- in your opinion, if, in the Holmes case, instead of one person owning the whole 50 acres as one lot, there would have been 50 people who each owned an acre.  Now, it looks the same, you know, the columns are in the same place, et cetera, and you're saying that does make a difference.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes or no?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what about adding here when I look to see the reasonableness of the regulation.  I mean, suppose in Holmes' case, the regulation had said you have to leave columns of a thousand feet of coal.  But every expert said, or everyone who knew about it, said you don't need more than 50 feet.   Richard J. Lazarus  Well, certainly it's true, the ultimate analysis, you pay attention to reasonableness. You -- you pay attention to whether the government -- you don't get to accept the government saying it doesn't automatically qualify --   Stephen G. Breyer  Does that fit in your three?   Richard J. Lazarus  Absolutely, Your Honor.  It fits under Penn Central.  And in this case -- in this case, this is really the easy case.  It's almost a sui generis case because the -- the State law at issue was one which -- which is premised on the notion that under this circumstance you actually don't face such a great hardship.  That's exactly why they don't get the exemption. This isn't -- they are not challenging restriction.  They're actually challenging not getting exemption which someone else is getting.  And the reason they're not getting that exemption is they don't have the same hardship that other people have. The -- the owner of the isolated lot, substandard lot, asks for some kind of exemption.  They face the prospect of a complete economic wipeout.  But the owner of two substandard adjacent lots, they don't. That person, like the Murrs, they have development options. In addition, they have the opportunity, as I said before, to created value, value that doesn't exist separate.  And in this case, the value of joining the property together, the reason why this property -- which is beautiful property, stunningly beautiful, St. Croix River, at the bend of the river.  The reason why it's so valuable is two things: River frontage and privacy. That's the touchstone of value here. Lot F is only 58 feet wide at the bottom, the distance between the two columns in this room, and right next to a public area.  Lot E has a hundred feet, twice that, of river frontage.  And off to the west, more privacy.  When you add those two lots together, the value of this luxury lot at the bend of the river is so great, it actually almost overcomes the loss of value of not having the second home on the lot.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is this right? Just say yes or no, and if it's wrong, I'll figure it out later. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  Are you saying -- look, of course you look at the lines that the State draws, but that isn't determinative because you want to know the total impact on the person, which may get you to look at nearby property or other things.  You want to know how reasonable this regulation that affects it is; you want to know whether he knew when he bought it, and perhaps there are others. Is that basically what you're saying? You're not denying that you look at the State's lines. It's just that they are not determinative?   Richard J. Lazarus  Mr. Chief Justice, may I answer the question?   ",15-214X

I mean, you have a statute that prohibits importing a vegetable that isn't a fish, and we can't read ""vegetable"" as ""fish."" I mean, it just isn't.  And what I'm having is the problem of the language.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let -- let me show you. The term ""State,"" just as she said it, includes the District of -- of Columbia and Puerto Rico.   Stephen G. Breyer  Where do we find that? In the first part of Title 11, which has to do with bankruptcy.  So what it seems to be doing is it's the whole Bankruptcy Code.  It's 11.  So when I see the word ""State,"" that includes Puerto Rico. And then it says, ""except for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under Chapter 9."" So I go back, I look at it, and it says -- one of the things, it says, well, a State law prescribing a method of composition of indebtedness.  That is not for the purpose of defining who is a debtor under -- under Chapter 9.  So what am I supposed to do about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What the first part of the tree says is, State, nothing we say really stops you from controlling your municipality, except in one important respect.   Stephen G. Breyer  And the important respect is that you cannot have your own bankruptcy law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I read it as a decision tree.  What am I supposed to say?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know that.   Stephen G. Breyer  They can't be a debtor.   Stephen G. Breyer  So -- so then where -- where -- where in the Code, except for this provision -- are there dozens of places? 20? A thousand? -- where the word ""State"" is used outside of Chapter 9's debtor provisions where then it makes sense to read Puerto Rico into it?   Stephen G. Breyer  About 40?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And you have them in your brief?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, but I -- is there some reference? I can get them?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All I have to do is to get myself to do the following thing: I could dress it up so people couldn't understand it.  But what I would be doing is saying the following: It says a State law, and it says the chapter does not limit or impair the power of a State, okay, et cetera, et cetera.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, all I have to say is that word ""State"" right there does not include Puerto Rico.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  My only problem with writing those words is somebody is going to direct me to the provision a little bit later where it says the word ""State"" in Title 11, of which this is part, means Puerto Rico.  Okay?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, that -- that's hard for me to do because of that language.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That may be, but I can't say that an ""airplane"" means a horse. (Laughter.)   ",15-233X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But it doesn't have to be just that.  He has some -- an additional string to the bow; that is, what he wants us to do is to take the words ""a State"" -- ""this chapter does not limit or impair the power of a State,"" which is in 903.  Now, he wants us to read that as if there were then a parentheses, ""a State that is a debtor under Chapter 9."" You see? And that a State -- what States? The States that can be debtors under Chapter 9. Now, that's how he wants us to read it, and that means that that provision does not apply to Puerto Rico or D.C.  But it isn't just that no part of Chapter 9 could apply to them.  It is that if you look at the first sentence of 903, is that what it says is that those States that are referred to in that first sentence maintain all the power to control by legislation or otherwise a municipality. And he says, what could that apply to? Those entities that are not in Chapter 9 obviously have all the powers they normally had, but the ones that are in Chapter 9 might not.  And so what this Section 903 is addressed to are those States that are in Chapter 9, because there's no need to apply that first sentence to anyone else, and therefore it doesn't apply to Puerto Rico, that first sentence.  But since the key sentences, one and two, are subparts of the first sentence, they don't apply, either. I think that's the whole argument.  And it isn't requiring us to really play that much -- you don't play games with the words.  All you do is say, this is one of those parts of Chapter 9 -- not all, but one of those parts -- that even though it doesn't use the word ""debtor"" under Chapter 9, applies only to debtors under Chapter 9.  I think that's the argument I got, and is that -- that's, I think, probably consistent with what Justice Kagan was saying.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You got it? Do you see what I'm saying?   Stephen G. Breyer  Good.  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  But not -- no.  In -- my guess is, if we go through Chapter 9, and the parts that will -- do apply to debtors under Chapter 9 --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- whoa, whoa, whoa -- municipalities.  State municipalities. If we go through Chapter 9 and look at those portions of Chapter 9 that do apply to municipalities who are there legitimately as debtors, we will find some sentences that clearly apply only to those who are in there as debtors and clearly do not apply to anyone else in the world.  And he is saying this is one of those.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So you're saying is -- I take it you're -- that you say -- you say -- you're just used to this.  So you don't understand that I'm not used to it.  And the -- the -- you -- you go look at 903.  There -- there are three separate sentences.  And you're saying that the -- the first sentence and second and third are really separate things.  That number 2 and 3, which are numbered 1 and 2, have a big objective. If I read the cases you cite, I will say Congress intended something very clear.  They didn't want those States who weren't in Chapter 9.  They didn't want those States who were not in Chapter 9.  They didn't want them to make rules for bankruptcy of municipalities, not binding rules, anyway.  That was their purpose. And there's just no reason to think that when they had the specific thing before, they wanted somehow to let Puerto Rico and District of Columbia do it, do what the States couldn't do.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And you say, well, there is a good reason.  They said the good reason is the States can come in to 9, and they can't.  And you say, well, that isn't a good enough reason. Is that where -- have I got this?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Referencing that, can you give me one more thing? Give me your best either Law Review article, treatise, legislative history, whatever it is, that will -- that will show me that, in your view, look, these are separate things.  This -- the first sentence was not meant to be just a gateway into -- into 1 and 2, that -- that it was designed to do what you say.  What do I --   ",15-233X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What I think the Chief Justice asked -- I don't want to take words out of his mouth -- but I think the question was, one of the two lines that's been asked, is that in the district opinion at page 7, the district court has said that if the ASC regulation goes into effect, there will be one facility left in Austin, two in Dallas, one in Fort Worth, two in Houston, and either one or two in San Antonio.  And before that, he said that the enforcement of the appointment privileges, the privileges of admission, would reduce the number from 20 down to about -- from 40 down to about 20. Now, I think the question was, what evidence did those findings rest upon? As you've heard, the other side, I think, say there is no such evidence, or the court of appeals said there is no such evidence. So can you give a brief account or page numbers that will show that those findings, the diminishment of the number from about 40 to about eight, which is what the district court found, rested upon some evidence? What was that evidence?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What'd they say? Could you give us any record references later or on rebuttal?   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought that the Grossman affidavit, which I have -- I grant you, it's going on the briefs -- but it said at Table -- affidavit page 9, Table 2, says that the number of abortions that are, on average, performed annually at the remaining clinics is 2,000.  So let's multiply by 2, and you get 16.  Let's multiply by 3; you get 24.  There were 70,000, approximately, women who needed these procedures. So I -- I had taken that.  Is it that accurate?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   ",15-274X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  And you asked to put in this evidence, and then the court said no, we will not let you put in the evidence?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I asked, did you ask to put in this evidence?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Thank you very much. Okay. I'd like to go back to the -- the question that Justice Ginsburg was asking, which is about what is the benefit of this procedure. There are two laws.  I am focusing on the first law.  The first law says that a doctor at the abortion clinic must have admitting privileges in a hospital 30 miles within that -- nearby, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Prior to that law, the law was that the clinic had to have a working arrangement to transfer such a patient, correct? I'm just reading it from this.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So I want to know, go back in time to the period before the new law was passed, where in the record will I find evidence of women who had complications, who could not get to a hospital, even though there was a working arrangement for admission, but now they could get to a hospital because the doctor himself has to have admitting privileges? Which were the women? On what page does it tell me their names, what the complications were, and why that happened?   Stephen G. Breyer  But so --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- Judge Posner then seems to be correct where he says he could find in the entire nation, in his opinion, only one arguable example of such a thing, and he's not certain that even that one is correct. So what is the benefit to the woman of a procedure that is going to cure a problem of which there is not one single instance in the nation, though perhaps there is one, but not in Texas. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't ask that.  I'm sure there are people who had all kinds of reasons that would like to have this and so forth.  And I'm not -- I'm just asking you, where we have a judicial duty to say whether this is an undue burden upon the woman who wants the abortion, there are two parts: Is she burdened and what is the benefit? And now on the first one, I've asked you to give a single example of an instance where there was a benefit, and you say, I think quite honestly, there is no such burden. So let's turn to the second.  The second one, according to the amicus briefs here, which I guess I could validate, that even without the surgical center, leave it out, there are risks quite correct.  Those risks are roughly the same as the risks that you have in a dentist office when you have some surgery, where you don't have an ambulatory surgical center.  There are 28 times less than a risk of a colonoscopy, where you don't have ambulatory surgical center.  There are like hundreds of times less -- you've seen these briefs. Okay.  So I read them, and you read them. And so what is the benefit here to giving, I mean, the woman, her risk, I can't say it's zero here, this ambulatory surgical center when the risk is minuscule compared to common procedures that women run every day in other areas without ambulatory surgical centers?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't see where this fits in, I mean, to the argument.  I -- I don't question their purpose.  I won't question their purpose.   Stephen G. Breyer  But the -- the -- what their purpose is, that they're worried about these complications and they want to make life safer for the women.  All right? Let's take that as the purpose. You said there aren't very many complications.  Now, would you say if you reduce the number of clinics, as has been argued -- maybe it isn't exactly that, but that -- and you -- you suddenly have at least 10,000 -- maybe a few less, and maybe a few more -- women who have to travel 150 miles to get their abortion -- maybe more, maybe stay overnight, maybe try to scrape together the money, you understand the argument -- are there going to be more women or fewer women who die of complications due to an effort to create an abortion? I mean, you read the briefs, and you've read the same articles I have.  And of course the argument is if you lead to self-induced abortion, you will find many more women dying.  So if the concern is this tiny risk of dying through a complication in a clinic, is this a remedy that will in fact achieve the legislature's health-saving purpose?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'd like to hear what he says.   ",15-274X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Sometimes it doesn't.  But I joined Bennett, and the reason I joined it is it says in the second prong, ""Or from which legal consequences flow."" So I would assume that nothing in Bennett -- or I would have dissented -- is intended to overrule what I think is the great case on the matter, which is Abbott Labs. And Harlan, in Abbott Labs, explains completely and thoroughly what this Court has done in Frozen Food Express, what the Court did in Storer.  And on the point you're now making, what he says specifically is the ICC order is right for review, even though it would have no effect until later.  Someone decided to bring a particular action. He says that in Storer, the Commission, policy determination is ripe, even though it would not issue a television license -- that's what the policy said -- even though no specific application was before the court.  So it wouldn't take effect until later. And the same thing is true precisely of the order in Abbott Labs itself.  It was a statement of interpreting what the Commission would do, and nothing was going to happen.  Nothing happened, unless later on somebody decided to violate it.  Much like this.  And even if they violated it, nothing would happen, unless the Commission decided to prosecute. So what Justice Ginsburg said was, once this is in effect, okay, now what happens? The person who is subject to it has to take certain steps because of the law.  One, spend $150,000 to try to get an exception and fail, or two, do nothing, violate it, and possibly go to prison.  Those sound like important legal consequences that flow from an order that, in respect to the Agency, is final, for it has nothing left to do about that interpretation. And B, is perfectly suited for review in the courts. So we have harm flowing from a change in legal relations, we have an agency that has nothing left to do on this particular matter, and we have a court that is perfectly suited to review it.  I would say it flows from Abbott Labs, almost QED.  So what is your -- what is your response to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Then he goes to jail.  I mean, you put in your brief he risks it.  In your brief -- and I think the point raised, of course, you -- it's a good idea to give people advice.  Abbott Labs takes care of that.  One of the three important features of Abbott Labs is you look at it from the point of view of the Agency.  And you say, how formal is it? What was there left to be done? And in this case, we have a whole set, a whole part of the CFR which is devoted this, which goes to varied -- it's called ""Jurisdictional Determination from Instructional Guidebook."" The Army Corps of Engineers is brought in.  Once they make a determination, it's called the Agency's official view. It's stated it remains in effect for five years, unless conditions change. And you, in your brief, say that the issuance of an approved jurisdictional determination marks the culmination of the distinct process by which the Corps informs a landowner whether the Corps believes that covered waters are present. So that doesn't sound like someone giving informal advice, and there's an appeal process.  It sounds like a formal system of answering a question, which question is: Are these lands wetlands, Federal or not? Now, if you give some kind of informal advice, fine.  You'd come to a different result.  But I've just listed the things here that suggest it isn't at all formal.  It's a five -- informal.  It's a five-year formal, definite procedurally guided CFR determination.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Well, if that's so, we have the other part of the problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It isn't just the pressure.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's both.  And the concern on the other side, beyond the EPA, is this is a vast Federal government.  And this vast Federal government can operate -- can issue many, many formal determinations on aspects of the statute.  And if people are -- people are required to follow those, without court review, on penalty of going to jail if they don't just follow it, or are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars, what happens to judicial review? That, I think, is also a public policy question.   INTERRUPTING ",15-290X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The question is why.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why.  I think -- I think, if I understand the question, you go into district court and you say we're from Alaska, and here we are in Florida and we don't belong here, there's no jurisdiction.  And the court says you're wrong.  Now, that means you have to stay there.  You have to go through the whole proceeding.  It's going to cost you one million dollars.  It's going to take a long time, but you don't get independent review of the jurisdictional question. So I think the question is, if I may say it --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- is -- is why doesn't that apply here, too? Because this is just like one part of the whole thing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Nothing --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- is like the jurisdictional question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, this says that nothing's going to happen to you until they decide that they're not going to give you a permit, which is part of it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  I mean, I've made mine, but I'm going to the question.   Stephen G. Breyer  It isn't just -- that isn't -- the issue, I think, is this -- what I thought your answer would be is that informal advice is not final Agency action normally. There is a statute.  It was passed in 1946. It's called the Administrative Procedures Act.  It tries to divide such things with that word, ""final,"" as rulemaking by the Agency, from accomplishing roughly the same result by never having a rule but just telling everybody informally what the Agency will do in such circumstances.  It might be that the formal is, other things being equal, final Agency action in respect to that matter.  It might be that the latter is not. So I think what you're telling me is what I should do next is go read those Federal rules and regulations and see, is this more like informal advice, or is it more like formal rulemaking? And you have the latter, and they have the former, I guess.  I don't know.  And I go and make up my mind.  I guess that's my job in this instance.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, if Frozen Food, Storer and Abbott Labs, and Bennett too, are examples of what falls on the formal final side of the line.   Stephen G. Breyer  A few other things will be on the other side of the line.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's not --   ",15-290X

But, I mean, is anybody here now claiming that the sentence was unconstitutional at the time?   Stephen G. Breyer  You have? Where did you say that in your brief? Because they say you didn't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  I'm saying in your brief in this Court, have you claimed that the sentence, the proceeding in the Indian court violated the Federal Constitution?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Well, then, I take it that for purposes here, you concede that.  I don't see how you can get around the fact you haven't complained. So if it's a valid conviction, why can't you use it? I mean, you could -- you could sentence people to more; that's what Nichols says.  You could sentence them to three times the sentence without any conviction. You would just introduce some evidence that he hit his wife before badly. You could -- you could raise the sentence if it was a civil -- if it was a civil case.  And -- and there was a judgment in favor of the wife, I take it. So why can't you raise the sentence on the ground that there is a valid conviction, period? End of the case. Which is, I think, what Nichols said.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  But you have told me that you have not -- I don't see how you could send a person to prison on the basis of the -- the lack -- where there's no counsel.  If the Indian tribes can do that, then I don't see why the Federal government can't later use it if that's valid.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then we should hold that -- I guess, that all of the convictions in all the tribes that are using, going to jail where people might go to prison for more than six months or at all, for a day, all those are invalid.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So how does it work with diversity? We have a complaint; Petitioner or plaintiff, I'm from Kentucky.  Plaintiff, my defendant is from Illinois.  Okay? Filed.  Response: Hey, I'm not from Illinois.  I'm from Kentucky too. All right.  How does the judge -- what does the judge do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  When?   Stephen G. Breyer  When?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  And --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- that's to determine if there is jurisdiction?   Stephen G. Breyer  And you're saying that should be the same here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So if we take --   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I was thinking, I can't get my hands around this case, or my mind around it, because it -- it seems to me it's really about a practical matter.  And the practical matter is when should the judge in this kind of case decide whether or not there really is a claim here, a legitimate claim they can win on that falls within the category.  Rather like diversity. And the answer is, it's a foreign country, and sovereignty is at issue.  Do it as soon as you can in an ordinary case.  But if you have something special, maybe you can't.  Judge, you run your own trial, but keep that in mind.  We don't want to have foreign countries in our courts when there isn't really a -- a pretty good case against them, and maybe a winning case. So decide this thing quickly, decide it up front.  But to start talking about jurisdiction and these things, I can't really understand as well as, say, Justice Ginsburg, who taught jurisdiction.  And -- and I -- why are we in this? Why don't we just give them that practical advice?   Stephen G. Breyer  You're -- actually, I'm getting pushed the other way.  I came in on your side, but I swing back and forth.   Elaine J. Goldenberg  Oh, dear.   Stephen G. Breyer  But this is what's really bothering me: It sounds, the more I hear you speak, that there isn't a good thing that we're going to write in this case that isn't going to get everybody good and mixed up, because it reminds me of a case where we set a kind of order of battle, as first you have to decide the jurisdiction, and then you decide this.  And I've never received so much criticism from the district judges as for that case.   Elaine J. Goldenberg  Well, also --   Stephen G. Breyer  Because they tell us that cases differ a lot one from the other.  Let us do what's practical in the circumstances. There are three kinds of issues that can come up.  There's a set of facts.  Those facts might be in dispute.  If you find one way, there is the jurisdiction.  Find the other way, there isn't. There is a second kind of issue: that we take the facts as given.  Do they, in fact, fall within the definition of this statute? And that can even exist in a diversity case.  Somebody's from Guam or somebody -- you know, that's the kind of -- does it really fall within, or is it just possible that it falls within Federal law arising under diversity or this? And then there's the third kind of case: Are you so far out that it isn't even hopeful that you could get into the court on this? Now, if you take the third, which is where we are, you leave it up to the district judge to decide the other two when and if it's most suitable in the case.  If you don't, I'm worried.   Elaine J. Goldenberg  But in that circumstance, you are asserting jurisdiction over a foreign State based on a nonfrivolous allegation, and that is something that doesn't respect the foreign State's dignity --   Stephen G. Breyer  Because you are, in fact, asserting jurisdiction over somebody who's from Guam. Because, in fact, you'd have to go into the birth conditions and all kinds of things.  The judge wants to put that off for a while because of other things that might dispose of the case.   Elaine J. Goldenberg  Understood.  But this is a special context in which there is a real dignitary harm to the foreign State if the courts of another country sit in judgment as to something that foreign State --   ",15-423X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know that that's a different issue, I think.  Suppose in a diversity case, A says, I'm from Kentucky.  And B says -- and he says B is from Illinois.  B files an answer: No, I'm from Kentucky.  No diversity. Doesn't the judge normally make that determination right then and there?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then why should it be any different here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, so what? I mean, the reason you do make that right at the beginning, I have always thought, was not a mystical thing.  It's because you don't want to haul somebody across the country in different places when there isn't even diversity jurisdiction. Here, though, the reasoning isn't quite the same.  They say, try it out at the beginning whether there is at least a claim here, real claim, that they did seize the violation -- they did seize the property, violation of international law.  That way we don't bring China or someplace all the way over to the United States and cause all kinds of problems without there really being something.  So do it at the beginning, Judge, don't wait till the end of the case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So what difference does it make? And here I'm --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- I'm not asking an argumentative question.  I don't know. What difference does it make whether you move under 12(b)(6) or move under 12(b)(1)?   Stephen G.

Stephen G. Breyer  So in your view, on the Chief Justice's hypothetical, before -- your view is they move under 12(b)(6) right away and they would say you aren't entitled to relief because you only own 49 percent?   ",15-423X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But the question that Justice Kennedy asked, and I think it's an important one, to me, anyway, was, if you -- forget this proceeding.  If, in fact, in the broadest possible, or whatever, reasonable interpretation and you were in front of the Patent Office, and that's what they would look at, and if it was too broad because that broad, you know, it has flaws in it of whatever kind, the patent doesn't issue.  Is that right or not right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's either right or wrong. You can tell me I'm right, or you can tell me I'm wrong.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know that.  I'm saying: If at the end of the day, on the broadest reasonable interpretation, it is not patentable, there is no patent issued.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- if that's so, you could look at this new law as -- as -- as you were looking at it, as trying to build a little court proceeding.  If I thought it was just doing that, I would say you were right. But there is another way to look at it.  And the other way to look at it -- and that's what I would like your comment about -- is that there are these things, for better words, let's call them patent trolls, and that the -- the Patent Office has been issuing billions of patents that shouldn't have been issued -- I overstate -- but only some.  And what happens is some person in business gets this piece of paper and -- and looks at it and says, oh, my God, I can't go ahead with my invention. And so what we're trying to do with this process is to tell the office, you've been doing too much too fast.  Go back and let people who are hurt by this come in and get rid of those patents that shouldn't have been issued.  Now, we will give you, again, once the same chance we gave you before, and that is you can amend it once if you convince the judge you should have done it before.  But if, on the broadest possible interpretation, you know, reasonable interpretation, it shouldn't have been issued, we're canceling it.  And -- and that is for the benefit of those people who were suffering from too many patents that shouldn't have been issued in the first place.  I don't know. If it's that second purpose, then I would think, well, maybe this is right, what they're doing. And if it's ambiguous between those two purposes, I would begin to think, well, maybe they should have the power themselves under Chevron, Meade, or whatever, to decide which to do. Now, that's -- that's the argument, I think, that's in my mind registering the other way.  So what do you say?   Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   ",15-446X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Is that --   Stephen G. Breyer  What's the evidence? That is to say, I picked that up from your brief, that this statute is, in part -- call it a partial-Groundhog-Day statute.  You'll do it again until you get it right, and partly, it's designed here to go back to the -- I -- to the Patent Office, probably because a large number of businessmen told Congress that they were getting threats of suits in respect to patents that obviously should never have been issued. Now, if that was the problem, then it doesn't make -- it does make sense to say at least the PTO has the authority under a partial-Groundhog-Day statute to do that part of it over.  And that's not surprising; there are only six that actually got amended, because they narrowed it before and because the PTO held these are invalid, anyway.  Okay? That isn't -- so that doesn't move me. But look at the view I just expressed of the statute.  There is another view that this is just a little district court proceeding designed to save people that time and money that they'd have to spend on a big district court proceeding.  All right? Now, what's the evidence that the first view that I had, which would not say this is just a little district court proceeding, is correct?   Stephen G. Breyer  How -- how does this happen? I -- I thought we send it back, and the PTO says we shouldn't have issued it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They say that we cancel it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

He says, Judge, I have nothing really left of my case.  They can move for summary judgment or -- and let them move for the defendant. You -- I -- it must be weird if the defendant doesn't.  I mean, I can't imagine such a case. But if he didn't, I guess the trial court would say, defendant, move for summary judgment. (Laughter.)   Stephen G.

The case is over.  How does it work.   Stephen G. Breyer  It would be the defendant who moves for summary judgment, and then it will be entered in his favor.  And then the plaintiff, of course, will have an appeal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I would think that was the normal system.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

At that point, what is the plaintiff supposed to do? You think the judge's ruling is wrong? He doesn't want to pursue a claim that's only going to be worth 10 cents, because, of that, he's most likely to get no more than two cents for the lawyer himself.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.

There's a lot of case law that says you can't just express a future intent, and we're being technical.  It says you have to make a conditional dismissal.  We dismiss under the condition that we are -- you know, that we're going to appeal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

It says, ""An expression of intent is not a reservation of a right to appeal."" So you're in a dilemma.

But if you don't reserve something, you're in the box you're in right now and the case is over.  And so you think of this thing called ""intent,"" which is perhaps an unknown creature before you thought of it.  I don't know. And then you say, aha.  We're not really conditionally dismissing, so we're not out for that reason, but we all are reserving an intent, and therefore, we get to say that it's final and can appeal the issue.  The Rules Committee, having worried about yours and similar problems, says here's what we'll do for you.  We'll give you that (f) interlocutory appeal. Now, why should I not think about the case just that way?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there anything terrible that would happen if, say, the precedent leaves this open, and looking to try to simplify procedure, we'd say: If we take the other side, we leave to people in your position.  Ask the Court of appeals for permission under F. Now, sometimes they'll wrongfully deny it. Well, if they wrongly deny it, here's what you do.  Go litigate your case and lose, or give up and then appeal that final judgment for them. Now, there could be a few cases where that won't work either.  But they're likely to be so few and far between that the simplicity of that and people knowing what to do is better than having 14 different cases in conflict in the different circuits and trying to figure out what we're trying to figure out now.

And -- and the difference here turns on whether the jury is still in the courtroom or whether they've gone into the hallway and is asked, did anybody talk to you? No.  Okay.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  It seems to me when you say ""urging"" -- now, wait.  See, I can go back to a lot of different commission, the Brown Commission, the Senate S1, the language of the statute, and I read ""official action,"" something quite similar to the statute here, ""A decision, opinion, recommendation, judgment, vote, or other conduct"" -- perhaps other similar conduct -- ""involving an exercise of discretion."" So in this case, the official action we're talking about is giving money to a group of people in the university to conduct a study. Now, the Governor didn't do that.  But a person who tries to influence an official action and is also in the government is also guilty.  But wait. That's the Indian case.   Stephen G. Breyer  But wait.  The word ""influence"" is too broad, because every day of the week politicians write on behalf of constituents letters to different parts of the government, saying, will you please look at the case of Mrs. So-and-so who was evicted last week? And that's so common, you can't pick that up. But then you use the word ""urge."" That's not exactly a legal word.  And what I'm looking for is a set of words that will describe in both sides' positions what we should write as the words that describe the criminal activity involved in talking to or influencing the person who does create the official act, like give a pardon.   Stephen G. Breyer  Like award a contract, like vote, like -- et cetera.  Now, those are the words that I can't find, and I'd appreciate your opinion.   Stephen G. Breyer  You want to use ""attempt to influence""? My goodness.  Letters go by the dozens over to the secretary of HUD, to the secretary --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- of -- of HHS, to the secretary or the assistant secretaries, and they say, my Constituent Smith has a matter before you that has been pending for 18 months; we would appreciate it if you would review that and take action.  And then the elected official says to Smith, I did my best on this.  And Smith thinks, good, he's used his influence.   Stephen G. Breyer  A crime? My goodness.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Fine.   Stephen G. Breyer  You say ""absolutely not."" That's what I thought that you would say.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So I want to know -- but the words you used were ""attempt to influence."" And so -- though I don't think that's the right word, and I want to know what the right words are --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- in the instruction that the judge is going to give.  Not in your case --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- but in general.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Of course they are.  But you have to have the standard that will distinguish the urger --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- from the one who does it criminally and the one who doesn't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Mm-hmm.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, there we have it. There we have it.  All these letters going over, saying, please look at Mrs. Smith's eviction notice.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Mrs. Smith, who, by the way, took me to lunch last week. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That won't do it.  The one you just read won't do it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So you use that.  The key to the word in there is ""merely.""   Stephen G. Breyer  Because sometimes it could.   Stephen G. Breyer  And somebody might have the embarrassing question, merely when it can or merely when it can't.  Give me a little enlightenment.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's Birdsall.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's Birdsall.  Look, I can -- I've read the Brown Commission Report.  I've read the Model Penal Code.  I've read all these efforts to get language.  And I've looked at the present statute. And I think I can limit that because the statute, itself, seems to cover things like voting and contracts, et cetera.  But it's also true that a person who tries to influence those things has committed bribery.  I think that's correct.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, my problem is with Birdsall and how do we write those words so that they do catch people who are doing this dishonest thing without, as I've said five times, allowing the government the freedom to go and do these ridiculous cases.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  It's not a campaign contribution.  What it is, is he takes him to lunch, and an expensive lunch at that.  Okay? Because the quid side is not limited.  The government has argued continuously that in for a penny, in for a pound.  Okay? So we don't have the limitation on the quid side.  We have a possible limitation in frame of mind. And now we're looking to the quo side.  And you want to remove any limitation there.  Okay? Now, why do I think that's a problem? Two very fundamental reasons.  And it's not because I'm in favor of dishonest behavior.  I'm against it.  And we have just listed some that is dishonest.  My problem is the criminal law as the weapon to cure it.  And if the criminal law is the weapon that goes as far as you want, there are two serious problems.  One, political figures will not know what they're supposed to do and what they're not supposed to do, and that's a general vagueness problem. And the second is, I'd call it a separation of powers problem.  The Department of Justice in the Executive Branch becomes the ultimate arbiter of how public officials are behaving in the United States, State, local, and national.  And as you describe it, for better or for worse, it puts at risk behavior that is common, particularly when the quid is a lunch or a baseball ticket, throughout this country. Now, suddenly, to give that kind of power to a criminal prosecutor, who is virtually uncontrollable, is dangerous in the separation of powers since.  So in my mind -- right in this case, nothing to do with this Petitioner, nothing to do with him, but in this case, is a -- as fundamental a real separation of -- of powers problem as I've seen. And -- and I'm not quite certain what the words are.  They won't be perfect.  They will leave some dishonest conduct unprosecuted.  They won't be perfect. They will put some politicians at risk.  But I'm searching for those words because, as I said, this is a very basic separation of powers problem for me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I appreciate your help on what the right words are, and I'll tell you right now if those words are going to say when a person has lunch and then writes over to the antitrust division and says, I'd like you to meet with my constituent who has just been evicted from her house, you know, if that's going to criminalize that behavior, I'm not buying into that, I don't think. So -- so I want some words that will help with what I see as as naughty and complicated and difficult and basic a problem as I can think of.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no one said it is.  The lunch with the Chateau Lafite wine happens to be the quid, and -- and that's worth, like, a thousand dollars, or 500, anyway.  I don't go to those restaurants anymore. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But -- but you understand that --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- side.  It's the other side of the equation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Of course it isn't.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but how -- but you're asking --   Stephen G. Breyer  What is it they're trying to prove? Now, of course, this is a State case, not a Federal case.  It's a State official -- it's a Federal law but a State official.  I don't know.  I've only been peripherally involved in political campaigns, but my peripheral convinces me that a candidate will go out and he'll have lunch with hundreds of people, hundreds. Everybody wants to give him lunch.  Great.  And -- and he wants to meet as many people as possible.  He wants to be friendly.  He might receive a raincoat.  He might receive all kinds of things.  And at some point, it becomes very dishonest.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But that's a matter for campaign laws. Wait.  Now, I've also been involved in the Justice Department.  And we would receive many, many letters in the antitrust division.  Have you looked into such and such? I know perfectly well that that Senator just wants to go back to the constituent and say, see, I did my best.  That's all. Now, you're saying to the jury, take those facts I just gave you, and you look into the state of mind -- the state of mind of which the amounts being given will be somewhat indicative, of which the nature of the letter will be somewhat indicative, of whether he writes in personal writing at the bottom will be somewhat indicative, and we're going to let you 12 people work out what was really in that Senator's mind. I say that is a recipe for giving the Department of Justice and the prosecutors enormous power over elected officials who are not necessarily behaving honestly. And I am looking for the line.  I am looking for the line that will control the shift of power that I fear without allowing too much honesty through this law. You know, other laws exist on the other side.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That -- that's what I want your view on.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I want, your view.   Stephen G. Breyer  But, I mean --   Stephen G. Breyer  But that's the point.  You see, what -- exactly what the Chief Justice asked. What's the lower limit, in the government's opinion, on the quid? What? Tell me right now.  What -- if you're going to say $10,000, okay, I feel quite differently about this.  If you will say an afternoon of trout fishing or et cetera, then I feel quite differently. It's pretty hard to see the conduct being honest if you exempt the campaign contributions and put it up somewhere.  But I didn't think that was the government's position.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is the government's position -- what -- you tell me I'm wrong, in for a penny, in for a pound.  You tell me right now it is not the government's position that the trout fishing afternoon is sufficient to be a -- a quid.  If you say that, I'll feel differently about the case. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But now --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You tell me -- that's why I asked you at the beginning.  And you -- in order to be -- you say you're going to push back, and then you complained about their definition.  If I thought their definition was so perfect, I wouldn't have asked you. And -- and it's -- it's exactly -- you do -- you tell me how to do this.  And I'm not -- you say it sends a terrible message.  I'm not in the business of sending messages in a case like this.  I'm in the business of trying to figure out the structure of the government. And that's part of Separation of Powers, and I expressed my concern.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I dissented in -- in Citizens United, so whatever that said there, but -- (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  The -- the -- but the point is the one I raised at the beginning that every single one of us has raised.  We're worried about -- because like any other organization, the prosecutors too can be overly zealous.  That can happen.  And so we need some protection on both sides, even though the line won't be perfect.  And it will fail to catch some crooks.  And it will -- I mean, I understand that.  And -- and I want to know your view.  And it doesn't even -- it helps a little, but not a lot, to say, well, meetings.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's too specific.  I want to know what your view is as to the language we write in discussing the line.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no.  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  I did -- (Laughter.)

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What's awfully difficult in this case is not your case for me.  It's not your case. It's the hundreds -- or not hundreds -- but look at all the briefs filed.  There -- there are disqualification rules all over the law, and suddenly to turn this into a constitutional matter as we did with Caperton, which we did with our eyes open, we don't know what we're getting into.  I mean, there are congressmen who can become judges who voted on statutes that come before them, as Justice Black did.  There are executive branch officials who decide all kinds of things, and later on, something with their name signed on it comes up.  When does the Constitution require it or not? So that's why I think you're getting these questions. My question is: Is there a way of avoiding this? And -- and the -- the thing that is suggested by -- by the other side is that you did ask for reconsideration.  Reconsideration would have taken place without the chief justice because he had retired. Reconsideration can be pretty perfunctory, or it might be serious and thorough. Is there anything -- is there a way for us to send this back and say, you said you reconsidered it; we're not certain what that reconsideration consists of; reconsider it. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, is there a way to do that, and what do you think of that? That's what they're suggesting.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can we tell them to do that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  So -- so we could say, given all the facts, of which there are quite a few, and the filing of a motion for reconsideration, and the fact that they may not have done it, go reconsider it, period.  End of -- end of opinion.  Can we do that?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I was hoping. (Laughter.)   ",15-5040
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, this is common in the situation where someone's appointed to this Court. There are a series of cases where he had sat, that judge.  And very often they are decided by the two people who remain.  They don't rehear the whole case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And in that case, there was nothing wrong with the participation at the time.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The harder point is the judge from Guam, I think, who wasn't supposed to sit in the Ninth Circuit.  And again, I think we -- the decisions went ahead.  The same thing could come up with recess appointments, and there are many of those.  And -- but I don't know where there's a disqualification of the judge because of bias.  Now, in that kind of situation, is there any precedent that supports you, or maybe the other way?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I'm not saying -- what I'm looking for is a disqualification because of bias, because in that circumstance there's something biased about that judge being in that panel.  Now, in that situation --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- I can think of a lot of others that I've just mentioned.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In that situation, are there instances -- how does it cut? What does the ABA say about that one and -- and what have you found?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Recuses because -- go ahead.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, but there -- there's a difference, you see, where the judge recuses himself during the process.  The remaining judges know that.  And because they know that, they make an effort to decide it among the two. Where the judge didn't recuse himself during the process, the other judges take his point of view into account, just as they would if they're in any ordinary circumstance.  Now, in practice, I think that's a big difference.   Stephen G. Breyer  Not -- not in an instance where you know that you shouldn't because that judge --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- should not have participated.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You can't know it at the moment.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But -- but what you -- what you do know at the moment is that the two judges, or six, or whoever were there didn't think we must ignore his situation, what he thinks.  They didn't think that, so of course, they didn't. In the situation that they're talking about in the ABA, I take it the remaining judges do know that they are not to take into account the opinion of the judge who is out of it.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's not this question.  I had the same question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Once you're there -- I mean, my thought was the same as Justice Alito's: Vast range of violations.  Some don't hurt really at all. Some are sort of accidental.  Some are certainly not bad faith and they didn't cause much trouble.  Really, why dismiss the case? And once you begin to agree with that, you're into argument 2.  And once you're into argument 2, what do you think of the Lujan factors?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But the clients did not know that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  On the record, does it show that they did know it or they didn't know it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not correct.  It was a question.  Either they did know it or they didn't know it.  What does the record say about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  But on the question of whether they knew it or not.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why did you never ask them or the lawyer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So here we have ambiguity as respect to that.  Could I write an opinion that said the Lujan factors are some factors? Life is complicated.  There are all kinds of factors, and these factors affect the basic fairness of the situation, which is something that judges should look to as well. Like many, many, many decisions, this is conferred upon the Supreme -- upon the district court to make a fair decision in say -- in terms of sanction, in light of the circumstance, to be reviewed by abuse of discretion.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't have to worry about this case; you do.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I -- I have to worry about the right standard to write an opinion.   Stephen G. Breyer  Before you get to the facts here, I have this thought in my mind, which is that this is a court order.  People don't normally take it on themselves to decide whether to follow it or not.  If you don't like it, lift it.  But while it's there, follow it. And this court order does have a possible consequence in some case that if it is violated, it will cause harm to a defendant who learns for the first time that he is being sued by reading The New York Times. Okay? Now, that may or may not hurt some.  It may hurt some a lot.  Now, can that be taken into account? I would say in an appropriate case, absolutely.  The Court has to be concerned in working out a sanction, the overall fairness of the situation, and that's part of it. What do you think of that?   John F. Bash  I didn't disagree with anything you said.  I think the Court could take that into account.  It couldn't have made a difference here because those three journalists did not leak the suit to the public.  So the -- State Farm couldn't have read about it in The New York Times. And what we think -- while these violations were certainly in bad faith, what we think mitigates it and at least makes the district court -- means that the district court did not abuse its discretion here is that it doesn't appear -- as Mr. Singh was saying earlier, it doesn't appear this was designed to publicize this suit. Scruggs was representing a lot of clients bringing non-FCA suits.  He did not, for example, leak this complaint to the media members.  He leaked the evidentiary disclosures.  And to be sure, they said that there was a lawsuit.  But it seems designed to have been background for the general allegations of fraud for those three journalists.  So if it was intentional, it was in bad faith. But if the question was, did this District Court abuse its discretion in declining to dismiss these relators with prejudice who had already secured new counsel because the counsel would respond to this --   ",15-513X

Breyer  You see, I -- I think this is going to protect the government's investigations. But the consequence of this is that there is a document somewhere in the court that says Joe Smith is a defendant in what could be a very harmful case to Joe Smith.  If Joe Smith is innocent, for example, it's unjustified.  Where does he read about that? In a complaint? No.  He reads about it in the national press. Now, that's a harmful thing.  And -- and seals are not just this case.  They are national security cases, privacy cases, trademark cases, all kinds of business cases.  So it is a serious thing when someone deliberately breaks a court seal and reveals the contents to the national press.  Well, it's not just the department that has an interest in this.  It's the United States judicial system that has an interest in this.  And that's what poses the problem.

Breyer  All right.  I'm trying to understand it.  It is a jurisdiction that is involved in a special way.  It is a jurisdiction that used to be a residence, and it is no longer a residence.

Even if he thinks that, in fact, this isn't even her jewelry, that it was just loaned her on the occasion by a good friend, the necklace.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What the statute says is defraud.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not asking you to repeat it.  I'm asking you, if the local person comes to the door and says, dear Miss Kardashian, I a.m. your local jewelry cleaner.  Please give me your jewelry. She does.  And that's not fraud.  He wanted to get the jewelry.  He tried to get the -- he also believed that the friend had just loaned it for the evening, that she's triple insured, that she won't even lose any money because the publicity will be worth it.  Okay?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, my question is: There's the statute.  I would have always thought from first year of law school, criminal law, that that was fraud, but perhaps I was wrong.  So I would like you to explain it.   Stephen G. Breyer  What it says in the instructions is, ""Intent to deceive, cheat, or deprive a financial institution of something of value.""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what's the problem?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So the ""or"" goes between ""to deceive, cheat, or deprive.""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But what you have to cheat, deceive, or deprive them of, is something of value.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And a possessory interest is something of value.  So what are you arguing about?   Stephen G. Breyer  In other words, you think it means ""deceive, cheat, or deprive""?   Stephen G. Breyer  But not of anything.  It doesn't say anything, what it seeks to deprive them of. And then it comes out of the blue and says --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- someone intends a financial institution of value.  That's what you think it means.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Did you make that argument in the court below?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What page? Do you have it here, by chance, what page you made that particular argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  By watching the movies, most -- I'd be afraid, in this case, that we're going to write something of five pages that nobody's going to understand, with the simple thing, Jessie James goes up to the bank, says, your money or your life.  He sees behind the teller is a drawer, and you know he's -- that in that drawer, the last five customers have given him some money.  That's the money he wants. It doesn't matter whether, in fact, the bank is going to put that money in Joe Smith's account, or whether the bank has something called a possessory interest or something else.  And in fact, if Jessie James' brother comes up and says, Jessie James is on the way, give me the money, it should be the same result. Now that's very simple-minded, but -- and it's built in me by the movies, but if, in fact, you have a different approach, I would like to know where in the law that different approach is, and why it is, and -- and how this does -- how this is -- I'm afraid, in other words, of confusion. You unconfuse me, please.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, my question is, why hasn't Jessie James or his brother committed a crime -- the brother, probably, because he's lied and says Jessie James is on the way, and whether the money behind the desk was put there, to everyone's knowledge, by the depositors, or whether the money happens to have been there for 50 years by the bank -- put in by the bank's founder, makes no difference to this statute.  And I want to know why it should, or anything else you want to say about that.   Stephen G. Breyer  You have a lot of cases, and I think the model penal code started it, where you have the word ""intent"" in a statute normally, not always, but normally it covers both purpose and knowledge.  So that if you try to murder the queen by blowing up the carriage, a famous example, and that would lead to the death of the footman, even though you love the footman, you are still guilty of killing the footman through murder.  Okay.  That's the famous example.   Stephen G. Breyer  So intent includes, unless there's some contrary which you could argue, to the both.  The statute that can -- the instruction they have to show, scheme to defraud, means that the person intends, which means he has knowledge that, as I take it, to deceive, cheat or deprive.  That's where the ""or"" is, deceive, cheat or deprive a financial institution of something of value. So I looked at that and I thought, what's the problem? What's the problem? That's what I want you to explain.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's not saying intends to cheat or deceive somebody, and then a separate thing, or deprive the financial institution of value.  It's intend to deceive, cheat or deprive.  Who? A financial institution.  Of what? Of something of value. So what is wrong with that instruction? That's -- that's what I need explanation.   ",15-5991
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  It's okay once you put in the word ""material"" --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- which is what you have in instruction 17.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It says you have to execute a scheme or defraud a financial -- to defraud a financial institution as to a material fact.  So that assumes it was separate.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The deceive was separate. You would have to deceive the financial institution as to a material fact, which is defined in instruction 19 as one that has a natural tendency to influence a financial institution to part with money or property. So what you took away in instruction 21, you gave back in instruction 19.  So it's a --   Stephen G. Breyer  So what's the right words?   Stephen G. Breyer  For the -- I mean, there -- there are many situations.  Do you -- you require an intent that there be property? Well, how do you want to say it, an intent to injure the bank in its property? How do you say it? Look, some people, bank robbers go into banks.  They take the customers -- they line the customers up against the wall, and they take out their billfolds.  Is that defrauding the bank?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, yeah.  So how do you want to do this one?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There was, but it was a property interest in the bank.  What do you have to prove in respect to that property interest is in the defendant's mind?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In order to obtain something of value, so that it could be of value and belong only to the customer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  That's why I want to know -- that's why I need to know the words.   INTERRUPTING ",15-5991
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  You have to have an answer for this reason.  No one on the other side thinks anything but this is terrible jury misbehavior.  That's a given across the case.  It is not a question of the validity of the behavior.  It's invalid.  The question is the timing of when somebody has to object. And their point is they have to object before the verdict comes in.  Because if you don't have that rule, you will, in fact, open the door to all kinds of evils which they mention.  All right? That's their argument. So what we're really asking for is your reply to that argument.  And it doesn't really reply to say maybe you're going to have a bunch of other things too, because then that strengthens their argument.  And on the other hand, maybe that's what you think.  I mean, the whole question is that inevitably, opening the door to these other things, which will mean tell the jury, Jury, if somebody says a racist comment, write me a note, the judge says, before you reach a verdict. Do you get the point? That's why the question is being asked.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so that's why I, too, would like an answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  What did the -- what did the 20 States do?   Stephen G. Breyer  What did the 20 States do?   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't see the problem there.  What -- what's actually worrying me about it, if I had to write this on paper, somebody could say, well, you know, on -- on request the defense attorney can get an instruction, send us a note before you reach the jury.  That could be happen. But you want to go beyond that and impeach the verdict. The real reason, I suspect, is even though we can imagine cases that are just as unfair, flipping a coin, et cetera, that part of the purpose of these amendments is to create a judicial system that is seen as fair beyond the individual case, and indeed, being seen as fair beyond the individual case means that it is more likely to be fair in other cases as well. Now, if I'm really honest, I think, yeah, that's probably right.  And then the history and everything become relevant.  But have you found any support for that?   Stephen G. Breyer  That what we're doing here in creating the exception, despite the fact that we can think of Justice Alito's case which is just as unfair, though it doesn't involve race, is we're trying to create a fairer system in general and one that will be perceived as such, and there race is a special problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So I wonder if you, and -- and I -- if I could write it right, I think it would make sense, but I'm asking you is there support for such a thing.   Stephen G. Breyer  The reason I think would be the Sixth Amendment says, in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a trial by an impartial jury. I agree with you that racial comments in the room can be equivalent to other comments.  But there may be -- that's what I wanted to know, a prophylactic aspect, that if you want impartial juries in general, you have to deal with the problem of racial confidence in the work of the jury.  And that's a reason stemming from the language of the amendment, to treat race specially, and we have 20 states that have done so without the reasons for limitation swamping the process. Now, that's what I understand is a textural argument, and purposive, that would, in fact, allow constitutional protection of the kind they're asking for.   Rachel P. Kovner  So I think when considering -- I think, Your Honor, when considering a prophylactic approach to preventing Sixth Amendment violations, it's important to consider both the cost of this rule and the other alternative mechanisms that are available, because those are things that the Court has traditionally considered under the Sixth Amendment. So turning to that with respect to race, we think the prophylactic mechanisms that the Court has relied on are likely to be particularly available in many cases with regard to race, and to talk about, first, voir dire and then the in-trial mechanisms that Your Honor mentioned. So in voir dire, as Justice Kagan's questions alluded to, there's a -- a well-settled principle, and it's the law in Colorado that you are going to have the opportunity to ask these questions about race.  And there's also been a lot of study and thinking that's gone into how to effectively detect bias with respect to race in particular. And then Your Honor alludes to mid-trial reporting.  Now, things can be done to strengthen that safeguard.  I think Your Honor alluded to some of the things that can be done about particular instructions, but in general, jurors are instructed that this kind -- that bias, in general, is impermissible.  And they can be instructed that racial bias, in particular, is impermissible, and even to contact the judge. On the cost side of the ledger, Your Honor, this Court has always recognized that there's a very high danger and a fair trial danger.  If you are trying to reconstruct, after the fact, jury deliberations with a sort of he said/she said about what was said, that that can really undermine confidence in the jury system. And we think that that risk may be particularly acute when you're talking about a very sensitive allegation like that racial bias occurred. And I think we know, as time goes on, that racial bias can be expressed in subtle ways, and particularly after a jury verdict is rendered and somebody goes back into the community where a sensitive issue has been debated, and they're trying to recall what was said, there's the real risk that there will be these kinds of credibility --   ",15-606X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But they have to prove one -- they define, somewhere, structure, right, in the statute?   Stephen G. Breyer  And don't you have to prove that that definition applies? I mean, you know, suppose it was a structure for -- for an animal at a zoo or something.  I mean, that wouldn't count, would it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.  Well, if it does not, don't you have to at least prove that it falls within the definition?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And, similarly, in Taylor, you have to prove that it falls within the statute's definition of boat or car or house.  Right? You have to prove one of the three.   Stephen G. Breyer  But you don't have to prove -- you have to prove in Massachusetts if you have an indictment which says it was like a houseboat, so they're not certain what it counts as.  So they say, don't you have to prove our prosecutor says it's a boat or a house? Now, would that get a conviction in Massachusetts? They proved that.  It's either a boat or a house.  Do they get a conviction or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, we don't know Massachusetts law.  I'm saying under --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- Massachusetts law, would you be able to convict the person?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The answer is no? You cannot convict a person, say, on a houseboat in Massachusetts where the prosecutor says it's either a house or a boat? They have to go into what the difference is?   Stephen G. Breyer  So, in other words, if six people think a houseboat is a boat and six people think a houseboat is a house, the guy gets off --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- in Massachusetts? Do you have any case on that? I would be rather surprised.   Stephen G. Breyer  I know.  But what I'm driving at, it's the same thing, the same thing.  But you've made up a very ingenious difference.  But why isn't it just the same thing here as was in Massachusetts?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's why I asked you about Massachusetts.   Stephen G. Breyer  You violated Section blah, blah, blah.  Prosecutor: You broke into a house. Defendant: No, I broke into a boat. Admitted? Yes.  Guilty or not guilty?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'd like to try with one -- one -- what I'm trying to do is get the essence of your argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And so you can just say I don't have it or I do have it.  If I don't have it, I'll go back and read it, I promise, and I'll get it before I decide this. I think you're looking at Descamps.  And you say, look, the word in the statute, ""Federal,"" is crime. It doesn't mean what a person does on a particular occasion; it means the kind of thing in a statute. So imagine we have the word ""burglary,"" and that's all the statute said.  And then a court said you can commit this in any one of five ways: A boat, a house, a car, et cetera.  Now, even if the charging document there said ""house,"" that wouldn't be good enough because the crime is what the statute says.  So you start there. And you say, now, what difference could it possibly make? If in a different section of the statute there are some statutory words but they say just what the Court just said in the other case, now, okay, I'll go back and read it.  I mean --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's what you're saying.  You're saying that in both cases the key point is that the -- the court was telling you in the first case that the burglary can be comitted in different ways, which means you don't have to charge it, and the jury doesn't have to be unanimous in respect to it. Now, if you take those same words out of what the court said and put it in the statute, which you think happened here, then those words don't require the jury -- they either charge it or the -- the -- the jury to find it unanimously, so it's not an element.  And if it was good enough to get my client out of the statute in the first case, it should be good enough when the same thing appears in a statute.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that your basic argument?   Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because it's not part of the crime.   Stephen G. Breyer  And what Congress wanted was crimes.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is this right? Is this like -- like even with the Massachusetts statute, the question has never come up.  So we don't really know what the jury has to find in the case of a houseboat. But where there's a word in the statute, like Descamps, and that alternative thing like houseboat, da da, da, is not in the statute, but rather it's a judge-made interpretation of the statute, and the courts say there is several different categories, it would be virtually impossible for a court under those circumstances to say that the A, B and C, which it divided the statute into, that they're elements.  You would have to say they're means.  Do you think? I don't think a State court would have the power to, in the face of a statute that doesn't itself divide things, to say that, A is an element of the crime that has to be defined, and then B is a different element of a different crime.

And if you knew the answer to that question, it would help me.   INTERRUPTING ",15-6092
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why do you say ""scant""?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, my bigger question is why -- why do all the disclosure forms we have to fill out? They have a lot of relatives.  You have to put, like, your minor children, your wife.  And in giving gifts, you have to disclose your minor children, your wife. I mean, why are the statute books filled with instances where the public wants to know, not just how you might benefit, but how your family might benefit?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, I realize it doesn't, but I mean, I'm looking for the reason why. And of course I can suggest a reason.  Because they think very often, though it depends on families, to help a close family member is like helping yourself.  That's not true of all families --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- but many, it is.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you think it addresses benefits?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, the statute doesn't, but there's a long history, and the person who's been defrauded, I take it, or the object of deceit is the company whose information you use.  And when you use their information, which you shouldn't, and tell it to someone, you're hurting them.  And then there's a subset of cases that we prosecute.  And the subset of cases we prosecute are the cases where, having used that information, you use it to benefit yourself. And the question, I take it, is when you use it to benefit a close family member, is that, in effect, benefitting yourself.  Cecil B. DeMille said -- or maybe Jack Warner -- rule of relativity: Never hire a relative.  You could have -- you could have that view, but you also have the view that helping a relative is helping yourself. Now, that seems to me where we are in this case, and the law is filled with instances where they do seem to think it's the same.  And there are a lot of cases here that think it's about the same, so why isn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  I -- well --   Stephen G. Breyer  I agree with that.  But it seems to me the analogy is the antitrust laws, very vague statute.  They've been around a long time. Exactly what's criminal and what's civil and so forth has been developed by courts over a long time.  This statute's been around since the '30s, and we have courts developing law in it.  And I believe the marketplace pays a lot of attention to that.  And virtually every court, I think, but this one has held that this does extend to a tipper giving inside information to a close relative.  And it seems to me -- and I'm giving you a chance to respond to this, that -- suddenly to take the minority statute here -- or to take the Second Circuit, is what I'm thinking of -- is really more likely to change the law that people have come to rely upon than it is to keep to it. I just want to get your view on that.   INTERRUPTING ",15-628X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But the difficult part is for a personal advantage, at least to me.  And the question is what counts if the tipper gives inside information to a member -- a family member or friend? When is it for a personal advantage, and when is it not for a personal advantage?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do we decide?   Stephen G. Breyer  So if you know --   Stephen G. Breyer  If you give it to your -- anyone in the world, and -- whom you happen to know, and you believe that that person will trade on it, that is for a personal advantage.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is the personal advantage?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So what is the personal advantage that you received?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That is a personal advantage?   Stephen G. Breyer  If they did that, why did they use the word ""advantage""? The -- you keep going back to the -- the part that everybody concedes: This tipper is using information he shouldn't use in a way he shouldn't use it.  Okay? Conceded. Now, it's the next step of what -- when is he liable, and what the words are is when he uses it for a personal advantage.  And it sounds to me, as you are saying -- and you said this -- whenever the tipper knows that the person, to him, he -- who he gives the information might well use it to trade.   Stephen G. Breyer  What did you say?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Go ahead.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't say it -- it has a sentence here which is exactly what's hanging me up and exactly what I thought you were going to answer before you got cut off. The sentence is: ""The elements exist also when an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend.""   Stephen G. Breyer  That doesn't sound as if the writer of those words had in mind any person in the world.  Now, in each instance you have to know that that person would, in fact, use the information to trade, but it doesn't say any person in the world.  It says a trading relative or friend.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So I want --   Stephen G. Breyer  No. All right.  So I should read the whole opinion, and --   Stephen G. Breyer  What can I read -- now I want you to tell me what I can read to get the explanation of Dirks that the majority of lower courts have followed.  It seems to me the Second Circuit has not read it as you're reading it.   Stephen G. Breyer  For after all, they came to the opposite conclusion.  And are there circuits that have read it just as you had, said you walk down the street.  You find anybody, you don't even know him, but he does keep saying trading, trading, trading, trading, and you tell him, and therefore you know that he will likely trade.  Now, in other words, an anonymous person, very far, just what you're arguing, what are the circuits that follow that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I realize this case -- I'm trying to get it clear in my mind.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not worried about that. I'm not worried so much about this case.  I a.m. worried about line drawing, and you want to draw a line so that friend, relative, doesn't matter, and -- and before I write those words, I'd like to know what circuit courts have followed that approach?   ",15-628X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  If we could go back to Justice Kennedy's question and the Chief Justice's, I may not have the distinction correct, but I thought the distinction, at least as we've interpreted it in Teague, we provided -- produced a different answer.  There is a statute.  It says that pestiness is a crime.  Sounds like a pretty good statute.  But you -- you can't pester people. Okay.  Now, the Court says, I'm sorry, desirable though that may be, it's unconstitutional. That's the end of it.  Okay? There are 32 people in prison for having violated that statute.  They were convicted many years ago.  Do they, under Teague, get out?   Helgi C. Walker  I don't think they do --   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that amazes me. Because I thought the point of Teague was that if the statute under which they are convicted doesn't exist anymore because -- for whatever reason -- because, for example -- and did not exist at the time, because it was an unconstitutional statute -- they are serving time under a statute which was then and is now nonexistent and, therefore, they get out. But if the change that was made in the law is a change having to do with the accuracy of the procedure that was used to convict them of that statute, that statute still exists.  They didn't get the right procedure when they got convicted of it, but we're not going to let everybody out of prison for those kinds of mistakes for a variety of reasons.  It may be there are too many of them or whatever.  But then he doesn't get out under Teague. Now, that's what I thought basically, we said, Bousley, I don't know, a bunch of cases here. Now -- now, if I -- if I have this fundamentally wrong, if what I've just said is wrong, so you can explain to me what I -- what I did.   Helgi C. Walker  Justice Breyer, what Justice Harlan said, and what the Court adopted in Teague, is that habeas should issue when private, primary conduct has been put -- and this Court reiterated in Montgomery --   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Helgi C. Walker  -- altogether beyond the power --   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what he says there. But later we say substantive rules include decisions of this Court holding that a substantive Federal criminal statute does not reach certain conduct.   Helgi C. Walker  And that's --   Stephen G. Breyer  See?   Helgi C. Walker  -- the statute --   Stephen G. Breyer  Therefore, there is a statute, perhaps.  But this person is in prison, and this person is in prison for doing a thing that there is no statute makes illegal.  That's how I read that. That's Bousley.   Helgi C. Walker  And that's the statutory construction decision, which is all my friends have to rely on here, when of course what we're analyzing is a constitutional rule.  And they don't even say that Bousley by its terms applies.  They ask you to say -- to adopt a radical new test, a comparable effects test. But we don't need to analogize by an analogy to a constitutional rule, which is what Bousley is about.  We should use the standard for judging whether a constitutional rule is substantive or procedural.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but that's still -- you have a point that, because it's not quite like the pest statute.  The pest statute, when we say there is no such statute, it's unlawful.  And there they are, 22 people now in jail because they violated a statute, and that statute, there was no such statute, or it isn't in the future, you see? And so we say, you get out. On the other hand, if the only reason that they -- anybody got out is because they were convicted under a procedure, you see, that was unconstitutional, they are within the class of a valid statute putting in jail. The valid statute puts them in jail.  But we're not certain he's the right one because the procedure was unfair.  Is he really that kind of person? And that's the procedural thing.  It doesn't go backwards. Now, if those are the two categories, this has some of both, you're quite correct.  He was convicted for having violated a legitimate law, though he's not quite like our pest. On the other hand, after time has passed, a large number of these people are sitting there in prison and there is no statute of the Federal government that says a person like you have been told you are, deserves or can be put in jail.  And so in that respect, it's like the pest.  And so is it like? Which is it like? That seems to be the problem in this case.   Helgi C. Walker  Well, it actually --   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know if you want to address that or not.  It's up to you.   Helgi C. Walker  I would love to.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right. (Laughter.)   Helgi C. Walker  Johnson has to be substantive if it's going to apply on collateral review.  So if you're not quite sure whether it's procedural or substantive, then the default has to go to nonretroactivity, because whether we want to call substantive due process rule an exception to Teague, or whether we simply want to say they're not subject to Teague at all, the point is there's a particular type of rule that qualifies as substantive.  And if it doesn't squarely qualify as substantive, and I think the fact that my friends have had to resort to an effects-based test that draws from a statutory construction case that analogizes to the actual first Teague exception, shows that Johnson doesn't squarely fall into the bucket of a substantive rule. And my second response, Justice Breyer, would be that Teague assumes, it's inherent in Teague, that there will be constitutional violations that go unremedied.  Otherwise, all new constitutional rules as announced by this Court would apply retroactively.  And that is certainly not what Justice Harlan ever intended.   ",15-6418

All -- that's all I wanted to know.  You don't want a holding here that is going to knock that out.   Sarah E. Harrington  Right, but -- so I said that a -- a court could not resolve a case by ordering the distribution of assets that would violate their priority scheme. Now, in our view, ""the priority scheme"" is sort of a broad term that includes both equitable subordination law, subordination principles, which are not applicable here, and also includes the ability of the priority claimholder to consent to impairment of its rights. I think it's important to keep in mind here that the priority claimholders here, Petitioners did not settle.  This is not a case where the people whose rights were impaired agreed to it, and you can't have -- you can't call a settlement basically the agreement of other parties whose rights were not impaired and who, in fact, benefited from the impairment of the Petitioners' rights.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  You -- you were beginning your first statement -- if you remember, you were just about to give us a special reason, which I wanted to hear.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't see what this has to do with that.  But my problem is quite simple.  What was -- this is not your asset --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- that's -- this is -- this is an asset of the estate?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So there is an asset of an estate.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's a claim against a third party.   Stephen G. Breyer  Very well.   Stephen G. Breyer  And now there is a person, probably the trustee or a committee, that's going to pursue that claim.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then the claim is settled.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, at least on request when you're in Chapter 11, doesn't the judge, the bankruptcy judge, have to approve that settlement?   Stephen G. Breyer  No? Why not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Ah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But suppose they had settled it for a dollar, and one of the creditors says, this is all corrupt.  I'm not saying they did in this case.  But, I mean, wouldn't -- wouldn't -- there's an asset of the estate.  They bring a lawsuit.  They reach a settlement.  Suppose it's a totally crooked settlement.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What happens?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not talking about this case.  I just want the background in my mind.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There is no power of the -- of the bankruptcy judge to even look at a settlement that the company in bankruptcy has made of an asset; namely, the claim that he has against another party.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh.  Fine.  Okay.  It's the same --   Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.   Stephen G. Breyer  In that place, once we are in that place --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- what we have is a settlement, not corrupt, not crooked, perfectly fine and honest and so forth, but what it does is it takes Congress's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and it says, what we'd like to do is 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, what that seems to do is it seems to be quite contrary to the order of -- of battle or the order of distribution that Congress has said should apply to the assets of the estate --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- of which this is one.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, so -- right.  Now, you provide a case.  Congress has said 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for estate asset.   Stephen G. Breyer  You have an estate asset, and you want to do -- I exaggerate -- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So where does the bankruptcy trustee or any court get the power to say that a group of people can, in fact, reverse the order in which these assets will be distributed?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That is -- that is what is bothering me, and presumably the government, and certainly the workers here, who are -- who are upset about it.   Stephen G. Breyer  But that's -- I see that point, which you've made several times, is a very good point.  I -- clarify a basic misunderstanding on my part.  What's a structured settlement?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not just call it a settlement?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let's call it a settlement.   Stephen G. Breyer  So now a company finds, very surprisingly, that there, underneath the building, is Jean LaFitte's gold treasure. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  See? But there is somebody down there who has it.  He says, give it to me; it's ours.  He says, I'll give it to you, but I want you to use it to pay my friend who happens to be my cousin, who is the 19th ranked creditor.   Stephen G. Breyer  And as long as you give the majority to him, okay, then you can give the rest to the others. All right.  Now, that would seem to be a possibility at least from your argument in this case.   Stephen G. Breyer  By the way, if you want me to, I will make up my hypothetical so that giving half the gold to this person is just as wonderful as you would like, and I will also change the hypothetical around, if you could do or I could do, so that not giving the money to this person would be just terrible.   Stephen G. Breyer  The Earth will come to an end.  So the question is, do you think Congress gave to the trustee or to you or to somebody else the power to deviate with Jean LaFitte's gold or with these particular -- this particular set of money or any other set of money?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It seems to me a dangerous principle to get into, but if you can tell me or that normally happens, I'm open to --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, this 363(b) -- is there -- I mean, this -- you would -- they say -- you're just saying they did it the wrong way when they reached the settlement; then this -- the -- the Petitioners here should have gone to the bankruptcy judge and said, Judge, you know, there is an odd thing about this settlement.  They're not only paying in $3 million or whatever, but they want to tell you how to distribute it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And they want to tell you how to distribute it, and we want you to distribute it according to the rules, and not according to what they say. That's what you say they should have done.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if that's what they did do, what's the problem?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then you're saying they have discretion there.   Stephen G. Breyer  So the question is: Do they have discretion --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- to depart from -- okay. I got it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do they have discretion depart from the -- do they have discretion to depart from the priorities as set by Congress?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Over the objection of one of the creditors.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  That's helpful.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, well, once -- then I'm back with Justice Kagan.  I'm pretty worried about that provision.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the reason I'm worried about it is -- and you'll be worried about it, all you have to do is represent some client or represent some -- a bank, for example, that thinks it has secured -- thinks it has a secured interest in something, and lo and behold, there is a $40 billion settlement, and they make it conditional that the money go to the widows and orphans --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- so we reverse it here, and then the --   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What the Code in 363(b) says is the trustee can sell a suit.  Okay? That's what it says.  It says nothing about --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It says nothing about what the terms are.  It says nothing about what the settlement is.  And the question for us, I guess, is, in those words, which make no reference to it --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- can you settle it on terms that will, in fact, take these assets that belong to the company and distribute them in a way that is contrary to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   ",15-649X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What -- what is your evidence of that? I mean, look, which I'm sure you've read, in -- in the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus, which I had hopped would end these cases in this Court, which it certainly doesn't seem to have done -- all right? But if you make the comparison, it isn't enough, I don't think, for you to say that they just saw some traditional factors; and they didn't take into account other evidence that they were using race predominantly. Well, if you look at the other evidence on page 1271, you know, the west thing, it was pretty strong evidence.  They added 15,785 new voters; and of those, precisely 12 were white.  Right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, is there -- and when you looked at their use of the factors, of the traditional factors, they were pretty irrelevant.   Stephen G. Breyer  It makes a point of that in the opinion, and that -- that that's meant to guide the district judges.  And so what -- what's the equivalent here? What's the equivalent if -- assuming he didn't say exactly the right words, no one can say exactly the right words, what's his mistake?   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  What is the evidence that you say would show that, in fact, they did use race? What's your strongest one or two pieces of evidence?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You saw the 17 -- 15,785. That's pretty strong.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What was the number, roughly, of the new people in the district? How many are black? How many white? Of the people who were moved out of the district, how many were black, how many were white, approximately?   Stephen G. Breyer  But giving a number matters, because, after all, the -- the -- that was the key factor in Swann.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  How do I find that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I found what I wanted to know.   Stephen G. Breyer  I just wanted to know where to look.   Stephen G. Breyer  We haven't said that for a reason.  We haven't said just the use of race is wrong. We've said it has to predominate, as you know.   Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and my problem with your argument here, if you want to go on the -- what the district court said there, which you may be right, but this is such a complicated area that it's the easiest thing in the world to go through a district court lengthy opinion and to find a sentence that's not exactly right.   Stephen G. Breyer  And that's why it seems to me, if we're going to have a -- ever have districting done back in the legislatures, rather than in the courts, you've got to prove your case that, not only did what he say was wrong, but it mattered, with pretty strong evidence.   Stephen G. Breyer  But in -- in -- in the Alabama case, certainly what I tried to do, changing what my position had been previously, in order to get a court that would have a clear set of standards, on page 1271 there are two paragraphs that address the issue you're talking about, and they virtually say what you say.  And then at the end, to deal with the problem you're -- you're -- you're raising, we say that it has to be a strong basis in evidence.  That's because you don't want to put the district court in a position, and the legislature, to do the impossible, right? So it tries to do that.  That is the decision of the Court.  I had thought, that having done that, there would be lots of lower courts that would rely on that decision. Is it a good idea now suddenly to change and go to some different test?   Irving L. Gornstein  No.  I'm -- I'm not saying you should go to a different test.  I think that the stare decisis considerations are what they are.  The Court's Alabama approach is the right approach, but under that approach, Justice Breyer, you did not say that it's an essential to show a conflict --   Stephen G. Breyer  Right, correct, exactly. It's predominant.  And then it has the two paragraphs that I've talked about, which are meant to illustrate what that predominance means.  And they are pretty much what -- I think pretty much what you said.   Irving L. Gornstein  Yes.  We would agree with that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Pretty much.   ",15-680X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Let's talk about 71.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I have a particular question on 71.  Remember what I was trying do.   Stephen G. Breyer  At least in Alabama. The -- the Court's cases, at that moment, pre-Alabama, I -- I'm one of the problems.  Okay? So I am trying to reflect what is actually there in Miller, for better or for worse, and to make it clear. The column I've referred to talks really about evidence showing predominance.  Does it or doesn't it? And there are two things there that are crucial in that -- I think, in those two paragraphs.  One, there was direct evidence that they moved 70 -- or 50,000 -- 15,000 people are all black.  Okay? Two, when you look at the three districting traditional criteria, they are pretty weak as applicable to that case.  They just seem not to have much relevance to what they are talking about.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, let's look at 71. Same kind of thing they are arguing.  Same kind of thing.  They moved -- I don't know, you have it in the SG's brief too.  They moved 11,293 people out and 17,000 in.  So let's look at those people.  The ones they moved out were three-quarters or something white, and the ones they moved in were three-quarters or something black. So that's pretty similar.  It seems to me they paid a lot of attention to race. Then they say, let's look at the traditional criteria.  The one they mentioned, which is this horn thing, they said that they -- they did it to keep it preserved Richmond centered.  But it already changed it so it wasn't Richmond centered at all, and the changes had nothing do with it. So what they are saying is in that case, look at that specificity, and you will see that the mistake of the judge in listing the criteria, you know, his statement, overly broad or whatever, made a difference, send it back, get him to do it right. Now, that's a long question, but that's designed to focus you.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's -- that's what I have to do after this argument, isn't it? I mean, you gave me exactly what I needed.  You -- you gave me the things to look up.  He gave me the things on the other side, and -- and they -- they didn't use exactly the right test, but does it matter? And -- and -- and I -- I think the -- the reason I approach it that way is because this is such a -- the reasons you said.  Okay.  You have to give leeway here; leeway, leeway. But the government makes a pretty good point here that it -- that really was important evidence he didn't look at.  And -- and that's -- that's my job, isn't it, to go back and read these things and figure out how they -- the -- the evidence.   INTERRUPTING ",15-680X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, right.  But Justice Sotomayor's question was, why not? The virtue of having two notices of appeal, it's definite, a certain time, people know what to do.  When you have one notice of appeal and then maybe you're going to add a few arguments later, did you -- did they have a fair chance to answer? What is that later time? It raises a lot of questions. So the simplest thing with a rule, and it doesn't hurt anybody, is what I think she was suggesting: Just follow what the government says there. You appeal, then you appeal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  But the rule says --   Stephen G. Breyer  You're just being literal in the rule.  The rule says in a criminal case, a defendant's notice of appeal must be filed within 14 days of the order being appealed from.  That's one of the things -- and you're appealing from the order which says, pay so much.   Stephen G. Breyer  From the judgment.  So we have a judgment which says -- judgment says, and it leaves restitution open.  Then we have another judgment which is -- says how much the amount is.  I mean, that's so simple, and all the lawyers would understand it, and the other seems more complicated. Now, what's your response to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Dolan didn't --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know whether it answered the question.  But in one second, I'm going to conclude that you don't have a reason, other than I would read the text.  Your reason is if the text literally requires -- doesn't require it, then it doesn't. But do you have any answer other than that?   ",15-7250

So I thought -- and that's why I pointed to the brief I did point to -- that history is matters here, and we're talking here about a multicomponent product.   Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So disagreement on this point.  So why, if -- we have a hard-enough question trying to figure out what the standard is.  Now, why can't we just ask the lower courts to listen to your arguments and theirs, and work it out?   Stephen G. Breyer  You don't think it's difficult, but they think --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- they think it's difficult.  In fact, they think it's easy on their side. So if I go through and come to the conclusion, at least, that each side has a good argument, under those circumstances, why don't we focus on the question that is of great importance across industries and leave the application of that and whether it was properly raised to the lower courts?   Stephen G. Breyer  I get your point.  I'll read it and I'll --   Stephen G. Breyer  But I have a question on the general issue, which I think is tough.  And the general question that I have is I have been looking for a standard.  Now, one of the standards -- which are all quite close; the parties actually in the government are fairly close on this -- but is in a brief for the Internet Association, the software industry.  And you know that brief I'm talking about on Facebook and some others.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  What they did is they went back into history.  They have a lot of different cases which they base the standard on, and they come to the conclusion, which is a little vague, but that the design where it's been applied to only part -- it's on page 23 -- of a multicomponent product and does not drive demand for the entire product, the article of manufacture is rightly considered to be only the component to which the design applies.  And only profit attributable to that component may be awarded. Now, really, to understand it, you have to have examples -- but antitrust cases are hard to understand -- and our rule of reason and people do use examples.  And so that kind of standard, with perhaps examples to explain it to the jury, you know, wallpaper, you get the whole thing.  A Rolls Royce thing on the hood? No, no, no.  You don't get all the profit from the car.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, why not?   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh.  Then go ahead and answer her question.  At some point you can come back to it.   INTERRUPTING ",15-777X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I have one question, which I don't think you can answer orally.  But I think that these cases -- you can point me to the answer.  That's what I want. Look.  There will be a bunch of easy cases. And then there are going to be cases like your client who has been on death row for 36 years.  And there will be borderline cases.  And the reason they're borderline is because the testing is right at the border, like an IQ test.  And then you'll put weight on what's called related limitations in adaptive functioning, a matter that on its face sounds as if it's maybe easy in some cases and tough in another.  All right? What is the Court supposed to do? Are we supposed to have all those hearings here? I mean, you've made very good arguments for your client.  There are probably several others in the country in different states which may have different standards.  And if you have some view that the law in this area should be law, i.e., that it should be uniform across the country, point me to something that will tell me how a district judge should go about making this determination in borderline cases.   Stephen G. Breyer  My suspicion is that there is no such thing, but that's why I asked the question. I want to be sure.  There might be.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I understand.  But you are saying whatever they should do, it shouldn't be what went on here.  Okay.  I got that point. I'm asking a different point.  And if you want my true motive, I don't think there is a way to apply this kind of standard uniformly across the country, and therefore, there will be disparities, and uncertainties, and different people treated alike, and -- and people who are alike treated differently.  Okay? Now, that's my whole story.  And I want you to say, no, you're wrong, there is a way to do it. What?   ",15-797X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, maybe I could ask a follow-up.   Stephen G. Breyer  Basically, there are two things wrong, possibly, with the factors which we've heard.  One I can't deal with at this moment in oral argument.  You could go through them -- they're in the briefs -- one by one, and say reading them, actually, they're not consistent with or they reflect an error when compared with what the psychiatrists and psychologists think.  Your answer is they don't.  The other side says they do.  Okay.  I can't go further with that here. The other is the question of, why did the Texas court write these standards? I have to admit that in reading through Briseno, I came to at least pause when I read the words that they are trying to figure out what to do in borderline cases, and what they have done is not -- you know, I understand it, but they say we have to figure out the level at which a consensus of Texas citizens would agree that a person should be exempted from the death penalty. When I read that, and when I read, there are some other words -- that's on page 6 of the -- of the report, of the reported opinion -- when I read some other things that they said, I thought they were trying to do this, which we do often in law.  But what's the purpose of this? The whole purpose is to try to figure out who not to execute because of their functioning, the way they function.  That's the purpose. Let's look at what Texas citizens would think about this person, and let's try to get standards that reflect that.  I really did think that's what they were trying to do in that opinion.  And they are arguing that that's the wrong thing to try to do in this instance. First, because it would produce nonuniformity among 50 states or among the many states that have the death penalty. Second, because the question is not what the citizens of the state think about who should be executed.  That has nothing to do with it.  Oddly enough, in this case, what has to do with it is a technical matter about this individual, that would free some while subjecting others to the death penalty, irrespective of what Texas citizens think. So do you see my question? What were they up to in this opinion? Briseno.  I think they were up to going back to the citizens of Texas.  You saw what I think they are up to.  And you tell me if I'm right, wrong or why.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's the point. That's exactly the point.  That's the point that we've been making, or at least I thought we were.  That the whole point of Briseno is really to answer the question that you said -- probably should say, no, it isn't really there -- it's to help determine which persons suffering borderline cases of mental disability ought to be executed, or should not be because they are less morally culpable. Now, I did think that's what they said. That does supply a reason for making differences, as Justice Ginsburg just pointed out.  And then the question is, is it what the purpose of Atkins and the other case Hall was, was it to give each State the right to decide in borderline cases whom or whom not to execute in light of their feelings about capital punishment? I thought it had a different purpose -- unusual in the law -- but which was to appeal to technical definitions of who and who is not mentally retarded or intellectually disabled.  That's a real issue.  But I think that this case does present that issue.   ",15-797X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose you have a private contract.  In the private contract, it's for medical services.  The written part does not actually use the word ""doctor,"" but the circumstances are such that any reasonable person would assume, would believe that the parties contracted for medical services provided by a doctor. This is an ordinary contract case.  Could not a jury or the judge find that that implicit term of the contract that the services would be provided by a doctor was breached, it was a material breach, and, therefore, the implicit statement was false?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  What's the second?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, fine.  But now let's go a step further.  We have our contract.  The facts are such that any reasonable person would assume there is an implicit statement that the services will be provided by a doctor.  You say that could be a breach of contract. Now it turns out that this company that has that contract has sold the shares over the SEC.  And the SEC says, you know, it's so obvious that that implicit statement in the contract meant that they had a doctor who was a doctor -- that's so obvious -- that we think in selling shares in this company, where indeed this contract was absolutely critical, millions of dollars was at stake, without a doctor, violating of implicit statement that there was a doctor, we think that's fraud under Rule 10(b)(5).   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, fine.  But what is -- I'm talking the common law.  All I know about contracts came from Blackjack Dawson, my contracts teacher -- (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  -- who was a great teacher, and he taught the common law.  So I don't know anything else.  I -- well, I won't go quite that far, but nonetheless.  Nonetheless, I think under common law, you could say that that was a material breach of contract, what I just talked to.  And indeed, there happened to be a whole set of regulations on the shelf, et cetera, which spell it all out to which there was an implicit reference in the contract if it's -- you understand what I'm saying.  It's common law that I'm saying.   Stephen G. Breyer  I see that.  That's to me what's at the heart of this.  How do you distinguish those regulations, breach of which are fraudulent when you breach them, and implicit promise not to, from those that not? There are millions of regulations.  That's what all the amici are worried about. But now, this is my basic question, and it is a question.  The obvious kind of distinction that would seem possible is a contract-based distinction between matters that are material where the whole contract disappears and matters that are sometimes I think called nonmaterial, I'll get the -- I'll forget the exact word, partial, where even though the condition is violated, you don't destroy the contract but you might get damages for that. Now, that's a distinction that every court that deals with contracts is used to applying bread and butter.  All right? Normal daily basis.  Why not use that same distinction right here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  What you'd say, of course it applies where the condition that was lied about was material.  And there can be implicit lies.  Of course, there has to be an implicit lie.  But it could be an implicit lie that I did not comply -- you might implicitly imply that you fulfilled provision No. 43876(b) which says paper should be three inches long, okay? Okay.  Or there could be an implicit lie that that person in your hospital was a doctor.  The first you'd say is not material.  The second is material. Now, that I'm asking because I wonder if a distinction like that, drawn from contract law would, or would not, satisfy most of the concerns that are -- are raised in the amicus briefs supporting you.   Stephen G. Breyer  How do you want us to write this? The -- you're in an area where billions of dollars are at issue.  There -- this is going on a long time.  I don't want to write something that's going to upset everybody's expectations in the contract area. On the other hand, the common sense of it, and you just said the words, you said, well, if, in fact, you send in a form which says certainly give me money for supplying the guns or the medical care, something is implied.  And you used the word ""essentials"" to describe that. And then I also know that if the agency wants to, it could put a little statement at the bottom saying, I hereby certify I complied with every regulation.  And I guess if they -- if they did that, then even you would not have an objection saying your failure to do it while signing was fraud.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what am I --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  From your point of view, this word is ""essential,"" whatever that may mean, which I will look up, how does it work?

Breyer  Please, because I have read -- you have lots of good arguments, and I'm not -- I'm asking for advice from you, from your point of view, what the sentence in the opinion should say that describes the circumstances under which the person who submits a form saying, I want a thousand dollars, I just supplied the guns or the medical care, when that person -- and, by the way, there are regs say they have to fire, and the regs say it has to be a real doctor. When has that person committed fraud or -- that's what I want.  What is the sentence you want me to write?   Stephen G. Breyer  How does it differ, what you just said, from this thing in the Restatement where you say it would be fraud, facts basic to the transaction or matters known, that he knows to prevent his statement from being misleading? The statement is, implicitly, I did the work.  And this kind of problem, is it or is it not, basic to the transaction that the doctor be certified, is the kind of thing that I think you and other lawyers argue very well on opposite sides, as you just did. But the standard you advocate is, according to the Restatement, misleading statement about a fact basic to the transaction, misleading, implicitly, I did it.  Truth? I didn't.  You see, I'm saying your standard gives rise to the same problem, doesn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   INTERRUPTING ",15-7XXX

Stephen G. Breyer  And, third, he has to omit telling the government about it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, I look at the two things he talked about in the Restatement, and he says matters known to him that he knows to be necessary to prevent his partial or ambiguous statement from being misleading -- boy, that's pretty close to what you said -- and then (e) is facts basic to the transaction if he knows the other is about to do it under a mistake. What's the difference between -- I mean, I know the people are experts, and this will tell me there are huge differences.  But what's the difference between what you just said and what he said?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what has it done? What has the government done when they certify things? Do they say things like, I hereby certify that I complied with all material regulations? What do they say?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I agree with you.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The wholly or in part, now -- now, I just copied out of the Horn book the basic difference between a material breach and a partial or nonmaterial breach of contract.  A material breach of contract is a contract that -- a breach that allows one party to repudiate the contract.  A nonmaterial breach is a breach that gives rise to damages but cannot serve as the basis for repudiation. Now, until this last interchange, I thought that was the distinction you were drawing, that if the piece of paper says nothing, but pay me, and there is a violation of a reg, if the violation of that reg is such to be material, meaning, it would be a basis for repudiation, then it is an implied -- then it is an implied statement.  It was complied with, and it's fraud. But if it's just staples, you may have to pay damage for staples, but that certainly doesn't -- to say the contrary there would make the contractor responsible for having complied with every one of 40,000 regulations, the size of the room, size of the table.

We do know that the prosecutor asked the expert witness, is it correct that the race factor, black, increases the future dangerousness for various complicated reasons. And he says, yes. So that seems -- I mean, you can't prove it, that that was the key factor, but it seems like it could have been a substantial factor.  And Texas, in six cases, says this is totally wrong.  And now in this seventh case, you're taking the opposite position.  And I have to admit, like what the Chief Justice seemed, I don't understand the reason.  It seems to me it proves the arbitrariness of what's going on. But regardless, the issue here is, is there some good reason why this person shouldn't have been able to reopen his case? I mean, that's the question. What's the reason? I mean, after all, we later decided these other cases, Martinez.  His circumstances seem to fit Martinez pretty much like a glove.  The State certainly doesn't have a strong interest any more than in the other cases, or at least not obvious to me, some kind of reliance.  So he has a case where Martinez seems to apply.  He couldn't -- he was diligent -- diligent, not much -- not too much reliance on the other side, and seems to meet Martinez's criteria for hearing the issue. Why doesn't that make it extraordinary enough to reopen under Rule 60(b)? That seems to me the question in the case.   Stephen G. Breyer  And all this took place after this Court decided Martinez and Trevino?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, I mean, you listed a whole bunch of things in which he could have done.  Did those take place or not after we decided our case? If some of them did, which?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Gonzalez v.

Breyer  I mean, there are all kinds of statutes of limitations, and this is one of them that the court said he didn't -- he didn't pursue the change diligently, and besides, it wasn't that big a deal, and not every interpretation of Federal statute setting habeas requirements provides cause for reopening cases long since filed, and the change was not extraordinary, and it was because in part of Petitioner's lack of diligence in pursuing it.  There's a whole list of reasons there.  As I read those reasons, I don't think one of them applies here.  So which one applies here.   ",15-8049
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why didn't the -- why didn't the -- the statement that an IEP, what it has to do is it has to, based on peer-reviewed research, when practicable, will -- will be provided to the child to advance appropriately towards attaining the annual goals to make progress in the general education curriculum and so forth.  So you've just described if the situation is that, wouldn't that have been violated? Or if they wrote the IEP that way, wouldn't you be able to go to court and say, look, there is their IEP and they didn't live up to it? So you already have two arguments under the statute, and the problem that's working in my mind is if we suddenly adopt a new standard, all over the country we'll have judges and lawyers and -- and -- and people interpreting it differently and -- and -- so why isn't the present situation sufficient?   Stephen G. Breyer  Besides having nine people who don't know -- I mean, at least speaking for myself -- don't know that much about it, creating a new standard out of legal materials which are at a distance from the people, the children and the parents, who need help.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I'm sorry if it doesn't happen.  What are we supposed to do to make it happen? I mean, you have a statute that certainly seems to say that and you have a system for enforcement.  And how does us suddenly using this word ""equal"" -- you know, the word ""equal"" has history from a lot of different areas of law.  And -- and what do you do with a wide range of -- of disabilities, a huge range in individual students and -- and -- do you see what I foresee?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I foresee taking the money that ought to go to the children and spending it on lawsuits and lawyers and all kinds of things that are extraneous.  That is what's actually bothering me.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, suppose we have a child who is a handicapped child, there's a range of people, and they can't do much for them, but they can do something for them.  And if they can do something for them, do it.   Stephen G. Breyer  But if you, say, measure that in terms of their ability to progress from grade to grade, maybe some will; some won't.  And how does that -- it seems to me the word ""appropriate"" tried to recognize that.  And -- and do you want to recognize that? I mean, you can't ask for more than is reasonable for them to do.  So -- so what -- what words do we use?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The problem is you say leave it to us.  You represent the Department of Education here.  They at least have experience with it and we have far less.  And so, obviously, I'm relying and must rely upon people who have connection with expertise.  And I don't want to do something that uses words that has effects that I have no idea.   Irving L. Gornstein  So we --   Stephen G. Breyer  So I go back to look at two words.  The IEP is filled with the word ""progress."" There's several.  So the word ""progress"" seems like something that should be there.   Irving L. Gornstein  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  And then the other word --   Irving L. Gornstein  I would agree with that.   Stephen G. Breyer  -- that goes -- goes -- you see a lot is ""appropriate."" Now, you've taken that word ""appropriate"" and spelled it out in light of the student's particular needs and abilities.  I think that's what you're doing with ""appropriate.""   Irving L. Gornstein  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  And if we stick ""appropriate"" in that sentence somewhere so it's significant and appropriate, does that matter?   Irving L. Gornstein  That happen -- we are happy with that.  One of the formulations we --   Stephen G. Breyer  You looked into this and you don't --   Irving L. Gornstein  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  -- see anything wrong with sticking in the word ""appropriate""?   Irving L. Gornstein  We do not.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now -- now, the other thing I looked at in yours is you say the school -- ""requires school districts to provide."" And when I see ""requires school districts to provide,"" I begin to think everybody is going to start suing about whether they did provide.   Irving L. Gornstein  No, no.   Stephen G. Breyer  So I'm thinking, well, maybe it should be something like they are reasonably calculated to provide.   Irving L. Gornstein  That's actually -- we agree with that.  That is what Rowley said, and that is what the standard -- that's what it means to require.  It's a program that is reasonably calculated to -- to make significant --   Stephen G. Breyer  Not appropriate.  Is that --   Irving L. Gornstein  Not appropriate.  Yes. So --   ",15-827X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Where is it? As I see one way of looking at what we're doing, two things have occurred.  One, Rowley itself is somewhat ambiguous.  It doesn't -- it deliberately doesn't say how much, and that's why you get the ambiguity. The second thing that happens is the statute is amended.  So what we're doing is going back and looking at those somewhat ambiguous words in Rowley in light of a statute that was amended. Now, when you look at the statute that was amended in the IEP, you do see in at least two and maybe more places that that IEP is designed to be a statement that will produce -- meet the child's needs to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education, and then further, advance appropriately towards an -- annual goals to make progress in the general education. So now what the SG has done is go back, take those words, ""make progress,"" and put them in a phrase which, in fact, I think with not much modification says, look, let's read what Rowley said in light of these additional words, ""make progress,"" which are statutory words, while taking account of great differences by using words like ""appropriately in light of the student's particular needs and abilities,"" and those all come from the statute.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what we have -- we have now.  We have the words you've mentioned.  They are in old cases.  As was just pointed out, those words ""some"" -- what is it? ""Some"" -- ""some"" -- ""some benefit.""   Stephen G. Breyer  You could say some benefit or you could say some benefit.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, that's an ambiguity.   Stephen G. Breyer  And as you pointed out, most courts have interpreted what I think is the correct thing, they said benefit.  Okay? And you say there is really no problem.  Okay? There is really no problem. But there still is a problem with the language in a handful of courts.  And now we have an IEP statute which again and again and again looks to progress. So why is it making something up out of whole cloth --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- simply to take that word from the IEP, which is enforceable anyway, and say, look at these two words of ambiguity, and we think we should interpret them in light of the IEP requirements, which are pretty close to what the SG suggests?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   Stephen G. Breyer  We get that -- I mean, how does this actually work? I thought there is a statute in 1414 before that, it says you have to, school district, write an IEP.  Then it says what an IEP is. And one of the things it says an IEP is, is it is a statement of the services, et cetera, based on peer review stuff that will be provided for the child to advance appropriately and to make progress in the general education curriculum. Now, suppose the school district writes a statement called an IEP, but it does not show that the child is likely to advance.  Can't they go to the administrative thing and then go to court and say to the judge, look, they didn't write what they were required to write?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So they have to write something that's minimally --   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, let's suppose they write it, but they don't do it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, isn't there something saying you have to follow the IEP?   Stephen G. Breyer  And so, again, they go to court?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And what they -- again they say they didn't follow the IEP?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But they do have to provide something that makes progress in the general education curriculum and --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- and advance appropriately --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- towards a --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's procedurally calculated.   Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know.  I would say if you take Rowley as meaning -- hmm, or whatever those two words were, what, beneficial? What's the one before ""beneficial""?   Stephen G. Breyer  Some educational benefit. If you say ""some,"" this is inconsistent with Rowley.   INTERRUPTING ",15-827X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  And there is more arbitrariness because of this guideline than there was before the Guidelines were passed? Is there any evidence of that? I have a lot of evidence it wasn't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Especially so.  Is it so at all? There was a system before the Guidelines exactly as Justice Alito said.  Moreover, that system is existing today side by side with the Guidelines in any case in which the judge decides not to use the Guidelines. So I don't get it.  I really don't.  And you can be brief here, because it's really the government that has to answer this question for me.  I don't understand where they're coming from on this, and you don't have to answer more than briefly, but I do have exactly the same question that Justice Alito had.   Stephen G. Breyer  This is -- this is a fairly deep question, actually, you're going into, in my mind. And what is -- before I reached a constitutional question, I would ask whether the Guideline falls within the scope of the words ""Guideline-enabling statute."" I don't see why you have to get into the Constitution. But even doing it that way, it then becomes a matter of the extent to which the Federal courts are going to review the substantive Guidelines, itself an open question. So rather than get into that, I might think about your case like this: Why was the statute vague? It was vague because with three examples preceding the residual clause, they tried to apply it, Congress, to thousands of State criminal statutes that vary in a variety of ways one from the other.  That's what caused the problem, I think. Now, if that was the problem, that isn't present here because these apply to Federal statutes. Moreover, they don't apply to State statutes.  Oh, maybe -- I see.  Yeah, yeah, you're right.  There is. You're right.  You're right.  I can't get around it that way.  Thank you for your answer. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  But let's go -- let's go a step further.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, you're -- you're thinking the right thing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But I have -- I have -- I'm conceding, because one way of clarifying the kind of vagueness that's there in the statute is through example.  If we'd had twenty examples instead of three, we might never had to get to that constitutional issue. So here, what the Commission did was provide some examples.  That's all.  And one of the examples was a sawed-off shotgun. So why isn't that sufficient? I mean, there was vagueness.  Assume.  Because similar reasons? Assume.  And now we have an effort to cure.  And the effort to cure is by giving examples.  And why isn't that good enough?   Stephen G. Breyer  But his point, I think, is that, yes, all that you say is true, but this is a special kind of guideline.  This is like a threshold. This is like a rule of law that says, get into this career offender business if and only if you satisfy this rule.  Thus, most rules are telling the judge, Judge, go back to your history of what this is about.  Look at the offender, figure out what he did, and then try to find an appropriate sentence in light of factors.  This isn't that. This is off/on.  You either are in the career offender or you are not.  And just as you couldn't, even before, have decided the sentence through a throw of the dice, so you cannot now interpret an on-off rule to say it's no worse than what you're talking about.   Adam K. Mortara  And, Justice Breyer, that amounts to an argument that because the career offender enhancement residual clause isn't quite that vague, it's more subject to constitutional vagueness challenges.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, I'm not saying it's not that vague.  It is that -- it is saying you can't rely on how sentencing used to work in order to save this on-off rule. Then what was worrying me in our conversation is I could think of other parts of the Guidelines; for example, the part that deals with concurrent versus consecutive sentencing, which, you know, is a nightmare and is also the notion of a kind of on-off rule, and I'm afraid of what we would do here. See, that's where I a.m. in this.  I mean, I'm not saying don't go ahead, go ahead.  But I think he's trying to make a qualitative difference in what we're talking about here.   Adam K. Mortara  I do want to get back to the (a)(2) factors, but I -- I'll address your question directly. My friend said that the problem here is Molina-Martinez and Peugh and the weight that the Guidelines are given.  And that weight in part comes from Rita, which says that -- that an appellate court can presume a within-Guideline sentence is reasonable, because that reflects the judgment of both the Commission and the sentencing judge that the 3553(a) factors have been met. But that's actually not true with the career offender enhancement, and that's because the career offender enhancement exists at the command of Congress in 994(h)  The Commission is not actually deploying its expertise when it made the career offender enhancement. It's doing something it was commanded to do, which is make sure that sentences get at or near the statutory maximum. So the rationale for the reasonableness presumption of Rita completely goes away with the career offender guideline, and that's why the career offender enhancement should not get that kind of weight and that's why it doesn't. My friend referred to 80 percent of sentences being within Guidelines ranges.  It's 75 percent outside of the Guidelines ranges -- Guideline ranges for career offenders.  Only 25 percent of career offenders in 2015 got within the Guidelines-range sentences.  And some of that is government-sponsored departures to be sure.  But an astounding nearly 30 percent of career offenders got below Guideline-range sentences without the government sponsoring them. And what's going on there is that judges are not giving the career offender enhancement as much weight as Molina-Martinez and Peugh are talking about because it doesn't come from a Commission's expertise on the 3553(a) factors, and the Rita rationale is gone and because sentencing judges are commanded to consider the very facts of the offense and the criminal history that they were deprived of considering under the ACCA. In Johnson, the Court made very clear that the saving construction offered by one of the other opinions, the so-called criminal history or record-based approach, was not available as a matter of statutory interpretation.  But under the sentencing guidelines in factor (a)(1), a sentencing judge must consider those facts. So to take the example from Johnson, a variety in a correctional institution under Connecticut law under the categorical approach, probably a crime of violence, but there might be the rare violence-free riot.  A sentencing judge under the Guidelines can look at what actually happened and look at the severe effect of the career offender enhancement and then sentence below the range. And that is what is, in fact, happening, because judges are looking at the facts, and they are not acting like automatons blindly adhering to the Guidelines whatever their weight. But coming back to the (a)(2) factors -- and I do want to come back to them -- in 1984, the (a)(2) factors were enacted.  They are vague by anyone's definition.  And the only answer we get from my friends is the Sentencing Guidelines require numerical range. The (a)(2) factors lead to a specific number, a fixed sentence in the mind of the judge.  Which is more arbitrary or provides less notice? That's easy. The only other explanation we get is the weight afforded to the Guidelines.  I've already mentioned that a little bit, but another way we can think about it is a district judge is allowed to deviate from the Guidelines if it disagrees with them as a matter of policy.  That's Kimbrough and Spears.  A district judge cannot declare that they disagree with the purposes in (a)(2) and say, I a.m. now going to sentence under my theory of radical over-deterrence, instead of adequate deterrence.  That would be reversible error under all of this Court's precedents. So whatever weight Molina-Martinez and Peugh say should be given to the Guidelines, the (a)(2) purposes have actually equal or more weight, because a district judge cannot disagree with them.  They are, in a sense, more binding than the non-binding career offender enhancement. And in that respect, it goes from discretionary sentencing, which I agree historically we've all accepted as constitutional, and then to the (a)(2) purposes, which may be an attempt to codify that historical practice, but they are law.  It -- it is a statute.  It says shall impose a sentence, a fixed number.  And they are vague.  And if you accept that discretionary sentencing is constitutional and you accept that (a)(2) purposes are not subject to a constitutional vagueness challenge, it seems extremely difficult to accept that the career offender enhancement is somehow subject to a constitutional vagueness challenge either because of the numerical range, it's a fixed number for (a)(2), or because of the weight for the reasons I've given. One other thing I wanted to raise, which is related to questions Justice Sotomayor was asking about the resentencings.  I'm not aware of the percentage of those 88, what percentage that is of the total resentencing that would come up, and my friend suggested it's an unrepresentative sample.  But there's plenty of confounders in this resentencing. The -- the first is, sometimes it's been a different judge. The second is, sometimes the -- the defendant was originally sentenced under Booker, or pre-Booker, so mandatory guidelines. The third is that in some of these cases -- and I've looked at the government's sentencing referendum -- the United States has gone in and said, well, because the Commission has gotten rid of the residual clause, we would like the defendant's sentence to reflect the way sentences are going to be going forward, so we're asking you to impose a lower sentence because we want things to look, in the future, the way they are going to look for this defendant today. All of those things are confounders on the actual effect that the career offender guideline had in its original form on the defendant's sentence.  And to take an example of Mr. Beckles, we talked a lot about Molina-Martinez and Peugh, and some other decisions that are mentioned in Peugh as giving weight to the Guidelines.  Most of those decisions did not exist when Mr. Beckles was actually sentenced.  Only Rita was there.  And Mr. Beckles' lawyer told the sentencing judge that all the factors in 3553(a) were equal, that none of them had any more weight than any of the others, and Mr. Beckles still got his within-Guidelines range sentence. It is true that six years later the district judge said, I would have sentenced him differently.  But that may -- that may be just as much an indication of a Rita-Gall style error of overinterpreting the Guidelines or overweighting them as anything else. If the Court has no further questions, I'm -- I'm prepared to sit down.   ",15-8544
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Here's a thing I'd like you to think about, and -- and tell me what you think.  This is -- this is what's bothering me about the government's position.  It's important, the government's position. Put in your mind the words that we're talking about, ""or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury."" Okay? Those are the words.  Put them over here; they appear in the guideline.  Put them over here; they appear in the statute. When they appear in the statute, they have a meaning, and it's fairly limited, and there's likely to be one.  And eventually there will be an authoritative meaning. When it appears over here in the guideline, it could be viewed as having an authoritative meaning or it could be viewed as leaving up to the district judge the job of interpreting these sensibly in the case, just like we used to do. And then the Commission goes around first to review it for reasonableness at the court of appeals, and then the Commission goes through the feedback process that you -- that you describe. Now, that would mean, one, a system that works itself towards a more logical, sensible approach in terms of punishment, and it also would mean that the normal words vagueness in the Constitution, or, if you like, feed it through the statutory enabling legislation, it would -- it would mean that it would have different meanings in the two constitutional versus statute versus guideline.  But the purpose of that would be to get better guidelines.   Stephen G. Breyer  We know that because this is -- the words I read you are just one set of what I bet are hundreds of examples in these Guidelines if you go through and think it doesn't make too much sense.

Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, you'd say, I take it, that when I've tried to identify the design separately, I've ended up with something that is not capable of existing independently of the -- of the ""utilitarian aspects"" of the dress, because it looks like a dress.  So when Marcel Duchamp has a shovel on the wall and says it's a work of art, he can have a copyright as long as he doesn't try to sue people who make shovels.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's it.

Now, isn't that a -- what?   Eric J. Feigin  Well, Your Honor, it is --   Stephen G. Breyer  Why do we wear robes?   Eric J. Feigin  Your Honor, it is clear and it is common ground among the parties and with the Copyright Office that the actual cut and shape of a garment isn't copyrightable.   Stephen G. Breyer  What about Lemley's --   Eric J. Feigin  What we're here about --   Stephen G. Breyer  What about Lemley's test on page 17 of his brief? As I -- as I read it, as I read it and I thought -- and I'm sure you've read it -- and it seemed to me that it does say that a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional piece of clothing is not entitled to copyright because it is not a design of anything but a utilitarian object, the clothes, whether they are beautiful clothes, ugly clothes, cheerleader, or anything else.   Eric J. Feigin  Well, Your Honor, I think I -- we disagree that you can't take the aesthetic aspects of the cheerleading uniform and put them in a different medium.   Stephen G.

Feigin  Your Honor, as you've characterized the statement, we don't agree with it.  We do think that the two-dimensional artwork here is separable from the garment, the cut and shape of which is not copyrightable.  Let me just make a couple of points. One is about the act and what it's doing overall.  The act overall is drawing a distinction between the kinds of aesthetic communicative expressive functions that are traditionally protected by copyright and the kinds of mechanical, pragmatic, utilitarian functions that are exclusively the domain of a ""useful article."" And the kinds of functions that Mr. Bursch is talking about here are fundamentally expressive functions. First of all, conveying the information that someone is a cheerleader.  When someone is wearing a particular piece of clothing intended to convey that they're a member of a particular group or that they hold a particular belief, that is the kind of expressive function that copyright traditionally protects. And, indeed, there is an express exception in the definition of a ""useful article"" for conveying information.  And I think this is indistinguishable from putting a sports team logo on a T-shirt to identify someone as a Washington Capitals fan, for instance.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, before you get away from that, one thing very quick, because maybe I really agree with you.   Eric J. Feigin  I hope so.   Stephen G. Breyer  I had looked at page 22 of your brief at figure 8.  And what I had seen there when I took the arms away was a picture of a thing that was a picture of the cut and style and not just a picture of chevrons.  And so -- but if that's what it is, then you would agree and I would agree that it's not -- everybody would agree, I guess, it's not copyrightable.   Eric J. Feigin  The point of figure 7 and 8 in our brief, Your Honor, is that everything you see in figure 7 that's also in figure 8 is not copyrightable. That's the cut and shape of the dress.  It's the stripes and the coloration, the lines and the design in this particular arrangement.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what happens if when you look at the picture that they submit to the Copyright Office and try to figure out if it's separable what you see is a picture of a dress that goes around a woman which does look like, you know, shape and cut and so forth?   Eric J. Feigin  So they have generally checked a box, as they did here, that says two-dimensional artwork, and the Copyright Office understands all they're trying to protect is the surface imagery of the garment, and that, they'll register. I do want to address this idea that making the viewer look different is somehow the kind of non-expressive function that is associated with the ""useful article"" -- with a ""useful article."" And I think that approach would be contrary to congressional intent and completely inadministrable. If you look at page 55 of the House report, you'll see that Congress believed that two-dimensional designs on fabric or on wallpaper would be separable and thus copyrightable.  But that wouldn't be true under the approach petitioner is urging. Under that approach, you'd have to look at a particular two-dimensional design on wallpaper and try to assess whether and to what degree it might make the room look bigger or brighter or smaller or darker.  I'm not aware of any scientific reliable or consistent way --   ",15-866X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But the point, the question is, I think, if I -- because I have exactly the same question.  And it starts with the premise that everything has a design.  Some -- really, a lot of that set can be copyrighted.  All women's clothes have design.  All men's clothes have design.  For a hundred and more-than-that years, the fashion industry has not enjoyed copyright protection.  It is an industry on the women's side, I believe, that 225 billion dollars, at least, worth of clothes are sold every year.  If suddenly in this case we say that dresses are copyrightable, and they are because every one of them has some design, perhaps we'll double the price of women's clothes.  Now if that's -- that's, I think, the thrust of the question, and that is a practical question. I also have a conceptual question which I'd like to ask, but why don't you disabuse me of my notion that we are into monopoly big-time?   Stephen G. Breyer  And mine is about all dresses, all clothes, that's all suits.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I see it here, and as I look at it and cut away the wings, I have left -- this is page 22 of the ASG's brief -- what I have left is, I have left the design you're after.  It is a two-dimensional design that looks to me very much like a dress.  It looks very much like a two-dimensional picture of a dress that covers a woman's body.  Now, did you -- that's what you want to copyright, that thing --   Stephen G. Breyer  It's not.  So you have a different design.  So we are not talking about -- about figure eight.  We are not talking about figure eight.   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course.  It's a two- -- look, I can do a two-dimensional art work that looks like a Rubik's cube.  I mean, a two-dimensional can look like a three-dimensional thing.   Stephen G. Breyer  You didn't say you own the dress.   Stephen G. Breyer  What you said is you own the design of the dress.   Stephen G. Breyer  I -- now isn't -- you don't?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, wait.  I have a conceptual question.  I'm not yet satisfied with your answer to the practical question because I fear that any good designer or lawyer could go and take any dress or suit, just about, and produce a picture that looks very much like that and then sue the companies that use the same dress or style.  That's my practical, but this is the conceptual. Since we can take -- since we can take anything -- anything -- to a two-dimensional picture and put it on the wall like Marcel Duchamp, if I decide in your favor, am I not allowing copyright for virtually, assuming other things satisfied, every design of a useful article, the very thing that Congress said they did not want?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not talking about the shovel at the moment.  I am talking about an artist's ability to take a piece of clothing, which is a utilitarian object, and do a two-dimensional picture of the piece of clothing, which it has some things on it, some chevrons, or nothing.  It just looks like a dress. Now on your theory, does that not become copyrightable?   INTERRUPTING ",15-866X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  This is something that a direct answer to, because the statutes have changed so quickly that I may have lost track.  But the -- but the 3553(b) is what I'm looking at, and that talks about departures.  And I take it that the sentence for robbery was a departure.  The -- the guideline recommendation for -- and you did sentence the judge under the guidelines; correct?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  He didn't depart from the guidelines.  He didn't -- but he did depart from the guideline sentence, which was 48 months or 44 months.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And he went from there to one day. And 3553(b) says you have to -- I don't know if it's still law -- have to impose a guideline sentence unless the court finds there exists here a mitigating circumstance of a kind or to a degree not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guideline. So you'd look and see their guideline says 48 months, and they departed down to a day for the reason that there was this add-on sentence, the mandatory. Now, is there anything that suggests that the commission did not have that in -- take that into account? In other words, is it a proper factor for departure, viewed not now from what Congress intended, not viewed from the point of view of the statutes you've been referring to, but viewed simply from the view of the commission and the Congress as to when you can depart downward?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  This is a statute. And the statute says, Judge, if you want to depart downward, you can do so if you're applying the guidelines only for a reason -- the words are, to repeat them, a mitigating circumstance of a kind or to a degree not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines. I'm not giving you an answer.  It's not a hostile question; it's not a friendly question.  It's a question I'd like to know the answer to.   Stephen G. Breyer  But the basic reason was he thought that the mandatory was long enough.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But the basic reason, I think it's fair to say, is he thought the mandatories were long enough.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let -- let me assume that then.  And it seems to me as if I hadn't thought that through till this moment, and I still haven't, the relation of 50 -- 3553(b)  It may be you haven't thought it through either.  Maybe nobody has, but -- but I mean -- and maybe there isn't one, but -- but I -- I wanted to learn as much as I could if there is a relevance of that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I know 3553(a)  That isn't a problem for me. What I'm trying to think of is maybe this is a matter that lies in the hands of the commission. Maybe you could say, well, the commission didn't say you couldn't depart for that reason and, therefore, it is a factor, a mitigating factor not considered by the commission, but maybe the commission, should it choose to do so, could consider it and could say when it could and when it couldn't be, in which case the judge couldn't depart downward.  You see, that -- that's -- that's what's going through my mind and there's no point repeating myself.  You thought -- you might have thought about it, you might not have.  It's a little bit of a side issue.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I was thinking of at a deep level of what Thomas Reed Powell said about the law.  He wants us to think of this second part, you know, as related, but really no.  Look at the second part, keep it totally separate, and the statute means that the part about robbery has to be done separately. Reed Powell said if the -- you can think of a thing that is inextricably related to another thing without thinking of the thing to which it is inextricably related, you then have the legal mind. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what he wants us to do.  He says that's what the statute requires.   ",15-9260
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  It didn't say --   Stephen G. Breyer  It didn't say it anywhere. This is not taken into account by the commission, unless you can tell me there's a guideline on this particular application of the mandatory minimum.  And the statute and the guidelines both say a judge can depart for a reason not taken adequately into consideration by the commission. So unless you can point to me someplace where they take this into consideration, although they might in the future, I would say they didn't take it into consideration at all.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And therefore the language allows it.  The language allows it, and indeed the theory allows it, because the theory is you could have a person there who's convicted of 19 multiple counts, you know, and -- and the judge is given considerable power to work all this out so that you have overall a fair sentence.  All right? That's the whole argument. So what's your response?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know you do.   Stephen G. Breyer  Where?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where did you take this? Where.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You look at 2.4.  I missed it.  Where -- where is the place on --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where? Where? I mean, I -- my quick reading of 4, I promise I didn't memorize the guidelines.  I used to know them pretty well, but I don't know them perfectly, by any means, and never did. But it seems to me that comment 4 in 2K2.4 is saying that -- that defendant, you have committed a crime, and in our guideline as punishment for the crime, part of it is increased because you had a gun.  And so if we're going to apply the mandatory over here, which is our special statute here, don't apply that.  But I don't see anything there that says you can't subtract.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right --   Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe I'll find it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  He varied here.  He varied.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  And that's harder for you.  It's harder for you, because after all, if it's a variance, he's not applying the guidelines.  If he's not applying the guidelines, all this stuff in the guidelines that supports you is out the window.  And -- and -- including the sentence I read.  And if it's out the window, all we're trying to do is back where we started, is the statute -- does the statute, which doesn't mention this, forbid it, or is it otherwise unfair?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  My fault, not your fault.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's -- that's what I'm trying -- I'm not criticizing, not criticizing.  I'm trying to figure out what's the right system, putting this case aside.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, if we had the guidelines there -- try this.  If the guidelines were here, it wouldn't be such a problem, because they would have -- the commission could look into this and it could take the factor into account.  And then we'd have 3553(b) and we'd follow that in the future unless it's irrational. But they're out the window.  Okay.  They're out the window because it was a variance.  So now we're left with 924(c), you know, the statute, and we're also left with the provision that says that a -- a court of appeals has to look at a departure or a variance and see if it's reasonable.  Is that the right word? Reasonable or rational or something.  What's the word?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- on the appellate part.   Stephen G. Breyer  Over -- what -- what is it -- there's a word in the appellate part when they're doing the review.  Is it reasonable or -- you know, I'll look it up.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, I think it is too. Okay.  So now --   Stephen G. Breyer  Correct, correct, correct. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  So that's the -- that's the -- the question in this case beyond the case is really, how do we do that? And so -- so what I would try out is, it would be obvious if you're right and the statute is clear; okay? The -- the 924(c)  Then you win.  That's the end of it.  That's what you think.  I don't think it's clear. If it's not clear, what do we do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And now -- now, what about looking -- looking to see what the commission said about it, noting that this is an individual case, not general, not general where the district court has more power or other things.  Now you tell me.  Those are floating around in my mind.  I'd like to know what's floating around in your mind.   ",15-9260
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  For this -- for this argument I'm not sure, because of course they dispute that, and they have a long list of cases, Alsterbach -- or what, Aukerman and so forth, going back into history. And they have the man who wrote the statute, and they have words in the statute.  And they say if we look through all of those cases, what we will find is that there is a long history of applying laches in one legal context, or that it's -- that it's patents.  And anyway, almost all patent cases were equitable cases, and so it would be a big change, and you know all those arguments. Now you've come back and you have two arguments -- two cases the other way, and you say two are mistaken.  So it seems to me what I have to do on that one is read the cases.  And if I come to the conclusion that there is this long history here, then the laches should stay.  And if I come to the conclusion that no, if you really look at these cases, there isn't that history, then it should go.  But neither is it a case, one way or the other, of us making up anything. It's a question of what was the heart of the law for quite a long time before.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that right? I mean, that's how I'm approaching it, and I'm asking you to comment on that because I don't want to waste a lot of time reading cases I don't have to read.   Stephen G. Breyer  In the statute is the word ""enforcement."" And -- and when it is invalid, what's the word --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- ""unenforceable."" And that could apply just to the -- the -- you know, monkeying around with the patent, doing bad things to the patent, or it could include laches.  And the guy who writes it says, yeah, it includes laches.  And you could read it the other way not to.  So I didn't get too far with the statute, either.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I have one question on that.  I dissented in Petrella, and I thought to myself, I lost.  Okay? I lost that case.  How right I was, but nonetheless. So I don't want, I think in this case, just to repeat, I'm still dissenting, so I'll take Petrella as the law, at least I'm tentatively doing that.  And then I looked here to say, well, is there a significant difference? And I found so far you've mentioned them. Maybe case law and history, but I have to look that one up.  Maybe language, but there are two sides to that too. Then I found this.  That in Petrella, to me in dissent a major point, which was well-answered by the majority, is what's going to happen after about 30 years where the plaintiff has just laid in wait to see if the material is a success, after they spend all the money it's a success, and he sues for the last six years and collects all the profit while the defendant was the one who paid all the money that earned the profit. Never fear, said the majority, because you can deduct all that expense from the six years' profit that you're suing for.  Never fear.  And I didn't really overcome that argument very well. But in this case, it isn't true that you can deduct, and therefore plaintiffs can lie in wait to see, and it is 40 times more difficult for a company that has relied on their not suing to change the hundreds of billions of dollars in investment, and in case we think that's theoretical, Dell has filed a brief involving Sprint, Lucent and other companies where they spent close to billions knowing there was somebody out there who might sue, but he wasn't going to.  He led them to believe he wasn't, approximately.  And then later on they come back and they try to get all this money, just the profit, without the deduction of the loss when it's too late for the company to change. Now, I'll look into that, but that, in my mind, is a big difference.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I accept that.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  No, that isn't.  If it isn't -- look.  If it isn't unscrupulous -- if it isn't unscrupulous, laches doesn't apply.  If there is nothing unjust or inequitable about it, laches doesn't apply. I am not getting into an argument about who did or didn't behave unscrupulously.  I am assuming that there was unscrupulous behavior that would ordinarily call into play laches.  I am assuming that. For example, after telling him, don't worry, I won't sue, he phoned him up every day to see if the evidence has been burned up.   Stephen G. Breyer  I want to --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, you -- please. I think that whether there is unscrupulous behavior or bad or unfair behavior is a function of whether an existing doctrine, laches, applies to the case.  And that I think is the issue here. So I have to assume laches applies to the case, if laches applies at all, and that's what we are arguing about.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, it's not.  It's the difference -- the difference that when, in fact, in an appropriate case, you do sue under copyright, what you get is the profit from the last six years, minus the costs to produce that profit. When you do sue in patent, and the examples are in the Dell brief, you get the profit for the last six years without subtracting the money that previously went in to produce that profit, and moreover, companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars in reliance on whatever conduct gave rise to laches.  That's the differences.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can I go back a step, because you may have -- if I understand what you're saying, we have a case that would otherwise be laches. That is, every one agrees that Smith has Jones' patent. But Smith thinks that Jones has given him approval, a license, a very complex kind, and so he goes ahead and uses it.  Jones sells to a -- let's use a phrase that's not happy, but ""patent troll."" The patent troll gets the patent.  The patent troll looks at the license.  The patent troll says, I don't think this really works, the license.  I'm going to bring a lawsuit. He brings a lawsuit.  The judge thinks this is very unfair, given what the patent troll and everyone else had told the defendant.  Laches would normally apply. And I was saying now they're going to get vast profit without the expense that went into making the profit.  You say I'm wrong.  The reason I'm wrong is because you only get a reasonable royalty.  And in calculating the reasonable royalty, the judge will subtract the costs of producing that royalty during the six-year period, so you'll end up where you end up in copyright. Now, do I have the argument correctly?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I was thinking of the examples in the Dell brief, which undoubtedly you've read.   Stephen G. Breyer  Those are the examples in my mind.   ",15-927X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  A weak point in your argument is all -- most of those prior cases were -- were equity cases, but the weak point's weakened because most of those equity cases after 1897 were under provisions that had a statute of limitations, and the reason you didn't have laches in equity is because it didn't have a statute of limitations.  But here you did have a statute of limitations. So you have all those cases; that's your argument.  And I'm -- I'm actually just trying to summarize it so you'll tell me where it's not correct.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Strengthen it, but when you strengthen it, will you please spend about a minute or two on what I thought was another argument, which now has been seriously undercut, and I want to be sure you have a chance to address it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I was -- I was afraid of -- and I think I might have been well wrong to be afraid of it -- but moved in part by the Dell brief, I was afraid that a person with a patent or the transferee of that patent, in year 2, would have told the -- a licensee, go right ahead, go ahead, or not said anything when he could have or something like that, that would have given rise to laches.  That licensee would have spent billions on technology that is very hard to change.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And then in year 18, this person, now the transferee of the patent, sues him, and he is going to get six years worth of profits and nothing deducted.  Now they have told me that's totally wrong because what you would have done is gone back to year two, figured out a reasonable rate of return, and that's what it would have gotten. I'm still a little worried that he brings the same lawsuit in 19 -- year 19, year 20, years thereafter, and thereby really fixes this guy who has, in fact, invested $4 billion on the old technology.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I want to give you a chance.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The part -- the part I'm missing in your argument, I've focused it -- look.  Year 13, okay? It all turns on a license.  License.  Year 1. Gone.  Disappeared.  Far.  Can't find any witnesses, okay? So therefore, laches, if laches exists. Now, you say, the difference with copyright is that the people there involved are really locked in, that -- those are your words, ""locked in."" I want to say respect, locked in.  So what? Why does that make a difference?   Stephen G. Breyer  ""Locked in"" means you can't change.  Why is it relevant that you can't change?   INTERRUPTING ",15-927X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  All that will happen -- imagine you have the converse case. I mean, if we can have a law like this, so can every other country.  And now an American firm makes a part in some other country, all right? And that happens more and more.  They have laboratories all over the world.  They make a part.  They bring it back here.  It doesn't violate the patent law of the other -- of our country, not at all.  They sue to sell it all over the place. And suddenly a foreign patent holder, in, say, Switzerland, had -- takes this American company and obtains enormous profits on the basis of the sales in the United States, where those sales do not violate American law. I mean, suppose 10 countries do this. I try to think about that and I see chaos or confusion.  And at that point, I think part of comity is, what happens if everybody does it? And then I become uncertain about whether there's no place for our concern with what happens when we apply American law abroad.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  With effects abroad.   Stephen G. Breyer  I know.  I've read the cases and I've read the -- both sides and -- and I think you have an excellent case.  And they also point out that it's simply a different situation or it's just passing and they did it as -- you've read those too.  Okay. So I -- I -- I -- I -- you get a plus for that, in my mind, and -- but not a total plus because they get a plus too.  All right. So -- so I -- I -- I accept the argument, but I think I know the argument.  Is there anything else?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  These --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's not idiosyncratic.  We cover, for example, computer programs.  The Europeans don't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, there -- there are different views all over the world. Now what's bothering me are not the cases, but I can't find that they are in your favor 100 percent.  So let's assume that I'm right, that they're not clearly on your side. They're -- they may be open. What's bothering me is the practical problem that I brought up before of what happens in respect to third-party behavior where they are not violating the law and damages are here, are calculated on the basis of that.  What happens if 10 countries do that, if 20 countries do that? I see three possible ways of trying to deal with the problem.  One way is what they want.  Another way is through the notion of proximate cause, because there's a D.C. case, after Empagran, that takes that route.  And there may be a -- a -- a third route.  I don't know. I'm posing a practical problem and asking you what, if anything, you want to respond with.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, it's not double damages.  It is the chaos that would ensue if 10 countries have the same rule that you are advocating.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then maybe this is an easy case, but what's in the back of my mind, I reverse the idea, see, France has this law that you want here, right? Joe Smith goes to France one day and he makes a tiny particle, which it turns out violates somebody else's French patent.  He ships it back to the United States, where it forms a very small part of a very large and valuable gizmo.  And all of a sudden, we discover that he's paying the entire profit of the entire gizmo industry to some French company that had a small patent on a small part. Now all I have to do is generalize from that and I think, my God, we have a lot of problems here.  Now there should be some principle in law that cuts that off so my horrible example becomes just what you think it is, a horrible example with no practical bite.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm looking for that principle.   Stephen G. Breyer  The D.C. Circuit did that with Empagran follow-up in -- in a case which you may not have read.  Tell me if you haven't read it; I'll stop.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, they're -- they're using proximate cause to try to deal with this.  Does that ring a bell? Forget it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there --   ",16-1011
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What are they?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, that's -- that's where I'm -- I'm having trouble to be -- actually, to be specific.  I can imagine a problem if a large British or French or Swiss company, which makes items sold all over the world, farms out through a -- through a branch in North Carolina and makes a tiny part which it turns out infringes someone else's American patent. And, as a result for that -- of that, that French or British or Spanish company must pay to that North Carolina firm its profits from billions of dollars of sales across the world. Now that's not just hypothetical because an amicus brief cites to us the Marvel case where that really happened.  Okay? I can see how that would, in fact, upset foreign countries a lot, because, after all, it wasn't even a violation of any foreign patent law. And I can imagine them having similar statutes which then cause more problems. And that's all in your favor.  Yeah. But there is a principle of law that should deal with that and it's called proximate cause. And that's why I brought up the Empagran case below.  They didn't seem -- your opponents here did not seem very willing to embrace it.  But doesn't -- why doesn't that work? I mean, the problem is one of proximate cause and knowing where to cut it off.  And take comity into account when you apply proximate cause.  Don't have an absolute rule.  I thought that would be a fallback position for them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You could -- you could -- well, go ahead.   Stephen G. Breyer  However, it doesn't quite answer it, because the -- your client, I don't want to prejudice your client, but it didn't seem to me he was the strongest case for your argument.  I mean, the damages here are pretty closely related, I think, but there -- I can easily imagine cases where it's not. And so it's come -- the proximate cause -- yes, it's true, if you have a tough proximate cause law, tough, you will stop people from being fully compensated, but the reason you do it is because you're afraid with 92 district courts and juries and so forth it'll get out of control and be a kind of major problem with other countries.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The argument the other way -- and that's argument for you, say: Just cut it off.  The argument the other way is there are cases that will deserve it, deserve the damages.  And that's --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Anything you want to say about that?   ",16-1011

I mean, I thought that was an example of an exigent circumstance --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- but you know the area of this law better than I do, I -- I guess, and that isn't so.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, no, I've given you the facts.  The facts are there's a big pile of cocaine right there and there's somebody wandering around inside. And -- and can't he -- I don't know, what is an exigent circumstance if it isn't that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Fine.  Fine.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He has reason to think there's somebody in the house.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Or no --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So that -- yeah, if that's an exigent circumstance, and you happen to see -- now changing the situation -- you happen to see a motorcycle which is a rather unusual shape and happens to look identically like the one that you know was just stolen, you can't go and -- go look at it? You have to get a warrant? Of course, they drive away in the meantime, but, nonetheless, you -- you're there by yourself, no other policemen. It's in the window, okay, just like the cocaine, or it's in the driveway.  Why can't you?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know that.  That's why I thought the tarp made a difference.  And that's why I thought this was a case about a tarp, oddly enough, and not a case about whether you have an exigent circumstance.   Stephen G. Breyer  But you just told me I'm wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, I know that. What I'm trying to get at is I suddenly thought: I don't understand this case because you said the circumstance is the same without a tarp.  That's what confused me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's why I asked the question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you -- you don't dispute -- in other words, you -- in your view, you agree that the policeman standing on the sidewalk knows that that item covered by -- or at least has probable cause to it -- covered by the tarp is the possibly stolen motorcycle? You agree with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  So he didn't really have to lift the tarp at all?   Stephen G. Breyer  So that's his decision; he didn't have to.  I mean, in -- in your view, he could have just grabbed the whole thing, tarp and all, if he'd had access?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I know that, but I'm saying if he'd had access to it.  If they'd said please come to my curtilage.  All right? (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, if that had given him access, he could have just grabbed the whole thing, tarp and all.  Is your view -- I'm just saying do you agree -- you -- I thought from what you just said -- I -- I was surprised, but I thought that now you do agree that that is the case.  He could just grab the whole thing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you agree with that or don't you agree with that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You don't agree with that? Okay.  Okay.   ",16-1027
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So -- so look, I want to ask you two questions, and the first is just to be sure I have the basics right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay? The basics question is a weird hypothetical, but I'm using a weird hypothetical for illustration. The mad art burglar has just stolen The Thinker, Rodin's Thinker from the local museum.  It weighs 2,000 pounds.  And with his confederates, he's put it in his new glass house.  And the policeman stopping on the sidewalk looks in the window and sees: My God, there it is, the thing he's just stolen. I thought the law is that that policeman cannot go into the house until he gets a warrant.   Stephen G. Breyer  When he should -- that's the law.   Stephen G. Breyer  He told the confederates, they're not going to -- The Thinker is not going to escape, it weighs 2,000 pounds, okay?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  All right. Fine.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So, fine. Okay.  Now, the other Hornbook principle is it's not The Thinker, it's a wisp, a wispy bit of very suspicious drug smoke. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  And there, if, soon as the smoker, whom he sees in the window or he believes he's off on the side, as soon as he gets an inclination there's a policeman around, I'll tell you where all that drug is going to be, right down the sink, okay? In that case, he doesn't need a warrant, because there's exigent circumstance. Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And what we don't have in this case is we do not have the exigent circumstance.  By definition, you all have ruled that out.  Is that correct?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you might have it, but that's not in front of us.  That's not why we took the case.  That's not what this is about.  Right?   Stephen G. Breyer  But now -- wait, there are two differences between my example. One, it's curtilage, not house.  And, two, it is a movable thing, like a police -- like a -- like a car, okay. So the question is it's -- and, moreover, the policeman didn't know with any certainty -- he certainly suspected, maybe had probable cause -- but he didn't know that's the right motorcycle. Now, if all those things are true hypothetically, it's as if, though it's the curtilage, he saw in the middle of the driveway a box, and he thought inside that box there might be a motorcycle or drugs or something. And can he go up without a warrant and without there being exigent circumstances to open the box to look to see if inside there are drugs or a motorcycle? I thought that was this case. And even though -- and I think you want to say, yes, he can, if it's a motorcycle, but not if it's a box.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If it's a big box and carries a motorcycle --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- like a tarp, you can say yes -- you want to say yes, okay, and I would just wonder why? Why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, it's on the driveway.  It's in part of his house.  I know that the motorcycle is movable, but there is no exigent circumstance. He is search -- wants to look -- look into the box, open the tarp.  Why? Does the Fourth Amendment permit that? Okay.  That's a long, long question.  I just needed the basics, and now I've got to my point, and now I'd like to hear your answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  A porch is --   INTERRUPTING ",16-1027
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  You have the language, but -- but the -- the -- it depends, I guess, a lot on the background that this is being passed against.  And I -- as I've read this, the background -- I tend to agree with what the background is, but I'm not sure what the evidence is this. The background is 1988.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, you say that because I knew you would agree with me on that, but what's the basis for it? I see one thing for the basis -- because if it's a -- 1988 is the background, then normally the prevailing party in an appropriate case gets all the fee. He doesn't have to pay a dime.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  So if -- but now -- so it's important.  Are we operating against that as background or something as -- more general, which is -- which was the Chief Justice's question?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the only answer you've given so far is -- is, well, look at -- read the language.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not sure about the language.  I mean, is there anything else that supports the 1988 is the basic background?   ",16-1067
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you're -- you're using --   Stephen G. Breyer  Finish.  Finish.  Go.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's true.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it did, you're right.  I have the same question that the last -- actually, it was exactly what you said. Now, your -- your things in your brief talk -- they say limit costs and put it in the same position as non-incarcerated plaintiff. What non-incarcerated plaintiff? The first sentence of the statute says: ""In any action brought by a prisoner ... in which attorney's fees are authorized under Section 1988."" Now, that's fairly strong evidence that they're thinking, since it's right in the statute, the first line, that they're thinking of 1988 plaintiffs. Now, that's -- I'm just saying that I can't get too much out of the language.  You're right, it would have been absolutely clear if they had said, ""to help satisfy."" Then you would lose.  But they didn't.  They said, ""to satisfy."" So we have the language up here about up to, and we have the language down there about satisfy.  At that point, I, myself, am not certain, but then I do look to the purpose, which is what you're talking about. And then, when I see that, the first sentence is put them in the same position as 1988 plaintiffs.  Well, that's the only instance when they're going to get their attorney's fees.  But, but, okay? They will have to pay up to 25 percent. Now, up to 25 -- now we get into the language.  So I get into the puzzle.  My thought was, which I'm addressing the question to, we both have the sentence that he quoted on page 12 of his brief, which would have made a choice.  We can do this in one of two ways. We can say: Prisoner, you always pay 25 percent, or we could say: Judge, you decide, up to 25 percent. Which way? Well, I suddenly had this thought.  If we take the former, given the other provision of the statute which says you have to limit the attorney fees generally to a fair amount given the overall judgment, and these judgments are small, the poor district judge on your interpretation, facing a problem where the thing is small, all the burden is going to throw -- be thrown on the lawyer. It's going to be thrown on the lawyer because he'll have to reduce the whole attorney fee in order to make this prisoner, who suffered a lot, not be penniless or not really be hurt a lot.  See, he wants to help the prisoner. Am I -- are you following what I'm saying?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  And then -- then the only way to help the prisoner who's gotten such a small award is to reduce the whole attorney's fees.  But if we make it discretionary, there's another way.  You can have a reasonable attorney fee here, a little bit higher, and the prisoner doesn't pay the whole 25 percent.  We put some of it on the prison guard, the state, that's acted so abominably. Now, I think, which is the choice there? They're both reasonable choices. Then I go to page 12 in his brief, and the preceding language, and I conclude, hey, Congress was on a seesaw here, and they ended up on his side. Now, that's a little complicated, but that's where I am at the moment.  What do you want to say?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that inclusion -- now -- but, remember, if you follow this complicated argument --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- sorry to be so complicated, but the -- really I've the choice down in my mind.  It's the -- the victim here is not the government and it's not the -- the victim on your interpretation, as I've been through it, it is not -- it is not so much the prisoner, it is not so much the government; it is the lawyer, because -- because, as I said, the -- the -- the prisoner who suffered some, you know, pretty bad treatment and has got a very small award, the judge can help him out only by cutting the whole legal fee. But if the opposite interpretation is right, the judge has another tool.  The other tool is to make the defendants here pay more than 75 percent.  And so now we have two tools. The judge has more discretion.  He can deal with the different cases differently.  And first they tried the one, rejected it on page 12, and now they tried the other. Now -- now, that's where I am.  And --   Stephen G. Breyer  Mm-hmm.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  But here's another -- here's another -- I don't know, looking at the dictionary here, and on ""satisfy,"" isn't it the case that the government pays the rest of the reasonable fee, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  And everybody knows the government pays the rest of it, right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So think of a case where it's 12 percent, which you think it can't be, but suppose the judge says, 12 percent, you pay 12 percent, okay? Now, they're paying the rest from the government.  He's paying the 12 percent in the circumstances that satisfies the debt.  Think of bankruptcy.  Think of a settlement.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Think of a settlement.  You pay for the settlement -- you don't pay the whole thing; you pay some of it. That's why -- I won't read the dictionary thing.  It's a little complicated.  But it seems to me that -- that the -- luckily he -- I have a dictionary here all the time, and -- and it's -- it's helpful.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Then it satisfies it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then the whole statute's --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- linguistically satisfied or whatever.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  Right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And the obligation is to pay that portion of the debt that isn't going to be paid by the defendant, and by the time you're finished, the debt is satisfied.   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose she knows -- suppose she knows that he is going to eat that delicious turkey sandwich in the refrigerator. (Laughter.)   Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  There are a lot of different things, I mean, the simple basic thing, if you can just say it as simply as possible.  In law, as you well know, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. And so I think what's bothering from these questions people, as it bothers me, we -- there -- there are pro-choice states and there are pro-life states.  All right? So, if a pro-life state can tell a doctor you have to tell people about adoption, why can't a pro-choice state tell a doctor, a facility, whatever it is, you have to tell people about abortion? See? That's simple. The one we've said you can make a doctor who is very pro-life tell her about abortion, okay, I get it, and why don't we have to say, to keep sauces the same --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- that you're a pro-choice state, then you can make these people tell them about abortions?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I said do you want to draw a line as to whether it's actually the doctor, medical treatment about to do it, as not?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, I got it.  My other question, and it's the only other one I have, is you have a totally different line in which you are attacking this, and that is, you say, which is certainly a point, that this statute picks out 60 to 70 really pro-life facilities and says you have to post these signs, but nobody else does.  Right? Isn't that basic --   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now what are -- that sounds like you have a point there if that's correct.  But doesn't there have to be a trial on that? What did you argue? This is just a preliminary injunction.  Don't you have to have a -- a trial or present some evidence? I don't know what your evidence is.  I don't know what the evidence is on the other side. And -- and can we decide that without knowing the evidence?   Stephen G. Breyer  So, in your view, family planning clinics do not have to tell any woman about abortion -- adoption?   Jeffrey B. Wall  I think it depends on whether it's tied --   Stephen G. Breyer  No, they don't provide adoption; it's not their service.   Jeffrey B. Wall  As Petitioners were saying, if it is just a center that counsels people on abortion in a general sense --   Stephen G. Breyer  No, it doesn't.  It's a center that helps women plan their families. That's what it is.  Now it's not -- they don't have doctors who are performing abortions there.  I'm just saying it's a family planning center.  Okay? It's an information center. My point is the same.  There are millions of people in this country who have views on this subject that are absolutely opposed, one to the other.  So that, to me, suggests the law should keep it as simple as possible.  And that's why sauce for the goose, sauce for the gander. I mean, if the law is permissible which says, Doctor, you must tell the woman about adoption, then why shouldn't the law say, Family Planning Center, you must tell the woman about abortion? Sounds even-handed, sounds as if everybody in the same business is under the same rules. Now you, the government, and -- and the NIFLA are trying to make a distinction there.  And I need to know if you're right, and the only distinction I hear so far is one has a doctor about to perform and the other has just a counselor.  Is there any other distinction possible?   Jeffrey B. Wall  Justice Breyer, that is the crucial distinction.  I agree with you on the sauce is for the goose and the gander.  But when you are performing a medical procedure and you're making disclosures about your own services, what the plurality opinion in Casey says is -- this is at page 83 --   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, I kept -- it was about doctors.  I agree with that.   Jeffrey B. Wall  That's right.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I think for most people you'd think family planning, you know, family planning.  That's the category. And the woman will make a decision, and then the state can tell them some things they have to say.  And we know they can tell them about adoption.  They can make them tell them about adoption.  So why can't they make them tell them about abortion?   Jeffrey B. Wall  Because, Justice Breyer, that -- when you are going in to have a procedure and you've got to make certain disclosures, that's a disclosure related to --   ",16-1140
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  You see, that's what I gave up on.  I don't know.  I came away from these briefs and I think I got the impression that there are about 60 or so centers, maybe 70, that are really pro-life for religious reasons of different kinds, all right? And they don't want to talk about abortions. And then it seemed to me maybe there are a thousand centers all together in California, or several hundred, and I really did end up wondering, well, you know, all those centers, do the poor women really get the information about free abortions? I have no idea. I mean, the fact that they may have a Cal medical thing doesn't mean they tell everybody about it.  I don't know what they're like.  So this is my question: Don't we need a trial on this? And I don't see -- I mean, I'm just telling you right now I have no idea.  And your answers don't tell me.  They're not empirical. You haven't told me whether women who don't go to these 67 centers but do go to, say, 700, are all informed whether the center is a -- is a -- is a member of the Cal medical program or not. I don't know whether they're all informed, and I suspect that you don't either. And, therefore, I -- I -- I think trial, that's what they're for.  What's the answer to that?   Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, suppose -- to go to your first example.   Stephen G. Breyer  I just often wondered this.  I think -- remember the gardener?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, suppose you hire somebody to shovel your snow off your steps --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- every three weeks or so or every week or -- and the gardener does some gardening, burns some leaves, and you pay him more than $600 over the year.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then I guess you're required to file a 1099 for them.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know -- I don't know people who do.  I mean, maybe everybody in the country is a law breaker.  But I -- but I mean, if -- if their interpretation is correct, in your view, that would give them the power in their discretion to indict, I won't say half the country, but -- but a -- but a very significant number of people, is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  If they know of this requirement and if they want to help the gardener or whatever.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that is right, you're sure that's right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, they want to help the gardener and they know about it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I wasn't thinking of those people.  I just think that there are many, many, many, many regulations in the code that are -- seem to be quite trivial to an ordinary person.  And they might, in fact, not pay that much attention to every form and, moreover, maybe they even want to help the gardener.  All right? Now, I think there are many such people in the 1099 case, but I don't know. That's why I asked you whether it was an appropriate example.   Stephen G. Breyer  But how did they in Aguilar? I mean, I took -- I read the language in Aguilar and I thought it was very helpful to your case.  The statute's identical --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- virtually, except administration of justice instead of administration of this title.   Stephen G. Breyer  And then it's quite limited how they interpreted it.  But I -- I'm not totally clear as to what significance -- they said something about a nexus --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- but a nexus to what? I mean, and -- and --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- what's your understanding of that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So your argument is nexus to a pending proceeding, interpreted with the same language except it says administration of justice should lead us to say nexus to a pending proceeding in a statute that's identical, but the words are administration of this title.

Breyer  You realize everybody in this audience now knows about the 1099 form, right? (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why? Why? I mean, that's -- you have used several times the words ""specific intent."" So is it the -- specific intent to me in the law means knowledge that the particular action is unlawful.   Stephen G. Breyer  So are you saying the government's position is we cannot under this statute prosecute any person for anything he does unless that person knows that what he is doing, such as giving money to a person in cash, will be used to provide a benefit to that person that is unlawful, he knows that doing this, what he is doing, is unlawful, and unless he knows that, the statute does not permit prosecution?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, don't think it's accurate.  I want to know if the government of the United States is saying this statute does not permit us to prosecute any person, unless that person knows that the action he is taking -- I'm repeating myself -- such as giving the money in cash, breaks the federal law, and he also knows that what he is doing in giving that money breaks the federal law?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If he does not know both of those things, he cannot be prosecuted under this statute.  Now, I'm interested in the position of the United States, on that question of interpretation, it is an interpretation of the word ""corruptly.""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, the answer is the position of the United States is what I just said is correct.  No one can be prosecuted unless both those things are true?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  I would like a yes or a no answer to the question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The answer is yes. Okay.  Thank you.  That's helpful.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The self --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you are --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- if you want, I want this answer.  I don't want to interrupt your answer, but I want you to augment it. And you started to do that when you started to talk about just what you were talking about.  Look, if I put it differently, three principles: One, the Chief Justice, I think, enunciated, and I -- it sounds comical if I'm going to say it, but -- but it's very important; it is not an appropriate way of interpreting a statute. Look, perfect criminal statute, it is a crime to do wrong in the opinion of the attorney general.  Don't worry, we'll interpret it properly. Even if you do interpret it properly, no.  The answer under the Constitution, I think, is no. The second principle is right here in Aguilar, both of them, the second and third. ""We have traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute, both out of deference to the prerogative of Congress and out of concern that a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand of what the law will do, if a certain line is passed."" From those principles, they conclude that a statute identically worded to this one but for the word justice instead of title requires a nexus be shown to a specific grand jury or jury proceeding, a -- a court proceeding, even though, of course, you can read the word justice to include the investigators and many other things. All right.  They're saying, in effect, you take those same principles, that same limiting restriction, and do the same analogous thing here. Now, why not?   ",16-1144
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  In which case I have just one question, which is forget the consolidation for a moment, just to clarify in my mind; think of Rule 54(b), imagine it's a case with a lot of parties and a lot of issues, and Rule 54(b), I think, says that ""the court can direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, the claims or parties,"" right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now suppose a judge does that as to one of the claims.  At that moment, the clerk writes a separate piece of paper and it says final judgment as to that claim, right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's important because -- because what I'm going to ask you is -- is -- there is a single piece of paper here, is there not?   Stephen G. Breyer  And it says final judgment, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  So I thought perhaps there is a rule somewhere which says when there is a final judgment on a separate piece of paper, you can take an appeal.  But there is no such rule that I can find. Rather, what it says is the appeals courts have jurisdiction over every decision, final decision.  It doesn't say ""final judgment."" And so, if it says ""final decision"" and there is no place where it says you can always appeal from a final judgment, then whether this counts as a decision for purposes of appeal, is it a final decision, is up for grabs. And the policy arguments and the old statute and the old case are all relevant. Now, have I got the question right?   Stephen G. Breyer  I do?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So then we are going to decide -- if we decided against you and said, no, final decision does not always mean final judgment, and, indeed, this is a case for the policy reasons they list, for example, where it doesn't count, okay, and the judge has to -- all right.  What havoc would we work?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I know you think that, but I want to know what.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so all the time, under Rule 54(b) when he issues a final judgment, it's always appealable? True or false?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, he doesn't certify it.  What he does is follow 54(b).  He enters in a normal case, not consolidated, a piece of paper which says this is a final judgment in respect to claim number 1 of the -- there are 42 claims in the case.  That piece of paper is entered. Is there always an appeal, yes or no?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you will -- I will be able to find authority where -- that supports this; is that right? And where is that authority in your brief? Because I want to -- the authority is for the proposition, forgetting consolidation, that once a piece of paper under 54(b) is entered, says final judgment in respect to some but not all of the case, there is always an appeal. Where is that authority?   Stephen G. Breyer  Where is the authority that says that's what Rule 54(b) means?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, it must have come up.  Surely, somebody has tried to take an appeal sometime from a judgment under 54(b) where there are 92 parties in a case.  Like a BP, they have 4,000 parties, okay, and -- and one of them gets a partial judgment and it's entered under 54(b), wants an appeal.  That's never come up? Okay, you don't have the authority.  I'll look for it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.  That's what I wanted to know, actually.   ",16-1150
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's why I'm interested in Rule -- in Rule 54.  I'm interested in a case where we're not interested in consolidation. So rule -- under that rule, no consolidation because the finding of what Justice Ginsburg said, a district judge can enter a final judgment as to some but not to all the parties or claims. Now, once you as a lawyer see that piece of paper that says final judgment, you think: I better appeal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Period.  Now, if there is nothing to the contrary, there is a strong argument for doing the same thing here because lawyers then know, once they see a piece of paper saying a final judgment, bong, appeal. Now, sometimes they also have to know that if someone has moved for a new trial and it's granted, then, of course, there's no longer a final judgment.  But that wouldn't be true in Rule 59 or 50, what was it, 50, wherever it was, 54, in respect to a new trial for some of the other parties.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That wouldn't affect the judgment on -- that says final judgment as to Smith when Jones gets a new trial on other issues. And so why wouldn't the lawyer think exactly the same here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's the same process.  It's the same thing.  It is totally consolidated, perhaps no more and no less than an ordinary case with thousands of parties and thousands of issues.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Okay.  So --   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now I think I may be getting this.  You say, look, here's what you want us to say.  Once you see your cases consolidated for all relevant purposes -- I mean, there could be exceptions, but forget that for a second -- for all relevant purposes, you have what the rules call a case with multiple claims involving multiple parties, both. And, therefore, what you do, lawyer, is if you want a quick appeal, you tell the judge to make an express finding that there is no just reason for delay.  Judge, you must make that finding or you cannot enter a final judgment.  Whatever you call it, it isn't a final judgment.  That's because of the ""otherwise"" language. So you want the consolidation -- it would be nice if it explicitly, but you want us to say it implicitly references 54(b) and that's how we should handle it; is that right or wrong?

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  A problem.  You produced an irresistible example which I can't resist. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  And, therefore, I suspect that the key of your example is the word -- the word ""something,"" not the word ""respecting."" And when you say ""tell me about,"" what usually that means is ""all about."" But let's try it with the word ""statement,"" which is in the statute.  Make a statement about his batting average.  Make a statement respecting his batting average. There, I'm with Justice Kagan; I have a hard time seeing the difference.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, not tell me. Make --   Stephen G.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Fine, fine.  What's the difference between what various professors have suggested I might have written in places that we should give respectful deference to the -- the opinions about the foreign nation, highest court or appropriate, respectful deference and what the court here said? We defer to the Ministry's reasonable interpretation that the term means or suggests. I mean, maybe there's a difference between ""defer to a reasonable interpretation"" and ""give respectful deference to."" But what is it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what you want us to do is to say you used the term ""defer to a reasonable interpretation"" and you should have used the term ""we give respectful deference to."" And for that reason, we would like you to reconsider the whole thing. Now I -- I -- I see that.  It certainly has a point.  But I'm afraid people would sort of start to smile on the court of appeals when we wrote such an opinion.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Well, what is it?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  In this Court, we have a brief submitted by what they purport to be the official interpreters of Chinese law, which you'll hear in a couple of minutes, and they say, one, it is Chinese law that these individual companies -- like our Webb-Pomerene association is what they are -- they -- but they have to make an effort to get together on price, and even if they don't, someone who exports must export at the price that the Chinese Webb-Pomerene association fixes. Normally, you get three producers in a room, they can agree on price.  That isn't a tough problem.  So -- so they'll agree.  And then, when they do agree, the key point is you can't export unless you follow their price. Now I asked my clerk to go through the record and see if there's anything in the lower court that actually suggests that isn't Chinese law.  Well, I don't know, not much. So that's my question.  What is there? What is there? Before we send this back to say you shouldn't have used the word ""reasonable interpretation,"" you should have used the word ""respectful deference,"" what is there, given the brief filed here, that you will use or could use to suggest, or have used, I haven't seen it here, that that isn't the law of China?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That isn't my question there, on that part.  It is what is there that suggests that a Chinese exporter could set a price lower than the price set by their equivalent to the Webb-Pomerene association? That's -- is there any evidence on that point?   Stephen G. Breyer  What?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  That -- that -- that would be a point.  And yet that might also equally prove that they don't all follow the law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We're not.  But, I mean, in Pink and others, that's the other part.  I don't know.  They filed a brief in this Court, and shouldn't we take as given what they say in that brief?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, fine.  But here we have a government.  They say this is our law.  And is there -- I don't know the answer to that question, but I think it could be that we should take that as the law, unless you come up with a fairly good reason to think that isn't a -- that isn't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So -- so -- so what are -- look, what do you want? What words do you want to appear in the opinion? I mean, you're representing the State Department, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay, fine.  The State Department, I'm sort of interested in their opinion, very.   Stephen G. Breyer  A hundred ninety-two countries.  We have nearly 1,000 federal judges.  The -- by and large, the characteristic of a federal judge is he knows very little, if anything, about the law of 192 countries. And so what precisely should we write in this opinion? It can't be no matter what, accept what they say.  But, my goodness, if you open the door, I mean, how -- how is this to be done? So that's why, ""respectful deference,"" I don't know if that's the right phrase.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I don't know if ""defer if it's reasonable."" Reasonable seems to open it.  So what are the words that these 900 judges are going to follow when they get submissions from the highest legal authorities in 192 countries without producing some kind of international chaos?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, if it's not supposed to be that, and we're not supposed to tell them, what is it we're supposed to say? And if you say open the door, maybe we could say, of course, do whatever the State Department tells you.  I mean, that is -- I'm making it sound facetious, but there -- there -- you can work out that kind of thing.  Is that what you want?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, what?   Stephen G. Breyer  There is, of course, the risk that the State Department will say thing A when it's country A and B when it's country B.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about saying when in doubt you can ask the State Department, see what they think.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Take it into account for what it's worth.   Stephen G. Breyer  You're seriously saying what you want us to say is say nothing? Say nothing about what the standard is, nothing other than some general word like ""respectful deference""? Should we say that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, when --   ",16-1220
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what should we say in general? I just want you to reach that, because I can see three possible things.  Say they're like a state.  I'm sorry, if Texas' Supreme Court says this is the law of Texas, I don't care what somebody else says, that is what the law of Texas is, whether they held the exact opposite yesterday or not. Another possibility: Chevron.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Okay.  Another possibility: Skidmore.  You see? We take it for the power to persuade but not the power to -- you know, it doesn't have the power to -- we just take it for what -- what it's worth and we show respectful consideration. And maybe we could limit it to the instance where it's the highest interpretive authority of the state, or nearly that, and instances where there are four professors getting into an argument about it. I mean, I'm having a serious problem, as you could tell, as to what words to put in this opinion.  You're worried about winning. I'm worried about what words to put in. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We have very good authorities.  You know, the professors are telling us, no, the right language is respectful consideration.  And, well, I'm not being facetious.  They -- they spend a lot of time looking at this kind of stuff all over the world.  And -- and so that's a significant factor.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So the words, to get back to the question, the words you want us to put in the opinion, at least in respect to the highest or near highest authority or -- or -- or -- or are what?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's the -- do we draw that distinction, the formal submission of a foreign sovereign? The reason I ask that is -- you practice in this area, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  My impression, not practicing in the area, is these -- this is an unusual case because this normally arises, say, in a contract dispute among private parties, and it says interpret it according to the law of China. And so you'll have experts who say what it is, and they'll conflict.  And the judge has to make a decision.  That's the normal case.  This is an unusual case because the sovereign country of China is itself interested, and that's why they've submitted this. Now do we recognize that in an opinion that's laying down a standard? Do we use a term like you just used? What is -- how do we preserve what, I guess, in an ordinary case should be a judge making a difficult decision in terms of conflicting evidence from this case, where you have the nation itself directly interested in the affair? Maybe the answer is don't distinguish. Maybe it is distinguish.  What do you think?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.   ",16-1220
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why? Why? That's -- I mean, that's the part -- the point that was a very practical point. When I'm a judge on the First Circuit, I would say in multiple party, multiple, you know, gang cases and so forth, one of the most common things was a defendant would appeal, either saying it should have been a sever, he should have been severed if he wasn't, or he shouldn't have been if he was, and so forth. Very, very common. And so what was worrying me is that the prosecution, if we -- if we adopt something like you say, and the defendant comes in and says, I want to be severed here at least as to some of the counts, the prosecutor thinks, if I agree to that, I don't know what's going to happen. You know, we'll get some kind of a verdict in this first case.  And all I know in the second case is that his lawyer is going to argue that there are various aspects of it that are inconsistent with going ahead with this and we're not going to be ahead with it.  At worst, there will be some appeals.  It's going to be a nightmare.  And the best thing for me to do is just say no. And -- and that is exactly what is worrying me.  And -- and you have an alternative.  You can say treat the severance as if it were a single trial and just, as you say, he waived the double jeopardy matter when he appeals, so you could say he waived it when he asked for the second trial, you know, when he asked for the separate trial. I have a problem with theirs too, so I'm not just saying that -- that this is the problem I had with yours.  So you say, well, it hasn't worked out that way in Florida.  Hmm.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why wouldn't it work out that way?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But there will be reasons --   Stephen G. Breyer  What I'm worried about --   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm worried about other -- that there are other situations.  And the most common claim was I should have been severed and I wasn't, or vice versa, they never win.  I mean, the claim hardly ever wins. It's really left to the trial judge. And so I -- I -- I recall that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, I'm not -- that isn't -- I'm just so worried about this prosecutor who now is going to take the government's position against and throw, in a very big trial with 19 defendants, some guy who happened to be on the corner, you know, and the jury isn't going to distinguish among them, and you see where I'm going.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I see, I see.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's claim preclusion.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So what's the difference? That is -- I -- I misspoke.  It's issue preclusion.  That's how we prevent the government from prosecuting the second poker player robbery.  Okay?   Erica L. Ross  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Defense in the first case was I was in Chicago at the time.  The jury accepted it.  Okay? Now we're into the second case and he was just as much in Chicago.  All right? Now, you're saying he waived that when the only difference is that you separated the trial. That's all.  They started trying both together and now it's separate.  But it ends up two separate trials. And what I think I'm having trouble grasping is why you should treat that any differently.  And now your argument is because he's waived it by conduct. So Justice Kagan says, hey, he's waived it by conduct.  Let's just be sure he waived it.  Let him waive it expressly, if he wants to waive it, because after all the Constitution says that no person shall be held, you know, for jeopardy twice, or whatever it is. And now we -- (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  You get the point?   Erica L. Ross  Yes, Justice Breyer, I do.   Stephen G. Breyer  You get the point. He's waiving a constitutional right and, therefore, why shouldn't it be express? And that's -- that is where I think I stop because I want to know your answer.   Erica L. Ross  Certainly, Justice Breyer. So my answer is that the same argument could have been made and I think, in fact, was made in Jeffers, that essentially in Jeffers the defendant said: I want to be tried separately. And then later he said: Well, actually, this is a lesser included offense in a greater offense, and that under this Court's precedent, now means that I was actually charged with one offense.  And so I should have had one trial. And this Court said, no, when you made the agreement to have two separate trials, you should have said at that point that these might be the same offense, and, actually, I want to have one trial. The Court said, if there is a right in the background under the Double Jeopardy Clause, it is the defendant's to invoke. And for that reason, I think that the same logic would apply here.  If when Petitioner agreed to have two separate trials he actually thought, well, later I would like to be able to bar or limit that second trial because they're, in fact, for the same offense, that's my right to invoke now.   ",16-1348
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can I --   Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I -- look, it's complicated.  And I keep trying to simplify it. And -- and tell me what's wrong with this simplification. All right.  Let's take two examples, or three.  Example 1, all right, the defendant is accused of two crimes, A and B.  He is tried first on A and acquitted.  Then a few months later the prosecution decides B. Now nobody objects, do they, two totally separate trials, no nothing, that this issue preclusion thing applies in B, however it applies.  I mean, however it applies, it applies in B.  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now let's take Example 2.  Example 2 is they decide to try both A and B in the same trial. Now here, if he's found guilty of one, even if it's totally inconsistent, the verdict stands, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  And the reason it's right is because this is in a sense allowing a little bit of jury nullification in.  We think: Well, the jury thinks that's the fair thing to do.  Okay? Now, if those are the two examples, we have here Example 3.  It is a different jury, but it once was not.  So, since it is a different jury, our reason for allowing the inconsistent verdicts in my example no longer exists. This was not a jury that saw the whole thing.  It was a jury that only saw this case. And, therefore, let him assert the double jeopardy, whatever it is, because our reason for not doing it isn't there. Now, of course, we'd have to have a corollary, unfortunately, for -- what did you call it, the -- the bifurcated jury, because there it is the same jury.  I don't know what to do about that one. But -- but the -- the -- in -- in these three, see, my three examples, I just say is the reason for Example 1 there in our case, answer no, so treat it like two separate trials. And, by the way, if the prosecutor has a problem, he can always insist on a written waiver if the defendant really wants the separate trial.  All right. So what's wrong with my examples?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't say the state in the Constitution.  It says ""shall not be subject to."" So -- so, I mean, can we do this, which is a more -- I'm trying to get my hands on this case, which is filled with complexity. Just say: Look -- Justice Gorsuch asked this question, and I'll just do it again -- we're not certain -- we don't have to decide the contours of issue preclusion.  Isn't there enough agreement among the lower courts and in this Court that there is something to it in some cases? And then say: Whatever that is -- we're leaving it, you know, to the research and so forth, but whatever that is, the question here is whether the doctrine, in some form or other, applies when there is the second trial as a result of the -- the Virginia law or as a result of the waiver or as a result of whatever.  Can we just do that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Which, the second?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That is exactly why I've -- I was interested.  You say you're primarily relying on literally. Well, I think in 10 minutes the two of us could think of hundreds of examples maybe, or at least 50, where just, look, any seamstress or customer who makes or wears dresses. Hey, they don't mean the seamstress who wears dresses.  They mean the customer who wears dresses and the seamstress makes the dresses.  Any professor or student who teaches or learns at this university, they don't mean the professor who learns at the university. They mean the professor who teaches and the student who learns. Any salesman who -- what's the word, you know, sells or -- sells cars or -- we -- you see the -- but I think there's so many examples like that, that that seems to be the natural meaning.  You have two words over here that are verbs, two words over here that are nouns.  The first seems to go with the first, the second with the second. And if I just gave you this and you knew nothing else about it and you were just looking at the literal words, I would have thought on a bet you would have said that's the interpretation.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  Okay.   Stephen G.

Breyer  Yeah.   ",16-1362
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  You can read it that way.  I have no doubt that might even be the most natural reading.  Suppose the word were ""involved in"" instead of ""engaged in.""   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, it would.  And so what we're doing is we're trying to parse the difference between ""engaged in"" and ""involved in"" in a fairly technical statute involving one of 40,000 different kinds of workers as part of a very general statute. Now, that to me rings a bell that if this isn't a question for an agency, what is? Now, all right.  So, if I'm thinking that, and maybe no one else is, I'm only speaking for myself, I was sort of surprised that nobody in the Ninth Circuit referred to a doctrine that nobody refers to anymore.  It's called primary jurisdiction.  And it can be used to ask the relevant department to file a brief, and nobody did that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, suppose I -- suppose -- suppose I -- I think, gee, I don't know the answer to this question.  It's highly technical.  I do look to purpose.  The purpose, apparently, was that they put these mechanics in there because they had farm equipment somewhere, that people go in the middle of the night, so they didn't have fixed hours. Whether that was so or not, I don't know. And maybe the service person would call at 2 in the morning and tell the farmer he's coming, in which case he doesn't have fixed hours, so he should be exempt too. I don't know.  So suppose I start -- you see the attitude? Have you any advice for me at all?   Stephen G.

Do we have now subsection 18.378 of LaFave, which is called the car rental cases? See, Fourth Amendment law is too complicated in a sense already.

And over a wide range, who knows what's in them? And what can be expected? That's awfully complicated.  And, therefore, I'm looking for something simple.  And the simplest thing that we were discussing, it seemed to me, is to say the following: Where the individual has all the other indicia of the right to control the -- and fill in the blank -- here it's a car, he's sitting there driving it, that he can assert a right to privacy and has standing, unless it is criminal, unless it is a crime.

It doesn't say in (p) that outside those circumstances the person is liable for an equivalent amount.

Stephen G. Breyer  Oh yeah, that's why I mentioned the fact -- if -- if you go back into the history.   Stephen G. Breyer  -- of the forfeiture, it's quite different from that.  The history of the forfeiture was you had to have the property itself and certainly if we're looking to history and tradition, history and tradition are the one thing when you're talking about criminal liability and it seems to me, which is why I asked, quite the opposite.  When you're talking about forfeiture.   Stephen G. Breyer  But in both of these in your answers, I take it, it happens to say, and we have -- we're trying B.  And A is around, but we're trying B who's gotten nothing.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, it says you can use 853(p) if the property described in subsection (a), as a result of any act or omission of the defendant.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, it wasn't the act or omission of the defendant.  It was A who mixed the money, who hid it, who went to Mexico, et cetera.  But you're saying you still can get it from B.  And I guess your reasoning is somehow these words, am I right, in (a), ""Any property constituted or derived from any proceeds the person obtained,"" okay, you say that includes money that his co-conspirator obtained because of the under --   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  If that's so, I just want to be sure.  When we get to -- when we get to (e), which is called protective orders, I suppose on your theory that we have five people in a conspiracy, two, three are couriers, you know, they were found somewhere on a beach and they drove a truck and they have nothing, or they only each have about a thousand -- no, not nothing, but a hundred thousand dollars, and then we have A and B, who were the leaders and they have about 10 million. So on your theory of protective orders, you issue a protective order against all their assets, all five, and they can't hire lawyers, a matter which is a different issue, I understand, they can't hire lawyers. They may have to pay, even though the money is way over there with A and B.  I mean, it does bother me that they can't even hire lawyers on your theory.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, suddenly it seems to me we've switched meaning here, because now we're talking about the bag of money.  Now, does the word ""property"" -- the bag of money in A, mean the bag of money and not the substitute in B's bank account, which has never seen the light of day in any crime, or doesn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And you're able to do that under what statute? You see, everything until you said ah, you see the last clauses here, I could follow in a statute.  A statute that Congress said this is pretty exclusive. Now --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- it's only the things following that qualification that I can't find in any statute.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But (p) unfortunately says because of an act or omission --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- of the defendant, and then it adds, if act or omission of the defendant in, I think, respect to property described in (a).   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, is -- is this mysterious bank account which never saw the light of day within (a) or isn't it? Now, it sounds to me, and I'm not -- it does honestly sound that way, sometimes you seem to say yes and sometimes you seem to say no.   ",16-142X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why does it matter? The insurance company gets a letter saying I want my wife to be the beneficiary, period.  So that's the beneficiary.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I take it here the contract is -- let's call him Mr. Smith -- he has a contract with an insurance company. That contract provides that after a divorce the money will still go to the designated beneficiary. They pass a law and it says it will not go to the beneficiary that you initially designated, unless you act affirmatively. Right? That's the contract.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's the situation in front of us?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  Okay.  Now I found this -- three cases from the 19th century -- 1870s, 1880s, 1923 -- not a period when this Court was about to interpret the Contracts Clause loosely.  I think that's fair. One of the cases says the legislature passes a law after Smith, who is a bondholder of a corporation, enters into a contract with the corporation.  So this is a contract, Smith and the corporation.  They have a bond. The legislature passes a law that makes that bond less valuable, less valuable. All right? Applies it retroactively.  And this Court says: That's fine. You know why? Because all that Smith has to do in order to stop its value going down, rejecting the change, is affirmatively notify the company.  And they say: No, that isn't a big deal.  Okay? Case two: Smith buys property at a tax sale, at a tax sale.  All right? Now the owners can get it back, by the way, if they pay their taxes within a year or some period of time.  They pass a law retroactively saying: Smith, you can't keep your property unless you tell the owners they're about to lose it. That would seem to make quite a difference, because, after all, if they find out, they might object and pay the back-taxes. The court says: Not a big deal.  It doesn't violate the clause. Case three.  Okay.  What's case three? Conley.  Yeah, Smith has an agreement with the mortgage company.  It says: Where there is foreclosure, the mortgage company has to do A, B, and C.  Retroactively, the legislature says: Oh, by the way, mortgage company, you also have to do D, which is file an affidavit. Surely, an affidavit is no easier to file than to write a letter to an insurance company.  The Court says: That is not an obligation -- you have not violated the Contracts Clause, because filing an extra affidavit is not a big deal. So, when I read those three cases, I looked at what they said was not a big deal. Then I looked at the obligation here, which is simply write a letter to the insurance company if you don't like they're changing the designation that I originally put out.  And I thought maybe this isn't a big deal. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  Which, of course, is just what they're arguing.  So I would like to know, how do I, forgetting Blaisdell, hold for you?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Just like the mortgage contract.  All right, go --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No -- so -- so go ahead.  Sorry.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Okay.  Go ahead.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Which is easier? Which is easier? To produce an original bond that you bought, say, 20 years ago, and who knows where it is, or to write a letter saying, please, keep my wife as beneficiary? That's a loaded question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I said likely. I mean, I don't know.  I'm not a family law expert, which family law is the most difficult subject I think there is.  It's horrible, human, terrible.  It's really difficult. But if I were to guess, I would guess that when there is a divorce proceeding, there's a lawyer, quite often, usually, and he discusses with his client, the lawyer, what -- that this is likely to affect property. Now I'm not saying which, but a lot of people would think: I have an insurance policy.  Now I don't know that that happens, but I suspect.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're absolutely right on that.  I mean, that might not be a fair question because sometimes people will and sometimes they won't.  And I think you're originally saying often they won't think of it, and that's true.  And sometimes they will think of it, that's true.  I don't think actually perhaps neither of us knows how often they think of it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Just one second.  I took -- I took Justice Alito as asking something like this, but -- and I am curious. A lot of people did buy life insurance policies before 2002 which don't say anything about it, right? They bought it before. A lot of people probably were divorced between 2002 and 2018.  So what, if you win this case, what happens to all those people who were told by their lawyers that state law means that your wife is no longer the beneficiary unless you write a letter to the insurance company? And they say: Good, I don't want her to be.  I want my children to be.  Great. What happens to those people if you win this case?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm just saying obviously the question is do all those people who thought their children would get the money, they're just out of luck? Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They have to -- they have to find out about this case, if you win, and maybe they just read Supreme Court cases -- it's possible -- (Laughter.)   ",16-1432

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  You can do this too, I guess, with the -- can't you, with the need in state-run hospitals to restrict conversation in certain areas to medical matters, the need in law schools or other schools to restrict conversation in the class to the subject that is being taught, including politics, the need in -- I don't know, you make it up, but I -- because that's what we're doing, that's what I'm doing, and I can think of many, many instances where thousands, perhaps millions, of people have to have the authority to operate a standard to restrict the speech to the subject that's at hand. And so, if, in fact, we are trying to have a place where a person has reflective thought for a moment after the hurly-burly of the campaign, this problem will inevitably arise. One way of correcting mistakes is through as-applied challenges after the event. So my question is, how does that work?   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose in the examples that you've heard there were mistakes made.  The person who's running it thought that the Rainbow Coalition was an issue in the case because one party wanted to have it and the other party was against it.  Suppose he made a mistake and kept out the person with the sign or the T-shirt, either of which could have a rainbow on it. Suppose he's mistaken.  Is there any remedy in your state?   Stephen G. Breyer  So let's continue on this because I -- I'm finding it useful.  It sounded to me from your response, both to the Chief Justice and to me, that there are two people who make the decision as to whether it is or is not political.  One is the election official, and the other is the person carrying the sign or wearing the T-shirt. Both make that decision because, if the second decides that the first is wrong, he simply goes in and continues to carry it.  Then his name appears in a book, all right? If he does not want his name in a book, is there any action he could bring in order to remove his name from the book on the ground that it wasn't political?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They bring an APA action or, you know -- saying that this was unreasonable and improper listed.   Stephen G. Breyer  So they could get a judge to do it, you think?   Stephen G. Breyer  But it's never happened because it's never been a problem.  Is that the answer?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   ",16-1435
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  It's a two-sided market.  I mean, I -- I -- I've never seen such jargon.  In -- in my own mind, I can think of joint costs, oil and gas in a well.  I can think of complementary products, nuts and bolts, can't have a nut without a bolt, and I can think of combining the two, nuts and bolts made out of a special thing called titanium uranium.  Okay? Now there we are.  And I can think of different uses for the notion that you have two different products.  Some people might say that shows that this agreement had no effect.  Ah, if that's the use, I wonder why they entered into it.  Okay? Then, second, I can imagine them saying: The reason that we have this agreement is because it creates a new, wonderful titanium uranium bolt that never would have been produced otherwise.  That's like the manufacturers getting together and saying we have price fixing in order to stop poisoned toys.  Okay.  It's never been used as an antitrust flag justification, but I guess it could be. And then maybe there's 3 and 4 and 5. It's just that I can't find any of them relevant here, at least not yet.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We do the same thing, don't we, with nuts and bolts? We give the people nuts and we give them bolts.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and maybe it -- I mean, you know, there are loads of -- there are a lot of products like that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Should really? Because -- and you agree with that? For example, we have an agreement among toy manufacturers that we won't sell poisoned toys. That's always been an absolute mystery to put to the class, from Phil Areeda on, because they want to stop the poisoned toys, but you say, hey, that isn't the job of the antitrust law. That's the job of the consumer protection agency.  And so we have a debate.  And I didn't know that that issue had been solved in this Court.   INTERRUPTING ",16-1454
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's one question. Now I'm beginning to understand this.  I do sometimes learn something, as I just did from Mr. Stewart and the others in this oral argument.  And my problem is that I grew up in antitrust at a time when people didn't use phrases like platforms and two-sided markets. So I have to translate things into a language that I've been using for 40 years, but okay. So now, as I see your argument, and I -- I didn't -- I started out not seeing what it was -- tell me if I'm right, and don't just agree if I'm not -- I really analogize this to a -- a firm that makes things and sells through dealers. Now it used to be, correct, that you couldn't tell the dealer he had to fix his prices because that stopped intrabrand competition, and you couldn't tell the dealer he had to divide markets.  You couldn't divide them. And that's changed because sometimes those are justified.  And usually the argument they are justified is that by fixing the dealer's prices among themselves or giving him exclusive territories, we will encourage him to work harder to sell our brand.  And that sometimes is a justification. And it seems to me you are simply making a variation on that theme.  You are saying by engaging in this agreement among dealers, which is, after all, agreement that does not directly but indirectly has a tendency to fix -- to raise prices, therefore, in a sense, there's an anticompetitive aspect. But by doing that -- by doing that, we are better able to get a product through to the consumer that, in fact, they will prefer more. Now have I correctly stated at least in general terms the form of your argument?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Better for everyone.   Stephen G. Breyer  Just as a person says let me tell the dealer of the car that he has to fix prices with the others, resale price maintenance, because I'll get my new gizmo car through and that'll improve everybody's life. Okay? Now, if that's the form of the argument, then isn't the way I can be a little traditional, say step 1, is there an anticompetitive aspect? Then we go to step 2, what is the justification and does it out-balance, et cetera? Okay. So far we're at step 1, is there an anticompetitive aspect? Well, of course.  It seems to me obvious, of course, there is. When you tell the dealer that he can't tell the customer that he's charging a lower price, that's anticompetitive right then and there, and I don't see any other argument. I mean, what it could -- how could that be procompetitive? I mean, maybe there's a justification for it in terms of what you're going to do eventually, but how can that not be anticompetitive?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then what worries me about that, I have just the same -- look, you -- you both have put your finger, it seems to me, on one of the most, as you know, I think, unless it's changed, one of the most difficult problems in antitrust law: How to define a market. And, by and large, the answer to that differs depending on a lot of different circumstances and what you're up to.  And so, with an agreement that has an anticompetitive impact of some kind, it's easier and, you know, you get away from this, if you can identify an anticompetitive impact. Think of the new gizmo car which has 18 dealers.  We give each an exclusive area. And for analysis purposes, I don't think you have to worry about a market.  You say, look, that fact of exclusive areas stops these dealers from competing with each other.  End of the matter.  Right then and there you have an anticompetitive impact. And then we go on to question 2, is it nonetheless worthwhile? Now maybe you -- I've read the Second Circuit.  I know some of those judges know antitrust law pretty well and so forth and -- but I just don't see something that improves on that basic thing. Unless you want to come in and say, oh, this had no impact, you know, because he only had 2 percent of the relevant market, in which case why did he enter into it? You know, I mean, I can imagine variations.  But -- but do you see how I'm thinking?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   Stephen G. Breyer  It may have been anticompetitive in one way.  In one way.   Stephen G. Breyer  You cannot get through to the dealer -- to the customer, the fact that these different companies, some charge lower, some charge higher prices.  The product you're buying, some will be lower, some will be higher.  That is a fairly key element --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- which this prevents you from getting through in terms of information to the person who's going to be buying.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No?   Stephen G. Breyer  But the merchant is not.  And, indeed, were we to start down that road and say don't worry when you get a promise among merchants not to tell people what prices are, because, after all, the person who sells through you could always advertise, that, I think, would have a pretty strong anticompetitive impact across the country.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  On that point, you know, it looks to me like market power is a gremlin that you are going to throw, if we accept that, throw into the -- into the gears of antitrust law as it has been under Section 1 across the country everywhere. I mean, I thought -- and perhaps there have been changes, but I haven't seen them in this Court -- I thought that if, in fact, three people agree upon their prices, or forget price fixing, three people who are competitors agree that they will have a convention where they will hire Mr. Smith, who will lecture to them about the benefits of all charging the same price, I would have thought you just said that's anticompetitive.  That's anticompetitive.  There's no need to look at this gizmo called market power, which is a nightmare. Now, if the defendant wants to come along and says, I'll tell you something, Judge, because nobody had any market power, this couldn't do anything, then you would wonder why they did it.  But I would leave you that option, you know, if you're the defendant. So where is this thing you have to prove in every Section 1 case, market power? I have not seen it.  Is it in a case I haven't read, which is quite possible?   Stephen G. Breyer  What's the vertical case? Even Leegin didn't say that.  I mean, you know, I say even because I dissented, but nonetheless --   Stephen G. Breyer  None the -- nonetheless --   Stephen G. Breyer  Nonetheless, I've not seen a Section 1 case.  Now I'm not saying there couldn't be one, but I -- but I am saying I don't think it's a universal requirement. And I think if you have an anticompetitive agreement which looks anticompetitive, seems anticompetitive, et cetera, why go into market power?   Stephen G. Breyer  I only have 42 years of teaching antitrust. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  And I would say in that -- in that experience, which is not as good as yours, actually, because you actually have practical experience, but it seems to me there have been a lot of cases where you wouldn't -- you would not see price increases, the main one being Alcoa. I mean, Alcoa, which used to be thought to be the best case ever written in antitrust, Learned Hand.  It has no price increase.  It was --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There it was only market power.  I know.  You're going to say that, but that's a different point.   INTERRUPTING ",16-1454
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I wonder, since your time is limited, let me say three -- three quick questions. What you're doing basically is trying to apply a more modern framework to some older cases.  This has been the law for 50 years just about.  Okay? Holmes and Brandeis didn't know about these modern framework.  How many cases should we go back? Do you think we should apply modern frameworks to all old cases, begin with Marbury versus Madison? There are lots of very good lawyers in this room.  They will think of all kinds of older cases where we haven't applied modern frameworks. So, one, what's your limiting principle there? Two, what is your limiting principle on the matter that we're talking about? I mean, Stewart, Justice Stewart, who wrote Abood in the '70s, thought the case is identical or near identical to the Railway Labor Act cases.  Railway Labor Act, that's a railroad, they're regulated, government's involved, just as your clients are involved, you know, just as the unions here. What's the distinction, if you're going to try to make one? And -- and -- and -- and really, three, and this is for all of you, all the lawyers here, what do you think of the -- what I think of as a compromise put forth by Justices Kennedy, Scalia, Souter, and O'Connor in Lehnert, called to our attention specifically by the brief of Professor Fried and Professor Post? Does that solve most of your problem for any side? Those are the three.  You see? Stare decisis, even if it weren't there, how do you distinguish all the other unions, particularly those in regulated industries, and, three, what about the compromise?   Stephen G. Breyer  California says the opposite.  I mean, California has a whole brief there.  You've read that.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what's the answer to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Look, the --   Stephen G. Breyer  Labor peace, I once heard Archie Cox, maybe it was in your position right here, say the greatest instrument for labor peace and prosperity from the years 1945 to 1970 was grievance arbitration in the unions.   Stephen G. Breyer  So suddenly we're changing the method of financing that.  You say, well, it's just public unions. But if I were in a regulated industry and I read the Court's opinion siding with you, I would wonder if it didn't apply to me.   Stephen G. Breyer  And not all workers are lawyers.  And all they've seen is that this Court has suddenly cut legs, at least one, out of the financing of a system that at least in some aspects, though it's debatable, some people think it brought labor peace.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now you are the government of the United States.  What do you think about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's fair. Regardless, what is -- what is the answer to Justice Kagan's question?   ",16-1466
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So what about the compromise?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is -- is it possible to --   Stephen G. Breyer  Can you do that? Can you limit it to wages, hours, working conditions, where mandated as subjects of compulsory bargaining by the state, those three terms have a hundred years of history written around them.  It shouldn't be hard to administer and should keep the things like lobbying and so forth out of it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that correct? Is that what you favor?   Stephen G. Breyer  And can we get that from the Connick -- from the Connick -- from the Lehnert Kennedy, Scalia compromise there?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So -- so I don't see how you can say, if one person asks for more money, that affects the budget.  If one person in the railroads asks for more money, that affects the rates that a public body, the Interstate Commerce Commission, used to have to set.  If one person in a public utility, an electricity company, asks for money, that affects the electricity rate. So the line can't be, I would think, whether or not you're asking for higher wages, whether collectively or individually, because they all affect the budget. So then what is the line? I had thought the line was wages, hours, working conditions is okay, and if it's not okay, then that goes way beyond just public employees, doesn't it?   ",16-1466
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What about a grand jury proceeding?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, can it be prevented?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, I -- I've come across Supreme Court cases which refer to a grand jury proceeding as part of a criminal case, and you cannot introduce it in a criminal case. So what I wondered and seemed to be missing is that I haven't found anything that says, you know, you can't attack the grand jury proceeding later, but that's different.  So --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- so somebody finds a way, gets an order from a judge, he says I don't want these pieces of paper introduced, they were taken from me in violation of my Fifth Amendment right not to be a witness, and I don't want them brought before the grand jury. I'm rather surprised that that's never come up.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And -- then where are the cases that say that even though the person objected, you can introduce it to the grand jury? I can't find any.  And I have found cases that say a grand jury is a criminal proceeding.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I don't -- so back to my first question, I don't know what the answer is in a grand jury proceeding.  I do know you can't attack that proceeding at trial, but I don't know whether, as in this case, somebody might, if they were used, bring a 1983 claim on the ground that its constitutional rights have been violated.  That's what happened here. And I don't know what would happen if because of the circumstance the defendant went before a judge and said: Judge, keep that piece of paper out of the grand jury proceeding.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So I do think perhaps they should be treated alike, but I don't know what alike is.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't know.  Maybe you could.  I mean, there -- I -- I don't even know where to go to look that up.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I assume you've looked it up.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, all right.  I see that.   Stephen G. Breyer  So -- so we have an instance where there is a committee investigating Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith takes the Fifth Amendment 90 -- 94 times and then they compel him to give all kinds of statements and then there's a grand jury and he goes to the judge and says: Judge, keep those statements out.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And Mr. --   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I understand that.  He says they were taken in violation of my Fifth Amendment right.  And --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And there we are. Keep them out.  Keep them out of the grand jury.  Huh.  And you're telling me there is -- so this is an important case in more ways than one because what we decide here, I guess, would decide the same thing for the grand jury.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What -- what about other things? I mean, how does it work? I've -- I've not conducted grand juries, some of my colleagues have, but, I mean, I can imagine all kinds of unconstitutionally seized evidence. It could violate the Fourth Amendment.  It could violate the Fifth Amendment's coerced confession.  It could violate any one of 15 -- not 15, but, you know, five or six different constitutional prohibitions. And if the prosecutor says I'm going to go and introduce all this stuff before the grand jury, does then a defendant have no remedy whatsoever?   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  Well, that's what this Court has held in cases like Lawn and Calandra, that a defendant --   Stephen G. Breyer  Then does that happen all the time, that in grand juries they introduce coerced confessions, they introduce -- this comes as a surprise to me.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  Well, I think --   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, you have the experience.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  I -- I --   Stephen G. Breyer  They introduce illegally seized evidence, they introduce all this constitutionally impermissible evidence.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  Well, the issue, Justice Breyer, is I think that oftentimes it won't be apparent from the outset that the evidence was obtained in -- in violation of the Constitution.   Stephen G. Breyer  I just want to know what happens.  I guess this is not relevant to what happens, but I -- I -- I can be educated.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  I can tell you --   Stephen G. Breyer  And it seems like an important point.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  I can tell you that at pretrial probable cause hearings, both under the federal rule, this is Rule 5.1, and in the majority of state jurisdictions, defendants are prohibited by rule from challenging the admission of evidence on grounds that it was unlawfully acquired. Now that doesn't mean that they lack a remedy.  They can file a motion to suppress, they can get that issue resolved before they have to face the consequence of either taking a plea or going to trial. But I think what those rules recognize -- and there are other distinctions between the body of evidence that's available at the probable cause hearing as well.  Hearsay is routinely admitted. So I think what those rules recognize is that a probable cause hearing is fundamentally distinct from the issues that are going to be resolved at the guilt stage. It's a lesser consequence for the defendant.  He doesn't face the exposure to possibly having his conviction and punishment adjudicated. And for that reason, courts have recognized, and this Court in cases like Gerstein and Brinegar and Barber, have recognized that a defendant doesn't have the same right to have that determination made on the body of evidence that would be admissible at trial.

Breyer  For -- for reasons that are my own problem, I suddenly see now for the first time that if you win here, if you win, this is a major change because it's pretty hard to see how you can say you can attack the preliminary hearing and you cannot attack the grand jury, and you cannot attack the Estelle hearing or all these different hearings --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- that they've been talking about, so suddenly, whereas you previously haven't done it for whatever set of historical reasons, this will suddenly be subject to a lot of attacks. So that makes me pretty careful.   Stephen G. Breyer  And for that reason, I looked up whether you objected, because I do not see how the magistrate running the -- the preliminary hearing can know what to do unless somebody tells him that these statements were taken in violation of the Fifth Amendment. One, I don't see where you ever did tell the magistrate that. Two, looking at the transcript of the preliminary hearing, I couldn't find any instance where any of the compelled statements were introduced into the preliminary hearing. So what I would like you to do is to tell me what pages to look at in the preliminary transcript, which I have here, which will show that you did object or at least that some of the compelled statements were used.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It may not be in the record.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But if it's not in the --   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course, it's an important point.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Nor -- nor is actually mine a passing comment because Article III of the Constitution says we are to take real cases and controversies.   Stephen G. Breyer  And to decide a major matter where, in fact, going from what is in the record to an earlier stage of this and discovering if it's true, that there was no instance about which you are complaining, in my mind raises the question as to whether this is, in fact, an appropriate case or controversy for the Court to take.   Stephen G. Breyer  You don't have to answer it.  I -- I -- I --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is -- is it possible to ask, does -- is this a -- this is a 1983 case?   Stephen G. Breyer  Could we say, in your opinion, before a plaintiff in a 1983 case can bring a claim, that the preliminary hearing consider -- considered matters that were taken in violation of the Fifth Amendment, they must allege in their complaint that they objected before the hearing, for otherwise the magistrate would have no idea what he is supposed to do?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know they haven't. I'm asking.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then what is the answer to this? There are many, many ways in which a -- a statement by an individual could violate the -- incrimination.  In this case, he is asked questions by his superiors in the police department under threat of leaving --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- and they don't know that he considers that to be a violation of the Fifth Amendment.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then those statements go to court in a preliminary hearing, and the magistrate doesn't know that the person considers them to be a violation of the Fifth Amendment. What are the magistrates and the police department supposed to do? They're not necessarily conversant with all the facts of the case, if no one objects.   ",16-1495
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  The question, I think, which is perhaps truly speculative, but it is rather interesting, if we go back to the sick chicken, Schechter --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- there first is a question --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- of whether Congress has this Article 8 power to legislate at all in the area.   Stephen G. Breyer  You assume the answer's yes. The second is a nondelegation question. There, the delegation had run riot.  But suppose they'd used the words ""unfair competition"" instead of ""fair competition"" and, therefore, they had satisfied the Nondelegation Doctrine. Given the satisfaction of the -- of the source of power and satisfaction of the delegation doctrine or nondelegation, is there additional requirement? Does the preemption matter, assuming there were parts of that that preempted as there must have been, is that a separate doctrine that imposes yet a further restriction, or once the first two are satisfied, have you automatically satisfied the third?   INTERRUPTING ",16-149X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The point is, is your point.  Look, what we're talking about here is subrogation.  Has nothing to do with coverage.  It has nothing to do with benefits.  You're covered, you get the money, you get the CAT scan.  You're covered, you get the hospital payment, you get the pain and suffering or whatever, you -- you're covered. Now, there's a different thing that happens in the world.  There's a tort suit.  And our law affects the proceeds of that tort suit.  The proceeds of that tort suit are not benefits.  The proceeds of that tort suit are not coverage.  The proceeds of that tort suit are some money that our State and a judge decided should be paid to a victim of an accident.  Is that the point?   Stephen G. Breyer  There is no ambiguity.  The answer to the point, if I got the point right, is you say, you know, it's sort of like a lottery or something. There's some money floating out there.  And what the contract says, different from what the State law says, is that money that's floating out there, maybe you won it in a lottery or it came from Mars as far as this receiving benefits is concerned by the patient, but this contract says you take that money that came from Mars or wherever and you pay it to the insurance company. Why do you pay it to the insurance company?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because what is it that the insurance company did that entitles them to receive that money from Mars? What is it that they did?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I mean, just very simply, in three words, what did they do that entitled them to money from Mars?   Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly.  So there we are. Now, it relates to benefits because they get the money from this separate thing that happened because they paid benefits.  So now how do you say that this contract does not relate to benefits?   Stephen G. Breyer  But -- but --   ",16-149X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, does it -- that's the -- I think it's difficult.  Think of a simple example.  A small company thinks the bookkeeper is taking money off the top, hires Sam Spade, a private eye, and says I'd like you to look into this.  He does look into it.  He says it's the bookkeeper, all right.  And then they go to the police, and the police says, thank you, that's very helpful, Sam.  And they investigate further; arrest him.  That's the facts, all right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, previously, there was a statute called the discretionary restitution statute, and it allowed -- discretionary -- expenses related to participation in the investigation.  Well, I would have said that, quite likely, Sam's pre-investigation expense was related to the necessary -- the later. Now they've changed the wording of the statute to what you read.  Did Congress intend to change that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, no, but I'm asking you why would someone, taking a statute that previously allowed restitution to Sam for Sam's expense, want to stop that in a statutory change, by the way, that was meant to expand the scope of restitution?   Stephen G. Breyer  Is there anything -- since I'm interested in history, is there anything in the legislative history that suggests that this change of language was intended to diminish the scope of the restitution?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  State, federal.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can you say participation includes participation where the government investigation doesn't start until after you've finished, but they incorporate everything you've done? Sam Spade puts on his resume: I participated in their -- in their investigation, the government's.  What? They didn't start until November; you finished in October.  But I participated.  All my findings, all my witness reports were taken over by the government and used.  Perhaps you can.   ",16-1519
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's why I don't understand the statute, because you have a big problem, I think, with the language of the statute.  If, in fact, it's an investigation by the company before the police investigation begins, do they get child care? I mean, child care, transportation? I mean, what do you do about that? And -- and so I'm stuck. Now you're, of course, going to get me out of being stuck. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  You're also going to get all of the child care and transportation. Is that your opinion?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it seems odd that this investigation could go on for quite a while, and during that time, it's the company's investigation, it goes on for several months, child care -- child care for, I guess, anybody called up, and transportation.  That is all -- all covered?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Lunches?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's all true, but what I'm thinking is, I look back, now this is expenses related to participation.  That seems to me, intuitively as a judge, excellent because there are vast numbers of circumstances and the trial judge will figure out what's appropriate.  Now Congress is going to change that, and instead of it being discretionary, it becomes mandatory. Well, if you're going to make something mandatory, you say we better narrow it and be specific.  And then that would explain why this is limited to the government's investigation, particularly when you think of hundreds of billions of dollars in restitution that is owed by people who commit crimes that is not dischargeable in bankruptcy, which is never collected, and throughout the rest of their lives is simply there as uncollected debt, really causing a problem. So, if Congress was aware of all this and really thought let's narrow it, well, that would explain the differences.  But the problem for me is it doesn't say a word, does it? So do you have a view?   INTERRUPTING ",16-1519
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That would be an awful lot of -- that -- that's exactly what's worrying me.  Batson errors, you know, we can think of a host.  Sir Walter Raleigh is in the Star Chamber.  You know, I mean, you -- now, the government's position is what? The government's position is that even though there is a serious structural error, really serious, the all-white jury, the Star Chamber, et cetera, even then -- and the lawyer didn't object -- even then, the person doesn't automatically get a new trial. The truth of the matter is, we don't know what would have happened in the jury room.  We can't say.  And if what we're supposed to do is weigh the evidence, I guess then you're having trial by appellate judge.  And -- and so do -- do we get into that? Is that what you want, that in each case, no matter how egregious sort of the structural error, which may or may not affect the jury -- we don't know -- that there's no new trial? The appellate judges are supposed to say whether or not there really would have been or likely would have been an impact on this case? That strikes me as a little -- I mean, I would like to hear your answer, because it strikes me as -- as not -- not -- yeah.   Ann O'Connell Adams  Right.  So it's -- it's our position, Justice Breyer, that in the case of structural errors, you still have to show prejudice.  It doesn't matter what the structural error is.  The Strickland test says that we're looking under the second prong to see if this error had an effect on the outcome of the trial.  Maybe there's a reasonable probability that it did, in which case the standard is satisfied; and if there's not, then the standard is not satisfied.  We don't run the -- rerun the trial just because we don't know.   Stephen G. Breyer  What about using it -- if we're going to distinguish among substantial -- among structural errors, taking the standard out of Allano and saying those that seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, if the -- if the procedural -- if the structural error rises to meet that standard, then -- then you don't have to show prejudice.  But if it doesn't, then you'd better.  Now, that would harmonize the plain error and this proceeding which can come up in the -- in a collateral proceeding.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What do you think about that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, that's true.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you're asking us -- you say, no, none.  Just take structural error as your category, and -- and period, and that's it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, but they -- they want -- and they want to go to the other extreme, basically.  But if we're cutting this child in two, what about that as a standard?   INTERRUPTING ",16-240X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but what -- what's your line?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, do you -- suppose that the structural error were excluding African-Americans from the jury, or women from the jury. Okay? That's the error.  They select a different jury. All white men.  Now, we have no way of knowing whether that made a real difference in that case.  We don't know.  So it's a structural error. Now, are you saying in such a circumstance, where the lawyer failed to object, et cetera, therefore Strickland, therefore inadequate assistance of counsel, that that isn't the end of it? That there was an all white male jury? Isn't that the end of it, even though we don't know if there was prejudice in the sense that the jury would have decided differently? Is that your position?   Stephen G. Breyer  You can't.  All right? You can't.  You can't prove that the jury would have come out differently. So I'd say, at least in my mind, if your point is that even -- suppose they had a -- a trial by inquisition.  I mean, you know, I can imagine even the most fantastic examples where you don't know whether, really, the result would have been every -- different if you had the most perfect jury.  All right? Now, you're saying either there -- the -- somebody has to prove that it really made a difference? That's what a structural error is really about, that kind of case, where you can't prove it because it was a basically unfair proceeding.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I don't care what the Court said.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm asking my question. And my question, I thought, until I'm getting this answer, that, of course, in some instances, you say it was such an unfair trial, and you show inadequate assistance of counsel and that's the end of it.  You presume the prejudice.  And I was going to ask you how you draw the line.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not interested in Strickland at the moment.  I want to know how you think, in this case, we should draw the line between those structural errors, which are absolutely egregious, and it is plain that the defendant did not get a fair trial, although we cannot prove one way or the other that it would have made a difference to the outcome.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I would have thought that you would have said, of course, in such a case, inadequate assistance of counsel for not raising that error leads to a new trial.  We presume prejudice.  And if you're not going to say that, then I will withdraw all my questions and keep quiet. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING ",16-240X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that isn't the issue, is it? I mean -- at least to me.  And you can explain this.  You started out saying this is an arbitration case.  I don't know that it is.  I thought these contracts would forbid -- would forbid joint action, which could be just two people joining a case in judicial, as well as arbitration forums. Regardless, I'm worried about what you are saying is overturning labor law that goes back to, for FDR at least, the entire heart of the New Deal.  What we have here is a statute, two of them, Norris-LaGuardia, the NLRA, which for years have been interpreted the way Justice Kagan said. They say that they protect the joint -- joining together, those are the words, joining together, those are the words of our interpretation -- you could have two workers to seek to improve working conditions through resort to administrative and judicial forums. Okay? So Cardozo said we exclude cases from -- we exclude cases, that's the savings clause, where the contract is in contravention of a statute.  The statute protects the worker when two workers join together to go into a judicial or administrative forum for the purpose of improving working conditions, and the employers here all said, we will employ you only if you promise not to do that.  Okay? That's the argument against you.  I want to be sure that I didn't see, you know -- Concepcion, I've read it too, we all have, but I haven't seen a way that you can, in fact, win the case, which you certainly want to do, without undermining and changing radically what has gone back to the New Deal, that is, the interpretation of Norris-LaGuardia and the So I will stop.  I would like to listen, and I want to hear what your answer to that is.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, of course not. But are you now conceding that, in these contracts in front of us, that they do not forbid two workers or three or four from going together, approaching a judicial forum, asking the judge to hear their case, or an arbitration forum, and of course, if it violates some rule of civil procedure other than that, it will be thrown out. Are you conceding that that's the issue? And then I don't know which one it violated, but nonetheless --   Stephen G. Breyer  Why do we have to go into all this class action business? I mean, it seems to me that in each of these agreements, the worker is forced to agree that I will not proceed concertedly, that means jointly, just one other person joining my action with his and going into arbitration and saying do both together.  And maybe there is some rule that forbids people from doing that in arbitration -- AAA or something; I've never seen it.  And it also says you can't do the same thing in court.  You have to go to arbitration, and then the two of you can't get together. So simplifying it to its extreme case like that, why can't we just say that's clearly against what labor law, since the 1930s, has said was an unfair labor practice, the employee cannot -- the employer cannot impose such an agreement.  That would be simple, clear; it would void our class action -- I don't want to characterize it as a nightmare, but there is a problem there.  Okay? What's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I'm saying.  Of course, I haven't said -- I'm sorry, I wasn't clear perhaps, but nothing in what I just said was that ordinary rules of the courts like Rule 20 -- any other rule of the court, Rule 23, you have to be clear, whatever the rules are, they apply. And the only rule that wouldn't apply would be a rule that would say we're automatically going to enforce the agreement not to come here.  You couldn't do that when that would be a kind of trick.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But aside from that, everything else would apply?   Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe it won't. That's too bad.  But, I mean, doesn't that resolve this case?   Stephen G. Breyer  Does it resolve the case or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Wait a minute.  You said to Justice Kennedy -- I didn't -- I think I might have missed this. Smith, Jones, and Brown are three employees.  Each believes that he has not enough overtime or something like that, and he goes to the same attorney, all three, and it wasn't exactly the same time, it wasn't exactly -- there are differences. So what they want to do is file a joint claim.  They want to say: Our employer violated the dah-dah-dah because they did not pay us enough.  Okay? They're not identical, but they're very similar. Now, can they go together to the arbitrator under this agreement?   Stephen G. Breyer  No? Okay.  So the answer to Justice Kennedy was they cannot go to the lawyer and have this brought in one action, unless they just use one person?   Stephen G. Breyer  You think all the rules apply.  The rules of the forums apply.   Stephen G. Breyer  And both sides are in agreement on that.   Stephen G. Breyer  The question is whether you can resort to -- can they stop you from resorting to administrative and judicial forums?   Stephen G. Breyer  And in grievance arbitration, by the way, how -- I just wonder, because that's very common.  Are there instances where -- there will probably be a worker representative going to the employer, but are there instances where the grievance is a grievance that is shared by people, but not perfectly shared, so Jones, Smith, and Brown will go to the representative and say, representative, please let's go before the arbitrator, and you represent all three?   ",16-285X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Is there anything wrong, from your point of view, which taking this case in a very unsatisfactory way to everybody, except perhaps it's simple, is you just simply read the words what the employer cannot stop is joint effort, like making a joint claim, nothing to do with class actions, just making a joint claim, resorting to administrative and judicial forums for the purpose of making that joint claim? Now, the contracts seem to be an employer effort to stop an employee from doing that because they don't allow him to do that either in administrative or judicial forums. Now, suppose end of opinion, okay? Now, from your point of view, does that solve the case? Or does it just create a lot of problems? Is it totally out to lunch or what?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why do you not -- I mean, look, I quoted a statute, didn't I?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And the statute was passed after the Arbitration Act, wasn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  And Justice Cardozo said when in a comparable context, we exclude cases where the contract is in contravention of a statute.  And that's why Justice Kagan provided the example of the discrimination case.   Stephen G. Breyer  So I'm not quite ready to say it's more complicated.   ",16-285X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what is the --   Stephen G. Breyer  So it says here that there is a definition of effluent limitation.   Stephen G. Breyer  The definition of effluent limitation is ""a restriction established by the Administrator on quantities, rates, and concentrations."" Well, once you have that in mind, it's hard to agree with you, because it looks as if, given the fact that we have (A), (C), (D), and then (E), which refer to those four sections, it would seem to do two things: (F) says if they issue -- you know, you don't -- you want them to issue a permit and they won't, to you, go ahead, you can go to the court of appeals.  A little unusual since it's fact-based, but nonetheless. And then the other four that I just mentioned seem to say if there are standards, which are like rules, and they're related to the specific definition I told you about or the equivalent because ""standards of performance,"" after all, is a different set of words than ""effluent limitations."" But the ""other limitations"" means something like that. And if that isn't the correct interpretation, then what in heaven's name are (A), (C), (D), and (F) -- or what are (A), (C), and (D) doing there? Because you don't need them? Indeed, your view, which makes sense, because maybe all rules should be reviewed in a court of appeals, but that isn't what it says. And -- and I am rather stuck with that.  And you say, well, why did Congress do it? The reason they did it is because they were worried about getting review of effluent limitations, or the equivalent, as defined up there in a court of appeals fast.  And as to the rest of it, the rest of what the EPA does, they didn't care or at least they didn't care here.  Or at least the hearings weren't about that.  Or at least the members of Congress weren't thinking about that.  That's why they're left out. All right.  Now, that's -- that's how I read it.  And -- and what is it that you want to say that will disabuse me of that reading?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, I know that. ""Other"" means the same --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- roughly speaking, as effluent limitations but in respect to those things that aren't strictly labeled effluent limitations.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And so you have --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And if it is that, if it is that, if the -- Learned Hand once said you have to read these things like music.  And -- and the word ""other limitations"" certainly doesn't sound like a big catch-all; it sounds like a little catch-all. So, if that's true, your reading, though, why did they bother writing this other stuff? Because after all, they would be up there in the court of appeals anyway under what you see as a big catch-all.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why? Why? Because if you say, if it's like effluent limitation, how -- you say we need an end because this is close enough -- but it's defined as -- as I said, quantities, rates, and concentrations of constituents which are discharged. Now, how is a geographical regulation, a geographical limitation or expansion, how is that related to, why, that doesn't sound like a restriction on quantities, rates, and concentrations of discharges.

The lawyer would have had to tell him, your chance of winning this trial is zero, near zero, close to zero, and you'll have served an extra -- at least an extra 9 to 11 months because you'll be in jail for 9 to 11 months more, and the same thing will happen to you anyway.  Who would want that? It might be more than 9 to 11 months, because the chances of departure are smaller. Okay.  So now I can repeat, and you started in answering the Chief Justice: What's different about this case? And I'd say there are factual differences and there are legal differences.  Start with the legal differences --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- and then tell us the factual differences, why they matter.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I thought she said only if the only hope for him is jury nullification.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what we -- what you want us to do is to add to what she said.  And what you have to mean by that is it would have been no hope for you at trial.  That's the reason.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No hope for you.  Well, what do you want us to do?   Stephen G. Breyer  What is the --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Let's consider them all.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And suppose one of them is there's no hope of success at trial except jury nullification.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All Right.  That was a good point.  So imagine that your lawyers below in this very case went to the government and said, look, everybody was under a mistake here.  Why don't you go to the district court with me.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We jointly will tell them, the judge, that not -- what would have happened if he'd gotten good advice, is the government would have figured something out to help him.  The government would have charged him with a -- a lesser crime.  And my guess is you did that, and my guess is the government wouldn't do it.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So -- so is this the mistake you say that Judge Batchelder made is she said: I will assume, at least, that your client would have said I want to go to trial. Question: Would that have been a rational decision? Some circuits say if there is overwhelming evidence of guilt, it's never a rational decision.  And that's what we say.  And you want us to say that's where she was wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  And so send it back with the knowledge that sometimes it could be rational for a person to want to go to trial, even not hoping necessarily for jury nullification.  But sometimes it could be, and my client's the guy.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And so judges go back to the district court, do it over again, knowing that overwhelming evidence is not always the end of the case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We can't do that.  I mean, I don't see --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, the others, for myself, I don't see how we don't send it back.  I'm not a trial judge.  I don't really know how trial defendants react, and -- and a trial judge does know that much better than I.   ",16-327X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that might --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about murder? Suppose he thinks he's going to be murdered if he's sent abroad. Same problem.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But, I mean, I -- the problem is that he -- which you can read Judge Batchelder's opinion.  I mean, it could be read, as he says, that -- that if the evidence is overwhelming, that's the end of the matter, and it wouldn't have been rational to -- to ask for a trial.  And now all we've done is think of situations where it might be.  I mean, he thinks he's going to be sent back to some country in the world and it's going to end up he's dead, as is his family.  He'd rather be in jail. Now, we're not supposed to take that into account? Why not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So step back a second.  And I agree with you.  I can't find total clarity in -- in these decisions.  And it seemed to me that if we're making the separation, as they made, between what you look to, to show prejudice in a plea agreement and at a trial, both Strickland errors, it must be that the constitutional consideration of not really wanting a person to feel he has to give up his right to a jury trial, that influences the standard.  And if it doesn't influence the standard, I have a harder time deciding the cases. So, really, I think what we're deciding here is to what extent it influences the standard.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and -- and you -- you see how I'm thinking that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because there's a kind of just look to the plea, just look to the plea.  Don't give a damn about what happens at trial.  Well, we can't get that extreme.  So we say, well, we'll look just at the plea.  But if it's just overwhelming, then we're going to say we're looking to the trial, too.  Okay. If I'm right as to what these cases mean, then we are in a world where 95 percent of the people and what happens to them depend upon pleas, not upon trials.  And doesn't that argue for ""look to that plea"" part of the thing? Don't worry so much about whether he'd been convicted at trial.  In other words, we're talking about very small degrees here.  But that factor seems to me to -- to push in the direction of, if you really think he would have gone to trial, that should be the end of it, even if he's pretty irrational.   ",16-327X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So isn't it that -- that your answer is there's nothing wrong with that statute?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that, in fact, what the statutes does, whether it covers arbitration or not, if a court holds that it does cover arbitration, you have to look to see whether the other things in there are like arbitration sufficiently or there are other things that aren't covered that are like arbitration sufficiently, so that you could, at the end, draw a conclusion that this is or is not discriminatory.   Stephen G. Breyer  If -- so the -- as I -- as I understand the question better, one, of course the legislature could enact such a statute. Two, if we have our first case arbitration and they say arbitration is included among it, then what we're job is is to read the opinion. Now, sometimes courts don't write enough in the opinion for us to make the decision as to whether or not it is being discriminated against, in which case we send it back and ask them to write more.  So is that what we should do?   ",16-32XX
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  In other words --   Stephen G. Breyer  So in Kentucky, I issue a power of attorney to Jones and say, you have full power to protect, defend and maximize the value of all my property.  Okay.  That's what it says.   Stephen G. Breyer  And someone claims that this piece of land over here that we thought belonged to Smith belongs to him under various deeds.  All right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, the -- the attorney says, in my opinion, I want this tried before a judge because I think I'll get a fairer shake.  Okay. Illegal; right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you just said anything that waives the right to a jury is illegal unless it's explicitly there.  So, that's case one. Case two, similar kind of argument, and the lawyers for the two parties get together and say, we'd like to settle this case.  Illegal; right? No power, they can't do it in Kentucky.  Can't settle cases. Can't have traces -- cases tried before a judge.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, that's not right.  Oh, I see.  In other words, you -- you -- you -- why -- why isn't it right? Because after all, the fundamental right of trial by jury is being -- you're giving the attorney the power to refuse to have a jury.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what's the difference between that and the case we have, where we're not going to have a mediator, we're not going to have settlement, we're not going to have a judge trial, we're going to have an arbitrator.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All he did was say that in the attorney's judgment, if he wants to go to arbitration and thinks that's best, he can do it.  Now, I just don't see the difference between that and implying, in the attorney's judgment, if he wants to settle a case, rather than going to a jury, he can do it.  Or, if in the attorney's judgment, he would like a case tried before a judge instead of a jury, he can do it.  And you're going to tell me that that's ridiculous to think that a general power of attorney would give the attorney the right to say, no jury, judge trial.  No jury, mediator.  Oh, but it makes perfect sense to say no jury, arbitrary -- arbitrator. Now, if you're not going to tell me that those are treated exactly alike, I will tell you in my opinion right now you have discriminated against arbitration --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Unless you can find some difference.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, that isn't this.  You say that a attorney -- I'll be repeating myself.  I'm testing out whether it's really true.  Of course I'm highly suspicious as you can tell from my tone of voice. What I really think has happened is that Kentucky just doesn't like the Federal law.  That's what I suspect. So they're not going to follow it.  Now, that, of course, you're going to say, no, they would never do that.  So I'm trying to test this out.  And that's why I asked my question.  Because it seems to me that arbitration as a means of settlement of a case, of a dispute, mediation as a means of settling a dispute, a judge as a means of settling a dispute, are equally and no different in the respect that none of those three involves a trial by jury. So I just want to know -- and you have already said, no, no, they're all different.  Well, that to me proves that they're treating arbitration specially.  So I put my whole argument there because I want you to have an opportunity to reply.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We give the power of attorney to manage my patent, general.  A lot of litigation.  The other side comes in and says, okay, we'll settle.  I'd like you to sign this paper, and this says what you will say and what you won't say about my patent.  Absolutely normal.  What you will say about your patent, what you won't say about it in certain areas.  Can't do that in Kentucky, huh? Free speech. Free speech.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can't -- can't give a power -- general power of attorney that will allow a person to settle a patent case on perfectly ordinary terms.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any case that suggests that -- except this case, which happens to deal with arbitration.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You see, I don't know how to -- the part I don't know how to deal with your argument is, is you say every time I think of examples that would be very weird, which is what I'm trying to do, then -- then you say, oh, well, yeah, that's right. You can't do that anymore in Kentucky.  And every time you say that, the law of Kentucky in terms of attorneys, powers of attorney is getting more and more peculiar. That's why I suspect something is going to happen there. So what should I -- what do you think?   Stephen G. Breyer  Now -- now we say that you cannot enter into a power of attorney giving the power of attorney the power to enter into normal patent settlements.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what about business settlements? What about business settlements where, you know, there is a perfectly normal thing where a person agrees not to compete, and in agreeing not to compete, you're agreeing not to go to certain places?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  For that business anyway, a lot of constitutional rights that might infringe.  It might if you didn't waive it.  I don't know.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What do you say about the competing product?   Stephen G. Breyer  Right, right.  And, by the way, he makes a product, you know, the person who's given the power of attorney.  And as part of the disagreement, the attorney -- a disagreement with OSHA. He agrees that OSHA can come in and inspect his plant at various hours of the day or night.  That kind of power of attorney would be illegal also in Kentucky.  I mean, is there any State that makes that kind of power of attorney illegal or requires it to be explicit somehow that you could settle an ordinary OSHA case, you could settle an ordinary competition case, you could settle an ordinary, you know, patent case on fairly ordinary terms, and it says when you give a power of attorney to do that, you have to be explicit? Is there any State other than Kentucky in this opinion that has ever held such a thing? Maybe there is.   ",16-32XX
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I don't quite see -- two things; one, you can comment on it or not, but these amici briefs, and -- they're filled with this thing about a Texas district which they think has too many cases.  What's this got to do with this? As far as I can see, if we're supposed to decide what's good or bad, maybe you'd lose.  But I -- I don't know whether that's good, bad, or indifferent.  Okay? But is there some relevance to it? And the second thing that I'd like to know is you are not a corporation.  So since you are not a corporation, why do we have this case here deciding? And what are we supposed to do about that? We don't normally decide cases because Mr. Smith would like us to decide a case involving a corporation.  He's not a corporation, nor are you.  So what do we do?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You can go into that if you want.  As far as that -- might be other people are interested in that.  But I really feel I need an answer to my second question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That is, you're asking us to decide where venue is proper for a corporation, and you are not a corporation.  Therefore, on what basis are we supposed to decide that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there a holding that it includes you?   Stephen G. Breyer  Including a person.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I do, actually.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, as long as you have a minute, maybe you could indulge me and trace me through this.  With a corporation, I think 1400 says resides, where the defendant resides.   Stephen G. Breyer  But then that incorporated Section 48.  And Section 48 said where the defendant is an inhabitant.   Stephen G. Breyer  And now ""inhabitant,"" how do we know that means where the incorporation is incorporated or something? What does that mean in the case of -- how do we know that that -- that that word ""inhabitant"" means what you think it means? What do you think it means?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And Fourco is going really into whether 1391(c) or -- whether they made an exception, whether they included that, and it says no. It's a very short opinion.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  It says in respect of corporations, it means the state of incorporation only.   Stephen G. Breyer  But you are not an incorporation, so I'm back to my first question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And so I should look at what case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Okay.   ",16-341X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why another case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, look -- look. You -- if you -- if you're right, you win.  That's the end of the case.  If you're wrong, then you have another point, and that is that Fourco doesn't apply really to unincorporated associations.  So why isn't the right thing to do for us to decide the issue, if you win, that's the end of it; and if you lose, you send it back and we say to the lower court, if you haven't forfeited the point, maybe you could raise it and argue it. Is that the correct way to handle this?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's fine.  That's the correct way to handle it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Obviously, you think you win.  And -- and.   Stephen G. Breyer  -- and -- (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  Look.  I -- I'm -- I'm not worried about it if you win.  What I'm worried about what to do is if you lose.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In -- special or there are lots of different ones.  But did it say, if you pass this, don't worry about getting rid of 1400, because this gets rid of it? I mean, did they say anything like that at all?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I mean, getting rid of Fourco.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Did it say anything --   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean -- when I used to -- maybe this was years ago.  This said, don't worry about repealing 1400.  If you pass this, you will be rid of the Supreme Court's interpretation in Fourco.  Or anything like that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You asked me this question -- answer this.  I -- I'm not an expert in this area, comparatively speaking, so you need -- I need enlightenment here. Think of A-1.  This section shall govern the venue of all civil actions brought in district courts. Okay.  So what's an example of one that it doesn't govern, where the law provides otherwise?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So in other words --   Stephen G. Breyer  B doesn't apply because of the words in A, except as otherwise provided by law.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So why, if it governs B, does it not govern C? The words except as otherwise provided by law you've just said, and I think you are absolutely right as far as I understand it. That those words govern B. They govern A and they govern B, then why don't they govern C?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That might be--   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So -- so -- I know, but B is in a separate section.   Stephen G. Breyer  And now C is the next section, so why doesn't it govern that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I laugh slightly because if -- if that is so clear what is this case doing here, and -- and it -- that's why -- that's why I can't cut one way or the other with that -- that particular argument.  I mean, you would think the patent holders are a tremendously powerful group of people, businesses all over the country, and if they had been -- why weren't they in Congress? See, that -- that's a Congressional problem.  Why weren't they there saying we have a problem here, why don't you clarify it? You -- I don't think you can answer that question --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- until I get -- you can? (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING ",16-341X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  It's bankruptcy and that's what worries me.  Of course there will be a set of claims where the person is behaving pretty badly.  But there's a remedy right in the Code.  It's called a sanction.  Moreover, if they really go around doing this, I don't know why the FTC wouldn't bring a claim saying this is an unfair business practice.  So if in fact you say they also have a remedy under this other act, it's quite possible, given the remedies that they have under the other act, that lawyers won't move for sanctions.  They won't bother with it.   Sarah E. Harrington  Exactly.   Stephen G. Breyer  They will go right into court and then we'll have two sets of courts and other people trying to decide the same question.  The same problem that was bothering me 15 minutes ago and I'd like to -- I'd like to know what you think of that.   Sarah E. Harrington  I'd love to tell you.  The exact same thing is true in the general civil litigation context, that there is the possibility of Rule 11 sanctions just like there's a possibility of Rule 9011 sanctions.  In the very statutory findings in the FDCPA, Congress said in our view, existing legal remedies are not sufficient to deter this kind of conduct from debt collectors.   Stephen G. Breyer  If that's so, then why not -- what about this.  It's a little complicated as a solution and so I'm pretty nervous.  I don't know that I'd really do this.  But you'd say okay.  The word in the debt collection act is unfair and where it's in bankruptcy, there's a whole system to decide if it's unfair by people who know about it.  So where a bankruptcy court does in fact say that it's unfair and sanctions a party for this unfair behavior.  In that case, it's unfair within the meaning of the debt collection act and in that case, you can go and bring your extra remedy.   Sarah E. Harrington  So there are two reasons, I think, why that would not work.  The first is, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, there's a safe haven in Rule 9011, just like there is in Rule 11 since 1993 that allows a creditor to withdraw in offending a proof of claim when it's objected to.  Now, I just want to point out, if a -- if a creditor really has a basis for -- a good-faith basis for believing that its claim is enforceable, it will presumably assert that in response to an objection.  That's not what happened here. But the second is that there is even more reason to be cautious about this in bankruptcy than there is in general civil litigation.  Because by operation of Rule 3001 of the bankruptcy rules and Section 502 of the Code, a proof of claim, when it's failed, makes the underlying claim presumptively valid.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why can't they consent? Suppose it's Chapter 11? Suppose they're trying to get a plan? Suppose the plan is a company that does business in countries -- I know you don't believe there are such countries, but there are, there are countries where it's a matter of honor to pay a debt.  And people actually do pay debts. (Laughter.)   Sarah E. Harrington  I believe that.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So you could -- it's easy to think of cases.   Sarah E. Harrington  Justice Breyer, I --   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Sarah E. Harrington  -- I -- I think the one thing everyone agrees on in this case is that if the bankruptcy system works as Congress intended, 100 percent of time-barred claims will be disallowed. That is what Congress intended, but --   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, in Chapter 11 I'm not sure they did --   Sarah E. Harrington  Because it --   Stephen G. Breyer  But regardless of that dispute.   Sarah E. Harrington  Okay.  This --   Stephen G. Breyer  Is -- is -- is the automatic stay applied to these actions or not?   Sarah E. Harrington  Yes.  In our view these are claims within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code.   Stephen G. Breyer  So -- so they can't proceed in the -- the -- under the ^ cap? debt act until the bankruptcy is over.   Sarah E. Harrington  That's true, yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Sarah E. Harrington  And -- and also, you know, in terms of the discharge, the FDCPA gives the debtor the right to ask not to be contacted any more by a debt collector, which is basically the functional equivalent of a discharge, and the anti-discrimination provisions apply to any dischargeable debt, not just debt that has been discharged, and so that would apply to these -- to these types of debts. And so I just think it -- there is nothing in the code that gives a creditor the right to try to sneak one through when the creditor knows that if it's objected to, it should be disallowed --   ",16-348X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then what that means is that not just in this case, not just with statute of limitations, that -- that there are a whole set of claims that can be brought in bankruptcy where you would say they don't.  They don't have a reasonable good faith belief.  And, of course, what they say is we do.  We do have a good faith belief.  Okay? And now who's going to decide that? A bankruptcy judge? No.  An ordinary judge in a case brought in an ordinary court where, in fact, if one side wins, they get a thousand dollars per instance plus attorney's fees, plus costs.  Now, I thought the point of the Bankruptcy Code was to have bankruptcy matters decided in a bankruptcy court and not in an ordinary Article III court.  So how do you reconcile what you are arguing with the basic point of bankruptcy?   Stephen G. Breyer  Really? Really.  How interesting.  Then what do they argue about? In -- in -- I mean, are there cases in bankruptcy court where one side says, I have a legitimate dispute and the other side says, no, you don't? Is that unheard of in bankruptcy court?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that outside its purpose?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Oh.  Only when the creditor comes in and says, I admit I had no good-faith reason for bringing this.  That's the only thing your theory covers?   Stephen G. Breyer  It may not be.  I mean it depends on the circumstance.  But that isn't what's bothering me and I -- and I put it in a sort of -- you have a very good argument.  I'm not saying you don't. I'm telling you what's worrying me. What's worrying me is that we take a set of cases, which now you've -- you've narrowed it to that set which is sanctionable under Rule 9011, which is a bankruptcy rule with sanctions.  And you're saying in addition to the sanctions, the person who -- the debtor can go and bring a different case now under the word ""unfair"" in the debt collection act. And I'm saying what's worrying me, and I'd like to hear what you say specifically, is that here we have two sets of courts; one with the power to sanction; the other the ordinary Article III court, which presumably will automatically give $1,000 per violation, you know, plus attorneys' fees, plus costs.  And that seems what the bankruptcy court was trying to avoid.  We want bankruptcy matters decided in bankruptcy court. Now, I don't think I have a convincing argument against you.  I have a point.  And I'd like to hear what you have to say in response.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is -- is it just the statute of limitations you're talking about, or is it all affirmative defenses?   Stephen G. Breyer  Sorry.  And is it just the statute of limitations you're talking about, or is it all affirmative defenses?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Any affirmative defense.  Some of these, you know, are quite complicated.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And, therefore, we're now going to have the Article III judge -- maybe not in some cases, but in many cases -- deciding pretty complicated things as matters of bankruptcy law growing out of a bankruptcy case. Now, if that's wrong, why is it wrong?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  You missed my whole point.  You said it applies to all affirmative defenses.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is the only affirmative defense statute of limitations?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Then think of the most complicated one you can think of and let's talk about that one.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what you're saying is a set of cases that would warrant a sanction under Rule 9011, if I said to the bankruptcy judge, who happens to know something about it because he's heard the case, if I were to ask him -- but who's going to bother to ask him? Because I get my attorneys' fees and a thousand dollars and et cetera.  If I go into this other court before a judge who doesn't know about it and just issue -- have a litigate on an easy issue, an easy issue, the state of mind of the individual creditor, ah, yes.  It's just state of mind.  I grant you the easy thing about state of mind is it's only three words, and the difficult thing is, of course, proving what it was. Now -- now do you see what is worrying me?   Stephen G. Breyer  In this case, is it -- is there something in the record? I mean, it's rather surprising to me that there is a company and their business model, you say, is to go around buying up debts that can't be enforced and are worthless, and then filing cases hoping that no one will notice.  Is that shown in the record? I mean, is somebody -- they admit that's their business model? Where does this come from?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The FTC says that's what they did.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why didn't the FTC then bring an action against them if that's what they're doing?   Stephen G. Breyer  We then have the FTC that could do such a thing.  We have the sanctions in the Bankruptcy Code, and now you want this, too?   ",16-348X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Where -- where do they say that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  The (iv) is Mr. Smith owes some money to a Company Jones, and Company Jones assigns the debt to a servicing company, all right? And so the servicing company might have -- be -- it might be said, you can use it this way.  They obtained the debt from Company Jones. And so somebody might say that this assignee is collecting a debt from Smith, that Smith owes another, namely Jones.  But we don't want to cover them in this statute.  We don't want to cover that kind of debt collector.  So they write (iv). And the same is true of (iii)  They write (iii) because they don't want mortgage -- mortgage servicers to be falling within the statute, unless, of course, the mortgage servicer is serving a dead mortgage.  Then why shouldn't they? All right? Now, that reasoning doesn't seem, to me, illogical. On the other hand, if we take your reasoning, you have to interpret this is, so I was thinking of examples.  And I thought, well, what about one of these companies that goes and buys up other companies, turns them around, and sells them.  When they buy a company, they buy the -- the receivables.  And while they own the company, they're going to collect the receivables.  And so there they are.  You see? On your definition, those receivables were once owed the company that they're bought.  So on your definition, that whole category of people falls within the definition. So it seems to me, although you point to problems, they are not insuperable problems with the word ""obtained."" Or if I accept your definition of ""is,"" I get into a lot of difficulties.  Now, that -- that was where -- I'm not saying that's my final view of this.  I'm just saying, how do you respond?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's true about -- I take your -- I understand your point on assignees, I think. Now, look at (iv)  Where is the word ""assignment""? It's not there.  And what they are talking about is a person who takes a secured interest in the debt, I suppose, or he lends some money to the creditor, and in return, he takes some kind of secured interest; doesn't really say what kind.  And as part of that, the initial creditor might assign him the original debt.  It might not.  And what you've said is, oh, they almost always do.  Do they? I don't know that.  How do we know that? I mean, I remember, vaguely, commercial transactions.  And -- and I remember that there are all kinds of secured interest.  You could take a secured interest in a car, you could take a secured interest in their house, you could take a secured interest in all kinds of things. So where did you get this idea that, in fact, a creditor with a secured interest who has taken -- you didn't say assignment?   Stephen G. Breyer  But now, so where did this come from that we're only talking about assignees? And it's important.  For if we're not always talking about assignees, but only some of the time, you can't raise your objection except to a subset of the section (iv) people.  And as -- if you were talking about a subset, assuming you're right, no one writes statutes perfectly. You'll always under-include or over-include.   ",16-349X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I think -- I might not have this right, but I think that they're replying to that is what happens in the situation that you mentioned is that the initial creditor who sold the car or whatever, and they're going to give as collateral that.  They get -- the -- the person who takes the collateral, say Santander, takes an assignment of the debt. And they're saying taking an assignment of the debt, once that happens, it isn't true that the car buyer owes anything to the car dealer.  But if I've got it right -- good bet, maybe, maybe not -- but if it's -- if it's true -- that's true, then he is not collecting the debt for another.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Am I right about what you think his reply is?   ",16-349X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why -- why do you break -- why is everyone breaking it down in this way? That's what I'm having trouble with.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why -- why -- why not just say, look, there was a seizure.  It killed him or wounded him.  It's a seizure.  In fact, the question is, was that seizure -- i.e., shooting him -- was that seizure unreasonable and clearly unreasonable? And the answer to yes is, yeah, look at all the circumstances. There's one, they went into the house without even telling the woman.  Then they break into -- they go into the other house without a warrant, without telling anybody.  I'm -- I'm not saying that those are independently violations of the Constitution, though they might be.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If you look at the whole situation and say, you know what this is like? It's like the classic tort case.  Somebody pushes somebody else into the street where he is run down by a negligent driver.  Is the individual -- there's a supervening cause, negligent driver.  Of course they're liable, because that's what happens.  You expect negligent drivers, and similarly, you expect people to defend themselves. That's a -- why -- why -- what's wrong with that?   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, if you break it down temporally, second by second.  But if you look at the whole situation?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Save your rebuttal.   ",16-369X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So how? How is that? That is, what I think the argument on the other side is in response, I was looking saying look holistically.  The seizure is the shooting and his -- and his injury, okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  The question is, would any reasonable person think that that was unreasonable? Now, we break it down.  Not unreasonable to the shoot in the situation.  That wasn't unreasonable. Seems, too, they -- they say not unconstitutional or unreasonably wrong not to knock and announce, because that's what the Ninth Circuit found, and the part that was wrong, not getting a warrant, made no difference. So they're saying zero plus zero plus zero, it must equal zero.  Okay? That, I think, is the argument I'm trying to -- to put that I -- that I want to hear the answer to.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But -- but here, wait, wait.  Ordinary tort law, let's pick up on this for a second.   Stephen G. Breyer  And don't answer it if it's a red herring.  But, look, everybody is talking about causation.  Maybe this isn't about causation.  Perhaps it's about whether a reasonable person -- namely, a reasonable policeman -- namely, any reasonable policeman -- would know in the circumstances that what he was doing was unconstitutional.  What was he doing? Shooting someone. Why would he know it was unconstitutional? Well, here in ordinary tort law, Case 1, the trespasser reasonably believes, but wrongly believes, that he is an invited guest. Case 2: He knows he's a trespasser.  Okay? Does that make a difference to the result?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   Stephen G. Breyer  What -- just thinking, you know, we want policemen to protect themselves.  They have to.  Of course they do.  But there can be circumstances where, of course, that's true that they have a right to protect themselves, but the background circumstances are such that there's no justification for the whole ball of wax.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's, I think, what your argument is in respect to the warrant, if not the knock and announce, you can't deal with that anymore.  So it's the whole ball of wax which has less justification, and it is clear that the action from A to Z is what caused the death.  Now, would -- you haven't really strongly argued that, so I'm a little hesitant to bring it up.   INTERRUPTING ",16-369X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That's clearly an argument in your favor, practically, but I think the other side has said that that second sentence is what's called a statute of repose, whatever historically was the case. In CTS, we made a big distinction, and said in such statutes, you cannot toll them, et cetera. And here we're not talking about the action -- you may be right that -- that -- that when you file a class action, if it's certified, that is the action brought within the time, but here there's a second action. Your client leaves the first action.  And what does he do after three years? I guess he puts a piece of paper called a complaint in a court and that would seem to be bringing an action.  And if the other side says -- I'm just reminding you of these arguments, because you seem to think that they haven't made arguments, they have made arguments -- well, you think they haven't made good arguments. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Now, look, they say this is not -- this is a strict liability statute. Underwriters, after all, have committed no sin.  They haven't the bright mental state.  They've done nothing wrong. And in -- in that separate later action, there might not just be a repetition, one, two, three, of what's in the class action, but three new things, four more sentences, maybe 20. So years later, they could -- now, what do you -- please, I -- at some point --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- I would like you to deal with those actions --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Stephen G. Breyer  Precisely.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you need tolling.  You don't need it, perhaps, on your second theory.   Stephen G. Breyer  If we take your second theory, we have to read the words ""be brought"" to mean something like deemed to have been brought when, but -- something like that -- but that won't solve the practical problem you raised, because there will still be cases in which class certification is denied after three years, and all these practical problems will then exist, won't they?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And we need tolling in order to stop that.   Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why? Why?   ",16-373X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What will happen, what you -- what you have to do to get to his -- I agree -- to get to his result, I agree with you this far.  You have to read those words, ""any action be brought."" And what they mean is the action was brought.  It was brought when they filed the class action.  Whether it denied class certification or not, that's when it was brought.  And this is the same action.  It is not a different action.  It is the same action.  It is the same action because, one, the same words, because, you know, we go through a list, and moreover brought within a reasonable time. Why interpret those words in the way I just said? The reason why is because it is the same action. The other reason why is because you will, even if not so far, discover that people do want to protect themselves and will do so.  Whether they are big or small, they will.  And, therefore, let's imagine a class action involving 300,000 potential plaintiffs in the class, and imagine you're the district judge, and imagine 300,000 pieces of paper coming across your desk.

You can treat it as discrimination, but then you can't bring the civil service part. So now we want to bring both.  And we go to the MSPB.  And then we -- okay.  Now, again, we -- we take an appeal and we go -- we have to go to the Federal Circuit --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- and in -- in the MSPB. We then can -- if they kept it for 120 days more, we go right to the district court.  Remember that.  Then, by the way, if they decide against us, we go right to the district court.  Remember that. Now, in the two cases I said to remember, when the district court has them, does the district court decide both the discrimination issue and does it review the civil service issue?   Stephen G. Breyer  Otherwise, you're going to bounce, bounce, bounce.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, no.  I -- no, you're not following me.  I think I'm agreeing with you.  I'm saying your answer has to be right, because, otherwise, you again get the civil service part -- I mean, the discrimination part done.  Then it would be back over at the Board again and it would never end.  And this poor employee, who is already hungry and thirsty and been going on for quite a while, would just have another loop-around to go.  Am I right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, really? Now suppose they decide it in the MPSB --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- and then he goes to district court.   Stephen G. Breyer  Does he get review of the civil service claim in district court?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And so sometimes he does and sometimes he doesn't.  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  I see where you're going there.  And my question --   Stephen G. Breyer  So just as a matter of pure simplicity, if we could get there, why, if they're going to decide in the district court, I guess, under an ordinary AD-law set of standards, they're going to decide in the district court the civil service claim as well, and you will have nonuniformity in a whole bunch of cases where the MPSB decided no, why not bring this one in too? Because this one in too would give you the added uniform -- it -- it -- there's no more disuniformity than there is in any of the other cases. And all that you have here are just what he said on jurisdiction. What this case is really about is whether there was a voluntary departure from the -- from the civil service or whether he was really fired.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  I see that. But it isn't no good reason.  The reason is you're cutting out the extra loop, the very reason that you have the district court make the AD-law decision in the cases where the MPSB decided against the employee. So the reasoning is the same.  It is -- it is, I grant you, that much more, but that much more is not a distinction of principle.   INTERRUPTING ",16-399X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right --   Stephen G. Breyer  Are --   Stephen G. Breyer  Since I'm seeing your argument, it -- it -- it starts with a place where I completely agree.  The village snoop had a fallible memory and didn't follow people for 127 days. The electronic information is infallible.  You can follow them forever. That's a big change.  So, I agree that that change is there.  It's there in many aspects of life, not just location. Now, on the other side of it is that probably, I'm not sure, but probably police and FBI and others, when they get word of white collar crime, money laundering, drugs, financing terrorism, we could go through the list, large numbers of cases, of important criminal cases, they don't have probable cause. They do have reasonable ground to think.  And they start with bank records, with all kinds of financial information, purchases. So, if I accept your line, there's no such thing in the law as location.  There is, but, I mean, people immediately say and why? And then, when they say why, we're going to have to say something like: X days, at least arbitrary, but X days, are very personal.  It was given under circumstances where they didn't know they were giving it or they certainly didn't consent to it. And that is basically the reason. Maybe we throw a few other things in there to get an exception from Miller.  That will be taken immediately to the lower courts, and eventually here, and people will say: Well, what about financial information, i.e., credit card purchases where the most intimate credit card purchases, wherever they are, are immediately records, and what about -- and they'll think of five others -- I can only think of one or two, but, believe me, the legal profession and those interested in this understand it very well. So where are we going? Is this the right line? How do we, in fact, write it? Not, you see, for location.  I have less trouble with that.  But where is it going? Can you say -- it's a very open question, but I'm very interested in your reactions.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You want to add one --   Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe you want to add one thing, because I suspect you'll hear in a minute that all the imperfections of Miller, given your answer, and what I'm thinking, too, I quite agree with you, this is an open box. We know not where we go.  Unadministrable, et cetera. Anything else you want to add?   ",16-402X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I just want your reaction to what I asked the other side.  I agree with you that the law is at the moment third-party information is third-party, with a few exceptions, but it may be that here another exception should exist for the reason that the technology, since the time those cases have -- has changed dramatically to the point where you get the cell phone information, the tower information, and put it together in a way that tracks a person's movement for 274 days or whatever, is an unreasonable thing for the government to do.  Assume that's so. Now, one thing that is bothering me about that line is what I said before.  I would like your reaction as to how to draw such a line, if we draw it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because -- wait, there are other things, and I want to -- I'll be very specific about them through.  I said, and I didn't have much basis in your brief for saying it, is it true that it's quite frequent or, at least, not abnormal for the government, when faced with reason to believe that there are securities violations, white-collar crime violations, terrorism financing violations, all kinds of things like that, that they do go to banks and they do ask for purchase information or to the credit card companies, et cetera, without a warrant, just reasonable? Now --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- therefore, you don't want that interfered with.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  But -- but it may not worry you so much that -- that they can't track a -- a person's physical, which is like his body, you know, where it is, and the technology has changed dramatically there.  So maybe it's an unfair question to ask you --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- but how would you draw that line because that's the problem that's --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why not just say what he said on the other side? Say what's wrong with that? What we say is, look, what we have here is many, many days of the government taking previously unavailable tower information at the time of Miller, et cetera, now putting it together in order to track where this human being has been for a long period of time, something that never could have been gotten before, and to do that without some probable cause is an unreasonable thing.  What's wrong with that as an exception welded onto the basic rule?   Stephen G. Breyer  Or, well -- well, maybe it does have a principle.  Maybe the principle is that look at the exception they've made for diagnostic hospital records.  That is an exception.  And it has to do with physical bodies, and it has to do with the private information related to those physical bodies. And here, if, in fact, there are similar things in similar circumstances of highly private information, you draw, you know, several -- you draw several factors there and -- and you have it over here, if you had the similar thing, all those factors are met in these other cases, so be it.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Maybe you've got the answer to -- right there.  You say how do we distinguish this case from all the cases where you wanted to get the commercial information. In respect to the commercial information, banking and, you know, all the things for white-collar crime, it's commercial information.  And you have the subpoenas and you can perhaps have the protections there that -- that you were talking about here, but this is highly personal information on a -- on a line, you say, it's somewhat closer to the diagnostic testing than it is to purely commercial information. Now, I could imagine writing a paragraph like that and saying leaving the other for the future.  Does that work or does --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, I know you'd say no --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- but I need to know the reason. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But the diagnostic -- the diagnostic test to the hospital.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  But you were saying there is power.  Then I'm confused.  I heard you saying, of course the federal government has the power to insist that you no longer can raise your constitutional claim.  All they have to do is write into the plea agreement I forfeit my right to bring a constitutional claim. And I assume, henceforth, after this one that it somehow got away they will write that into every claim into every agreement, and then the person will not be able to bring his constitutional claim, but, rather, your point is that here they didn't write those words.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All they wrote were the words, I plead guilty.  So the question is, do those words have the same effect as if they'd exercised their undoubted power to stop the individual from raising the claim by writing it out specifically.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING ",16-424X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, all you have to do --   Stephen G. Breyer  There's a -- there's logic.  I mean, it's logical.  Justice Kagan brought this out before.  I'll assume with you that if the government wants to make the defendant waive his constitutional claims, you said they simply write into the plea agreement. And maybe there's some you can't, I don't know of any you couldn't, but there might be, then that's a different case.  So I'll assume that you could do that, and here somehow you forgot to do it.  In a lot of cases, you don't forget, but here you forgot.  Okay. So then we have to face the problem of whether, by saying guilty, that's a waiver. And I thought, having looked at Blackledge and Menna, the rule is simply this: When you say guilty, you have admitted you did what the statute forbids.  Okay? So let's go look at the statute.  See what it forbids.  And you admit you did it. Now, that means you're waiving all the claims that the evidence wasn't good enough, that they should have excluded something under the Fifth Amendment, that somebody shouldn't have testified under the -- the Fourth Amendment, under the Fifth.  There are a whole lot of things -- a jury trial.  Naturally, you admit you did what the statute forbids. But what you haven't admitted is that the statute, for example, is a valid statute. You haven't admitted that.  And another thing you haven't admitted, you haven't admitted vindictive prosecution because I did it, I did it, but they're prosecuting me for a bad reason, and they can't do that.  Okay? That's vindictive. Two, you didn't admit double jeopardy. I did it, I did it.  Ha, ha, you still can't prosecute me because you did once before.  I did it, I did it, but you cannot take away from me the right to claim that the statute's unconstitutional because my guilty plea has nothing to do with that. So, when we fall into that category, the guilty plea by itself doesn't waive the claim.  Now, all we have to say here is, and, moreover, where it's important, like Constitution.  But I don't know if you need the last part.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it doesn't quite work, her rule, because the rule doesn't take into account, which I hadn't thought of -- I thought it -- it doesn't take into account failures in the indictment.  And -- and a failure in the indictment, you couldn't bring up later because what you've admitted to is you did what the statute forbids.   Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't matter, because when you say you did it, you are admitting that you did what the statute forbids and they can convict you for it.  Okay? You're admitting you did what the statute forbids, so you can't -- you can't challenge the composition of a grand jury; of course not. You can't challenge any of the stuff that would take away that you did the things that the statute forbids.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, that can't be right because, after all, if you're admitting that they can convict you and put you in prison for it, we wouldn't have Blackledge and Menna, because in Blackledge and Menna, they admitted they did what the statute forbids, but still they could claim that it's double jeopardy or vindictive prosecution.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's a special -- I mean, you've created a case where you have special circumstances where under those circumstances they -- you want to argue that that might be the equivalent of your having written into the plea agreement: And I promise I will not bring a constitutional claim either. And you're saying the reason that you should read that in here is because, otherwise, we lose the benefit of our dropping the witness-tampering charge.  Okay.  I -- I -- I --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  We'll leave that for a different time, but this is not some special circumstance.  This is an ordinary case.

There is a Virginia statute, but in the Virginia statute it means what you say. And in that Virginia statute, however, the earlier clause speaks specifically about suspending, and they suspend it under certain circumstances and then they say ""tolling.""

INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where is this case?   Stephen G.

Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Are you saying those are unconstitutional?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So, in other words, the -- the federal government in your view has the constitutional power to, area-by-area, to say we will toll the statute of limitations, i.e., suspend it? But it doesn't have the power to say it across the board.  Is that your view?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's an interesting -- I've never seen that constitutional question.

Breyer  No, not the statute. But, I mean, in the stat -- suppose it just didn't have those last words about the 30 days.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah -- no.  No. What it has is just the one that Justice Kagan started with.  It just says, ""while a federal suit is pending and there is supplemental jurisdiction, state statute on the state claim is tolled until this case, federal or the state supplemental case, is dismissed.""   Stephen G. Breyer  No, not closer.  I want to know --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- if there's a constitutional question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, all I want to get at, which is a serious -- I haven't come across that claim anywhere.  There are lots of things I haven't come across, many constitutional arguments I haven't come across. So, what I want to know is what should I read in order to see that your constitutional, grave concern has also, in fact, they -- we have a country with probably 4,000 law professors and there must be a few that -- that it appealed to, so what do you want me to read?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  I grant you that --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- there are some people.  I just wanted a reading list. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  There's another -- there's another reading list I need.  But here I can draw on your experience if you don't have a reading list. My impression, which is not an informed one, is that a lot of these cases come up in the area of torts.  And the state claim is probably -- may be a tort claim or may be an employment discrimination claim, and that the state statutes on those things or maybe the D.C. statutes and so forth are fairly short. The limitations period is a year, maybe 90 days, maybe -- maybe two years.  Where they're long, it's usually property cases.  And when you have a property case, probably unlikely there was a federal claim involved. Now that's a very vague impression, you see, but -- but if it's normally a short limitations period, you could understand why Congress would want to say suspend it.  It won't hurt the defendants that much.  They're short anyway. And -- and -- and give them 30 days because if the person, as he said, his argument was, well, he slept on his rights, you know, and there are only four days left because he's sleeping on his rights.  We're not going to give him the whole rest of the limitations period, because there is none.  We'll give him 30 days. And if, in fact, he has another few months under the state law, then forget it, forget the whole business, he has the state law period.  Okay.  I can see that. But I have no empirical experience. You have some.  So -- so -- so is it -- is it true that this arises mostly in a state law tort area or an employment discrimination area where the statutes are fairly short? Do you know?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any experience I can get on that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In what kind of a case?   Stephen G. Breyer  Two to six years is probably this period.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's because they have that much time left.  That's because they had that much time left under the statute.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  All of those things.  Now, I'm starting here; this is my problem. Before International Shoe, I think basic rule with qualifications, et cetera, a State is a sovereign and can open its doors to whom it wants.  End of the matter.  No.  That isn't quite, but basic rule. Now, along comes International Shoe, no, you can't, not if it's unfair.  Hence the questions. Now, if that's what it is, if that's the basic way to look at it -- and I hear the answers you've given.  Many, but not all, of those answers I could, I think, have said the same thing in respect to multidistrict litigation.  And -- and so it sounds to me, if I'm right on that -- which I might not be, you'd have to say which ones aren't -- that what we need here is a rule.  We need a panel.  We need Congress.  We need the multidistrict panel.  But that isn't the Constitution. And then what I fear is if we say it's the Constitution, what do we do to either the class actions or maybe even multidistrict litigation? I think you could solve that problem by putting the jurisdiction transfer our court.  But -- but you see, that's why I think, what is it specifically that's special -- sorry, but --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what -- what is your -- (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  What is your solution to mass torts?   Rachel P. Kovner  So we think there are a couple solutions.  Claims like this, which are, I think, mass tort claims can be brought in a jurisdiction of general jurisdiction.  They can also be brought in Federal courts and consolidated for schemes like the MDL scheme. These are both solutions that provide efficiency.  And, of course, Congress can step in, if it sees a particular kind of mass tort that it doesn't -- that it wants to provide an additional forum for.  It's done that for specific kinds of -- for instance, mass accidents.  So that's an additional vehicle.  There are forums where claims like this can be brought efficiently.   Stephen G. Breyer  How, if it's constitutional?   Rachel P. Kovner  I'm sorry?   Stephen G. Breyer  How? How? How can Congress step in if it's constitutional?   Rachel P. Kovner  Because Congress is acting under the Fifth Amendment.  And as this Court indicated in Nicastro, it's --   Stephen G. Breyer  Fifth is different from the Fourteenth?   Rachel P. Kovner  Well, it's the -- it's different in the following sense --   Stephen G. Breyer  Isn't that what you write?   Rachel P. Kovner  It's different in the sense that the sovereign is different, and so the kind of contexts that you're talking about in the Fifth Amendment are contexts with the national sovereign.  So in that case, you would look to, does this company have the relevant minimum context to make it fair for the national sovereign --   ",16-466X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The obvious is that this is your home State.   Stephen G. Breyer  But let's imagine it's a home or whatever, and you say that a business is in that State.  You make it -- you -- you do business here, you make things here.  I don't care if you're home or not. Make things here, do business here, incorporate here. Now, you can be sued in any State still, under special jurisdiction, where you cause harm, but you can't be sued in States where you didn't.  Now, that, I think, is what -- I think that's what they're saying is the special federalism interest of either the home State or the State where they did the manufacturing, or the State where they, you know, whatever the other one is where you count as a home State.  That does sound special.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why isn't the answer to this, to my question, your question, which you raise a lot, this is going to be a terrible problem for mass torts.  Answer: Bring your case in Federal court.  Now, why couldn't these 572 or whatever people bring their cases in Federal court?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not all can.  Not all can.   Stephen G. Breyer  But -- but a very large --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- number.  And then that very large number is no problem.  They bring the case in the place where there is jurisdiction, it's consolidated in a multidistrict panel, and the multidistrict panel sends it to that venue for trial, which is convenient for all. Now, what they'll say, yeah, I'll agree with that.  And then they'll say, the solution to this great mass tort problem is that's what Federal courts are for. It doesn't work perfectly, but neither does -- does yours work perfectly.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what is the response to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what you do is --   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  Correct.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can you -- this is answer this in a sense -- all right.  This is -- because you just started to with Justice Ginsburg, no general jurisdiction.  Why am I here, says defendant.  Because, says the judge, you have enough activity in our State for us to call you into court to answer to one of our citizens who was hurt.  That's special jurisdiction, right?   Stephen G. Breyer  But why am I here in respect to Smith? Because, you see, Smith isn't a citizen of our State. So where that answer sounded -- this is logic, and what's bothering about the whole case is its logic, and I don't know the practicalities.  All right. But -- but the -- you see, the logic doesn't seem the same.   Stephen G. Breyer  I cannot say, because you are a citizen of Texas, because that cuts no ice in California.  So what is it I say in a single sentence that does make it clear to that defendant why he is here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I was here for that purpose, not --   Stephen G.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  When you say that, I assumed, I take as a given, the statement in Sosa, does international law extend the scope of liability for a violation of a given norm to the perpetrator being sued, if the defendant is a private actor, such as a corporation or individual? That's the question you're addressing.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then I've assumed, as it was brought out, that, in fact, if a private person struck the French ambassador in the street, as a matter to disgrace him, knocked away his cane, that the statute was passed to give the French ambassador a cause of action against that private person. So we know that sometimes the norm, even though it addresses what the state's supposed to do directly, is also telling the private actor not to do it, it's close enough. Now, when you look at this case, what they've cited is, for example, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which we've ratified, which says that states must take necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable. That sounds like a corporation.  And it sounds like the relation is the same as the international norm to the individual who struck the French ambassador in the street. And then, similarly, the U.N. Security Council has required states to prohibit persons and entities within their territory from financing terrorism.  Then we've implemented those through the Anti-Terrorism Act.  And there are other states that have incorporated it. And there are other examples.  So, when you say there is no such example, it seemed to me that the briefs are full of examples that are designed to make the point that the relationship between the corporation and the international norm is the same as the relationship between the private individual who struck the French ambassador and the international law at that time. Now, what is your response?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But this Court's person -- this Court's case, which I tend to think is precedent, says person or entity.  And the -- the norms that I read to you say person or entity. And if it were an American corporation, I can't imagine why, if it fell within the international norm, you would free it of liability.  So -- so how does it answer the question I raised to say corporations are never liable, given that precedent?   Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly right.  I completely agree.  I agree.  Now, given that, what are --   Stephen G. Breyer  I just want to be sure I get an answer to the second part.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is this --   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, all right.  I quite agree with you.  I looked at the footnote.  And you can't get very far by pointing to six treaties that we didn't, nor others didn't sign. But let's look at what we did sign. And what we did sign were the two I mentioned. And not only -- well, there are three things. One, we signed those.  Two, we've implemented those.  We've implemented those by saying that it is unlawful for corporations to finance terrorism.  And, three, if you had a rule of international law that said you cannot finance terrorists, who do you think it would apply to? I mean, maybe it applies to a few billionaires, but, I mean, other than that, if it doesn't apply to corporations, who does it apply to? So, I mean, you have those three things that I think argue that in this case, this provision of international law does seem -- and you want to say no, that's wrong, because --   INTERRUPTING ",16-499X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  I saw it, but what about the point that Justice Kagan raised.  She was quoting from the opinion.  Why do we have to get into an argument about whether they can be independent or partisan? An expert should not be -- he should give his honest opinion.  That's what they're supposed to do. Why is that the right characterization? Why not just quote from the opinion?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The defense has to have somebody who will conduct an appropriate examination, assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.  And in case we're unclear what that means, the court previously said that that person, the object is, is the insanity defense viable, present testimony to that effect, assist in preparing the cross-examination of a State psychiatric witness.  So why do we have to say more than? That's the question.  And here it seems to me that this defendant certainly did not get that help.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He came in, they presented a -- a report, I've read pages from the report.  And that report was apparently controversial.  And did the defendant have someone to do cross-examination, help him with that, help him understand the report, et cetera, and that's the end of the case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So what? So what? I'm sorry, I'm not being facetious.  I'm -- I mean, literally, I'm -- I don't know the answer to that. So what?

I don't think he consulted -- did he consult with the defense attorney before? Did he explain to the defense attorney? Et cetera, et cetera.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, all right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Fine, fine.  I'm assuming he was a fine doctor. My question is, did he assist the defense in the cross-examination? Did he assist -- of himself, I doubt it.  Did he assist in the preparation, the -- you know, these -- those four things that were listed? Did he or did he not?   Stephen G. Breyer  And he was -- and why was there no cross-examination?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because he was the defense expert?   Stephen G. Breyer  Would you -- would you object to the following disposition of the case: That we say the issue is not partisan versus independent. The issue is whether the defense had assistance from a psychiatrist in the evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense, including cross-examination of hostile or State psychiatric witnesses.  That's what Ake provides.  That's clear.  And what we want you to do, court of appeals, is decide whether that was so.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Would you agree with that or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You do agree with it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If they did not --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If they did not give the -- if they did not give him psychiatric assistance and pay for it, a psychiatrist who would have done those four things that I just mentioned, then they did violate clearly established law --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

Breyer  My question, what's worrying me -- I'd like to know your answer to which you have -- look, a city, to use a slightly farfetched example, imposes a tax on houses and boats.  Someone comes along and says, I have a houseboat.  It's not a house.  Houses don't go on water.  Not a boat.  Look at the French windows, look at the venetian blinds.  No tax. Now, I think that would last about five minutes, that argument.  All right? So I would like to know from you a list of the categories, characteristics -- characteristics, significant characteristics, of disgorgement which are shared neither by fines nor by forfeitures. In what respect is disgorgement like neither of those?   Stephen G. Breyer  Those are the two.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, those are the things that distinguish it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, let's look at those. Punishment.  It doesn't take -- it takes away from somebody something he normally -- he would not be rightfully entitled to. So a person who is walking along the street and commits a crime and is thrown into jail is not deprived of his liberty.  Hmm? I mean, I would think his liberty is something he is normally rightfully entitled to.  And I would think it is a punishment to put the person in jail.

And what you said was --   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  Go ahead.  I'm more interested in what you say.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.  I agree --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- disgorgement might not. A punishment, you say, does take something away from you that you're rightfully entitled to.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, often does.  Sometimes doesn't.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And here -- here you take away things only that the person was not rightfully entitled to.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's a difference.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  I got that one.  Is there another way? Is there another one?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  A thing -- neither a fine, nor a punishment -- I'm not being facetious, I'm -- I'm trying to get it in my mind. Neither a fine, nor a punishment takes from someone a thing that he was not rightfully entitled to.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But disgorgement takes from the person a thing that he -- no.  Sorry.  The other way around.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It takes away from a person something that otherwise he would be rightfully entitled to, and disgorgement takes away from a thing he would not be rightfully entitled to.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Have I got it now?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Wait, let's be more specific about the question that Justice Gorsuch is asking.  You said the difference was that we are taking with disgorgement, property, money, or the equivalent that he, the defendant, did not rightly have.  Perhaps he stole it.  Okay? Now we have a criminal case.  Judge, you stole the Hope Diamond.  I cannot take that value, which you've gotten rid of the diamond, but you have several million, I can't take that and give it to the victims. I don't even know who they are.  So I'm going to impose a penalty, a fine, and the fine will equal the value of the Hope Diamond.  Is that a fine?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You said it was a fine.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That would be a fine.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I think that's the question that's being asked.

I would find that surprising. I would find surprising some aspects of immigration law where the result is just about as bad. The result is they leave without any discretion to keep them here.

In mid 1990s, Congress passed a law in immigration statute, which is this 1101(a)(43), which lists about 30 or 40 crimes.  And it says if the person has committed one of those, goodbye, and the Attorney General can't stop it; is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  But what happened at that time is they stuck in the words ""sexual abuse of a minor.""   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  When they stuck in those words in this long list of crimes, some of which have cross references and some of which, like in that very section, murder, rape, deceit, et cetera, do not. At the time they did that, in 1996 -- I think it was '96, or maybe '95 -- there was on the books a Federal statute which had been passed in 1986.  And that Federal statute, by some amazing coincidence, which was a criminal law, is entitled sexual abuse of a minor.  And then it has a definition. So why not? And think when they use the same word to do about the same thing, list a crime, they meant to pick up the same definition, QED.  End of case. All right? Now, why not?   Stephen G.

Stephen G. Breyer  And they see some words over here in Part 1 on page 3860.  And they know, but we wouldn't know, that if you interpret it one way rather than another, it's going to be much harder to do the thing as a practical matter that they have over there on page 842.

Now, you can't invoke a court's power to do something, including an appellate court, unless you have standing.  To say an intervenor, who wants the court to do no more than what the plaintiff, or in an appropriate case, the defendant, wants them to do does not need standing. But where an intervener wants a court to do something different, then -- then he does need standing. In which case, it would save the court lots of trouble. If there are many interveners, you wouldn't have to look into the standing -- or you would, if, and only if, they want the court to do something different.   Stephen G. Breyer  They may disagree --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- perhaps with the argument.  The lawyer, amazingly, thinks he's a better lawyer than the one who's already there, and so he thinks he can make a better argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But if he doesn't want anything different than what they've already asked for, why does Article III insist that he have standing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  This case --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  This very case.  This very case, he may want nothing different.  All he may want is that the town gives the plaintiff the money, and then he will make his own case to say, I'm equitably entitled.   Stephen G. Breyer  What kind of rule -- probably not -- I -- I don't know.  Where I draw -- begin to get a kind of blank is defendant's standing.  I can see defendant's standing on appeal, et cetera, but forget it.  What about on the initial -- when does -- are there any cases? Are there -- is there a good article? When does a defendant have or lack standing?   Sarah E. Harrington  Justice Breyer, that's where I tend to start, that I think the -- the focus of the rule is on injury from the disposition of the lawsuit.  And so what you would ask is -- when you're talking about a defendant -- if the plaintiff gets what it wants, will that harm the defendant? And I think it's natural to say, will it harm it in a way that would give it standing to appeal. And so what the defendant is trying to do is, instead of waiting until that point, is trying to come in and prevent the injury.  This goes to the second part of Justice Sotomayor's question about the imminence.  And the Respondent said --   Stephen G. Breyer  That gives the defendant standing to --   Sarah E. Harrington  It doesn't give --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- take position to issue -- ask for subpoenas and so forth.   Sarah E. Harrington  Right.  So if the intervenor could be harmed by what the plaintiff wants in such a way that the -- this intervenor would have standing to appeal, then the intervenor sees this injury coming down the road -- this is an actual -- it's a pending lawsuit, and so there's an imminent injury that's -- that's coming the way of the defendant -- or the intervenor, pardon me -- and so the intervenor wants to get involved --   Stephen G. Breyer  I see your point.   Sarah E. Harrington  -- and protect his interest.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, sure.   Sarah E. Harrington  -- without then asking for a showing.   Stephen G. Breyer  We don't have to go into that here.   Sarah E. Harrington  No, you don't have to go into that. There have been a couple questions about sort of piggyback intervenors.  And I think you have to keep in mind that there's Rule 24(b), which is -- allows permissive intervention.  And permissive intervention expressly contemplates that a party has claims, has legal questions, or factual questions in common with existing parties. And I think if a person just wants to come in and say, oh, yeah, I have the same kind of claim you do, they can seek permissive intervention, or they can just file their own claim.  The point of Rule 24(a)(2) is that there's a potential injury from the disposition of the lawsuit to the person who is trying to intervene --   ",16-605X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  How does a defendant have standing? How does that work? What the government says is a defendant has standing because the judgment in the case may affect an interest of the defendant, a significant interest.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, I don't see any more with the defendant, how you can find a defendant without standing on that basis? I mean, the reason I find it relevant is because I think the other side is arguing that an intervenor has to have standing in the sense that a defendant has to have standing, at least when you intervene on the side of the defendant, as most do.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can we write an opinion and say the only people that have to have stand -- I mean, I don't know how to write this opinion unless you're talking about standing in general.  Yes or no on that. And why can a defendant invoke the court's power on appeal -- for example, subpoenas, discovery -- where defendants all the time invoke the court's power, and how can they do that if they don't have -- I don't even know how to phrase the question but you see what I'm driving at.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, not the difficulty of writing an opinion.  I want to know is there such a think as defendants having or not having standing, and if there is such a thing, why and how.  And if you don't know the answer right away, have you ever read anything on the topic, and what would you recommend?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What about when they ask for a subpoena to be enforced? I can't go in and -- you can't -- people can't just go in randomly and say I'd like to have a subpoena enforced against so and so.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  That brings me back to my original question.  Fine.  A defendant can go and get subpoenas and so forth, but if he has a counterclaim, that's different, then he has to show standing. So why don't we apply the same standard to the intervenors? The intervenors have to be like defendants in respect to intervening on the -- on either side.  They can get subpoenas, et cetera, but if they want something that somebody else doesn't want in this case, then they have to have standing.   Stephen G. Breyer  On the defendant's side -- I mean, on the -- why can't we just say simple? It's -- defendants are there because the court might affect their -- their behavior, do something they don't want to do or -- or affect their property in a way they don't want.  And an intervenor on the defendant's side, why not just interpret the rule that way? That's what the government says.  It has to show the same. An intervenor on the plaintiff's side doesn't have to show anything, unless they want something -- other than the rule, I mean, you have -- unless they want something that the plaintiff doesn't want.  That's where I started.  The government is saying interpret the rule this way and you object to that because?   INTERRUPTING ",16-605X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Say, so what -- you started to say this, but I guess Martinez itself, one of the concerns was that any mistake that the trial -- that the trial attorney makes -- and normally, by the way, you -- you don't make ineffective assistance counsel claims on direct appeal, I don't think.  It's usually the same lawyer.  You have to make it in State habeas. Okay.  What would happen would be that the defendant with a new lawyer in Federal habeas would go through every mistake that the trial court made, that the -- that the trial lawyer made, and say it was ineffective assistance of counsel.  And so the judge would have to do just what Justice Alito said, though perhaps a few fewer States. So, you started to say this.  What's the answer? It's five years.  To what extent has the Martinez claim proved a burden on Federal court? Is there any empirical information?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What I -- I asked you really, is there any empirical information? Because, of course, I think you probably think no.  But the other side may think yes.  And so that's what I would like to know, is there any -- anyplace I could look to find out whether it has proved to be a burden or not, where there have been a lot of claims or not?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I don't think that's -- I think, as I'm gathering Justice Alito's point -- and I think it's an -- you know, it's an interesting point and important, what is ineffective assistance of appellate counsel? I mean, I understand somewhat ineffective assistance of trial counsel, but it can't just be an ordinary mistake.  It has to be something rather special.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, is ineffective assistance of appellate counsel the same, or is an appellate counsel ineffective whenever the appellate counsel fails to present a claim that the trial judge made a mistake in the trial?   Stephen G. Breyer  So it's very hard to see when it would be ineffective assistance when there wasn't also ineffective assistance of trial counsel. What is such a case? I mean, I'm just probably missing it, but what -- what is a case where -- where there's ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, but not ineffective assistance of trial counsel? What is that case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So then why didn't the trial counsel -- this -- I can see that this was a very important matter for this particular defendant, but then why wasn't the trial counsel ineffective?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what about saying this: Suppose we said, yes, there is -- it's the same situation, you know, you have ineffective assistance -- you have ineffective appellate counsel.  Well, obviously, you can't raise it because he was ineffective.  So you never had a shot at it.  It's catch-22.  Same with the trial counsel. But those things, it's very unlikely that you're going to have ineffective assistant of appellate counsel where there wasn't also the ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  It's very hard to think of such an instance.  And just the bringing of an ordinary mistake is failure to bring an ordinary mistake will unlikely to be qualified. Suppose we wrote that into the opinion or the equivalent.  What would you think of that?   ",16-6219
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  The same question that I had before.  I -- I mean, every -- every instance in which a trial counsel might have objected but didn't, in principle, could be the subject of Martinez.  I suppose that's quite a few.  I don't know there are any more or any less.  So what's actually happened? Is there any information anywhere about whether -- any empirical information about whether habeas courts, Federal habeas courts, have been deluged, or have -- do we know?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Where?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah --   Stephen G. Breyer  Is it fair to say several hundred a year have come up under Martinez out of -- out of, roughly, how many habeas petitions? Out of fifty thousand? I don't know.  Hundred thousand? Forty thousand?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But several hundred a year.  Now, is there a reason to think there would be more? I mean, after all, you know, I grant you it's slightly different, you're complaining here about a trial error that was raised and the judge wrongly decided it.  And the counsel on appeal should have pointed that out, but he didn't.  Just like you point out with the trial judge -- the trial lawyer should have raised, but he didn't.  Very, very few are granted, very few.  And here, I guess, very, very few would be granted.  But the burden would be to read all those. Now, is it -- is it more, do you think? Why would it be more? I don't see why it would be more.  It might be.  I'm -- that's why I'm asking, though.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, yes, that's true, but how many are in the other? How many -- what's the number in the other? What is the -- what is the number? I mean, the norm, I thought, was that you raise an ineffective-assistance-counsel claim in the collateral proceeding. So how many States, actually, does Martinez not apply to? Do you know that? I -- I doubt that it's, you know, a small number, but I'm pretty certain it isn't every State. Do we have any idea here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you'd have to show, wouldn't you, that -- that the -- any reasonable lawyer would have raised this -- would have won this claim and made a difference -- raised it, won it, and it would have made a difference.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but that's not that easy to show, just as it's not that easy to show in a -- in the -- in the same situation in the trial.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I accept that, and people raise all kinds of things in habeas.  You know, they're -- they're -- this is a -- district judges are kept busy with these habeas petitions, I accept that. That's why I'm -- I'll read the empirical -- I -- I'm curious to know just what the situation is empirically.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  The other side has been brought out.  I mean, there is the occasional claim where let's suppose the appellate lawyer just really didn't even bring an appeal.  He had a two-page brief and the trial was rife with errors and a serious penalty.  It was attached and -- and no relief whatsoever.  He can't bring that to any court.  Do you see that? That's the other side of it.  Even if there are only a few.   Stephen G. Breyer  He has to have -- he has to have failed to do that, and -- or at least the State collateral review has to also have been inadequate.  And so we have to have a couple of situations where they are both inadequate or you don't even get into the Federal court.  So the standard for winning, which you concede is quite -- is very tough and -- but suppose it's met, that's -- that's, of course, what's annoying on the other side.  Here is a person in jail forever or worse, and the trial filled with errors and didn't have decent counsel anywhere and what a mess.  I mean, shouldn't there be some remedy? And there is none.  And that's why Justice Scalia wrote that there's no way to stop this extension.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He wasn't for it. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  Where -- where does it exist?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Actual innocence means he was actually innocent.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING ",16-6219
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Looking at the cases, my impression was that if, say, the defendant asked for $15,000 and the court gave $10,000 or maybe $20,000, whatever it is, or one side or the other disagrees with that, they can't appeal.  I mean, they can appeal.  It's like an administrative law.  Of course, they can appeal.  You can always appeal.  But you're going to lose because the statute is read by various courts, I think correctly, as giving very broad discretion to the trial court to decide how much. It's just like they want to call a witness or something.  I mean, you say this witness is irrelevant.  Well, the judge says I'm calling him.  You can appeal.  Ask for mandamus or something.  You're going to lose because it's up to the -- it's up to the court. And isn't that the same here and shouldn't it be the same?   Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't.  I'm saying it doesn't mean that.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's just like any other situation where a trial court has to run his trial.  He has broad discretion over many areas, and that should be the same here.   Stephen G. Breyer  We don't have to -- do we have to -- I mean, look, suppose it is the case that we're, technically speaking, correctly, listening to what you've done and it is an appeal from a final habeas order.  All right. We granted the petition for cert in order to decide whether the circuit is correct in using the words ""substantially necessary"" instead of ""reasonably necessary."" Right? Well, there are cases in which we have done just that.  We've decided the issue we granted on, and then we've said: And if they needed a COA, this opinion suggests, indeed requires, that they should have granted one.  Okay? And then we don't have to deal with that.  And if we did that, would that violate something?   Stephen G. Breyer  And we'll find out if the other side is.   ",16-6795
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Look, the statute says upon a finding that investigative, expert, dah-dah-dah, are reasonably necessary for the representation of the defendant, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, the court may authorize the defendant's attorneys to obtain such services.  It says the court, the judge, the judge may authorize.  All right. They say the judge should authorize, and this is the standard, and you say no, that's not the standard.  The standard -- or it's the same, do some other way.  But in either case it is a judge who is performing a duty that is imposed upon him by a statute. Well, why isn't that the end of it? We -- we -- we review matters of appointing attorneys' fees and paying for them. There can be all kinds of things that judges are authorized by statute to do as part of their judicial duties. I really don't see -- and the cases that you cite are all cases saying basically that there's a lot of discretion in the judge to decide how much, which I agree with.  But this is an unusual jurisdictional argument.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's -- that's true, you're -- what you say is true.  The question is, is the judge performing a judicial duty? And the statute says he is.  It's in with other statutes that talk about his judicial duties. And it would seem that making certain that a defendant has an expert, where necessary, is part of an ordinary judicial duty. I mean, can you think of -- if you're -- if Murray's Lessee is the best you can do, at least in my own mind, that's quite a different matter.  It was asking judges to award pensions or something like that, I think. But -- but that's -- is there anything else you have going for you at the moment?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Obviously, I'm skeptical of your argument, but go ahead. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Maybe, but they may have to go to -- maybe they have to exhaust -- maybe they haven't exhausted on this point.  I mean, I don't know.  In -- in the first sentence of where the language you're quoting does -- it's kind of -- it's an exhaustion requirement.  And -- and so they'll go and exhaust. Now, that isn't what we took this case to decide, is what everybody has told you.  So proceed if you want on this thing, but at some point, I'd love to hear your point in answer to what he said on -- on the issue we did say we would take.   Stephen G. Breyer  When you want.  You don't have to now.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  To go back to what the --   Stephen G. Breyer  It's jurisdictional, we have to reach it, I think I can find pretty good authority where it came up before and they didn't issue a -- COA, but we decided the issue and said now you should have issued a COA too. I may be wrong, but you don't have it in your briefs.  They don't have it in their briefs.  I don't have it in anything I've looked at yet. But I have it somewhere in the back of my mind, which is sometimes wrong. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  So I'll look it up. Okay.  I believe --   Stephen G. Breyer  No, it's not that reliable.  But the question -- this is reminding me of something, if I'm perhaps overly simple-minded on this, but what it reminds me of is the great argument that used to take place in ad law.  You see if, in fact, you reverse a fact finding of a district judge, you're supposed to do it if it's clearly erroneous.  You reverse a fact finding of an administrative ALJ, you're supposed to do it if there isn't substantial evidence in the record. All right.  That's what the statute does. That's -- so Jerome P. Frank, who was a great judge, one day said, my God, I've found it, eureka, I've found a case that a judge wouldn't reverse under the first standard but would -- or would -- would reverse under the first standard but wouldn't under the second. But then, when I looked at it more closely, I discovered I didn't have that unusual case anyway. See, he thought there was no difference. That spanned a bunch of law reviews that said, yeah, there is a difference.  Some said yes; some said no.  So why don't we just say, look, that's what the statute says.  Pick up his standard.  All these arguments you've been making, maybe good, maybe bad, make them to the district court.  Okay? End of case.  Fifth Circuit, you are to follow the statute.  And that's it. Good-bye.  And all these other arguments are for the lower court.  And if you want, you say that the lower court should take into account all the arguments that it deems relevant and significant.  All right?   INTERRUPTING ",16-6795
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  So how seriously should we take a word that you read from Ylst which was ""presume,"" it says the -- the habeas court should presume that this simple, one-word statement of the state supreme court means that the decision that's keeping the person in prison is, in fact, the decision of the intermediate appellate court? Now, then if it's a presumption, the state could refute it.  And I guess is this right? The state would be free to say, well, look, here, Your Honor, to federal judges, look, this decision of the intermediate court is so obviously wrong, in any event, it's so obviously a procedural ground, an adequate state ground, and look at what they argued to the state supreme court and bring out the briefs, and say under these circumstances you shouldn't presume that that lower court decision is what the supreme court decided on. Indeed, nobody even claimed in the supreme court that they ought to just decide on that ground.  I mean, would you be free to do such -- would they be free to do that kind of thing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it's -- in Georgia, I take it, the adequate state ground is not really one -- it's not in play in this kind of situation, but there are states where it are -- it is. I don't know how well, but what -- what I've just said and what you said it would be free, is that basically the situation that most of the states use, as that's what's going on right now in the country.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why do we not know? I mean, what he quotes in his brief, is this wrong? He says that Supreme Court Rule 36 says when somebody files an application for a cause, for a certificate of probable cause, the application, quote -- he's quoting from the rule -- ""will be issued where there is arguable merit."" And here we have denied.  And, therefore, there is no arguable merit.  Now, that seems like Euclid, or whoever, I don't know, who was it? Aristotle or something. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  But, you see, that's their point. So -- so how can you get up and say we don't know what they do? We do know they thought there was no arguable merit. So I guess what you're asking us to do is to think of ways that nobody, has yet occurred to anybody, that there was no arguable merit, not necessarily because it's a good opinion below, but because we've thought of one of your assistants, a bright young graduate, has walked into your office with a case from Georgia law of 1812.  And judging from the dust, nobody's ever seen it before, but it was written by Oglethorpe's second cousin twice removed.  And there we are.  And it's brilliant.  Nobody's thought of it.  You say how do we know that wasn't their reason? Now, that's extreme, but you see my point.  Okay? What's the answer to my point?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, the point of the question -- (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  Sorry.  Well, from your pleasant expression, it sounded to me as if you were understanding my obscure question. My -- I had two separate questions. One, I quoted the rule, which seemed to me what Justice Sotomayor said, must be correct. Then I asked a separate question, that the problem looking at it practically is that you're asking us to take on a burden.  The only person who will have a greater burden is you because you, in your job, when faced with a decision of an intermediate appellate court and a denial of CPC, will have to sit there making up reasons that are not present in anybody's opinion. And I use Oglethorpe as a comic example of that.  But it's that kind of thing that you'll have to do. So my question is obviously why should we take a system that works fairly well and throw this practical monkey wrench, which means a lot more work for you, into the gears?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well --   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, there is a big difference.  I mean, first, Harrison is different because in Harrison there was no decision of the state court that you could look to. Obviously, the federal habeas court has to try to figure out some theory as to what they were holding.  That isn't the question here where there is a decision of the court. And where a habeas court later takes that decision as being the decision from the state that led to this person's being deprived of liberty, what does that say about whether the summary affirmance should be treated as precedent for state law? It says nothing, I think. When you have us saying ours should not be treated that way, of course, we don't want it as a precedent binding every court in the nation.  When a federal appeals court says our summary affirmance does not mean that we agree, of course, they don't want it to be binding throughout the circuit. But this decision before us has nothing to do with that.  We can say this district could set -- the appeals court in Georgia has made the decision that is leading to his deprivation of liberty and ignore the summary affirmance without saying anything about whether the summary affirmance is precedent or not, a matter not before us.

For this reason -- now, this is slightly a side issue, but it's very puzzling, and I think I should know the answer, when I look up the definition of financial institution, it says that not only is it Credit Suisse and not only is it Citizens Bank, but it is also the customers of each of those financial institutions in an instance where the bank is acting as agent or custodian for a customer. Now, it seems to me that Citizens Bank is acting for agent or custodian of a customer, namely VVD, and it seems to me that Credit Suisse is acting as a -- as an agent or custodian for VVD. So why doesn't that cover it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why doesn't that cover it? Why are we dealing with a case which is coming out of something and deciding all kinds of things about banks and my wife, if I -- you know, where -- where this is absolutely dealt with in a statute, under -- under another provision, and nobody refers us to that provision, and I can't understand why they didn't -- what's going on?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You may have put it in your briefs, but, I mean, why in the lower courts wasn't this just said, look, point to that, Judge, this involves a customer of a financial institution, namely VVD, and, therefore, it's in the exempt area? Point to that.  And -- and I want to know why that didn't happen.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It's your case.  You can do it in a sense the way you want, but, I mean, where this is just standing out and we're asked to decide a question that I think is fraught with difficulty, I would like to know the answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  I think it's the same, but, I mean, at some point, you know, if we have two cases involving the Fishing Act, and it involves fishermen, and both parties concede we are -- we are fishermen, but, in fact, what they are is both farmers and have nothing to do with fish, I would say we'd have a problem in this Court about whether we should hear the case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But not as the statute understands it --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- which uses it to include a customer of a financial institution in circumstances which are present here.   Stephen G. Breyer  What about this, the -- where -- where it says a trust fee, gee, tree -- sorry, a trustee may not avoid a transfer that is a settlement payment made by a financial institution? Joe -- that's right, isn't it? So far?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Joe Smith buys a piece of property from Bill Brown for $10 million.  Joe Smith puts into escrow $10 million.  It's -- Bank of America is the escrow agent.  Brown puts in the deed.  When both are there, Bank of America gives each the other. Why hasn't Bank of America given a settlement payment?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't mean that --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I see.  So -- so it is not a settlement payment.  It's just -- it's not a settlement payment, a payment for a real estate transaction.   Stephen G. Breyer  It is not? It is not a real estate transaction payment?   Stephen G. Breyer  But if the same thing were true and what they had bought was a -- 5 million acres of wheat, then it would be?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you, thank you. I see.   Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.   Stephen G. Breyer  So what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, if I write a check, and it goes to the postman, and the postman delivers it to Smith, and I get my money back from Smith, then I guess you could say, well, the postman -- that putting it in the mailbox didn't have any financial effect. So what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that is all that he's trying to avoid.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I know, but I mean it has no effect.  If FedEx, you know, delivered the check.  I mean, there are many ways of delivering the check.  If they're just a conduit, the bank, it's quite true in a sense that transfer from the bank didn't have any effect because the people who got the money had to give it back to the people who deposited the money. But my question was, so what?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And there's no -- there's no consequence to Citizens Bank, is there?   Stephen G. Breyer  No -- no -- no consequence?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   ",16-784X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I have no doubt that neither party wanted it resolved on that basis. And so what's nagging at the back of my head is that, since it seems so clear, it's like two farmers who decide they have some other financial interest in fishing, and they'd love to have this Court decide the Fishing Act, but, in fact, if you look at the Farming Act, you've got the answer to the dispute between them. And can two parties who would just love it, if we could decide an issue that really isn't at issue before them, and can they stipulate away all of the actual, you know, they stipulate away the basic rule that a contract is valid upon signing or something, in order to get us to decide a question?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So for this --   Stephen G. Breyer  So, for this provision, do I have this right? A, look to the -- the transaction that the trustee is trying to set aside as a preference or fraudulent conveyance.  B, ask the question: Who is the person who directed that that transfer be made? All right. If it's a financial institution, et cetera, stop right there, good-bye, you're out. If not, continue to question 3.  And question 3 is: Who is the initial transferee and not a conduit of that transfer? And if the answer is a financial institution, you're out.  And otherwise we go on to ask the other questions. And that means that a -- that the transferee, the initial transferee, if he's receiving money that he is to hold for the benefit of the other, he still is the initial transferee.  And you will look to such matters as to who this money is to benefit later on in your -- your efforts.  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   Stephen G. Breyer  Uh-huh.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  All Right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you have what it says?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   ",16-784X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then that's the problem.   Stephen G. Breyer  Right there is the problem.  I mean, that's the problem in my mind. Faretta itself poses a problem because a large percentage of the people that insist on representing themselves, particularly in death cases, are going to walk right into the death -- the death chamber.  A lot of the people there are just not really capable of managing their own defense. So now we have a lawyer.  And, suddenly, we come in with a constitutional rule that's going to tell the lawyer how to argue his case.  How do I know what you say is true? The people who know this are the trial bar, if anybody.  But how do you know whether there are cases where, in fact, to make a sensible defense for this person who might have one, the lawyer has to say to the jury, because of what other witnesses have said and so forth, that letter did cross state lines? And if we agree with you in this, which is a very different case, the argument against agreeing with you in this is it will be like a balloon expanding into we don't know where what, because they're filled with elements, the federal code.  And before you know it, lawyers will have a hard time defending this person.  And you're walking right into jail when you start telling your lawyer how to run his case. Now, that's the concern that I think is there in the Chief's question.  And I -- I would like to know your response to what I consider a very practical concern.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's surprising.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's -- that's surprising, because if we announce that we're not deciding it, there are like 200,000 criminal cases in the lower courts and there will be a kind of chaos, I mean, I fear, that as to what -- there are lots of people, you know, there are many, many defendants who go through dozens of lawyers while they're objecting to this one or that one or the other one.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And you see what I'm worried about?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I think we should decide it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But -- yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That -- that's easy for you to say in a case that you're imagining. What I'm wondering, if there are other cases where it might be far more difficult to come up with that answer, and, therefore, I'm asking you this question: Suppose the opinion were to say in this case the lawyer explicitly said to the jury he is guilty of the crime charged. That the Sixth Amendment forbids. But the rest of these complicated matters, whether it's elements, whether it's this, whether it's that, we leave -- at least for now, we leave to the law schools, the bars, the ethics classes and the others because we don't want to freeze the answer into the Sixth Amendment. Now, what would you think of that?   ",16-8255
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Your point -- I see your point.  Normally, these are questions of the bar rules of -- rules of ethics for lawyers and so forth.  Normally, they do what the client says.  That's the normal situation. Right here, it was pretty clear that on the most major matter in respect to the trial, he did the opposite and said his client was guilty.  So why didn't this work out just the way you said? Why didn't the defendant say it violates the ethics rules, it was therefore ineffective; therefore, give me a new trial?   Stephen G. Breyer  Do the ethics rule say it's all different when -- when -- when you have a difficult client? Maybe many are difficult.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, but you just said the ethics rule say follow the wishes of your client.  I mean, that's what's worrying me, obviously, in fact, about the case is the extent to which it's fed into the Sixth Amendment, because there's so many different situations. But if anything is fed into the Sixth Amendment, I would think the example of the lawyer going in against his wishes and saying he is guilty of the crime charged, which is basically what happened, that that might or must.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  But they're not saying about what you have to put on or not put on.  They're just saying the Sixth Amendment says you can't go to the jury and say, as this lawyer did, my client is guilty of the crime charged. Now -- now, that's the extreme case that's put to us.  Now why doesn't that violate the Sixth Amendment?   Stephen G. Breyer  The -- the lawyer put on a defense?   Stephen G. Breyer  Would the lawyer -- did -- did his lawyer put on a defense? He conceded that -- he didn't fight the competence.  But did he put on a defense that the defendant was not competent at the time of the murder, that his -- that his mental state was such that he couldn't be convicted?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  To attack mens rea on the ground that it was not -- he was not mentally competent at that time?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And that's -- I now understand why we are where we are.  The -- that in this case, he did not, the lawyer, concede that his client was guilty of the crime charged.  Rather, he said he conceded that he had shot the people, killed the people, but he's not guilty because of his state of mind. So it's a question of the defense. That's why he started with elements and so forth.  You have to go down some road like that.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  And so your view is that even here, where he's saying I did this thing, but I didn't have the mental element -- I did this thing -- the client says don't say I did this thing, and that's the problem and -- okay, I've got the problem. Sorry.  I should have it before now, but -- but --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what's your -- what's -- that's fine to say in abstract terms, but -- but -- but our problem, I think, at least mine, is I have to write something -- (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  -- here that is going to be taken as a rather authoritative account. Now, what is your view as to what those words should be? That he can do anything, the lawyer, no matter how incriminating it is to the client as long as he says I want to follow a different defense, a different defense than my client wants? That's your view of it? And leave the rest to the -- to Strickland, the bar association, et cetera.  Is that your view?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is your view, if you can say it in a sentence or two?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Did he --   Stephen G. Breyer  Did -- did -- I'm thinking back, I think the Chief asked you, or maybe it was Justice Kennedy, he quoted the language where he said ""I've relieved you of your burden,"" so he says, ""I've relieved you of your burden,"" he says to the jury, and he also says, ""and he's guilty."" That was earlier. Now, in the context, was that -- you're familiar with the record.  All right. Was that, in fact, an admission that he committed a crime; namely, first-degree murder or second-degree murder or both, or are you saying, no, it was not an admission because -- if -- if it was not an admission, then why didn't he tell the jury: But, you see, he had a mental state that makes it impossible for you to convict.  Or did he?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He said you cannot convict because he has a mental state that prevents you from convicting him for either first- or second-degree murder?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I'll find --   Stephen G. Breyer  And he put -- and his closing statement said that too?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   ",16-8255
1,NO QUESTIONS,16-9493
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So is that -- is that -- because I have -- I'm drawing on what the Chief Justice said now and before in my mind.  And the question in my mind is, should we proceed by category? And people have been focusing, which I agree with, about the -- what Justice Kagan said in drawing on what was written by Justice Gorsuch, what people would think of this, but I'm not thinking of what people would think of this.  I'm thinking of what the guidelines are about. And we have, one, there was an error. Two, it's clear and obvious.  Three, it did affect the party's rights.  He went to jail at least one day more.  Okay? So we got those three things. And given those three things, it's probably an arithmetical error, probably, but not definitely.  And then we ask, four, did the error affect -- now there are three things here -- fairness, and the second one is what I focus on, I'm not focusing on fairness, I'm not focusing on public reputation of judicial proceedings, I am focusing on the integrity of the judicial proceeding. And the reason I'm focusing on it is because the guidelines have a special purpose and they have a special procedure.  The special purpose is to create a kind of uniformity among people who do the same thing in respect to their punishment. And the special procedure is that the Commission and the courts cooperate in gathering statistical information so that the Commission can see how that's working. Now, as soon as you have people who depart for incorrect reasons from what they're supposed to put, you muck up that statistical information. And although you could say with just one or two it doesn't matter, there is no way to distinguish between one or two and 51 or 52, and maybe one across the country but maybe one in a single district does matter. And so all those kinds of technical mistakes that do affect the party, that are clear, do interfere significantly with the congressionally legislated purpose of the guidelines and the effort to implement them. Therefore, considered as a class, because of the difficulty of distinguishing among them, we don't want to go case by case, distinguishing as a class, where 1, 2, and 3 are met, so is 4.  To the least, there is a presumption to that effect. All right.  That's how I would look at it.  And what's the answer to that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Correct.  But if you will read, as I hope you would someday, the introduction to the initial version of the guidelines, which happens still to be there, you will see that the purpose of the Commission is first to create a set of guidelines and then, through the procedures I'm talking about, to see what judges actually do in administering the guidelines so that those can be improved and changed over time. Now, if we are looking at not what the judge did under the guideline but what the judge thinks he did under the guideline, but he got the guideline all wrong, then, all right, we can't do it, we can't carry that out.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  As I say, we might be able to live with one mistake in one district, but then we have to distinguish which ones, and there's no way to do that. So you might end up with 50 -- the same point I'm making before.   Stephen G. Breyer  So I'm saying what the integrity is that is interfered with is the integrity of the congressionally-mandated purpose and method through which the guidelines are to be implemented.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, that's true.   Stephen G. Breyer  Wait just a second. Just in case you know this, I mean, I should know it, but -- I wrote it.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I don't necessarily.  Did we declare this -- this section unconstitutional in Booker? I mean, we tried to save as much as we could, and I don't know why we wouldn't have saved this one.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  My goodness, that's very good.  That's very good.  And so what -- and so we kept it or we didn't?   Stephen G. Breyer  It's an open question, okay.  Thank you. (Laughter.)   ",16-9493
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Why -- I'm just curious why -- why is this a civil office? This thing is -- can you hear me?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, go ahead and finish that first.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why -- why is that? I mean, after all, Congress creates the military by statute.  And it appoints all the officers by statute.  And they're all confirmed by -- by Congress. And this is a Commission that normally serves in areas where it could be under civilian control, but the civilian courts are not functioning, and, therefore, we have a military commission serving the ordinary officers. Now, all those things seem military, special, and if you want to know whether -- if you want to use: Did Congress intend military officers to serve on it, and in the absence of that it's civil, they did.  All right. So -- so what's civil about it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, except the fact you mentioned, it's of course true, it is of course true, that there is one civilian on it or two or three.  That's true. Is there anything that says a military officer, which would otherwise be totally military, suddenly becomes civil because you appoint one person who's civil?   Stephen G. Breyer  In the Civil War, I think you had military commissions, didn't you?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you want us to distinguish between appeal and just carrying out a trial?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but that isn't the issue.  The issue I think is -- that's being raised is what Justice Kennedy said. There are many, many, many adjudicatory bodies in the executive branch. And what the amicus says is if you don't want to have jurisdiction by cert directly from all of those, rather than through a court of appeals or a habeas court, if you don't want that because you think that is inconsistent with separation of powers, then you'd better find a way or a reason or a sensible difference between this case and the NLRB and the SEC.  And what -- what the amicus says is that Coe and the other cases that have upheld it -- I'm not sure how he deals with Palmore; I don't know about the D.C.  I'll have to ask about that. But the -- the -- the -- leaving that to the side, they all not only have the attributes of a -- of a court, but they also have jurisdiction over a territory.  Now, I think that that is what he sees in the prior cases.  And he says that is not true here.  All right? Now, if you do not agree with that, why? If you have a different test, why? If you would bring in all the NLRB, then say it.   Stephen G. Breyer  It's one question. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought the court of record was a court -- for years, I must have been under a misapprehension.  I thought the appeals courts of the circuits are not courts of records but the district courts are.  And that is because in the district courts, there is a record.  There is a -- a notary, there's a person there who takes -- here -- and -- and the courts of appeals, the discussion such as here, though we have it recorded, it's not necessarily a record.  And in the courts of appeals, it certainly isn't.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm also worried about the -- well, two things.  One, if we took your -- your test, what about the D.C.? Look, the D.C. Circuit is the exercise of federal judicial -- judicial power -- not the circuit but the court of appeals.  But it isn't an Article III court.  They have limited terms.   Aditya Bamzai  The D.C. Court of Appeals --   Stephen G. Breyer  What?   Aditya Bamzai  The D.C. Court of Appeals --   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, that's right.   Aditya Bamzai  -- is not an Article III court.  The D.C. Circuit is.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  Yeah.  So how do we explain the decision that's upholding that? I mean, appeals from that?   Aditya Bamzai  Your Honor, the -- the explanation is that the D.C. courts, the local courts --   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Aditya Bamzai  -- stand in the same position as territorial courts --   Stephen G. Breyer  No, didn't -- didn't -- aren't the -- weren't the territorial courts, they're Article I courts, I guess, but didn't Congress intend under your theory to delegate to those courts part of its judicial power or not?   Aditya Bamzai  That is true in the -- of the territorial courts.  They the --   Stephen G. Breyer  Were they life appointments?   Aditya Bamzai  They were not.  No, Your Honor, they were not life appointments, but they could exercise --   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Okay.  So I got your point.  But now, what about the government's argument that what we should do is look back to history and say the tradition at the time of the writing of the Constitution would have been to consider military justice as a functioning judicial system, and that isn't true of the NLRB and it isn't true of the other agencies. And because they both have the characteristics or many of the characteristics of courts and would have been so considered historically that it is appropriate to exercise appellate jurisdiction from their decisions.   Aditya Bamzai  Your Honor, respectfully, I don't know if that is entirely the government's position.  You might want to ask my friend.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Yeah.   Aditya Bamzai  And that is because the government appears to concede that this Court in Ex parte Vallandigham held that it could not directly -- directly review a military commission in that case because the military commission did not exercise the judicial power in a relevant sense. And as I understand the government's argument, it is that this Court can review the CAAF.  The CAAF is different because it has been codified by Congress.  I see that my time is up.   ",16-961X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  There are a lot of --   Stephen G. Breyer  I -- the amicus says --   Stephen G. Breyer  What we're doing is looking, I think -- at least I am, I think others are too -- for a reason; that is, what is it that -- that -- I can see the states. You say -- the easiest is the federal courts. I mean, Congress has judicial authority who exercises it.  Well, how can we have appellate jurisdiction over state courts? That's because states have sovereignty, and they can, in the exercise of their sovereignty, create a judicial system. Well, what about territories? Well, territories, that's a tougher one because it looks like it's Congress's sovereignty, but it isn't.  That is to say, sovereign -- territories are the equivalent of states before they are states.  Human societies on territories create judicial systems.  And so the territorial courts are analogous to the state courts. What about the D.C. Circuit? Hmm -- D.C. Court of Appeals, rather.  That's a tougher one but maybe rather like the territorial courts, like the state court.  Hmm. And now what? Okay? And now he says I've used this territorial principle, the sovereignty arising in territories physically, which aspect of the sovereignty is an authority to create a judicial body, giving us appellate jurisdiction. Now, military, you don't like that territorial-based distinction because it's -- territorial sovereignty based distinction because they don't really have -- it's not territories. And so now we're looking for another one.  That's a long question, but all I'm asking for is, what is that other one? And the Chief says it sounds like, which to me it did sound rather like, whatever we've done in the past is all right but not in the future.  And -- and that's a historical one.  Hmm.   Stephen G. Breyer  I know that, but looking at Coe, it doesn't seem to give much of an answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Well, at that point, Justice Kennedy's question becomes relevant to me.  Then he says, all right, Congress says the NLRB -- they used to be called, you know, hearing examiners.  And now they're called ALJs, which is administrative law judges.  And now what we do is produce a court of ALJs, which we call a court, dot dot --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- and has stenographers so it's of record, da da, you see? Now, that's the concern.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what if --   Stephen G. Breyer  What about -- you're really make -- you're making me think in this. I guarantee it's a hard question.  But maybe we find an analogy in the territorial cases. Can we read the territorial cases as -- as, looking at this, separately out of Article III, the Constitution gives to Congress the power to organize governments in the territory. The governments of a territory involve an executive, legislative, and judicial function.  Therefore, in exercising its sovereign constitutional power under Article I, in the power to organize governments and territories, it is going to have the power to organize courts of a kind that act like courts and, therefore, appellate review.   Stephen G. Breyer  The same is true of the military, which is a separate world, and it is Article I giving them power over the military that lets them do that.   Stephen G. Breyer  The same is not true of the NLRB, which is a specialized agency, and because the judicial and adjudicatory functions that the executive branch performs in its carrying out of executive duties are rule-making and decision-making authorities under execution, not judicial.   Stephen G. Breyer  You think that might work?   ",16-961X

I have no doubt that the language you point to helps you, but where I run into trouble is I can't imagine how a statute is supposed to work where you, objecting, say: I object to 10 claims, all right? Now we look at this and say: You're going to get that grant; if just one of those 10 claims is reasonable likelihood, you'll prevail.  Okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  So you will -- you will have inter partes review under the first thing, 13, 14, as long --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- as just one, all you have to have is one, and you will get inter partes review.   Stephen G. Breyer  You may get.  Okay. They say -- now, it's up to the Patent Office. And the Patent Office says, yeah, one, okay. Now, what you're saying is because there was one and nine they're never going to review, they think there's nothing to it. Okay? And it says that their decision not to review will not be appealed, all right? Okay.  So they find one, and all of a sudden, they discover they're in court and have to appeal everything on nine claims they thought made no sense.  But if they find all 10 are no good, then they're out of court, no way to get them in there, dah, dah, dah.  Okay? Now, that's the part I have trouble grasping, why someone would write a statute like that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I have done that.  I actually have it written down.  My law clerk has it here.  But I -- I grant you I have a hard time keeping it all in mind.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I started by saying --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I started by saying --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- that I think language does favor you but not definitely.  I mean, there is a lot of opening and ambiguity here.  And that's why I turned to what I was having trouble with, is trying to imagine what the purpose would be of writing a statute the way you want, though I find it very practical to think of the statute as your opponents want it. Now, that -- that exposing my method of thinking, I'm not wedded to that, but I do want to know what your answer is.   Stephen G. Breyer  No, I just mentioned that the word ""any"" is ambiguous.

Now -- now my -- my point is we have loads of statutes where the word ""any"" has a scope and the scope is determined by the context of the statute. And so what I'm thinking in the back of my mind is this is one of those, but as I say, don't let me get off on a wrong foot.   Stephen G. Breyer  It doesn't actually have to mean that.  I just thought there's another tack here, that if you're voting in Congress on this, you actually don't know what you think of in respect to the answer to this question we are now litigating. And since you don't know, the best answer, from the point of view of the agency, you use a word like ""any"" and ""any claim,"" as I say, filled with ambiguity, so that the agency can decide which way it wants to go.  Is there any indication of that?   ",16-969X

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What are -- what are they supposed to do? That is, every year a certain number of people die and every year a certain number move to California.  All right. We don't want them on the voter roll.  That used to be a big problem, voting dead people. Okay? What should the state do?   Stephen G. Breyer  They went and died in Hawaii, I don't know, they went and died in Alaska.  They went and died in Tasmania. Is -- is Rhode Island supposed to look at the Tasmanian voting records or hospital records or what are -- what -- it's a serious question.  I don't think there's no answer to it.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And I want to know your opinion.   Stephen G. Breyer  What?   Stephen G. Breyer  You know, I want to know what they are.  I -- I am very ignorant in this field.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm in Rhode Island. I see the statute.  I know some people have died, maybe in Rhode Island, maybe outside. Maybe they've moved to California. I don't want them voting in my state or people pretending to be them voting in my state.  What do I do?   Stephen G. Breyer  What about sending a card? Look, the reason I'm asking these questions is because I don't believe Congress would have passed a statute that would prevent a state from purging a voting roll of people who have died or have moved out of the state. So I'm trying to reconcile the two. And, therefore, I ask you what the state's supposed to do for that latter objective.  And suppose they send a card which says no forwarding.  Don't forward.  And their theory of that is that if the person has moved, and they wait long enough, and they send it a couple of times, the post office will send it back and then they'll know the person has moved.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, that's right. And you think that's okay?   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm asking you if you think that's --   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now --   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Fine, fine.  Okay.  I got my answer.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can I add one thing to it? I -- I'd like to add that because they don't want to send non-forwardable cards to everyone since it's expensive -- in a state like California, it might cost several -- tens of millions of dollars -- what they do is they send those non-forwardable cards to people who haven't voted for three or four years.  Okay? Now is it okay?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is there any stat on that? I mean, this does seem at the moment to boil down to an empirical question. You think that sending a notice, which is forwardable, is not going to tell you not much when it comes back because so many people just don't return notices.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, when it doesn't --   Stephen G. Breyer  Exactly.  Sorry, I misspoke.  You think that returning a notice that's forwardable, when it doesn't come back tells you virtually nothing because people just throw things in the wastebasket or --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- or it tells you next to nothing.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You don't know where -- you don't know if they just got it at the old address or they had to forward it.  You don't know. But if it wasn't forwardable, you get it from the post office, that tells you quite a lot.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Got it.  Got it.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, that's what you've just said. And if you're right on the first, then we have nothing left here or next to nothing left but the not voting.  That's your point.   Stephen G. Breyer  His point is we have something else.  We do have the fact that that notice didn't come back, and that means more than you think it means.  Okay? That's their point, I think.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now, if that's so, all I'm asking is, is there any place in this record that I can look for some numbers or surveys or something hard that will either support you or will support them?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But there might be surveys about how many people throw everything in the wastebasket.  I confess to doing that sometimes.  And -- and --   Stephen G. Breyer  I know that's what your opinion is.  And all I'm asking is, is there any hard evidence of that one way or the other?   Stephen G. Breyer  Page?   INTERRUPTING ",16-980X

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So how -- look, I -- I don't know what I'd write in this case.  And the reason I would write, if we have to get to this issue, the reason I don't know is because I think law is part art and part science.  And you learn in law school and thereafter how to read an opinion.  There are no absolute rules. Marbury versus Madison, two-thirds of it is not necessary to the conclusion.  So should we pay no attention to it? Of course, we pay attention to it. And then I can cite five, but I won't, where it may be that on this matter there was a unanimous Court, but nobody believes it because it wasn't, you see.  And they all go off. And Powell, of course, is, in part, key because he had a sensible view.  And the public, the lawyers, the -- the clients, the other judges, are the ones who tell us that over time. So, if you ask me to write something better than Marks, I don't know what to say, except what I just said, which will help nobody. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what guidance?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, what?   Stephen G. Breyer  You talk about the French movie.  That was great -- I mean fine. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  There I say, you mean they really don't want to see The Philadelphia Story? They must be crazy.  All right. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  But -- but -- but -- but you see, if you have, of course, a real French comedy, fine.  But suppose you have -- to show off -- Mr. Hulot's Holiday, you know, it's a comedy, but is it romantic, you see. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  I mean, that's what law is about.  And now suddenly you want us to write a rule.  They -- they've done all right with Marks.  Leave it alone.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And say -- interpret it with common sense.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You say they're wrong.   Stephen G. Breyer  And then they say what's right, we don't tell them.   Stephen G. Breyer  In a (C) agreement, it says, the Commission, that the judge -- it's the judge who will depart if that's the agreement, and it says the agreed -- he has to write his reasons in writing as to why the agreed sentence ""departs from the applicable guideline range"" for justifiable reasons. So, if the guideline range is 120 months, he says why it departs from that, and he has some reasons.  And if it's 100 months, he says why it departs from that. Now, much of the time, perhaps, I don't know for sure, but, of course, you are referring to the guideline.  And if the guideline is one thing, you might do A, and if it's another thing, you might do B.  And, certainly, you will have to say something different where the guideline is 100 versus 120.  Not certainly, but almost certainly. So why isn't that good enough? That's good enough to say that where the guideline's two levels lower, you know, you can get that advantage because your original sentence was in some sense based upon the guideline, namely, the sense that I just mentioned.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I don't know. All I have to know is what the judge would have done.  He's the one who departed and he had to put his -- you know, I'd just be --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- repeating what I said. So we know in every sentence like that there will be words about the applicable guideline.   Stephen G. Breyer  And much of the time, it will have something to do with the applicable guideline.  And why isn't that good enough?   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose we say you're absolutely right, and that's why the word ""based upon"" cannot just refer to these hypotheticals we know nothing about. Therefore, ""based upon"" refers to an instance where the judge made significant use of the guideline, either in his reasoning or in the reasons that he gave, which, of course, would throw this case right into the opposite side that you want.  But, nonetheless, it would be a workable rule, and we'd say ""based upon"" at least means that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In a (C) agreement, it would be because he has to write it down.   ",17-155X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  That may be, but that's -- that's exactly what I had as my question too, that it's not that -- you start -- you're down two tracks, it seemed to me. If you say the police officer is liable, if he really has animus, and the probable cause was not, you know, going to affect him, once you say that, you're into the hypothetical of the bar and all you've done is say the jury will decide all those questions. You get to the jury and the jury has a factual question.  That's true of the bar case.  That's true of a real riot where people are out insulting the police and they're breaking windows and burning cars.  And every one of those cases goes to the jury. Then you started down a different track, which is absolutely true.  That's not this situation.  This situation is someone sitting calmly behind the desk in the middle of the -- of the meeting, not somebody out there in a bar or somebody worried about a real riot. Okay? Now do you want us to draw that line or not? And if you want us to draw that line, how? And if not, how do you deal with Justice Kennedy's hypothetical?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm sure it is, but unfortunately --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- in my mind, back of it, is the kind of hypothetical -- and it might be extremely hypothetical --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- but I would like an answer to that question.   Stephen G. Breyer  Which route do you want us to take?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But those are cases that have been brought.  What we're worried, obviously, is some kind of rule that will change what has been brought. In the back of my mind, to put sort of every card on the table, is I was thinking of what Justice Ginsburg wrote in a concurrence in Reichle.  Do you know that case?   Stephen G. Breyer  Of course.   Stephen G. Breyer  Reichle.  I don't know.   Stephen G. Breyer  Sorry.  I'm not very good on pronunciation. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  But -- but in Reichle, Justice Ginsburg wrote a concurrence that I joined that tried to draw a separation between cases like yours and the cases that Justice Kennedy and I had been most concerned about, the riot cases, et cetera. Now -- now what do you think of that?   Stephen G. Breyer  You've got the facts. Of course, your case is quite different from what's worrying me and what's worrying me and I think Justice Kennedy perhaps, and that is imagine a serious riot situation.  They exist. And in that riot situation, where the police have a problem because there's a sub-gang and the sub-gang is going around breaking windows and setting fire to things, they can't arrest everybody in the sub-gang. There are too many of them.  Okay? So it's not going to be true that the Mt. Healthy, it would have happened anyway, works because it doesn't work.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it will because they wouldn't have been arrested.  There are six members of the gang and four policemen with affidavits saying we could only arrest four people. Then we have seven more affidavits which say, I saw the look on that policeman's face as soon as we called him a pig.  All right? And I am certain that he would never have arrested this person for -- who after all was just lighting a match.  He might have had a cigarette. And -- and I'm certain he wouldn't have arrested him had it not been for the words that he heard.  And the policeman had to make a split-second decision, and I don't know. Now that's a -- that's the subset that he means, I think, by a bar.  Okay? So is there some words in this opinion that would favor you hypothetically that would wall off that case from decision now?   ",17-21XX
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  If that doesn't -- if that doesn't work, what you started out, and I wanted to hear your answer, and this is just one add to the mix, but the mix, it seems to me, consists, for the bar and riot cases, et cetera, one, they say start with the Mt. Healthy framework.  Two, you have Iqbal. Three, you have qualified immunity. Justice Gorsuch added what he just said to that.  And I would add and the officer, it's a special situation, which either we don't reach or it's okay or you use the Fourth Amendment or whatever, where the officer must make singularly swift on-the-spot decisions and the safety of persons or property is at issue. Okay? Now suppose -- I don't see anything too terrible about writing those.  And what harm would be done? You would, of course, lose your case, which I consider perhaps you would consider a serious harm, but -- (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  -- but -- but none -- none -- none -- nonetheless, what -- what harm would happen to the interests that you've heard articulated?   Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't mean it as a five- or six- or seven-factor test.  What I really meant you to focus on was the last one because I've heard discussion on the others, and that is the police officer does have the immunity that they search in the situation where -- and I could repeat it, but maybe you wrote it down -- but it's -- it's that -- well, I'll repeat it if you want.  Where there is a singular need for a swift on-the-spot decision and where there is involved the safety of persons or property.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you say that, not on-the-spot, and you also say here they're suing a person who is not a policeman.  And so they have to show the causal connection. So the causal connection is, again, as Justice Ginsburg said, and I said in Reichle is -- is significant.  It matters.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And, therefore, since you have to show the causal connection between this decision and the other person who is the policeman, it doesn't really affect the police.   ",17-21XX
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I don't -- I don't know if you want to --   Stephen G. Breyer  I see the problem, I think, but what I don't see yet -- maybe I just have to go back and study it -- is -- is your answer to Justice Gorsuch's question, which has been bothering me on both sides.  They're with you on this, you know, but I look at the language of the statute, and the statute says: ""A government entity may require the disclosure by a provider of electronic communication only pursuant to a warrant issued using the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.""   Stephen G. Breyer  Right?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what it says.   Stephen G. Breyer  So then I go to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and there the first thing I discover is you ask a magistrate, and it says: ""A magistrate judge with authority in the district has authority to issue a warrant to search for and seize a person or property located within the district."" All right? Now, so that's what you did.  You went to this person, a magistrate, I think.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, you went to the district judge?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So it's the same problem.  It's the same -- isn't it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  But is that what you did? What did you do here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Okay.  Second question is -- maybe it's not this case, but what happens if you go to Microsoft and you ask, say, some for -- for some bank records that are in Italy, and, in fact, Italy does have a law, we imagine, which says absolutely no bank record can be taken by any other person without some special thing under the MLAT or something.   Stephen G. Breyer  And what happens then?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So what is the answer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So the answer is that, which many amici suggest to us, that what should be done in such a case is you go to the magistrate or the judge and you say, judge, I want you to look at the factors of comity. And one of them will be, if there is --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- which you say is not here --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- this Italian law, if there is --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- which says you can't bring it.   Stephen G. Breyer  So you -- so perhaps there's agreement, we'll see, about what should be done, and this new law proposes that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Right.   INTERRUPTING ",17-2XXX
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Just -- there are two parts to this in my mind.  One is the language, which I'll have to work my way through.  You heard the answer to that. The other is a practical way of dealing with the foreign law.  Now the government suggested what's impractical about this, in any situation where, say, Microsoft thinks that there really is a problem here because of a foreign law, which might forbid it or a variety of reasons, what you do is you -- Microsoft goes to the magistrate and says, look, there's a problem here because of the law of other countries, because of this, because of that, and the magistrate takes that into account. That sounds to me like a -- and then maybe Congress will pass this and we'll have standards in it and it'll be much more helpful. But -- but even without that, what's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  You're giving a conceptual answer, which I think is fine, but -- but I want to know, if the language permits it, can we read this statute to adapt to the modern condition and, if we can, then shouldn't we do it that way, because it would be practical.  Everybody would get a fair shot.  You'd take foreign interests into account.  Maybe you'd use Aerospatiale standards.  One brief tells us they're not good enough, but it didn't say what we should use, but -- but the -- the -- the -- you see my question practically?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  If your -- I'm going to ask a technical thing to help me with that, and do it -- no more than 15 seconds.   Stephen G. Breyer  What I did is I -- I looked at the warrant which is in the record, and it's signed by James Francis, Magistrate Judge, Southern District, New York.  Is that right?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So then I went over to Rule 41, and I assumed it fell within (b), (a), or, what is it, it's -- it's (b)(1). Am I right or is it -- do you know that well enough in your head?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, if it fell within (b)(1), it says that Mr. Francis, Judge Francis, has authority to issue a warrant to search for and seize a property located within the district. So that's how I got in by -- into my linguistic problem of -- what's the answer?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- and it says you're ""only pursuant to a warrant issued using the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.""   Stephen G. Breyer  So I said what's a warrant? It's Judge Francis's warrant.  He's in the Southern District of New York.  I went to Rule 41, and there 41(b)(1), which -- you see?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  So -- so what's the answer to that? The answer says that Judge Francis -- this says that Judge Francis has authority to issue a warrant to search for property in New York.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But you didn't make much of a point of this in your brief. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  And so I suspect that -- that -- that it just can't be that easy, this case.   INTERRUPTING ",17-2XXX
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Suppose it didn't.  I mean, that's the question you're being asked.  I mean, suppose that shackling a person, arms and legs, before -- when he goes before the magistrate does not affect the outcome of his trial where he wasn't shackled. All right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's certainly possible.   Stephen G. Breyer  The first thing you ask or would be in that case, the appeals court says: What's the prejudice? There's no prejudice to his outcome.  Fine.  How does he raise the issue?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's not the question I asked you.  I asked you, how does he raise the issue?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So you're saying if, in fact -- it wouldn't -- I'm being very hypothetical, absolutely hypothetical.  I don't believe it would ever happen.  But if, by some chance, they have a policy in a court, a federal court of the United States, that people will come in bound and gagged in body armor, hung upside down, okay, you're saying even if that's so, that person in this country has no way of challenging that order.  Is that your point? And if that is not your point, what does he have by way of procedure to challenge the order?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't ask you that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I asked you, what does apply?   Stephen G. Breyer  If they could get mandamus in that case, why can't they ask for mandamus in this case, where, after all, he has been bound without an opportunity -- they bind everybody, arms and legs? Now you can say: Well, he won't win.  I don't know.  Maybe he will win. But that's your point, they should ask for mandamus?   Stephen G. Breyer  But is that -- is that definite? I mean, is it -- is it the case that -- that where, for example, nobody ever thought anybody would do anything like this --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- to a prisoner, but they do something really terrible, but it isn't absolutely clear.  And now you're saying because it isn't absolutely clear, there's no remedy whatsoever.  Is that what you're saying?   Stephen G. Breyer  I know --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- but my -- my question is procedural.   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm still trying to get an answer.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Many cases are not absolutely clear.  And I want to be sure what you're telling me is there is no remedy.   Stephen G. Breyer  Who do they say --   Stephen G. Breyer  Who do they say --   Stephen G. Breyer  How? Who do you sue? And -- I mean, it's not a 1983 action.  This is federal.   Stephen G. Breyer  You sue the individual marshals, there may be an immunity, In re Neagle, et cetera.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Who do you sue?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Do you sue the judge? The magistrate.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Against the marshal?   Stephen G. Breyer  Fine, but what is the cause of action? A Bivens action?   Stephen G. Breyer  A direct -- so that's a Bivens action?   Stephen G. Breyer  So the lawsuit hasn't been brought before.  And if it unfortunately, perhaps, or fortunately -- look, the Court has held we're not creating new Bivens actions.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So -- so are you sure that you can bring a Bivens action against the individual marshal? What is it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What is it?   Stephen G. Breyer  An Ex parte Young suit.  Great.  Thank you.   Stephen G. Breyer  Thank you.  Thank you.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is --   Stephen G. Breyer  You've withdrawn -- the United States has withdrawn the policy.  If you win, though, will you reinstate it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Why -- why is it -- if a -- if a person is denied bail and -- by the magistrate and he thinks that was unlawful, what's his remedy there?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Because it's collateral order?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, why is this different?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You've said -- you've said several times, but if you would just summarize the main reasons why it's different.   Stephen G. Breyer  I got that point, but the -- the analogy that I was thinking of is after all, you deny bail, the person's liberty is constrained, he is in a cell.   Stephen G. Breyer  And, here, the person's liberty is constrained.  He is in a shackle.  And both are fairly important to him. And -- but the difference, you say, is you can continue with the proceedings.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I don't know there.  I mean --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- there the person's in a cell and here the person's in physical shackles.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I -- I'm not sure about that.   ",17-312X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What about their --   Stephen G. Breyer  But the government has said, I think, if I interpret it correctly, that, of course, you have a right to challenge this policy.  But there are three ways that you can do it. One way is when you appeal a conviction, the person says: And one other thing that hurt me in this process was the shackle before the magistrate. The second way is, if this is an extreme case, you're entitled to mandamus.  But he thinks it's not an extreme case. The third way is you get your client and, with a group of others, you bring an Ex parte Young action, which is actually the most straightforward, and you challenge the policy against the Marshals Service and you say just what you've said. So I guess now my question is going the opposite of where I was, is why not use one of those three? At least if you brought all three, one of them should work because, of course, you should have a method of challenging the policy.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So we're -- at the moment, it's very interesting and helpful, but I'm thinking if we -- if we -- if we go with you on mootness, I don't know what door that's opening up because it's really not moot because there are other people that will be subjected to it, not your clients. Then I'm thinking: Well, if we go on the mandamus, I'm going to hear just what I heard, that there are a bunch of districts that have this and it isn't as far out as my imaginary example. And then, if I go on collateral order, I'm going to run into the problem that we just said, that this would delay the proceeding rather than his like being in bail.  And then they say: But bring an Ex parte Young action, that's fine. And -- and how long would that take? I mean, you find five people down there who are going to be subject to it, and you go into court, we already have the orders, and there we are, we win. Okay.  How -- how long -- I mean, is it -- am I thinking -- you don't think I'm thinking correctly on this.  And I guess I want to know what --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, they say Ex parte Young.   Stephen G. Breyer  Is this -- What's the difference --   Stephen G. Breyer  Go back to the merits for a second.  I'm just curious, because I did have to write this case of the shackling before.   Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and there's a full page, more than a page, of citations that are not simply from Blackstone, but almost all of them are from American courts, and the conclusion is trial courts -- that what they show, for like a century, is trial courts may not shackle defendants routinely but only if there is a particular reason to do so.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now were those all jury cases? I don't remember.  Were they all -- I mean, I know that there's a magistrate here and it isn't a -- it isn't a district court judge, but magistrate judges are in courtrooms.  But did all those cases involve juries? Do you know?   Stephen G. Breyer  Do you know if Blackstone was, in fact, just talking about jury cases or if --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

And I think you're right when you -- when you -- the same theme maybe but variations, and obviously the problem is what you started with. It seems like a -- a pretty clear violation of the -- the Constitution in some form to have deliberate, extreme gerrymandering.  The Court said things like that.  But is there a practical remedy that won't get judges involved in every -- or dozens and dozens and dozens of very important political decisions? All right.  What would you think of taking the three cases and setting them for reargument on the question of standing and there we'd have all three variations in front of us and we would enable people who have an interest in this subject generally to file briefs, and we'd see them all together and they could attack each other's standards or they could support each other's standards or they could attack any standard? But there we'd have right in front of us the possibilities as -- as -- as thought through by lawyers and others who have an interest in this subject.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I raise it not for that reason.  I raise it because I want to think if there's some harm in doing that that I haven't thought of.  Is there some reason -- would it be harmful to somebody? Because I do see an advantage.  You could have a blackboard and have everyone's theory on it, and then you'd have the pros and cons and then you'd be able to look at them all and then you'd be able see perhaps different ones for different variations and, you know, that's -- maybe there are different parts of gerrymandering that rises in different circumstances, dah-dah-dah.  You see the point.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  You can't think of a reason not to do it?   ",17-333X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Competitive, the -- the -- the idea that's being advanced is extreme gerrymandering.  Okay? A hundred percent is extreme.  No other reason for doing this other than partisanship.  That's an example of extreme gerrymandering. And the election result changed. That's an example of harm.  And there is nothing else put forward, okay, except you did put something forward: There's been gerrymandering in the past, we're trying to cure it.  Something like that.  We've seen that in other cases.  Okay.  Say no.  The last reason is not good enough.  You have to start somewhere. Second, there is an example of an effect.  And, three, it's 100 percent partisan. That's the reason.  That's extreme. Now could we say that? Yes, I think we could.  But the problem is that's not going to solve other cases and we'll never have such a record again.  I mean, the people who do the gerrymandering are not stupid. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and they will never have such a record.  And, therefore, we will not do much to deal with a problem of serious dimensions that is national.  All right? So what do we do? Just say good-bye? Forget it? And, as, you know, you've read these briefs, if you think what's happened now is something, wait until you see those computers really working.  You've read that. I've read it. Okay.  What do you think?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Say equal protection law.  You get to the same place, you see, because we have 100 percent here, or that's -- the record could be read that way, get to the same place. That's why I was thinking you've got to get all these standards lined up together, you know, and you have to have people criticizing each one back and forth and see if any of them really will work or some work in some cases and some work in other cases and it depends on the type you have. I mean -- I mean, that -- that isn't squarely addressed by the lawyers because they're focused on their one case, et cetera.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What do you think?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, it said --   Stephen G. Breyer  Now here is the -- here it is, I think, if my clerk got it right. Are you for or are you against the following text: Establishes the boundaries for the State's eight United States congressional districts based on recent Census figures, as required by the United States Constitution?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- I mean, it doesn't even tell you there what establishes it.  I mean, what -- (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  Notice.  Have you -- do you read all of the notice -- I mean, maybe.   Stephen G. Breyer  I got that point, but I have a different question --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- which is -- I haven't thought of, and I -- so you may have it.  I have not thought of the answer to this question. Let's suppose that you do have 100 percent district drawn to help the Democrats, and suppose also in the next election the Democrat was elected, not the Republican. Now, if you said that was unconstitutional, and there's no other reason given, all right, now, in other words, extreme. If that's the holding of the court -- I'm not saying it would be, I'm just saying assume it -- how would that hurt independents? Is there a way that would hurt independent voters? That holding.

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  What happens generally if a tribe buys land or -- or thinks it owns land in downtown Tulsa or New York City or any other place off the reservation and they -- they send members of the tribe there and somehow they're in possession of at least part of it.  How is that dispute resolved?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what worries me is if there is sovereign immunity --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- and if members of the tribe acting for the tribe obtain property, they -- they -- they have a building or an empty lot or somewhere, and they're -- they're there and there's another person who believes he owns the property or the lot, the building, and so there are two different people, the tribe and another group, both of which thinks they own a lot in New York City or Tulsa. How is that dispute resolved? Normally, we resolve it in a court.  But how, in your opinion, will the dispute -- how has it been resolved? What I'm thinking of is I joined a case saying there was broad sovereign immunity.   Stephen G. Breyer  I thought Congress would act, but it hasn't.  And tribes have business interests all over the country, all over the place.  And how are they resolved?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.  So that's why I asked my question.  Property disputes are fairly common, and they -- you could get into really bad situations where the only resolution is force.  That's why we have courts. And I want to know how are they resolved, how should they be resolved, if you can't sue the tribe?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not talking about taxes.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  But, there's sovereign immunity -- look, Joe Smith owns an empty lot next door to his house.  One morning, because of some tribal legacy or something, he wakes up and finds members of the tribe there next to him on the lot. He says: I own the lot next to my house.  I have my swimming pool there.  He's quite wealthy. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  The tribe members say: No, this is ours. Now how is that dispute -- since that decision that I joined, how is that dispute, kind of dispute which could arise all over the place, how has it been resolved? I can't believe there is no such thing in some form.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, no, I don't know if they're frivolous.  But suppose they are. Suppose they are.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why doesn't the tribe -- how do you get around sovereign immunity if they are frivolous?   Stephen G. Breyer  Suppose you just said: Well, the tribe, being of the dignity of a sovereign, has the same kind of immunity as a sovereign nation would have?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I don't know. A sovereign nation, I think since about 1750, there's been an exception for a sovereign nation for immovable property.  And, therefore, if the nation of Canada comes and -- and has a piece of land in North Dakota and the person who lives there says, I'm sorry, this belongs to me, not to Canada, and Canada says no, my understanding was there has been a long-standing exception to sovereign immunity.   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, you say it's been made --   Stephen G. Breyer  But it doesn't say in the -- in the -- I mean, my law clerk has here, which I guess he got out of the briefs, I don't know, we have Vattel, Cornelius Van Bynkershoek in 1744, as well as Lauterpacht, who's certainly big authority.  They don't talk about exceptions.  They just say a prince -- that's Bynkershoek -- he says -- he says -- or maybe it's the other one -- he says in -- in sovereign -- several sovereigns have fiefs and other possessions in the territory of another prince.  In such case -- cases, they hold them in the manner of private individuals. And then we have Vattel and all these others, and they say the same thing really. They don't talk about exceptions or not exceptions.  So, if you were to have a quiz, what was the law of sovereign immunity in 1760, you know, I guess you'd have to say the law is that the prince buys a department store in Iowa, I'm sorry, he's just like another Iowan.   Stephen G. Breyer  So -- so what -- what -- I mean, Kiowa was 20 years ago.  I did really think Congress would do something.  It's done nothing.  All right. So, in the meantime, tribes, not necessarily this one, but many tribes have business interests all over the country.  And -- and so how -- how -- how do these in practice -- how are they getting resolved if there's sovereign immunity all over the place? What happens?   ",17-387X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Look, sending it back -- sending it back, I think it is a -- we could try to decide it or we could say: Review, not first view, all right? So one of the things -- ways in my mind is this, that reading the words ""immunity from suit"" broadly, extending where not even Canada would dare to go, all right, there's a lot of language in cases that does say that.  So I'm pretty curious, whether anyone else is, but I'm pretty curious, for the last 20 years, how have things gone? I mean, Congress hasn't acted.  Tribes are in business across the country.  There must have been controversies.  What's actually happened? And -- and one argument for leaving things alone is we've all survived.  And an argument the other way is it's very anomalous to give the tribes more immunity than foreign countries would have.  All right. So why shouldn't we send it back and get all this out on the table and, you know, we -- we have the views of other courts and we also have a more extensive set of arguments?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That might be fair. I mean, I see in terms of fairness between the parties, but we have, you know, a dozen tribes and the National Congress of -- of American Indians and so forth, they all have an interest in this. And they'd have to say squarely why should tribes have more immunity than Canada, Mexico, whatever, and -- and I don't know that they've addressed that squarely.  Now they -- and that's -- that's -- that's what's sort of moving me, to tell you the truth.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's on your side. But do you think there -- there are also people on their side?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G.

That's okay because they all wrote out the complaint, right?   ",17-432X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  What about after -- I'm sorry.   Stephen G. Breyer  He says it's, I think, I think, and I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I think let us focus on someone like me, a common person.  What you do is you sit home, you go to your office, and one day this complicated letter comes, and it says: There is a class action being filed, did you buy some pencils from so and so during a period of time? And if so, you are entitled to some damages.  And do you know what I do about that? Nothing.  It tells me I have a right to opt out.  Nothing.  Do I finish reading it? No. All right.  Now think of people who are like that.  Now what happens is that first letter came in plenty of time to file a suit. Then there was a class action.  Then it got dismissed. Then some individual people filed because they were tolled.  Now he's saying: Let's look back to that common person there. You know what he did the second time? Nothing. Did he read the letter? No.  Did he throw it in the wastebasket? Probably. All right.  So, as to that, he is saying, it is not equitable to give that person who didn't even read the letter a second chance again to be a person who didn't read the letter. I think -- I think that's something like what the argument is.   Stephen G. Breyer  Do you -- perhaps -- all right.  So your response is, if I understand this correctly, to my worry I said, well, I sit up in the -- you know, with my pencils and whatever, and I sit up in the attic and I never read my mail and -- and dah, dah, dah, and you can bring the class action, and I get rewarded even though I've never really done much of anything, and I've done it. And you say: Well, why does that solve -- why do -- why does my claim survive the running of the statute of limitations? And your response to that is, well, you behaved no worse the second time than you did the first time and that the reasons for giving you this reward are exactly the same, they are no different, because it really had nothing to do with time.  It had to do with the desirability of allowing small claims to be recognized.  Do I have that correct?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  They are.   Stephen G. Breyer  So you're saying --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You're saying that, and his -- his -- what they have to show is, well, why is it worse the second time than it was the first time?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Is that right?   ",17-432X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  But it doesn't go -- wait -- wait just a second, because I -- I might be missing this.  I don't see anywhere in this order, which is in your Joint Appendix Volume 2 -- you must be telephone number 1 or telephone number 2?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Were you telephone number 1 or number 2, one of those two?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I know that, but I mean for purposes of this order.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now where does it say in this order in respect to telephone number 1 or telephone number 2 that they can intercept within the jurisdiction of the issuing magistrate?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what I'm on.   Stephen G. Breyer  And it says -- it doesn't say anything about -- it talks about outside the territorial jurisdiction in the one -- in the relevant full paragraph on page 97. I don't see here anywhere. I mean, if what you said was true, why didn't you challenge this on the ground that it's insufficient because it does not claim or put in words that, in respect to telephone number 1 and telephone number 2, you have authority to intercept within the jurisdiction of the issuing magistrate, which I think was New York, wasn't it, or was it?   Stephen G. Breyer  Kansas.  In Kansas.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Where does it say they have jurisdiction to intercept in Kansas?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No.   Stephen G. Breyer  No.  Read the paragraph.  It says in the -- in the event that they are transported outside the territorial jurisdiction of the court, interception may take place in any other jurisdiction within the United States. It nowhere says that you have authority to interpret -- to intercept in Kansas.  Does it?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I take from your hesitation it does not.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Implicit that it says other --   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But aside from those words.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.   Stephen G. Breyer  The reason -- see, I -- I can't ask my question because you've stopped me cold; that is, what I thought was that we'd have an order which says you can tap in Kansas and you can also tap outside of Kansas. And I find the paragraph which says you can tap outside of Kansas.  Okay? But I can't find the paragraph which says you can tap in Kansas. So the first thing you say is, well, it's insufficient if an order does not say you can tap in Kansas -- yeah, that's what you cite, you just said that -- and so I never thought of that. And -- but, lo and behold, I never thought of it, although I read the briefs in this case, and I read the opinion below, and they never said anything about it. So I started where the -- where -- where -- I think, I can't remember who asked the question, I started saying it doesn't have to say that because that's not listed in Title IV.  That's in Title III.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you see my puzzlement?   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Well, suppose I said this.  There is one paragraph here saying, which I just read you, which says you can tap outside of Kansas.  Your clients had nothing to do with that.  They were never outside or whatever.  Okay? So what we do is we excise that paragraph.  It's called severability.  Excise it and send the case back to see, with that paragraph excised, whether there's some other reason why this warrant could be good to go. What about that?   Stephen G. Breyer  But here's the problem that -- look, first, if I look at this, what that -- what you just pointed to says you have to have in this document the nature and location of where the authority to intercept is granted.  Doesn't it? Yes. You just pointed to that.  So I look at the last page and it says District of Kansas.  It says it.  The judge puts his title, District of Kansas.  There is the authority that that's what they want, exactly what you said, that's where the authority comes from, and Title III makes clear they can't go beyond that authority, except in some circumstances that are not present here. So what we have with the paragraph you're pointing to is an addition.  It says: In addition, you can go outside of Kansas. That is wrong.  And, by the way, they didn't go outside of Kansas insofar as your client is concerned and anything that was introduced into evidence is concerned. So everybody's instinct, or at least mine, to say, well, sever that, is -- maybe the judge wrote poetry on the wrong paper, you know? I mean, maybe he -- he -- he wrote down a joke.  Maybe he -- he wrote something that was totally extraneous that had nothing to do with the case. We wouldn't look at that; we'd just say forget it, it has nothing to do with this case.  And why shouldn't we do the same thing with this paragraph?   ",17-43XX
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  It does say --   Stephen G. Breyer  This was a new --   Stephen G. Breyer  I'm a little bit still worried about what we discovered at the outset, that at least they are claiming that this order has to say you have authority to wiretap in Kansas as well as outside. So it occurs -- there are two things which worry me.  The first, by the way, it does say in Kansas.  Where it says Kansas is under the signature of the district judge.   Stephen G. Breyer  So it may be that they're thinking, given 3, you know, given what you read us in -- on page 16a where it says a judge can within his territorial jurisdiction authorize a wiretap, that that's good enough. It says he's in Kansas.  It says in the statute that you can authorize it within the state you're in, and, therefore, we know this authorizes Kansas. Now they're going to say, if this were what the argument were about, that isn't good enough.  It should say: And you can do it. Now what I'm worried about is that there are thousands, that this is a -- this is a form and that there are thousands of wiretap orders perhaps throughout the country which do not say in district X; though it says I am a judge in district X, they do not say that you have authority to tap in district X in those words. I'm worried about that because I wouldn't like this case suddenly to cast doubt without argument, you know, full argument --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- on those thousands, if there are those thousands.  Do you know?   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  I got that.  I see that.  There's one other question I have, which is, since that wasn't fully argued, what do you say in response to their argument that these questions of severability and reading, et cetera, while very interesting, were not the subject of any argument below?   INTERRUPTING ",17-43XX

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  So why -- just in case -- I mean, it's possible we will agree with you.  I mean, it does say that the clock starts -- stops ticking when the alien is served a notice to appear under Section 12. Then you look at the section, and it says a notice to appear shall specify nine things, including the time and place at which you're supposed to appear. And in the government's view -- I looked at the notice to appear here -- every one of those things is included on the document, except not notice to appear -- I mean, where you're supposed to appear.  And that seems odd, but assume you're right. We then get to step 2 of Chevron, and step 2 says that the agency decision has to be reasonable.  So I looked for the reason. What's the reason that they don't want to put in a notice to appear? And I notice the former chairman of the BIA said there used to be a process called -- it was called interactive scheduling.   Stephen G. Breyer  It meant that a human being who was over at DHS would go to his computer, find out what dates were available, and fill them in the notice to appear. Now that wouldn't seem too tough.  We do have computers today.  It would seem to be possible.  And yet what he says, the former chairman, is it eventually fell out of use, that system.  And ""he does not know exactly why."" Okay.  So I think to have a reasonable agency decision you would have to say not just that there are other things that don't appear, that you say have to appear, but you'd have to have a reason why this, which says does appear, doesn't appear. So what is the reason?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, not because of the structure.  The -- the -- I mean, why did the DHS or the BIA or the EOIR or the DOJ --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- why did some group of those people stop doing --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- what would have eliminated the problem in this case?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Why?   Stephen G. Breyer  Why didn't it work?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  As to the third, could you not invent a system today that would, in fact, allow people to know what hearing dates were available? As to the second, I have no view.  I don't know why.  But as to the second and the first, where does it say that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  The question is you gave me three reasons.   Stephen G. Breyer  The third one I'm rather dubious about.  The first two I'm incapable of evaluating at the moment, so I want to know where those reasons appear.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  In what document shall I read the reasons that the BIA or whatever these organizations were, why they did change the old system, and I will find there what you just said, so I will be able to think about it, what document says that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, I didn't find those reasons there.  Are they there?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, it used to be -- there was a famous hot oil case, which you know, and they discovered that the reasons or the agency rule and so forth was in somebody's desk at the Interior Department and had never been published.  So are we to, in fact -- that was the end of that case, by the way.  But did -- did -- (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  Did -- did they, in fact, publish this anywhere? No is the answer. And so, if they don't really give a reason, and I have a hard time understanding it, am I -- is there a basis --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- on which I'm supposed to find it reasonable under Chevron's statute?   Stephen G. Breyer  Do you want to -- do you want to -- my questions were rather mean, but they were designed to uncover something.   Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and it is actually a very interesting question.  I didn't mean them to be so mean, I'm sorry, but -- but the -- the fact is that there is an interesting Chevron question that's difficult, and that is: How much of a reason does an agency have to give?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Can it just say something like not practical, which is denied by their former chairman? Do they have to go into it in some depth?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  To what extent do they have to? You see that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Because it's not just a rubber stamp job.   ",17-459X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  If that's your answer, isn't it normal that we treat a dormant Commerce Clause case the same way we treat statutes? I mean, I think the examples are legion.  Congress cannot overturn constitutional decisions, but, in the dormant Commerce Clause case, it's different, and of course they can, and of course they do. So I don't really see a difference there.  So what's the difference?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no, but the word constitutional is not magic.  The reason that we say we are more willing to overturn a constitutional case is because Congress can't act. But, here, they can act.  And, therefore, there is no reason for treating it specially.  What is the response to that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, we have briefs from three Senators and Congressman Goodlatte that says Congress was about to act.  And, indeed, what stopped them from acting was our decision to decide this case.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now that's -- that's their view of it.  And between whether they know or whether I know, I guess they have a better view.  They're members of Congress, and they point to many statutes.  And you are 50 states.  If you do not have the power to get Congress to do something, I don't know who would.   Stephen G. Breyer  Can I ask you the questions that I -- two or three brief questions? You answer them when you wish and if you wish. And the reason I'm asking like this is because I read through these briefs.  When I read your briefs, I thought absolutely right. And then I read through the other briefs, and I thought absolutely right.  And you cannot both be absolutely right. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  So why is it, one, you have wildly different estimates of costs, revenues, and what states are losing or not? How do I find -- and other -- and other things.  Can you do this on the Internet -- they say there are 12 mistakes, even in South Dakota, all right -- or not? That's Question 1.  How do I find out? You have a list here of I would say -- they do -- of six or eight really tough practical decisions, retroactivity, all kinds of things like that.  How do we deal with that? Okay? I would like to -- to -- to know the answer to that.  And you've already dealt with one, which is, well, I'll put it specifically: What's the standard? What's the standard? The government says physical presence. Huh? Any? What? Okay.  So those were my three questions.  Anytime you want to deal with them or if you want to deal with them, do so.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But the one --   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  But, look, the part that's bringing me there, which I really think we can't do after reading these briefs, is what they -- their side puts up a certain specter which I'm sensitive to, which is that we have four or maybe five giant potential retailers in the country; I mean, there could be a very small number selling virtually anything.  And they sell over the Internet.  And the hope of preventing oligopoly, et cetera, is small business, which finds it easy to enter. Now you raise with this entry barriers, and they say a lot and you say a little.  And I don't know if it's a little or if it's a lot.  And if it is a lot, there might be ways of putting minimums in that would, in fact, preserve the possibility of competition and the possibility of new entry, stopping the entry barriers from raising too high. Now that's something the Antitrust Division could testify about, but they're not going to testify here.  And so that's the kind of problem that worries me.   Stephen G. Breyer  Oh, is that it?   Stephen G. Breyer  But where -- what Complete Auto is, it's -- it's a nexus such that the benefits of state revenue do not outweigh the compliance costs associated with the tax collection obligations that the state has imposed. Now that seems like a sensible test, until I suddenly think of 10,000 cases being brought by 20,000 lawyers on one side and another 20,000 on the other to decide jurisdiction by jurisdiction, case by case about whether that test is met. Now that's -- that's -- that's why -- that was my problem with Complete Auto.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's true.   Stephen G. Breyer  That's a very good point.   ",17-494X

I mean, for example, go to the website, which I went to, that they recommend, and it seems easy to determine what the sales tax was.  And you say: But, my God, even 12 mistakes in South Dakota. And, moreover, there are 10,000 different ones, and you try to do that and you get it wrong, and either the state assesses $500 penalty for every mistake, which is billions or, you know, a lot, and -- or the class action lawyers sue you for having paid too much.  All right? Your brief is filled with that kind of thing. Their brief says: You know, even if we don't have perfect software, we can develop it.  It's not so hard.  And when there's a demand for it, we'll do it, and it'll be easy. And you say: It's going to cost thousands and thousands of dollars for a small business, maybe all their profits eaten up in hiring accountants.  They say: That won't be necessary.  We'll do it on software. And, hey, they're not going to -- and do it -- overrule prospectively.  Okay? Both are logical.  How do I decide who's right?   Stephen G. Breyer  You may know the answer -- you may know the answer, but, I mean, with all these numbers, I mean, one part of the answer to that in my mind or, not an answer, but help resolve it, is what does it cost for a mandolin seller who sells mandolins on the Internet to sell them in 50 states? How much does it cost him to enter that market? How much did it cost Sears, Roebuck? You know, that's an ancient name, but they did all right. (Laughter.)   Stephen G. Breyer  And, by the way, how much does it cost Amazon voluntarily to comply? And I -- I mean, see, there are empirical questions that I think are -- would help me reach an answer.  And if you know them, tell me.  No one asked Amazon.  What does it cost Amazon? What does it cost the mandolin saler -- seller? What are the -- are there differences? I don't know.

0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Well, what is he supposed to say? He did give reasons.  He says having considered such motion -- that's your motion -- and taking into account the policy statements set forth at U.S. Sentencing Guideline, dah, dah, 1B1.10, and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a), to the extent they're applicable, I reduce the sentence to 114 months. All right? He gave a reason.  That's the reason.  Now what else is he supposed to say?   Stephen G. Breyer  No, no.  What -- what else is he supposed to say?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So we have in the record what -- what he did.  That isn't a problem.  And -- and judges do when they choose -- that's why I've never understood the part of -- what they do is they look at the crime and they look at the defendant and have a range here, and they select the point that they think is appropriate. What else can you say besides that?   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, then I don't know why.   Stephen G. Breyer  They say, I -- I've seen a lot of cases.  I -- I -- I see what -- I look at the conduct.  I look at the defendant. And this is what strikes me as appropriate. And now what else? I mean, you could not tell -- that's the truth of the matter.  So what else can he say besides that that is truthful?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  He says, I considered it.  How do you consider it? What you do is you read it and you think about it.  What else?   Stephen G. Breyer  Like what? You -- you've had a lot of experience probably with sentencing cases, much more than I have.  All right? So let's take an original sentencing. And the reason there is -- is -- there is discretion within the range is because what judges used to do, and typically do, is they just decide.  You know, there's -- there's nothing you can say. All right.  So -- but they're supposed to.  So what do they say, what kinds of things?   Stephen G. Breyer  What Rita did say on this point, I think -- point within the guidelines that applied, the whole paragraph, which you didn't really have time to read, but the paragraph there talks about sometimes a judicial opinion responds to every argument; sometimes it does not. Sometimes a judge simply writes the word ""granted"" or ""denied"" on the face of the motion; other times the -- and the reasons make everything clear.  Sometimes they leave -- the law leaves much in this respect to the judge's own professional judgment. You have a borderline case.  I mean, I -- I don't know whether more should be called for.  And that's why I was looking around of a way of resolving this.  And it seemed to me one way to resolve it would be to say you can write pretty minimally, but the court of appeals can ask for more if they need to.   Stephen G. Breyer  You do? (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING ",17-5639
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Can you explain --   Stephen G. Breyer  You did at the beginning -- I mean, there is something I don't understand about this.  I -- I tend to agree with you that if we suddenly start saying you have -- I mean, I've seen hundreds, if not thousands, of -- of district court decisions which take the following form: Motion for summary judgment denied, okay, or motion for this or that denied. And if we're suddenly going to say, well, this has to have more than that word ""denied,"" I don't know what's going to happen. So I tended to follow what Justice Sotomayor said.  Sometimes the court of appeals would say we need to know more and sometimes they wouldn't. But I think what he's arguing, and I may be missing something, is that the statute says in 3553(c)(1) that if the sentence is within the guideline range and it exceeds 24 months, the court at the time of sentencing shall state in open court the reason for imposing sentence at a particular point within the range. Now it doesn't say that when you're reconsidering.   Stephen G. Breyer  But it does say it at the beginning.  And so the background rule isn't that you don't have to give a reason. The background rule is just what I read. So how does it work?   Stephen G. Breyer  I want to know how it works and, after all, if that's the rule, if I'm right that that is the rule, how do they do it, and shouldn't you have whatever they have to do there the same here?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, here is a statute.  I'm saying -- my question is, how does that work in the ordinary sentencing case where we've all said, gee, sometimes you just can't say more.  Well, the statute seems to say more. And then, if it -- whatever that is, why shouldn't it be the same here? And I think what they're saying is you don't have to say it's the same if it's proportional because it's obvious.  But if it isn't proportional, it isn't obvious. And so you should have to say something.  Okay.  So what is the --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- response? What is the response?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  Right.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's right.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, yeah, right. I'm only interested in the particular point within the range.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah, but I guess that's peculiar.  What's the reason for that? Judge, when you give a sentence of 18 to 24 -- you know, the guideline is 108 to 122 months. You pick out 114.  And you have to give your reason for the particular point. But if you do precisely the same thing on resentencing, you don't.  But why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So can we do this -- can we do --   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  It --   Stephen G. Breyer  I just want to go back for a second to Taylor.  My understanding is that Taylor is speaking generally in 1988, and it's considering the Speedy Trial Act. Subsequent to that, I believe we decided a case called Rita.  And I thought in Rita, we addressed specifically this question at an original sentencing.  And what we said, yes, there has to be some explanation, but the length, the detail -- when it's within the guideline, not outside the guideline, and I think that was the intent of the Commission. Outside the guideline, you better explain it.  Inside the guideline, in this range, it says, that the statute or precedent does not insist upon a full opinion in every case.  The sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the arguments and has a reasoned basis, but the length, the detail, the content, even when to write is basically up to the judge. Then, when the judge does that, if the appellate court needs more, it can ask for more.  Now I thought that was what Rita -- but I haven't looked at it in a long time -- so I thought that's what Rita was saying. And -- but there's nothing -- is there anything wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Well, I hope it was consistent.  But if it wasn't consistent, it is the later case and does deal specifically with sentencing guidelines, as opposed to dealing with the Speedy Trial Act.   INTERRUPTING ",17-5639

1,"Stephen G. Breyer  I see that point.  I see -- I have a very basic question.  And I think your argument is perhaps the refutation of it.  But I think the guidelines are not the tax code, despite the continuous effort necessary to number after number after number. So -- but I'm not saying you shouldn't do it.  You have to.  But -- but the -- the -- the fact is here the guide -- the Commission made a simple decision and so did Congress. The drug guidelines were too high, so we're going to lower them two points.  And we want people to be resentenced.  If it has really anything to do with that, I'm saying based upon read it broadly, why?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Because there's only one person who knows really what that was based upon, and that's the district judge who put the sentence.  And we can't psychoanalyze him. And we try to proceed case-by-case in three kinds of instances.  One, he used the guidelines.  That's easy. Two, he departed from the guidelines. Was he looking at it when he departed? I don't know.  He knows. Three, this kind of case, departure from the statutory minimum. Now, since we're never going to know, really, and all we have to do if you read it broadly ""based upon,"" is send it back so that judge himself or herself can resentence.  And, by the way, Judge, when you resentence, if the guidelines had nothing to do with this, don't change the sentence. Now that seems to be practical, prevents every case from trying to psychoanalyze the judge, prevents us from hearing appeal after appeal like the appellate courts would certainly have to, and, anyway, this is, you know, common sense as to how they're supposed to work.  Does the statute permit it? Yes.  Because the statute says: Judge, in the departures, you start with the guideline. Because the statute says here: Judge, in the language he read, you start with the guideline.  Now maybe some won't.  Maybe some will never use it and maybe somebody will say 60 months no matter what. Good.  You, Judge, want to do that. Do it on remand, do it when you reconsider, if it's legal.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now that's a very simple -- you see, it's -- it's a little complicated to say, but you see what I'm doing?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  What's your response?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, your -- your -- your -- your -- I sometimes speak more broadly than I should.  I don't mean really carry in a psychoanalyst.  What I really mean is you look at all these things he wrote in different things and try and put it together.  Nor do I mean in every case they wanted to lower it. They wanted to lower it in these cases.  That's -- that's -- you're right about that.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I still have the same question.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not saying that. I'm saying send it back to the judge because he or she is the one who knows whether this was really significantly influenced by the guidelines or not, and, therefore, you can -- they -- the judge can impose the sentence he really wants to impose.   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, if you're -- you're right about that, but then the guidelines and policy statements, which is what it says, have all kinds of things in them, including negative things.  You shouldn't do this.  You can't do that. And my thought is, once we go down the road that you're saying, which is examining, as you've done, a sentencing transcript in case after case, that way lies a kind of legal perdition because did he -- did the judge, for example, do the thing or did he think of doing the thing which the guideline says you shouldn't do? And -- and you see the complexity of second-guessing that seems worse, perhaps, from the point of view of what Congress would have wanted, if they'd thought of it --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  -- than giving ""based upon the guidelines and policy statements"" a pretty broad meaning.   Stephen G. Breyer  Quite right.   INTERRUPTING ",17-5716
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I mean, that's --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  You weren't ordered. I mean, that's the problem.  When I became a judge in 1981, one of the first things that I was told by the preexisting -- Lee Kemp, he said, when you get an appeal, they are appealing from a piece of paper called a judgment, or they are appealing from a piece of paper that says injunction motion denied, or possibly granted. What does the piece of paper say here? It seems to me the piece of paper says come to court.  Now, if we're going to call that a grant of an injunction, we're going to hear 50,000 appeals from the 93 -- however many three-judge courts there are.  And it also says, when you come to court, have a plan. Now I grant you there won't be 90,000 appeals; there will only be 40,000.  But -- but, still, you see the point.  What is the order, the sentence, the piece of paper that says injunction denied or says injunction granted from which there is an appeal?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I didn't say magic word.  I said, what is the piece of paper, the order? Read it to me.  It probably only has four words, and it is, in effect, saying -- is it the one that says stay denied? Stay granted? Produce some papers? You see what I'm driving at?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  That's it.  It is the order.  You are ordered to consult with mapdrawers.  All right? That is an injunction. Now, if that's an injunction, that's my concern.  If you're going to call that an injunction, you are ordered to consult with mapdrawers, unless some other thing happens. All right? Now why won't that open the door to you are ordered to be in court tomorrow morning? You are ordered to produce a witness? Okay? That's what I'm worried about.   ",17-586X
1,"Stephen G. Breyer  Yes, but there's a way.  What's bothering me here, as I said, is not this case, but there are appeals and injunctions in millions of cases. So the judge says: I've written an opinion which says just what you say.  The lawyer for the state says: Your Honor, we respectfully disagree with that opinion.  We are going to go ahead and have the election, unless you enter an order, an injunction, which I think you shouldn't do, but you enter an order, an injunction forbidding us from doing so. Now, when that piece of paper is entered, at that point, of course, there is an appeal.  Now, once you say the practical effects test, I haven't found a case with that. Not even Carson.  There was an injunction in Carson in the settlement plan. I found no case.  Now maybe you'll tell us some.  People have used the word ""practical effects,"" but suddenly, when we stop that without an injunction and adopt that, what happens to the 4 million cases in the U.S. courts?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Three days.   Stephen G. Breyer  What -- what is the law on the -- what is the law, in your opinion, not the facts, if you assume the following: One, there is an old plan and a state legislature thinks, you know, this old plan might really have been discriminatory; I wasn't here then, I didn't do it, but I see the point. Two, there is a judge who says this is okay, but, remember, I haven't seen all the evidence, I might change my mind, please 1,000 cautions.  And then we have bishops who look into the heart of the new legislature and they discover that the reason they passed it really was because it's our best shot.  You see? Now imagine those three facts.  What's the law?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  No, they determined that's the real reason.  They all voted because it's our best shot.  It's our best shot to get the old plan through.  See? Or some version thereof.  That's it.  Just thought it's the best shot.  Got the fact? That's the assumption. Now what's the law?   ",17-586X
0,"Stephen G. Breyer  If you're about --   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Can -- can I ask a more -- I did read, I think, almost all the 80 briefs.  Now your time -- what do --   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  All right.  All right.  Almost 80, and I think I -- some were repetitive, not too many.  And I think I know the basic arguments, but there's one question I'm left with and it starts with an assumption, which I think you share, but I want to be sure.  All right. I noticed that the Carter order and the Reagan order both had case-by-case exceptions.   Stephen G. Breyer  And I looked at this order, and this has case-by-case exceptions. And then it says -- you know, it says case-by-case waivers may be appropriate in individual circumstances, such as, giving some examples, the following. And then they have to be no terrorists.  Well, that's the law anyway.  And they -- they have to be in the interests of the United States.  And there can't be undue hardship, which the only time the word ""hardship"" appears in the immigration laws, it says ""extreme hardship.""   Stephen G. Breyer  So ""undue"" must be less than ""extreme.""   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay? So I'm -- then they have a list: people with foreign contacts previously established, business reasons, they've been here studying, or other long-term activity, they want to visit or reside with a close family member, they have a disease or something that they need --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- treatment for, they -- previously been employed.  And there are about five other things.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  Focus on that class of individuals.   Stephen G. Breyer  Now, in countries -- 150 million people, all together, there must be quite a few who have -- do fall within that class.  So --   Stephen G. Breyer  Well, that's what I'm asking about.   Stephen G. Breyer  You see?   Stephen G. Breyer  That's now -- if you -- you think -- now, as far as we're concerned, if they fall within that class, there -- there's no reason given here why they should be excluded, other than the -- the normal processes?   Stephen G. Breyer  What?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I'm not asking about the numbers.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  I want to ask about --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  So you think they should be excluded?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not if they meet the criteria.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Okay.  So there's --   Stephen G. Breyer  That's -- that's -- that's what I thought you would say.   Stephen G. Breyer  Then I get -- can ask my question.  Sorry.   Stephen G. Breyer  But I want to be sure we're the same wavelength.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  Now, falling within that class, here is the problem.  It seems to me that there are probably a significant number of such people.  And you read the briefs, you think, hey, there's the business community complaining, there's the academic community, there were 46 scholars at Harvard, there -- there are families in the Lisa Blatt brief, you know, that -- that they say we were trying to get medical treatment and nobody told us about this, and -- and they've only admitted two and there's supposed to be guidance, and --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- you haven't put in the guidance, and -- and -- and the most there are is 100.  And so there is my question.  If you have done the same thing that the Reagan people did and the Carter people did, then it might be -- I'm not expressing a definite opinion -- but, well, you've got the same thing here, but if this is, as one brief says, just window dressing and they never apply it --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- then you have something new and different going well beyond what President Reagan did.   Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So I want to know how do I find out -- how do I find out when there is not that information in the brief, do we have to -- can we have another hearing? Do we send it back? Do we say, look, the government, of course, thinks this isn't window dressing --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- but the other side says there are only two people, no notice, nobody knows.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  There are people in Yemen, there are people in Somalia --   Stephen G. Breyer  -- decent people. Business -- you see my point?   Stephen G. Breyer  What's the answer?   Stephen G. Breyer  Yes.   Stephen G. Breyer  All right.  That's 400 out of 150 million.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  And -- and is it well publicized in these countries that they know all they have to do is go to the visa office and say: I understand the thing, I want an exception?   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Not necessary.  There -- there you have President Reagan --   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Okay.  So you want me to consider --   Stephen G. Breyer  That's what you want. You want me to consider the lawfulness of this order on the assumption that there is no waiver.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Which is not what -- not what President Reagan did, not what -- not what President Carter did, and if you go through every action that Congress took, waiver, waiver, waiver, possibility, case-by-case, case-by-case here, that's the -- that's the --   Stephen G. Breyer  But that's -- that's, you see --   Stephen G. Breyer  You've read the briefs, as have I.  All right.  Now there are some that lists about 10 or 15 instances like the cerebral palsy.  One has Parkinson's.  Then there's another brief that lists all the people who are professors, scholars, at universities, and there are a lot.  And -- and then there are people, they list the students from these countries, a lot.   Stephen G. Breyer  And then the business community lists a -- a whole bunch and says, my goodness, they have been unable to get -- we don't know what's going on. And then they say: Well, what's going on is nothing is going on.   INTERRUPTING Stephen G. Breyer  Now I don't -- I'm not taking sides on that.  I'm just saying I don't know.   ",17-965X
1,"Stephen G.

There are obviously objections to what you're saying in quite a few briefs, all right, but the one that you talked about, it does say you have to have an interview with a consular official if the person is from a country officially designated by the Secretary as a state sponsor of terrorism.  It does say that. So they'll say, but we do have that in respect to everyone under the exception.  So there isn't much problem.  We've gone beyond that in respect to other people.  All right. Take their argument for a moment. Because my question is, which I couldn't find in the briefs, is, is it true -- I'm just taking what they say -- that really that isn't so, they don't publicize it, they haven't put forth a guidance, people don't know they can come in and qualify for this.
