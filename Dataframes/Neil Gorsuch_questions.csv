1,"Neil Gorsuch  Mr. Yang, you -- you indicate that (l)(9) is the exclusive remedy for a (2)(A) violation.   Anthony A. Yang  Close.   Neil Gorsuch  All right.  Well, let me know where I get it wrong, but -- or at least I understand that's the primary position of -- of your side.  But Amgen sought relief under State law and -- and I -- I didn't take -- take it that Petitioner argued preemption in any way, shape, or form.  So where does that leave us? (l)(9) might otherwise be the exclusive -- or almost exclusive mechanism, but what happens when we have a claim under State law that no one's argued is preempted?   Anthony A. Yang  Well, I believe Sandoz argued, at least in the court of appeals, that it was preempted. But putting that to aside, the Federal Circuit in this case deemed the State law claim for the injunction to be moot.  This is at page 24a and 25a of the Joint Appendix.  It did so because it found a Federal injunction and imposed a Federal injunction to enforce the statute.  That's precisely what the Federal Circuit made even more clear in the subsequent decision in Apotex, and so where we are now is only on the question of the Federal remedy, if there is one, for failing to give notice or failing to comply with the information exchange. I will say that it --   Neil Gorsuch  That's certainly not Amgen's position, so --   Anthony A. Yang  I will say that there are -- I think there are strong arguments that this would be preempted.  This is a highly detailed scheme.  And if States were to start to interject different means of enforcing it on a State-by-State basis, that might wreak some havoc, but we've not taken a position on that.   Neil Gorsuch  Exactly.   Anthony A. Yang  Here we --   Neil Gorsuch  I agree with you, but the absence of any argument on preemption is what makes it so curious.   Anthony A. Yang  Well, the judgment below did not rest on the State law claim.  Again, if you look at page 24 and 25 is where it says it's moot, it rests on a Federal law.   ",15-1039

Neil Gorsuch  But the question still remains under (l)(9) -- (9) -- (9)(C), rather, (l)(9)(C), what the remedy is.  And we've heard from the other side that the exclusive remedy is a declaratory-judgment action.  And how can we possibly decide what (2)(A) means without taking a peek at (9)(C) as to what remedies are permitted?   Neil Gorsuch  I'm spotting you that --   Neil Gorsuch  -- for purposes of this question.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  You can't -- it's hard to divorce a right from its remedy, isn't it, and to understand the contours of the right.

My question is how can we understand what a violation is, of Federal law, without looking at both the rights section and the remedy section?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Because the -- a violation is circumscribed in a certain way here by the remedies provided by Federal law.   Neil Gorsuch  Well, what's -- what's wrong with that? Why can't you argue that the notice is defective and seek a declaratory judgment on that basis, that the notice is insufficient, doesn't provide you with adequate notice as required by statute?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Right.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  I understand that.  If you --   Neil Gorsuch  If you say the notice itself is defective, apart from when it's given, because it doesn't provide enough information, isn't that a possible remedy right there?   ",15-1039

And maybe I'm mistaken in that, but because perhaps the furniture situation one should understand would be less in this area of town than that area of town.  But if it's a new tenant, we all live with folding chairs for a period of time when we move. So does that hold? Is that a fair reason? Should officers really have to distinguish between parts of town in deciding when to make an arrest?   Neil Gorsuch  Right.

But you don't have a -- a monopoly, a lawful monopoly, to use this technology abroad.  That doesn't belong to you.  That's outside the patent laws. And so why would you get lost profits by -- because of a third party's use entirely abroad? That -- the lost profits aspect of the damages is the bit that concerns me.  And the difference with the common law rule, for example, might be because of the patent law's territorial limits.

INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  And just -- just focus on the profits for me, okay?   Neil Gorsuch  And they arise from a third party's use over which you have no lawful monopoly.  Your patent doesn't run to the high seas, and so your uses aren't protected there.  So help me out with that portion of the damages alone.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  This Court -- this --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  All right.  Well, here's the -- here's the degree of my skepticism.  I -- I have yet to see a case from this Court at least where -- even under 271(a) where the manufacture entirely takes place here, third-party uses abroad give rise to lost profit damages.

That was part of the indictment and -- and the jury instructions here.  Or keeping records, failure to keep records --   Neil Gorsuch  -- that you didn't -- that aren't lawfully obliged to be kept.   Neil Gorsuch  The government made some similar arguments in the honest services case, that everything can be cured by a mens rea requirement.  We don't need to worry about actus reus.

I have to -- have to -- because it is specific intent, as Justice Breyer pointed out, and you've conceded. I have to know about some thing and I have to intend to obstruct or impede that thing.

Neil Gorsuch  But as I understood your answer to Justice Kagan and -- and Justice Ginsburg, it was one of the reasons we don't need to worry about your proposed rule is that the district court has discretion to delay the entry of judgment and that that is textually found in (b)(1), which, indeed, it is with respect to general verdicts, but there's no parallel language that you can rely on with respect to (b)(2).

And -- and your colleague on the other side suggested that the best line we draw is how substantial the impairment is. This Court has approved recording statutes as an impairment.  What do we do about those?   INTERRUPTING ",16-1432

0,"Neil Gorsuch  Is there -- is there any evidence -- usually, in First Amendment cases, we're concerned about overbreadth because of the chilling effect that's often undocumented.  And the burden is usually on the state to justify a compelling interest rather than the other way around. And so I guess my question for you is it sounds like Minnesota's law is a bit of an outlier compared to most of the country's. There may be nine states or so with -- with a statute that goes this far.  Is there any documented need for a statute to go this far as opposed to what happens in most other states, which is limited to electioneering?   Neil Gorsuch  Okay, 11.  Whatever number it is, it's a minority number.  And under your interpretation of ""political,"" it would forbid people from wearing certain portions of the Bill of Rights into a polling place but not other portions of the Bill of Rights. And I guess I'm just wondering what compelling interest Minnesota has identified that requires a statute that goes so much further than the vast majority of states?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  What evidence do we have? What record is there? What facts can you point to?   Neil Gorsuch  Again, Burson was electioneering, a different statute, and you're asking us to go a step further than Burson. And I'm just wondering what -- what do you have? And if the answer is nothing further than Burson, that's fine; that's an answer.   Neil Gorsuch  Political speech beyond solicitation for candidates or things on the ballot, right?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Okay.   ",16-1435
0,"Neil Gorsuch  We're not here to protect competitors, right, Mr. Murphy?   Neil Gorsuch  Or -- or necessarily even merchants.  The antitrust laws are aimed at protecting consumers; you'd agree with that?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Okay.  So, given that, there's no evidence of restricted output in this case, correct?   Neil Gorsuch  And that's normally what the antitrust laws care about, is deadweight loss.  That's the primary concern of antitrust activity, wouldn't you agree?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Okay.  All right. So you're left with this price question.  And you have an increase in price to merchants, but do we have any evidence that consumers, at the end of the day, including the rewards aspect of what they get back, actually pay a net price increase?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  What evidence do you have of that?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  No, no.  No, no. Evidence of price -- net price increase to consumers.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  I know you don't. I'm just asking --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  -- if you have any evidence of it.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Well, you have proof that not all of the increased price that American Express extracts gets to the consumer. That's not my question, however. My question is, do you have any evidence that, on a net basis, consumers pay more? And I don't believe you have.   Neil Gorsuch  I'm asking about consumers.   Neil Gorsuch  But I --   Neil Gorsuch  Isn't that true with every vertical restraint? Anytime I say I'm only going to service Cadillacs at a Cadillac dealership, I can't buy a Volvo at a Cadillac dealership. All vertical restraints have the impact of restricting interbrand competition in that respect, but we learned through painful experience and many, many years that they're generally pro-competitive, right?   Neil Gorsuch  Right.   Neil Gorsuch  So you'd just have us ignore the fact that Visa and MasterCard have 74 percent of the market?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Or that they exercise no restraint in this marketplace?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  That -- that's gone, though, right? I mean, any notion of horizontal agreement in this case is out of the case.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Mr. Stewart, what would you say, though, I mean, you -- you argue to us that this is a very unique situation and new -- new to antitrust law, the two-sided market issue, and assuming all that's true -- I'm not sure it is, but taking it as true -- why shouldn't we take Judge Easterbrook's admonition seriously, that judicial errors are a lot harder to correct than an occasional monopoly where you can hope and assume that the market will eventually correct it.  Judicial errors are very difficult to correct. And we've had a long and painful experience with vertical restraints in this Court going back to Dr. Miles that it took decades to correct, in Leegin; Albrecht, which took decades to correct in State Oil. Why should we disregard those admonitions in this case? I assume you'd like us to.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  For just these reasons.   Neil Gorsuch  And they're free to do that, right? I mean, American Express's agreements don't affect MasterCard or Visa's opportunity to cut their fees, their own fees, or to advertise that American Express's are higher.  There is room for all of that kind of competition here. It's just the difference between Cadillacs and Kias.  People can choose.  Do they want a high cost, high reward, a low-cost, cheaper alternative? And the two sides can compete with one another.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Absent a horizontal agreement, we have that, don't we?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Well, that was part of the case originally, but that's gone now, right?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Because those agreements have been dropped by -- by Visa and MasterCard.  I completely understand and accept that if that were part of the case, we'd have a very different case.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Right.  I understand the merchants can't, but the competitors can advertise all of these issues and they can point out their lower merchant fees to consumers, as they do.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  So, Mr. Stewart, I'm sorry, I apologize.  I just want to make sure I understand the argument then.  Is it that the consumer welfare here is measured by the relative effectiveness of advertising by merchants as compared to by Visa and MasterCard?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  I -- I just want to pause right there.  You -- you accept that to show an anticompetitive effect, you have to show not just an agreement --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  -- but also that it -- market power in some way, shape, or form?   Neil Gorsuch  Right, but you agree it need be shown?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Right --   Neil Gorsuch  -- if there were no market power, an agreement would have no anticompetitive effect?   ",16-1454

But market power, absent market power -- an agreement with a merchant to do anything that restricts anything is not in the cognizance of the antitrust laws.

0,"Neil Gorsuch  Counsel, you say that the bankruptcy was a proceeding related to the offense because fraud was at issue there too. And -- and maybe this is a clearer-cut case, but there are going to be plenty where the reasons for the bankruptcy are going to be in dispute, and we're going to invite district judges to engage in long collateral proceedings over whether something is or isn't related enough to the offense. What do we do about that? And, relatedly, you know, this statute covers a lot of different kinds of crimes, including violent crimes.  So I -- I can imagine someone saying: My divorce proceedings are related to the crime of violence, and I should get my attorneys' fees for my divorce proceeding too, and -- and child care and all the other things Justice Breyer enumerated. Where -- where is the stopping point here?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Well, I mean, this is a civil bankruptcy proceeding.  That's not very narrow.  And I don't see how it's any different than my divorce hypothetical.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  What if they initiated involuntary bankruptcy proceedings for the very same reason? Same result, I assume, in the government's view because you -- you take such a purposivist account of the statute, you know, and let's make sure everybody gets everything.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  I understand that. But I was kind of surprised to see a brief from the government of the United States go on for so many pages about purpose in very generic terms before actually getting to the terms of the statute, the language. And I -- I -- I -- again, why -- why wouldn't my divorce case or the involuntary bankruptcy meet the same purpose test you've articulated here?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Well, if -- if that's the case, if you agree that the purpose here is all about individual victims, doesn't that really pose a serious problem for you? Because it seems that the government's effort here is really to externalize the costs of its own investigations in corporate -- in corporate situations.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  I understand that. You -- you conceded, I believe, to Justice Kagan that Congress's purpose here had to do with individual victims.  And if that's the case, it certainly had nothing to do with the government leveraging private internal investigations in -- in -- in corporate --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  -- cases, right?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Ah.   Neil Gorsuch  Well, here's another tricky one, for me, along the lines of what the Chief Justice was just asking.  It seems to me you're making the case. How do we determine whether an internal investigation is even necessary for the government's work? I mean, presumably, the government can do its own investigation too. So how is an internal investigation that precedes the government's ever necessary in that -- in any sense? And don't companies also conduct internal investigations for their own reasons? They have to worry about shareholder derivative suits, they have to worry about class action suits, they have to worry about compliance with SEC regulations, among many other things. How is a district judge ever going to be able to determine whether an internal investigation was necessary for the criminal investigation by the government?   Neil Gorsuch  You're not answering my question, counsel. How is -- how is a district judge, the poor district judge, supposed to make a determination which one's necessary for the government's investigation and which one's not? I don't doubt they help the government.  I don't doubt the government's happy to receive that information and use the resources, the private resources, to conduct its public business.  But how is a district judge supposed to decide what was necessary?   INTERRUPTING ",16-1519

Seem -- seems to me that both sides agree on the premise that mixed cases can go to the district court, so the district court can adjudicate some civil service disputes.   Neil Gorsuch  Where in the statute is that provided? I look at 7703(b)(2), and it speaks of cases of discrimination filed under Federal discrimination laws go to district court.   Neil Gorsuch  And then I look at the standards of review.  And the standard of review for the Federal Circuit talks about normal agency, APA-type review, in (c) --   Neil Gorsuch  -- which makes sense for civil service claims.   Neil Gorsuch  The only standard of review mentioned for district courts is de novo --   Neil Gorsuch  -- which makes sense for discrimination claims, but not for civil service claims that might tag along in district court.   Neil Gorsuch  So but -- by what -- what authority does a district court ever have the power to hear a civil service claim?   Neil Gorsuch  But putting aside Kloeckner --   Neil Gorsuch  -- looking at the plain language --   Neil Gorsuch  -- of the statute --   Neil Gorsuch  -- if you could just help me with that.

Neil Gorsuch  But it's always only actions of discrimination filed under Federal discrimination statutes.   Neil Gorsuch  Mr. Landau, does that not suggest that this detour to the Federal Circuit may not be what's prescribed by the statute and that, again, bifurcation should take place and discrimination claims should go to the district court in the first instance --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  -- rather than hang around waiting in the Federal Circuit? Hopefully -- hopefully, with a regulation that might or might not say that those are tolled?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  My question is just where.   Neil Gorsuch  Cases of discrimination?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Keep going.  Keep going.   Neil Gorsuch  Right.   Neil Gorsuch  You also have to ask what are cases of discrimination filed under 717, right?   Neil Gorsuch  And those are classic discrimination claims that are filed in Federal district court.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  I hope so.   Neil Gorsuch  I'm not really sure.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  The question is where is the detour to the Federal Circuit that you also anticipate and seem to agree can happen.

1,"Neil Gorsuch  Mr. Fletcher, when we're talking about folks knowing where to go and making it easier on them, can you help me with the same question I had for Mr. Landau?

Now, that would be a nice clean rule; right? Individuals would know that their civil service disputes go to the Federal Circuit and discrimination claims go to district court.  We have to add a lot of words to the statute on standards of review for the district court if they're going to be reviewing administrative actions. We have to ignore the standard of review that is prescribed by the statute for the district court de novo when it comes to certain claims that would come before them.  We have to worry about all this equitable tolling as well, and a regulation that may or may not say what the government says it says.

1,"Neil Gorsuch  Mr. Dreeben, I'd like to -- I'd like to drill down on that and return to Justice Kagan's question.  You know, the facts here wind up looking a lot like Jones. One thing Jones -- Jones taught us is -- and reminded us, really, is that the property-based approach to privacy also has to be considered, not just the reasonable expectation approach. So, if we put aside the reasonable expectation approach for just a moment, Katz, Miller, Smith, and ask what is the property right here, let's say there is a property right.  Let's say I have a property right in the conversion case I posited with your colleague, so that if someone were to steal my location information from T-Mobile I'd have a conversion claim, for example, against them for the economic value that was stolen. Wouldn't that, therefore, be a search of my paper or effect under the property-based approach approved and reminded us in Jones?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Right.   Neil Gorsuch  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  But let's just -- let's --   Neil Gorsuch  -- let's stick with my hypothetical, counsel, okay? I know you don't like it.  I got that. (Laughter.)   Neil Gorsuch  But let's say that, in fact, I've got positive law that indicates it is a property right.  Would you there -- therefore, agree that that's a search of my paper and effect?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  But why not?   Neil Gorsuch  If property law says it is.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Well, that's fighting the hypothetical, counsel.  And I know I -- I didn't like hypotheticals, too, when I was a lawyer sometimes, but I'm asking you to stick with my hypothetical.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  All right.   Neil Gorsuch  Please -- please, could you stick with my hypothetical and then you can tell me why it's wrong.   Neil Gorsuch  Under my hypothetical, you have a property right in this information.

INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  In my -- in my hypothetical, if there were a property interest, you're not here to deny that that would be a search of my paper and effect?   Neil Gorsuch  Okay.   Neil Gorsuch  I think you --   Neil Gorsuch  Well, what does Section 222 do, other than declare this customer proprietary network information --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  -- that the carrier cannot disclose?   Neil Gorsuch  So -- so, but let me ask you that.  So -- so the government can acknowledge a property right but then strip it of any Fourth Amendment protection.  Is that the government's position?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  And so -- so could we also say maybe that they also get this property right subject to having a non-Article III judge decide the case, or quartering of troops in your home? Could we strip your property interests of all constitutional protection?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Are they?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  But does Congress's determination also yield in the face of the Fourth Amendment, Mr. Dreeben?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  It does not.  The Fourth Amendment is trumped by this statute?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  In the government's -- in the government's view.  Is that -- is that right? The statute trumps the Fourth Amendment?   Neil Gorsuch  Oh, good.  All right.  I hoped so.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  So the Fourth Amendment controls, not -- not what the statute says --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  -- with respect to the disclosure of the information?   Neil Gorsuch  Right.  The statute creates customer proprietary information --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  -- in Section 222 and then the Fourth Amendment will determine when it can be revealed.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Why does the statute control the Constitution? I think you are saying the statute controls the Constitution.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  So the bitter -- the bitter with the sweet.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  So -- so why --   Neil Gorsuch  -- why -- why -- why couldn't Congress also say you don't get an Article III judge to determine this issue?

And it doesn't cause any budget impact on the federal government. (2), under your interpretation, is a direct regulation by the government, and therefore might cost money.  And you could see a legislature saying: Well, you know, (1) makes sense, and I'm only going to vote for (2) because of (1) --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  -- because it's free.  It comes for free.

My question is, if we're asking the severability question the Chief Justice posed to you, one of the questions we have is what Congress would have done in -- in a different world? Now, that's a very hard question to answer, but that's the question we were posed. And how do we know Congress would have passed (2) without (1), given that (2) in this world, if it's -- if (1) is fine, (2) comes for free?

It's the directing the dismissal.

0,"Neil Gorsuch  Well, Ms. O'Connell, it seems to me like a lot hinges on whether this is jurisdictional or not in response to all of these questions. And this Court in recent years has instructed that we're not going to lightly assume Congress is stripping jurisdiction.  We need a clear statement, Arbaugh, Sebelius, and whatever might have been permissible before, Congress is now on notice that it needs to provide a clear rule.

Right.   Neil Gorsuch  Keene.  Right.   Neil Gorsuch  But you've also got Reed Elsevier, which has similar language to this.

But the upshot of applying the doctrine here to avoid the question whether intervenors have to have Article III standing would be that we would have to ask the Article III question effectively through the guise, admittedly, of Rule 24 in every single case. So to avoid the constitutional question once, we have to ask it every single time hereafter.   Sarah E. Harrington  That's the --   Neil Gorsuch  Is there -- is there a precedent --   Sarah E.

I will concede that my friend, Mr. Dvoretzky, has very ably pointed out the flaws in our constitutional avoidance argument, and I'm not testing --   Sarah E. Harrington  -- that argument here.   Neil Gorsuch  I appreciate the candor of that concession.   Sarah E. Harrington  Yes. (Laughter.)   Sarah E.

0,"Neil Gorsuch  Counsel, on -- on that score, why isn't that exactly the case we have here? The Plaintiff in this case, by way of relief, seeks a money damages for the taking.  All right.  That's his complaint, page 122 of the Joint Appendix.  Your client, page 162, wants damages for itself.  That's something that the Plaintiff could not have had standing to obtain for your client. Why isn't that a form of additional relief where an intervenor wishes a judgment against the defendant directly in its favor that would be enforceable through all the mechanisms of post-judgment, garnishment, liens, et cetera, and would offer your client claim preclusion effect, not just nonmutual issue preclusion, for example? Seems to me like that is a different form of relief, isn't it?   Neil Gorsuch  Well, except for the complaint expressly says that.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  So you're disclaiming the relief sought in your complaint.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Is there any relief you're seeking at this stage?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Would you agree though that if an intervenor did seek relief in its own name, that that would be relief beyond that which the plaintiff would be entitled to provide? I mean, after all, plaintiff normally doesn't have standing to seek a judgment in someone else's name.  So would you agree in the normal case that we'd have a problem here?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Or just a judgment in its favor.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  I'm sorry for interrupting, counselor.  If you would just answer my question, I would be grateful. If a plaintiff seeks a judgment in its own name, can't seek it for an intervenor, agree?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  The question is whether a plaintiff can seek a judgment against a defendant in someone else's name.  Generally not, right? That -- that's not a trick question.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Okay.  So if an intervenor then seeks a judgment in its name, generally speaking, that's asking for relief beyond that which the plaintiff has standing itself to provide, right?

0,"Neil Gorsuch  But, counsel --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Sorry, counsel. Just to follow up on Justice Sotomayor's point, I think you argued at page 228 of the Joint Appendix that trial counsel's objection was not sufficient to cover the charging error, and I think that the Federal district court on habeas found the same thing on page 366. And so that raises, to my mind, a question whether Martinez applies here.  Couldn't -- couldn't your client have brought a Martinez claim? And isn't the Martinez rule premised on the idea you get one clear shot at bringing the issue? And -- and maybe the absence of one clear shot here would bring you within the rule of Martinez, and that would take care of this case. What am I missing there?   Neil Gorsuch  Counsel, we spent a lot of time talking about Martinez, but one case we haven't discussed is Coleman.   Neil Gorsuch  And Coleman sets out the general rule that ineffective assistance by counsel in collateral review does not suffice to establish cause for purposes of Federal habeas.  That's the general rule.  And Martinez carves out a small exception for when there wouldn't be any chance to raise an issue in State court at all.  And that doesn't apply here because trial court counsel could have raised this issue.  We all admit that. So when we -- when we overrule a precedent, or part of a precedent, as I think you're effectively asking us to do with Coleman, we normally don't just ask about the merits.  We also ask about the reliance interest, the workability, whether the question is statutory rather than constitutional.  And I didn't see you address any of those factors in your brief.  And I'm wondering what I'm supposed to make of that.  Help me out.   ",16-6219
1,NO QUESTIONS,16-6219
1,"Neil Gorsuch  I have a separate jurisdictional problem that I'm hoping you can help me with and it concerns the COA requirement.  And neither side discusses it, but it's jurisdictional, so I'm -- I feel like I should give you a shot at it and you can help me out with it. The Fifth Circuit didn't require a COA because it read Harbison as saying one wasn't required.  But some circuits, including my old one, have distinguished Harbison in similar circumstances, pointing out that Harbison just dealt with the appointment, I believe, of clemency counsel, and the issue wasn't part of the final order in the merits of the habeas petition. Here, the denial of funding was part of the final order in the denial of a habeas petition.  And as I read 2253, a final order in a habeas proceeding, you need a COA. Now, maybe you can say it's just independent and totally separate from that. But then that might suggest you'd have to -- you'd be able to appeal as a matter of right anytime a funding denial takes place, even before a final judgment. And that seems odd too, though, because funding requests, attorney fee denials, sanctions, usually are wrapped up in and merged with the final judgment.  So, long-winded question, but it's jurisdictional, so -- and I thought you could help me out with that.   Neil Gorsuch  Sure.  But you're appealing the final order in a habeas proceeding, and that's the language in 2253. So help me out with the language in 2253.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Final order?

Neil Gorsuch  So -- so it's like a Cohen issue, you'd say, and we have collateral -- you know, it's a collateral issue and so we can take it up before a final judgment in -- in the habeas proceeding?   Neil Gorsuch  I've never heard of this animal before.  It's collateral, but it still merges to the final order?   Neil Gorsuch  Well --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Deny a hear -- evidentiary hearing or a discovery ruling, it all merges into the final order, traditionally. That's my understanding.   Neil Gorsuch  Sure.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  I would too.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  You're okay with that? (Laughter.)   Neil Gorsuch  You're okay with that?

Or did it rely solely on prejudice at least with respect to trial counsel?   Neil Gorsuch  How?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  But -- but -- that's contacting the family members.

0,"Neil Gorsuch  Mr. Olive, if we're talking about consequences of the ruling here, it seems to me it's possible that by adopting a look-through rule, we would encourage state supreme courts to say more, perhaps very little more, maybe as little as we're -- we're agreeing with the result but not necessarily the reasoning. But equally possible would be to encourage state intermediate courts to say less and perhaps take advantage of Harrington, so that no state court says anything and achieves maximum deference from federal courts, like California has, for example. Should we be concerned that a ruling in favor of look-through might actually yield if states are rational and look for the least cost and the most deference adverse consequences to your -- your -- your clients?   Neil Gorsuch  I'm asking you, do you agree with that? I mean, do you think that's right?   Neil Gorsuch  I understand they are, but perhaps state legislatures are.  And they may for altruistic reasons, as in Georgia -- very, very altruistic reasons, insist on a practice of some reasoned decision-making, but couldn't you see other state legislators making other decisions, say like California has, because of the cost of analyzing these cases?   Neil Gorsuch  Mr. Olive, we've spent -- we're spending a lot of time arguing about Georgia specific law, and I -- I guess I'm wondering if -- if it all turns on what the state court practice is, and we're going to create a huge incentive for a state court to simply adopt different orders that say, we adopt more or less the reasoning of the appellate court but -- but not necessarily all of it, and there may be other reasons, what have we accomplished in -- in this? Presumably, we're going to defer to those final decisions of the state courts and not look behind those.  I mean, I haven't heard an argument that we'd look behind that kind of ruling. So what exactly have we accomplished here?   Neil Gorsuch  So even if a state supreme court says we affirm the judgment, and -- and uses language exactly like this Court uses, but not necessarily all the reasonings, and there may be additional reasons beyond those that the lower court provided, we would look behind that? Is that -- is that the suggestion? And how does that fit with federalism and comity?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Even when the court -- supreme court disclaims --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  -- that?   Neil Gorsuch  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  And -- and in that case then, what have we accomplished is my question, if you could answer that?   Neil Gorsuch  It's just going to be a slightly different rubber stamp.

So let's say we are going to now confront 50 states or X number of states with rules or something in their precedents or a footnote saying we do not necessarily endorse all the lower court reasoning, just exactly as this Court has done for itself. Then what?   INTERRUPTING ",16-6855
1,"Neil Gorsuch  Ms. -- Ms. Ho, we have a number of cases that have arguably addressed this issue already, like McCormick, for example, in which this Court said the only authority competent to set a patent aside or to annul it or to correct it for any reason whatever is vested in the courts of the United States.  We have cases -- and American Bell is another one.  We have that wonderful quote from Justice Story indicating that any correction to a patent has to go to a court. The United States takes the position, as I understand it, that some of those decisions are purely statutory interpretation. What's your reading of those cases?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Why is your reading that they're constitutional, if you could help me with that?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Why not -- why not, though, Ms. Ho, just simply say the question is whether there's a private right involved? In answering Justice Kagan's questions and Justice Breyer's questions, you struggled with how much of an adjudication does an inquisitorial process have to have before it becomes an adjudication.  Why does that matter at all? If -- if you really want to stake your ground and think McCormick's right, why not just say anytime a private right is taken by anyone, it has to be through an Article III forum?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Schor is about the line between public and private rights.  You can stake your ground and simply say this is a private right.   Neil Gorsuch  But then you -- but then you --   Neil Gorsuch  Mr. -- Mr. Stewart, could you address the Chief Justice's question, which I'm also stuck on, the bitter and the sweet, to the -- to what extent could the executive condition patents on, say, you have no takings rights later or you -- you take it subject to whatever conditions in terms of its withdrawal that we wish to impose.     Well, I think if at the --   Neil Gorsuch  Including -- including maybe -- and, arguably, I understand -- the condition that we will stack the deck with judges whom we like -- administrative judges we like?     Well, I think if at the time of patent issuance the statute provided that the patent could be taken away for any otherwise appropriate governmental reason, that would be a constitutional scheme.  Congress had no obligation to create --   Neil Gorsuch  So the answer to Justice Breyer's question then, if there are all these reliance interests and $40 million or billion dollars spent, that would just be you're out of luck --     Well --   Neil Gorsuch  -- take the bitter with the sweet?     -- let me address directly the Chief Justice's question.   Neil Gorsuch  Can you answer that -- answer that question?     It has always been part of the scheme that the patent could be reexamined and not -- not by an administrative agency but at least by a court at any time while the patent remained in force, to determine whether the patentee was qualified for a patent in the first place.  So --   Neil Gorsuch  So is the answer yes?     The answer is that the patentee never had any expectation that, having been granted a patent, its validity --   Neil Gorsuch  So -- so --   Neil Gorsuch  -- I take it the answer is yes?     The answer is yes because the rule from the start was you get the patent, but it is not immune from --   Neil Gorsuch  Mr. Stewart, let's say we had a land patent.  Let's say the land patent said it becomes invalid if anybody in -- uses the land in an improper way, in violation of an environmental law, labor law, you choose. Let's say the land then gets developed and turns into a housing development outside of, I don't know, Philadelphia.  And it turns out, though, that a great-grandfather who owned the land originally back when it was a farm, indeed violated a labor or environmental law, rendering the land patent invalid on its terms. Could -- couldn't the Bureau of Land Management, for example, or some other department, Interior, official just pull back the patent?     Well, the Court said in some of the 19th-century cases that --   Neil Gorsuch  Under your theory?     -- with respect to land patents that transferred fee simple title, executive branch officials couldn't do that. I think it's unclear from the decisions whether they were constitutional holdings, but we'll accept for purposes of this case that that was --   Neil Gorsuch  Well, you dispute that they're constitutional holdings in your brief.     We dispute -- we dispute the --   Neil Gorsuch  So, presumably, there's nothing to prohibit the scheme I've just described in the government's position, correct?     I --   Neil Gorsuch  It's a yes-or-no answer I'm looking for.     I would not concede the invalidity of that proceeding.   Neil Gorsuch  Exactly.     But -- but I don't think that --   Neil Gorsuch  Exactly.     I don't think that the position we're asserting in this case has any necessary implications --   Neil Gorsuch  Those were four -- four cases, I believe, right? And involve foreign -- foreign patent applicants, right?     Well, the -- the reissue wouldn't --   Neil Gorsuch  No, not the reissuance.  The invalidity.     The -- the interference --   Neil Gorsuch  Yeah.     -- wouldn't necessarily involve patent applicants.  You could have a reissue -- an interference proceeding whenever a new patent applicant said I was actually the first inventor and somebody else has gotten the patent who shouldn't have gotten it.   Neil Gorsuch  But the invalidity, it's just those four cases you have, right?     The --   Neil Gorsuch  The foreign -- that period of time when there was a brief statute permitting executive rejection of patents by foreigners?     I'm -- I'm sorry, I'm not --   Neil Gorsuch  All right.  Fair enough.     Yeah, what I was referring to more was the situation where in an interference, the true inventor would -- or the putatively true inventor would say this person shouldn't have gotten the patent because I actually invented it first. But to your -- return to -- to your question, Justice Breyer, and -- and I'd like to -- to go back to the hypothetical about public employment, the -- the individual who is going to be terminated, even though he has for cause protection, has due process rights, has to have fair procedures, I don't think anybody would say that if the executive branch devises more effective ways of monitoring its employees and is better able to detect employees who have committed acts that would trigger termination for cause, that somehow the executive branch is forbidden to apply those to people who got tenure protections before those mechanisms were available. This is --   Neil Gorsuch  But, Mr. Stewart, if I understand your answer, an infringement action could be adjudicated by the director so long as money damages were not sought, and that would be fine.     Well --   Neil Gorsuch  So a declaration of non-infringement could be issued by the director, for example, right?     And -- and it would be -- that -- even that would be harder to defend because infringe -- determining whether one private party's action infringes an existing patent is not part of the PTO's traditional work. When the PTO --   Neil Gorsuch  So traditional being more than 40 years but less than 400? Or what --     Well --   Neil Gorsuch  -- what's the -- what's the cutoff?     Well, I mean, since 1836, the PTO and its patent -- and its predecessor, the Patent Office, have decided whether patents should be granted.  They have determined what, in effect, are questions of validity.  Does this person meet the prerequisites for the -- the granting of the patent? The last thing I wanted to say, to -- to respond briefly to Petitioner's primary theory, which is that it's the use of adjudicative proceedings, proceedings that look like a trial that renders this infirm.  It happens all the time that executive branch agencies get input from private people before making their decisions. We've cited formal rule-making as an example, which in rule-making, of course, can be triggered by a petition from a private party.  At congressional hearings, the members of Congress will listen to sworn testimony from witnesses who may express different views, and Congress ultimately decides how to vote. When the Solicitor General is deciding whether to file an amicus brief, we will read the papers that were submitted to this Court. We'll have meetings with the parties that resemble oral arguments. At the end of the day, what makes it unproblematic is that, even though our procedures may resemble the Court's procedures, the decision that we make is the decision to file an amicus brief on behalf of the United States.  So long as that's an appropriate exercise of executive branch authority, the fact that we get input from private parties can't render it constitutionally infirm. If there are no further questions.

Neil Gorsuch  Do you think it would work if -- if we had land patents subject to the same circumstances, that they could be reexamined at any time over hundreds of years, even after the farmer had sold the land to the developer who built the houses and that the land patent could be revoked by the government, by bureaucracy, I suppose, in the Department of Interior?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  But, that it is subject to packing by a director who's unhappy with the results?   Neil Gorsuch  A monopoly in the use of land.  What's -- what's the difference between -- operative difference, other than obviously one isn't land?   Neil Gorsuch  Isn't that question begging about what's a private right? Isn't that the very question this Court has to decide?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Fair -- fair enough, when it's -- when it's granted, but once it's granted, there's an abundance of law going back 400 years.  Justice Story says it.  I mean, you know, this is not new idea, that once it's granted, it's a private right belonging to the inventor. Justice Story said it is a property that has -- an inventions of a property which is often of very great value, in which the law intended to give him, the inventor, absolute enjoyment.   Neil Gorsuch  Yeah.   ",16-712X
0,"Neil Gorsuch  Mr. Walsh --   Neil Gorsuch  -- can you help me out with what happens to the law of preferences under your interpretation? As you know, trustees can avoid transfers leading up to the bankruptcy that meet certain conditions.   Neil Gorsuch  And a lot of that would seem to go away, that power would seem to go away under your interpretation, if a bank or financial institution is involved.  So that a lot of avoidable transactions would become unavoidable all of a sudden. How do we reconcile your -- your interpretation with that -- that apparent difficulty?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Well, but often --   Neil Gorsuch  -- often a transfer that's avoidable does involve a financial institution.  You'd agree with that, surely?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  May, but --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Well, but it could --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Well, but it could. I mean, why not? I mean, do you have any empirical information on that?   Neil Gorsuch  No.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  So not -- a triviality we don't need to worry about, even though it was a central feature of the Seventh Circuit's opinion?   Neil Gorsuch  But we don't have any -- nobody has any data on that? We're just -- we're just going on your -- your representation versus your friend's representation otherwise?

1,"Neil Gorsuch  So -- but, Mr. Clement, on that, I assume your friend will get up and say, well, a lot of those charitable contributions are by check, and those aren't covered. And just as -- just as we heard when I asked the question about avoidable transfers, that it became an empirical debate about how many of those would be covered. So how -- how clean a line is this really? I mean, what -- what you're suggesting?   Neil Gorsuch  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Customer.   Neil Gorsuch  Right.   Neil Gorsuch  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  The amici -- the amici give us a very clean position, right, that we need a transferee under the statute and a debtor under the statute.  I read the red brief as being a little more equivocal on that. Maybe I misread it. Did you endorse the amici's clean position without qualification?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  All right.  All right.  But the Second Circuit is very concerned about the effect that this would have on the leveraged buyout industry and -- and, therefore, the economy more broadly. I can understand an argument that Congress in 1978 wasn't much concerned about the leveraged buyout industry because it didn't exist, as we now know it, but what -- what else do you say in response to that, the parade of horribles that we've heard?   ",16-784X
0,"Neil Gorsuch  Well --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  But, Mr. Waxman, if we have to draw a line, it seems to me we have at least two axes we have to worry about.  One is, where do we stop on the concession? You say it goes down to elements. I -- I -- I press you why it wouldn't go further than that, if the client instructs the lawyer not to accede to admission of a piece of evidence as particularly damning but the lawyer sees no good faith basis for objecting.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  -- why -- why doesn't it go down to that level? That's one axis.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  The other axis would be you say it's -- the lawyer can't admit the element.  But what if the lawyer casts doubt on the element? I mean, what if the lawyer here hadn't admitted guilt but had presented a mens rea defense that really cast aspersions on the actus reus defense, right, it really cast -- any reasonable person would know what the lawyer is up to.  He didn't use the magic words ""I admit,"" but he did, in fact, essentially do that. So we have ambiguity on both these axes.  Where would we draw the lines?   Neil Gorsuch  But sometimes -- sometimes -- sometimes, though, a piece of evidence is far more important than an element. Take -- take the Chief Justice's example of a Hobbs Act.  I mean, the interstate commerce element is usually not that big a deal in those cases.  But admission of a piece, a letter or, you know, an admission by the defendant is a huge deal.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  I know.   Neil Gorsuch  Mr. Waxman, I -- I --   Neil Gorsuch  -- think you're right about that, but my question would be -- I'm sorry.   Neil Gorsuch  On that, it seems to me that that's Faretta, right? That you have a right to control your self-representation if you're unhappy with your lawyer. The -- your client had an opportunity to -- this is on his second lawyer. And he -- he had notice before trial that there was a breakdown with his lawyer.  And the trial court ruled he -- he came too late to replace him with a third lawyer yet or to go to self-representation.  Why isn't this just an untimely Faretta problem, accepting everything you've said about the original understanding? At some point, one can waive these rights too.  These are personal rights that could be waived.   ",16-8255
1,"Neil Gorsuch  Counsel, you've been asking us to review this under Strickland, but why -- why isn't this a structural error? The Sixth Amendment guarantees the assistance of counsel, as Mr. Waxman points out, and that is a fiduciary relationship.  And when someone doesn't just admit an element but admits guilt of second-degree murder, which is effectively what happened here, why isn't that structural error, a total denial of assistance of counsel, absence of an assistance of counsel, that we should take cognizance of and draw the line there?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Well, why -- why isn't this just like Faretta, where we said, you know, that you have a right to have assistance of counsel and not to have an agent of the state assist the state in prosecuting you?   Neil Gorsuch  You'd agree, though, that he -- he effectively conceded guilt to second-degree murder?   Neil Gorsuch  Well, if -- if we're there, though, in Strickland, even in Strickland, on deficient performance, why isn't there at least deficient performance here by the lawyer admitting the element as opposed to remaining mute about it? That would have been an option that I think the lawyer could have pursued. So we'd still have prejudice prong, I understand your arguments there, but why not on deficient performance? I would have thought under the ethical rules, which I know are not controlling here, that you -- you would have had an argument for an ethical violation in conceding your client's guilt.   Neil Gorsuch  Well, let's take Justice Kagan's hypothetical then on its own terms.  What would be the outcome in that case?   Neil Gorsuch  Let's posit all of that, that we have a competent, rational, thoughtful individual who makes a calculated decision autonomously, that that's the route he or she wishes to go. Is it -- can we even call it assistance of counsel? Is that what it is when a lawyer overrides that person's wishes?   INTERRUPTING ",16-8255
1,"Neil Gorsuch  Ms. Davidson, I was wondering about our -- our standard in Olano and the fourth prong, talking about fairness, reputation, integrity of judicial proceedings, where it came from. And I traced it back to Atkinson, a 1936 opinion.  I know you've cited that.  And I wanted your thoughts about that, because in Atkinson, it said district courts should be guided by the following test in when to exercise their discretion to correct a plain error and suggested that they should correct a plain error whenever it's obvious or when it affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. And Olano turned that ""or"" into an ""and."" What do we make of that?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Well, if that's true on the fourth prong, public reputation, let's say, how are we supposed to determine that normatively, right? As an empirical matter. We're supposed to take a poll? I think if we took a poll, we'd find that a lot of people may not care about how long your client spends in prison.  Right? Whether it's an extra six months or not. Should that matter? Should public reputation in a -- in a -- in a institution that's designed to check majoritarian impulses like the judiciary's supposed to, should -- should those majoritarian influences even matter in our consideration of the fourth prong?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  So it's a normative inquiry rather than an empirical one, I think is what you're suggesting, in which case, should -- should the fact that a person spends a day in prison longer than the law permits be something we should care about?

Neil Gorsuch  Well, Mr. Ellis, if -- if -- along those lines, though, Congress did speak to this question, the feedback loop problem that Justice Breyer has been alluding to, in 3742(f)(1), where it said if there's an error in calculating the sentencing guideline, the case shall be remanded.   Neil Gorsuch  Not -- not ""may."" I take it you'd have us read ""shall"" to mean ""may.""   Neil Gorsuch  So -- well, you haven't -- you haven't suggested that the statute's ineffectual, have you?   Neil Gorsuch  You'd have us just ignore the statute then?   Neil Gorsuch  I think those are your choices.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  We either ignore the statute or we read ""shall"" to mean ""may.""   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Have you got a third option?   Neil Gorsuch  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  So what's the third option?   Neil Gorsuch  Before you -- before we leave that, I'd just like to nail this down --   Neil Gorsuch  -- because the harmless error rule makes sense to me in Williams in light -- in light of the language because the court has to determine the sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guideline, and if it's harmless, it wasn't imposed as a result of. But how do you -- how do you get plain error into this rule? How do you get, you know, that problem solved?   Neil Gorsuch  Without turning ""shall"" into ""may"" or ignoring the statute all together?   Neil Gorsuch  If we're going to compare the -- the cost empirically of the two systems, wouldn't we have to account for the fact that under the regime you propose there are a lot more appeals that the courts of appeals have to resolve? In the circuits where this rule exists or this presumption exists, the government frequently confesses error to mathematical mistakes in the guidelines applications and it automatically goes back for resentencing without the need of -- of appellate resources being involved. Should that be a cost that we should consider or -- or is that one you would have us ignore?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Are you including the fourth prong as well? It's irrelevant there too?   Neil Gorsuch  That's -- that's just an argument against the plain error rule all together, isn't it?   ",16-9493

1,"Neil Gorsuch  Well, have they, though?   Neil Gorsuch  I mean, I look at the -- I'm sorry.   Neil Gorsuch  So --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  So, counsel, don't we, though, have to assume the constitutionality of that limitation on the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief for -- for this position to work and, second, what if Congress were to alter that scheme and provide the -- the President or the Secretary further authority to alter the results of military tribunals? And, in fact, I think the Secretary, if I'm correct, has to approve the dismissal of any commissioned officer as well --   Neil Gorsuch  -- under 871(b).  So there's another limitation on the authority of the military tribunal and another grant to a superior executive officer.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Well, if it changes the analysis, then where -- we're back to the Chief Justice's question -- where is the line, and assuming the constitutionality of these limitations.   Neil Gorsuch  Where is the line? How much authority -- how much of a court is it before it is no longer a court when it's all sitting in the executive branch, as this Court ruled in Edmonds?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  So it's --   Neil Gorsuch  -- criminal versus civil? I mean, I can see the next case being civil.  There are consequences, maybe not of a criminal nature, but you lose a rank or a privilege or some other sort of -- well, we struggle with what's the difference between civil and criminal all the time in this Court.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Well, I accept -- I accept that.  I'm saying, well, what about the next case, why would we draw the line there when civil penalties today are very harsh and severe?

When you're doing the institution decision of inter partes review, you're going to look at the petition.  Couldn't it be just that simple? And doesn't 314 kind of cut against the government in some ways too by suggesting that all the PTO needs to do is decide whether there is one claim that isn't frivolous, that's -- that's the sum total of its job under the plain terms.

Neil Gorsuch  No.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Well, help me -- help me out with 316 then if that's where you're going to go to.  Where do you -- where do you see the authority for the regulations that the director is proscribed here?   Neil Gorsuch  Now, (a)(4), that -- my problem with that, where I get stuck is that (a)(4) concerns establishing a governing inter partes review.  And we're not at that stage yet.  We're at the decision whether to institute inter partes review.   Neil Gorsuch  I would have thought you'd have to look to -- to (a)(2) rather than (a)(4).   Neil Gorsuch  I'd agree with you to cover -- you've given great discussion on the standards for showing sufficient grounds to institute a review.  I'm not sure, I guess I'm -- you can help me on how that also includes the authority whether to grant review of this or that claim, the weeding out process.   Neil Gorsuch  I can see how it might affect the reasonable likelihood inquiry and how the director is going to go about doing that, but I -- I guess it's a little less clear to me how it also grants him authority, or her authority, to decide which claims to proceed with.   Neil Gorsuch  Yeah.   Neil Gorsuch  Well, but -- but 314(a) seems to proscribe that -- that question, at least with respect to one claim. It speaks to that very issue.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Is there some inconsistency with 304 where you're allowed -- the director gets to decide which question specifically the director wants to take up? There seems to be an express grant to the director there to do exactly what you want to do here.  And is its absence here suggestive?   Neil Gorsuch  It's not just claims in 304, it's questions.  And so the director can pick and choose which questions.  And is granted that express authority. And normally we -- we think that when it's granted in one place but not clearly granted in the other that that -- that that intends a difference.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  What do you say about our -- our last argument, where a lot of our attention focused on Congress's putative intention to -- to want to move things to an expert agency and -- and speed things along, make it more efficient?

Before the district court, it appeared that you conceded that you had to prove but-for causation, that but for the alleged gerrymander, the outcome would have been different in these last three elections.  And the district court expressly rejected a lower standard, rejecting some metaphysical could-be burden in favor of the but-for cause test. In this Court, you seem to now be backing away from the but-for cause requirement, as best I can tell, in favor of something the district court might have described differently. And I wonder how could it be an abuse of discretion for the district court to have proceeded on the basis of a concession before it that you're now backing away from?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  I understand that. But before the district court, you took the position that you had to prove it, according to the district court's opinion.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  According to -- your brief is saying our burden is to show.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Right.   Neil Gorsuch  So the district court twisted your concession?

O'CONNELL: I -- I think it's the Federalist Papers, the Hamilton quote from the Federalist Papers.  Also, Schooner Exchange versus McFaddon lays that out as a general rule for foreign states at least. But, again, I think that one important point that I want to get out here is that if Congress were to look at this and -- and decide whether to create a judicial -- or a statutory exception for tribal sovereign immunity, it may very well make decisions like it made with respect to the United States about a statute of limitations or exceptions for adverse possession claims or things that Congress is in a position to weigh and create a comprehensive solution.

This Court doesn't normally resolve questions like that in the first instance. Normally, it's a question of review, not first view.  Why shouldn't we exercise discretion here and wait?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Well, but you -- that's not quite right, though, because we know the United States would be immune from this suit, right?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Well, adverse possession, I think we -- everyone acknowledges that the United States would not be subject to a suit like that.  Maybe you can tell me why that's wrong in response to Justice Ginsburg's line of inquiry. But it -- assuming it -- it could be immune, here, if the land were in trust, it would be the same as the United States' land. And so it is possible that a sovereign could be immune from this kind of suit, right?   Neil Gorsuch  I -- I understand.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  But if this were in trust and, therefore, property of the United States, you'd agree sovereign immunity would bar this suit?   ",17-387X
1,"Neil Gorsuch  Counsel --   Neil Gorsuch  -- I just -- no, please go ahead.   Neil Gorsuch  Counsel, just returning to where the Chief Justice started us, under American Pipe, we say that equitable tolling gets you a new claim here.  And you accept that. But you ask us to write an exception to Rule 23.  So you get a new claim, except for Rule 23.  You don't get the benefit of that rule. Is there another circumstance where courts have allowed equitable tolling but denied access to procedural mechanisms in a subsequent suit?   Neil Gorsuch  No, I'm talking about after equitable tolling, that this Court has imposed and allowed --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  -- a new suit, can you think of another example where in that new suit the equitably tolled plaintiff is forbidden from accessing a particular procedural right --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  -- otherwise available to all litigants?   INTERRUPTING ",17-432X
0,"Neil Gorsuch  Exactly.  All right. And that's pretty --   Neil Gorsuch  I'm sorry, and that's pretty unusual, right? I can't think of another example in equitable tolling doctrine where we do this, which may suggest some question about whether American Pipe is correct. And if we have doubts about that, why should we extend it so radically here in a way that was unforeseen even by the authors of American Pipe?   Neil Gorsuch  I'm sorry -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but -- but if -- if we doubt those rationales, if we doubt American Pipe and think that it doesn't really represent true equitable tolling principles at common law, why would we extend that?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  But only on the understanding of American Pipe that it's after the fact rather than before the fact.  That's the difference, I guess.   Neil Gorsuch  I guess I'm not --   Neil Gorsuch  I don't think anybody questions the importance of that -- that function of the rule.  I think the question that Justice Breyer is getting at, and I guess I am too in a way, is can you stack them forever, so that try, try again, and that the statute of limitations never really has any force in these cases.  What do we do about that, given the congressional judgment that there should be a statute of limitations? And what restraints might there be if -- if not the ones that your friend proposes that the Ninth Circuit suggested, for example, that class action attorneys would exercise restraint.  Should we rely on that?   Neil Gorsuch  Well, if we -- if we were to rule against you, it seems to me the effect might be that we would encourage more protective filings, and that would solve the problem, wouldn't it? We wouldn't have to create these extraordinary rules in extending American Pipe in new ways; we'd just create a new incentive structure that would ensure that there are backup class actions available.  What -- what's wrong with that?   Neil Gorsuch  And -- and we're now balancing a multiplicity of interests in a slightly different context.  And why wouldn't the balance with respect to encouraging protective filings might be slightly different here?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  The alternative is backhand administration over comity questions that are effectively unreviewable.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  So how do we weigh those two interests?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Are you aware of any court that's ever held that a district court abused its discretion in -- in -- in declining to follow another district court's decision?   INTERRUPTING ",17-432X
1,"Neil Gorsuch  I --   Neil Gorsuch  No, go ahead.   Neil Gorsuch  I think -- I think the concern that, if I'm correct, that -- that my colleagues are expressing is are -- would -- we may be creating a perverse incentive here for the government to issue earlier notices to appear on dates that it actually has no intention of proceeding in order to stop the clock on clients like yours, rather than being more forthright and saying we don't know when we're going to be able to do it, but here's a notice to stop the clock. We're going to wind up in the same place perhaps, and it's just a paper exercise.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  That's the concern, I think.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  We wouldn't go that far, counsel. (Laughter.)   Neil Gorsuch  It -- it just is a matter of administrative convenience that we're going to list it for the first Tuesday on the second month, and maybe we'll get there and maybe we won't.  And then we'll just send out a new notice, and a new notice, and a new notice, and a new notice, until we get to the date. So what's the difference between that regime and the regime we currently have? And why -- why is one better for your client than the other? Sometimes when courts require additional procedures to aid a criminal defendant or an immigrant, they wind up perversely creating the opposite, unintended effect.  Why isn't your case one of those?   Neil Gorsuch  Were there any remedy for your -- for -- for your client in a circumstance like the one I've described that you can think of?   ",17-459X
0,"Neil Gorsuch  How is it that under Ordaz a notice to appear isn't a notice to appear if it -- if it's not filed, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out? An extra-statutory requirement that I -- I can't -- I don't see this -- in the language of this statute.  Maybe you can tell me where I can find it.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  But -- but yet a document that contains some of the elements that are required by this statute should qualify? That seems to me to have it sort of backwards.  Help me out.   Neil Gorsuch  I understand that. But -- but the BIA, in its wisdom, has said that a notice to appear isn't a notice to appear if it lacks something that the statute doesn't require, but it is a notice to appear if it lacks something the statute does require.   Neil Gorsuch  And I am thoroughly confused by that.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Maybe you can help me out.   Neil Gorsuch  So -- so what is the definition of a notice to appear? It doesn't have to have a date.  It doesn't have to have a time.  Does it have to have the charges? Does it have to have the facts? I mean, when does the emperor have no clothes? At what point?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  A blank page with -- with the title notice to appear, would that suffice?   Neil Gorsuch  Well, okay.  But if that's true, then surely we don't need to worry about the charges or the law or the facts either.  It just could say we're going to -- we're going to come after you at some point, some indefinite point about something having to do with immigration.  That would be a notice to appear under your definition, wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Well, I'm just wondering where the government would have us draw the line --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  -- and why.   Neil Gorsuch  Okay.  So that's the nature of the proceeding.  So we've got (A).   Neil Gorsuch  We've got to have that.  How about the legal authority --   Neil Gorsuch  -- got to have that?   Neil Gorsuch  Okay.  And how about (C) and (D)?   Neil Gorsuch  So it's only the date and time that's -- we don't have to have. Everything else is good.   Neil Gorsuch  (E) through (G), no, none of those?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  So you don't -- don't need to tell them they need counsel, for example.  That's -- that's not required?   Neil Gorsuch  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Doesn't Congress get to decide what's the essential function of a charging document? I would have thought that, you know, I don't see a distinction between (A) and (D) versus (E) through (G) in -- in this -- in this statute.  I mean, Congress could have done that.  These are the really important ones --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  -- (A) through (D) --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  -- (E) through (G), forget about those.   ",17-459X
1,"Neil Gorsuch  Mr. Dupree, if we're going to look back, as you're encouraging us to do, further than 2004, why not look at 1938 and the regulations that were promulgated then that suggest that money remuneration is broader than you're arguing?   Neil Gorsuch  Well, what if we read it more broadly? Would you have any further response?   Neil Gorsuch  I'm sure you don't, but let's just suppose we did.  Then what?   ",17-530X
0,"Neil Gorsuch  Why would you wait until the day of exercise, though, if it -- why not the date of vesting, and -- and what -- I'm still not clear on what you do with privately-held stock that is not readily -- there's no liquid market value that you can look to at any point in time.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Almost anything can be valued, though.  I mean, anything can be reduced to money.  So why -- why -- why wait, other than it's convenient for the government?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  No, no, once it vests, it's different.  There's no question that you will be able to exercise it.  It's just when.  You may choose to exercise it years later, but it vests, so you immediately at that point in time have the right to exercise it on that day. I'm still not clear what your answer to the Chief Justice would be.   Neil Gorsuch  Sure.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  So more regulations. Okay.  Fine.  And what do we do about the more general problem, though, that lots of companies issue lots of things to their employees that are forms of compensation that can be reduced readily to money? You mentioned lifetime passes for riding the rails, for example.  Sports tickets might be another.  Home technology might be another.  Why aren't all those kinds of benefits -- child care -- why don't all those qualify as money remuneration in the government's view, or do they?   Neil Gorsuch  A home computer?   Neil Gorsuch  I guess I'm not sure how the regulations help you.  I mean, the more recent regulation says, effectively, that money is whatever money is under the statutes. That -- that doesn't do much work, it seems to me.  And the fact that -- that the IRS chose to replace the 1938 regulation, that might or might not be more helpful to the government, we can debate that, seems to me a lost opportunity for the government.  No?   Neil Gorsuch  How is the existing regulation helpful to the government?   ",17-530X

0,"Neil Gorsuch  Mr. Katyal -- Mr. Katyal, if I might on -- on the statutory question before we leave it.  We've been proceeding so far on the assumption that we can reach the merits, but the government makes the argument, for example, that aliens who are removed from this country have to bring their claims personally and third parties can't vindicate those rights of aliens being -- who are present in this country, and asks the question why it should be that third persons should be able to assert the rights of aliens who are not present in this country.  What's the answer to that?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Oh behalf of --   Neil Gorsuch  -- aliens not present in the country?   Neil Gorsuch  I understand that, but those arguments don't work with respect to aliens present in the country.  So why do they work for aliens who are not present in the country?   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  Those very same arguments would not succeed.   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  I think you'd concede that they wouldn't succeed for aliens present --   Neil Gorsuch  Mr. Katyal, on that, it's been a long time since this Court has used the Lemon test, reasonable observer, even to strike down a domestic statute, let alone something with purely international application.  What -- what do we do about that?   Neil Gorsuch  That --   INTERRUPTING Neil Gorsuch  -- raises a question of remedy for me.   Neil Gorsuch  We have this troubling rise of this nationwide injunction, cosmic injunction --   Neil Gorsuch  -- not limited to relief for the parties at issue or even a class action.   Neil Gorsuch  And, near as I can tell, that's -- that's a really new development where a district court asserts the right to strike down a -- a federal statute with regard to anybody anywhere in the world.
