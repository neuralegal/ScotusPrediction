And if it's the latter, where do you draw the line?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yes, but the State doesn't go that far.  If it doesn't require the defendant to persuade the judge of the defendant's likely innocence, then there's no constitutional violation.  If the... if the rule of State law simply requires a consideration of the strength of the prosecution evidence in relation to the defense evidence, that's... that's all right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But where is the line?  That's what I'm trying to get at.  If it's... if the rule is that the defendant has to raise a reasonable inference of innocence and you take into account the strength of a prosecution's case in making that determination, you don't just accept the defense evidence and... and see whether... how... how strong an inference of innocence it would raise if it's believed.  I mean, where is the line?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And that would be unconstitutional as well.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  Isn't that... but isn't that what happened here?     No.  I think... I think this court excluded it on the basis of reliability determinations, whether in fact there was sufficient corroboration for what the individual was saying in the statement.  The trial judge found that the information that was purported to be said by Jimmy McCaw White was something that was generally known within the community as a whole.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How could... how could court conclude that the State's evidence was strong without making... without finding, in effect, that the State's forensic witnesses were credible?     I think they could evaluate the evidence in the manner that it... that it was presented to them to get an indicia as to whether there is any reasonable reliability to the third party guilt evidence.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Just take, for example, the... the palm print.  The chief Mobley said he found it in... in the apartment, and that would be very strong evidence, if in fact that was the case.  But his credibility was contested.  So how can you conclude that the palm print is strong evidence for the prosecution without implicitly making a determination, a credibility determination?     Well, I think that type of evaluation, we believe, necessarily needs to be done to make a determination to the... to the probative value or the prejudicial value to the presentation of the third party guilt evidence of... of the defendant, that all those matters need to be looked at as to whether, in fact, it should come in.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But then the court is making--     If there was just the palm print--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --the court is excluding defense evidence based on a finding that a prosecution witness is credible.     --No.  I don't think that's the test, and I don't think that's what they were doing in this case.  They were making that... viewing that information to determine whether the presentation was reliable that was being presented, whether there was some substance actually to what was being given, and whether leaving that information out would have deprived him of a meaningful right to present relevant evidence in his defense.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  On the other side, if Westbrook is credible, isn't that strong evidence for the defense?     The... the... it's... it's evidence for the defense, but it's evidence for the defense that lacked the sense of reliability.  And it lacked--   Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  --then wouldn't that be strong evidence for the defense?     --It's some evidence for the defense, but the problem is it lacked corroboration.  It wasn't given in a timely manner.  If you contrast that to the situation which occurred in Chambers v. Mississippi, there was an entire information that the Chambers situation had independent of the third party statement which supported and showed that that information did have persuasive assurances of reliability.

Could there ever be things that it's understood that are things that any employee ought to be concerned about, such as very serious wrongdoing within the office?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But isn't there this... isn't there this anomaly in the position that you're advocating?  It would seem to me that categories of employee speech that are most likely to be disruptive would be public speech that's outside of the employee's duties, or internal speech that is outside of the employee's duties.  How much of a... of a problem is it that employees are bringing first amendment claims based on largely internal speech that falls within their own job duties?   Edwin S. Kneedler  --I think that would be a huge problem, because it would effectively constitutionalize the day to day interactions between supervisors and subordinates within the Government, and put the Federal Courts in charge of overseeing that.  Even if these cases might ultimately be disposed of on summary judgment, there would be discovery, there would be the burdens of the litigation.  And in a case like this, where the... where the Government is taking the position that the... these actions were not even taken against the employee because of this disposition memorandum... they say they had perfectly valid other reasons... but this case exemplifies what the problem would be, is that the employee could identify something that he said or did in the course of his duties that involved speech and say,  ""That's the reason that I was disciplined. ""   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But are these going to be difficult cases under Pickering balancing?  You have the case like this, where the employee, let's say, says to the prosecutor,  ""I think the case should be dismissed. ""  The prosecutor says,  ""Well, I'm the supervisor, and I disagree. ""  ""We're not going to dismiss the case. ""  Typically, the employee wouldn't be disciplined for doing something like that.  Now, if the employee persists and, you know, is insubordinate, there would be another basis for taking disciplinary action.   Edwin S. Kneedler  Well, but in this case, if we look at what the Ninth Circuit said, for example, when it got to step two, it said that the employee could only be disciplined if the... if the agency could show that there was disruption or reckless disregard for the truth.  But when somebody is actually carrying out his job duties... not engaged in outside activities that may reflect back and be disruptive, but engaged in the job duties themselves, the employer has a right to insist on more than that the employee not be disruptive or reckless; he has a right to insist that... the employer has a right to insist that the employee affirmatively contribute to the work of the office and exercise good judgment.  And the... and the supervisor has to be in a position to make judgments about whether that judgment was good or not.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, is this going to lead to difficult problems in determining what falls within the job duties of a particular employee?   Edwin S. Kneedler  I don't... I don't think it... I don't think it will, and certainly no more problems than the... than this Court has wrestled with, and the lower courts have, in terms of what's a matter of public concern.  I think it's a common inquiry to determine what a person's job duties are.  And I think it's a very important place to have a clear line, just as there is a clear line with respect to matters of public concern.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Suppose, in the memo here, the assistant district attorney had said,  ""I think that this deputy lied, and I think the deputy should be fired. ""  Now, whether the deputy should be fired or not probably isn't within the job duties of this... of this employee.  So, would that be outside of your rule?   Edwin S. Kneedler  No, I think it would probably be inside the rule.  I think... I would think, particularly for a... for an assistant DA to make a recommendation about the consequences of illegal conduct would be within his... within his job duties.  I also want to say that this Court's decision in Pickering, and in that line of cases, I think, fully support this, because, as this Court pointed out in Connick, this Court has repeatedly stated that the protection afforded by Pickering is for action taken as a citizen on matters of public concern.  That ""as a citizen"" phrase was reiterated in virtually all of this Court's cases in the area.  And the underlying principle is that--   ",04-473X

I wonder whether we can answer the generic question that you presented, whether the omission of an element of a criminal offense from the indictment can constitute harmless error, without considering the nature of the alleged defect here.  I don't know how you can answer... if you look at whether the alleged defect here is susceptible to harmless error analysis, or whether if we were to agree with you, in fact, it is harmless, how you can answer those questions without reaching a conclusion about whether there was any defect in the indictment in the first place.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And it doesn't seem to me that there's any defect in this indictment.  It charges... it recites the language of the statute, it uses the word ""attempt"" which has a very well-settled meaning in the law.  Any lawyer would understand exactly what is required for an attempt.  It sets out the factual basis of the charge.  So I don't know how you would get to the... how you can answer the second question without getting into the first question.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If you went back to the... if you went back to the very demanding nineteenth century criminal pleading laws, criminal pleading laws, they would say that where you use a legal term that has a well-0established meaning such as attempt, you don't need to spell out the definition of that, of that concept.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But this doesn't... ""proceeds"" must mean the same thing in every money laundering case, doesn't it?  And every money laundering case is not based on a gambling business.  There are drug businesses and all sorts of other predicates.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can it mean something different in... depending on the underlying illegal activity?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Let me go back to the question of the definition of ""proceeds"".  Isn't it very unlikely that Congress would have wanted... wanted to adopt the net income definition in light of the legal issues and the problems of proof that that would involve?  Let's take the example of an international drug ring that has assets in a foreign country.  They may have crops.  They may have processing plants, warehouses, trucks, airplanes, et cetera.  They ship millions of dollars of drugs into the United States.  They get millions of dollars in gross revenue here every year.  They hire a professional money launderer to launder the money here.  Now, the Government wants to prosecute the money... the person they hired plus members of the organization.  The person they hired may not know and may not care whether the money that was being laundered was profits or not.  And how are you going to prove what... whether this enterprise was a profitable enterprise or not?  They may have... and they may have enormous gross revenue, but they may have... they may have enormous expenses overseas.  They may have bought a lot of warehouses and equipment.  They may have lost a lot of things because they were raided by the government, destroyed the factory, killed the plants.  It becomes as impossible situation, and why would Congress ever have adopted a definition like that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I'm sure that's true.  They wouldn't be that worried about the unprofitable criminal enterprises because they wouldn't last very long.  But there's the... there still is the problem of proof--   Samuel A.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It seems to me that what Kentucky is trying to do is to, at least in part, provide make-whole benefits for a police officer who becomes disabled below the age of 55.  So what they want to do is to say we want to give you the benefit that you would have received if you had not been hurt on the job and therefore unable to work and had been able to work to the normal retirement age.  Now, if that's correct, is that an illegitimate objective?  And if it's not an illegitimate objective, is there any way that they can do that consistent with your understanding of the ADEA?  Because when someone is over the retirement age, it's rather hard to see how many years you would add on projecting how long that person would continue to work beyond the age of retirement eligibility.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if they want to do that and they have a case of a police officer who works beyond 55... the officer is 55-plus with 10 years of service and then becomes disabled... you say they have to give that person 10 years of credit.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But if do you that, aren't you going to be... you're going to be undercompensating the younger person who gets disabled and overcompensating the people over 55 who gets disabled who may not... it may not be realistic to think that someone's going to continue to work as a police officer until 65.

And where a service is widely available in response to the marketplace, for a State to dictate to shippers that they should use one service as opposed to another, we think would have... it would be a different analysis under Morales.  The Court in Morales said that the test was whether there was a significant effect on the carriers.  And where, as here, we have the three major carriers all providing, for example, an adult-signature-required service, for the... for a State to say, well, when you ship alcohol, you have to use that available service, that would not have much of an effect at all on the carriers.

Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What if you have the situation -- and I think actually your -- your co-Respondent's case illustrates this better than yours.  But you have a situation where the record as it has developed contains some evidence that supports the -- the veteran's position, some evidence that supports the position in favor of denial of benefits.  The -- the Veterans Administration, all the way up through the process, finds that the evidence contrary to the veteran's position is much stronger and denies the claim on that basis.  The veteran says: I didn't get notice of what exactly I needed to prove.  Now, if on remand to the regional office it's still going to be -- it's going to be up to the veteran to come forward with medical evidence showing hearing loss or vision -- connecting the vision loss to something that happened in the service, why does it make sense to send it back if there's no possibility that the veteran is going to be able to do that when the case gets back?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But why doesn't it make sense in your case?  I think this illustrates what is troubling to me about the Federal Circuit's decision, but maybe I am missing a point.  Your client was denied benefits for failure to show a causal connection, to show that his -- his vision loss is service-related.  He provided evidence from two private ophthalmologists or optometrists providing very weak causes -- evidence of causation.  One said it was not inconceivable that this was the cause of it.  He was examined by two VA doctors, who said it was more likely that this was caused by a post-service infection rather than by an explosion while he was in -- while he was in the service.  Now, if the case -- if the notice was defective, why does it not make sense to say to your client, show us that you can come up with some medical evidence that shows that this is service-related, something more than a doctor who says it's not inconceivable?  Then it makes sense to remand it.  But if you can't do it on appeal, what sense does it make to remand it, where the same failure to provide evidence is going to doom his claim?   Samuel A.

The -- the argument that is made on the other side is that the Native Hawaiians have a moral claim to these lands, not that they have a property right claim to the land.  And if the State of Hawaii, acting through any branch of its government -- and that's not a matter of concern to us -- says they have a moral claim to the land and, therefore, there should not be any land transfers for some period of time, what's inconsistent with Federal law in their doing that?   William M. Jay  Let me answer that in two steps, Justice Alito.  The first step is that the State supreme court's permanent injunction, although Respondents are now saying that the claims on which -- the unrelinquished claims on which it is based are moral in nature -- the permanent injunction is a legal obligation and enforceable by contempt.  And so the State -- the State supreme court, by effectively locking up the lands for an indeterminate period of time, has treated them as -- as legally valid and has entered relief that is legal in nature.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What if it's the State's position--   William M. Jay  --It's a State--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --that it's -- it is imposing a moratorium on land transfers because it thinks this is the best way to promote the interests of the Native Hawaiians, and part of their thinking is that there was an inequity done when absolute title was transferred to the United States and then to the State of Hawaii?  Would that be a violation of Federal law?   William M. Jay  --Well, I think, Justice Alito, that if the State made that determination with respect to the class of Native Hawaiians who are defined in the Admission Act as -- as one of the present-day beneficiaries of the trust, and determined that it was -- that that was the best way to act for the betterment of Native Hawaiians, which is a permissible trust purpose, that that would be permissible.  But for the State to -- to act on considerations that are wholly extrinsic to the trust, to treat the Native -- the claims of Native Hawaiians as valid, even though they are -- and to assume a duty to the Native Hawaiians that has nothing to do with the State's obligations as trustee of the section 5(f) trust, we think that would be impermissible.

How is your argument here consistent with that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But... well, the meaning of a RICO conspiracy in the criminal context is very well known.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Does your argument depend on the quality of the recordkeeping in this particular department?  I thought your argument would apply even if this department had excellent recordkeeping procedures but nevertheless made a mistake in this instance.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You're not asking for Arizona v. Evans to be overruled are you.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But none of that matters for your argument, does it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You want to make it -- you want to draw a clear line between errors by -- by clerical court employees versus errors by police employees.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How expeditious would it be -- suppose there's negligence on the part of both a court employee and a police department employee.  What is the judge supposed to do in deciding the suppression motion?  Is this a comparative negligence determination.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How are -- how are you going to determine whether there's error without determining whether there's negligence?  Suppose the court clerk calls up the police department and says the warrant is still outstanding, and in fact it's not.  And it sends them over a physical copy of a warrant, but that warrant has been withdrawn.  Now, the police could always take additional steps: They could send someone over to check the records, to look at the court docket to make sure that the warrant had not been withdrawn.  So there would be causality, but it would not determine what they should--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --what their duty was.  How are you going to determine where this error should be -- should be assigned?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Let me give you another example.  Suppose that the court clerk calls up and says -- it leaves a message, gives a message to somebody in the police department.  And they memorialize that, and they say ""called up"".  And let's say the warrant number is the same as the docket number of this case.  So the court employee says -- writes down ""Called up"", says,  ""Warrant quashed in warrant, in case 07-513. ""  The court -- the police department has a record of the call, and they say,  ""Received call from court clerk. ""  ""Warrant to be quashed. ""  ""Warrant quashed in case 07-531. ""  And so the 513 is not quashed; the person is arrested.  Now, who caused that?  You have to have a hearing?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How do you know that the police department wrote down the wrong number?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How do you know what number was--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --Well, what's the justification for drawing a distinction between a court employee and everybody who works for the police department?

Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And if that rule is applied in this case, you would lose; would you not?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What does contemporaneous have to do with officer safety?  It has to do with timing, doesn't it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Let's say when an arrest is made, 25 SWAT team officers are there.  The person arrested is a person of slight stature.

And yet it would turn out that the submission of the erroneous theory did not have a substantial or injurious effect.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Aren't there going to be cases in which there's enough evidence to support the submission of a theory of liability to the jury, but so little that the court is going to be able to say that it's harmless under -- that the submission of the invalid theory was harmless under Brecht?     Yes.  I mean, you can image in a case -- take Neder.  By this Neder instruction, the one omitting the materiality element, was submitted to the jury certainly enough evidence to support it, and then there was another valid theory--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  There is difference.  An element of the offense has to be submitted to the jury.  And it may be that that it's -- the element is undisputed, but a theory of liability isn't going to be submitted to the jury unless there is some evidence to support it.     --Well, Your Honor, if -- if there is some evidence to support it, if we were in a direct review context, that's the inquiry that Neder says.  So on a clean slate it might be that if there is sufficient evidence to support a contrary verdict, that that would end the inquiry.  But in many of these cases we are going to know that the jury has made at least some findings, has found some of the elements.  And that might inform the harmless error inquiry, just like in this as we know that the jury has found things like a respondent was a major participant, exhibited a reckless disregard for human life, discounted a significant portion of this -- of his statement by rejecting the duress defense.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Does the FTC at this point in 2008 have an opinion about whether the tar and nicotine figures that are produced by this testing method are meaningful or misleading?     --Well, as Your Honor is aware, we submitted a -- a supplemental authority letter that in July of this year the Commission issued a request for comment on a proposal to rescind its guidance with respect to the tar and nicotine test results, precisely because of concern that they are misleading due to the evidence that has developed about the incidence of compensation.  That was not believed at the time that the Commission issued its guidance back in 1966 and '67 to present a significant problem.  But it is evident now.  The scientific community indicates and certainly the findings of fact in the RICO case are that the -- that the tobacco companies have known since 1967 that in fact compensation is nearly complete, and for that reason, the tar and nicotine yields via the Cambridge test method are not indicative of the yield to a true human smoker.  And for that reason, it proposed to withdraw.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Would it be -- would it be unfair to say that for quite sometime now, nearly 40 years, the FTC has passively approved the placement of these tar and nicotine figures in advertisement?     With respect to the -- I want first to take issue with the question of FDA context, to Riegel and the like, and that is not the nature of what the Federal Trade Commission does.  It doesn't stand--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, you passed a rule to require it, did you not?     --We proposed a rule to require the disclosure of tar and nicotine--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And you withdrew that after the companies voluntarily agreed to place the information on the ads--     --That's correct.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --and entered into consent decrees with other companies requiring them to put information in their ads.     No.  The consent decrees did not require them to put the information in their ads.  It said that it would be deceptive to make claims about the tar and nicotine content of the cigarettes without expressing, in milligrams, what the yield was per the Cambridge test method.  But that's a very different thing.  It's a prohibition.  They were ordered to cease and desist making claims about tar and nicotine content without giving the consumer the benefit of the yield figures.  But the Commission has never -- specifically at issue in this case are the descriptors ""light"" or ""lower in tar"".  In 1997, the Commission issued a notice in which it said these terms are are not defined by Federal law.  They asked whether there should be--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Was there a different between saying ""light"" and saying ""lower in tar"" in accordance with the Cambridge testing method?     --Yes, Your Honor, because the -- the ""light"", on its own, much more conveys the impression to the consumer that this is the yield to the consumer himself, the actual human smoker, and in fact that was why the--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The FTC's position seems to me incomprehensible.  If these figures are meaningless, then you should have prohibited them -- are misleading, you should have prohibited them a long time ago.

And if they are misleading, then you have misled everybody who's bought those cigarette for a long time.     --They -- whether they are or are not misleading depends upon the incidence of compensation.  At the time the Commission issued its guidance in 1966 and '67, the HEW report was that compensation was not expected to be a problem.  It was not believed to be a problem.  Beginning in 1983, when in light of the Barclay's case in which it was determined that a particular cigarette, the yield according to the test method had nothing to do with yield to an actual consumer, the FTC started to inquire about this.  But the Petitioners, although they have known since 1967 about the incidence of compensation, failed to disclose that information to the Commission.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  When the issue, when the -- the claim is based on the evaluation of the truthfulness of a witness who eventually testifies at trial, where's the line to be drawn between the investigative stage and the prosecutorial stage?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What concerns me about your argument is the -- is a real fear that it will eviscerate Imbler.  Now, maybe you can convince me that it will not have that effect, but as the Solicitor General argued at the end of his argument, a very -- in the typical criminal case, the witnesses are not John Q. Public with -- who have never engaged in any wrongful activity.  A typical witness is -- well, let's take the case of the prosecution of a -- a white -- of the CEO of a huge corporation for insider trading or some other white-collar violation.  And the chief witness against this person is, let's say, the CFO of this company, who when initially questioned by law enforcement officials and investigatory officials, made -- made statements denying any participation in any wrongdoing, but eventually changed his story and testifies against the--  CEO at trial in exchange for consideration in a plea deal.  Now, your argument, in a case like that -- or you could change the facts, make it an organized crime case, make it a prosecution of a drug kingpin who's testifying -- the witness against him is a lower-ranking person in the organization who has a criminal record, maybe has previously committed perjury, has made numerous false statements, is subject to impeachment.  In all of those cases a claim could be brought against the prosecutor.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I mean, that might be true as an empirical matter, but I don't understand why it would be hard to allege.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What would you have to allege to get by Iqbal or to get by summary judgment?  You allege that the testimony at trial was false and that the prosecutor knew that it was false.  And in support of that you have prior inconsistent statements by the witness, and you may have the evidence that was introduced by the defense at trial that is inconsistent with that.  You have a triable issue.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You certainly get by 12(b)(6).   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why is it difficult to allege fabrication?  The -- the allegation is that at point A this witness denied that the defendant did anything wrong, and then at point B the defendant told an entirely different story after having received from the government a plea deal that promises no prosecution and entry into the witness protection program or something like that.  That certainly is sufficient evidence to -- of fabrication, is it not?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's an entirely false picture of the way any sophisticated prosecution is handled today, completely false.  You want -- the prosecutor may not know whether there's probable cause until the prosecutor interviews the witness.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And so then you have to go back and determine whether there was -- if there wasn't probable cause before the interview, then there is liability.  But if there was probable cause before the interview, then there isn't liability.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Before the re-interview, because the prosecutor doesn't want to take the case to the grand jury before looking this witness in the eye and seeing whether this -- this guy who's got a lot of impeachment baggage is -- is a -- is a credible witness.

Alito, Jr.  In -- in answer to Justice Breyer's question, would -- would it be a -- would it be practical and conceptually correct to draw the line at the stage at which the prosecutor is interviewing witnesses to evaluate credibility?

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. Rothfeld, I wondered if I could ask you about three interrelated points concerning your textual argument.  And if I could just lay those on the table and get your reaction to them, I would appreciate it.  The first is that it appears that there is a pretty universally accepted modern legislative drafting convention that statutes should be phrased in the present tense.  The Senate drafting manual, for example, says: Always use the present tense unless the provision addresses only the past, the future, or a sequence of events that requires use of a different tense.  And the House manual is to the same effect.  The second is that when the section that's involved here, 2250, was drafted, the drafters didn't know whether SORNA would apply to pre-SORNA sex offense convictions.  That was left up to the Attorney General.  And so when they were drafting this, they had -- it was natural, perhaps, for them not to make a special provision for the possibility that there might be some pre-SORNA conduct involved.  If the Attorney General had determined that only post-SORNA convictions would qualify, then only -- then the only travel that would qualify would be -- would be post-SORNA travel.  It was only when the Attorney General decided that pre-SORNA convictions could qualify that the question that's presented here became a possibility.  And the third is that once the Attorney General decided that SORNA would apply to pre-SORNA sex offense convictions, that necessarily meant that conduct constituting a -- a SORNA -- constituting a qualifying sex offense could occur in the past.  And yet there are at least four provisions of SORNA that refer to the conduct that constitutes a sex offense and uses only the present tense, although in those instances it seems that those provisions have to be read as also covering past conduct, pre-SORNA conduct.  These are all in 42 U.S.C. 16911, which is reproduced -- the relevant provisions are on 3a to 3-6 of the government's brief.  I'll just mention a couple of them to provide a flavor for this.  Under 42 U.S.C. section 16911(3)(C), on 3a of the government's brief, an offense may qualify as a tier II offense if, among other things, it, quote,  ""occurs after the offender becomes a tier I sex offender. ""  But there ""occurs"" and ""becomes"" have to be read as applying to past conduct.  42 U.S.C. 1691(4) on the same page says that an offense may qualify as a tier III offense if, among other things, it involves a kidnapping of a minor.  But ""involves"" there has to mean also ""involved"".  And the other two are subsection (7) on 5a and subsection (8) on 6a.  So I wondered if you could comment on that.  Maybe you have a reaction to it.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I thought that the sequence argument that the government was making was that the events have to occur in this sequence: the conviction, the interstate travel, and the failure to register.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, they might be wrong on that.  And I understood that you agreed that the interstate travel has to take effect -- has to occur after the sex offense conviction.  It wouldn't -- you couldn't violate -- you wouldn't violate SORNA if there's interstate travel, then the conviction, and then the failure to register.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, but they might be wrong that the sequence -- that the way these set out -- are set out in the statute dictates a temporal sequence--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --that you can argue that the temporal sequence that's necessary -- conviction, travel, failure to register -- follows from the purpose of this provision, which is to catch people who, after having committing a sex offense and being convicted of a sex offense in State A, move to State B.  It would follow from the purpose of the statute, not necessarily from the sequence of subsections in this provision.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that makes -- that makes a lot of sense.  But you can get that from the purpose of the statute, rather than from the sequence in which these elements are listed.  Is it -- is it usually the case in a criminal statute that sets out a number of element that they have to be satisfied in some kind of temporal sequence?  I'm not aware of that.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, let's compare two cases.  We have this case, where you have conviction, interstate travel, SORNA takes effect, failure to register.  We change that.  That's case A.  Case B is just like this case except the sequence is different.  You have conviction, SORNA takes effect, interstate travel, failure to register.  Now, why would Congress have treated those two situations differently?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Isn't the concern that the State of conviction knows that an individual who has been convicted of a sex offense has been released from custody and, if that person is a resident of the State, presumably knows that the person is likely to still be in the State, but if the person moves to another State, the State to which the person moves doesn't know that a sex offender has moved into the State, and that's the reason for the Federal law that imposes a penalty for failing to register in the new State after having traveled across interstate lines?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But all of those provisions refer now -- as a result of the Attorney General's determination that pre-SORNA convictions qualify, all of those provisions use the present tense to refer to activities that can have taken place in the past.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  This very -- this very statute.  Isn't that correct?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, but your main argument is that ""travels"" is in the present tense, and that means present and future.  But there are provisions of this very statute that use the present tense to refer to past conduct.  So why doesn't that knock the legs out from under your textual argument?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, Mr. Gannon may have made an argument that's not helpful to his position, but you can accept that the first provision means exactly what it says: ""is required to register"".  And that takes effect on day when SORNA is enacted.  There's nothing in the statute that says that those three events have to take place in -- in a temporal sequence.  It doesn't say  ""is required to register and thereafter travels in interstate commerce. ""  It doesn't say that.  In fact, an earlier version did say that, and it was taken out, wasn't it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It doesn't if that results from the aim of the statute, rather than the order in which those elements are set out in the statute.   ",08-1301

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. McConnell, when I read -- when I read the papers that Hastings submitted to the district court at the same time that the joint stipulation was submitted, I saw one reference after another to an allegation that Hastings was applying its policy in a discriminatory manner, that it was not in fact insisting that all registered student organizations admit all applicants.  And when I read their brief in the Ninth Circuit, I saw that point reiterated again and again.  So that led me to believe that what was stipulated was not that in fact they had a policy which they enforced under which anybody who applied to any group would be admitted, but that this was what Dean Kane had announced.  That was the stated policy, but not necessarily the actual policy that was employed.  And that was the argument it seemed to me that CLS was making; isn't that correct?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And was there any written document memorializing this policy prior to the time when the former dean gave her deposition?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And is the -- is the policy as articulated by the dean in her deposition the same as the policy that Hastings now claims it has in its brief?   ",08-1371

Alito, Jr.  So the answer is yes, this case which is -- before us has produced hundreds and hundreds of pages of amicus briefs, deserved two sentences in the court of appeals?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But hasn't it been -- hasn't it been CLS's position from the very beginning of this case that Hastings has not in fact required every group to admit any student who applies?  Don't they say that over and over again in their district court papers, in the court of appeals briefs, and in the cert petition?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But you now say--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --You now say in your brief that it is okay for a group to impose membership requirements that are neutral and not based on beliefs.  Isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, let's explore--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --Let's explore the implications of this policy.  Suppose at a particular campus there is a great deal of anti-Muslim animus.  And there's a small Muslim group; it has 10 students.  If the group is required to accept anybody who applies for membership, and 50 students who hate Muslims show up and they want to take over that group, you say the First Amendment allows that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, CLS obviously thinks this is a real threat.  Now, what do you propose that they do?  Suppose that you win this case, and then when the case -- and then when this all-applicants policy is administered, then precisely what they fear begins to take place.  Do they have any recourse?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, do they have any--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --Do they have any recourse?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If they have 10 members, and 8 who are completely hostile to the organization sign up?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I understand the answer to that question.  So, if -- if hostile members take over CLS, the former members of CLS can form CLS II?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If an orthodox--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --If an orthodox Jewish group or a Muslim group applied for recognition and the group said part of our beliefs is -- one of our beliefs is that men and women should sit separately at religious services, would Hastings deny registration to that group?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  We have -- we have two amicus briefs from orthodox Jewish groups and a brief from a Muslim group.  So, your answer is that they could not be recognized under Hastings' policy because of their religious beliefs regarding the way religious services should be conducted?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  As I understood the position, your latest position in your brief, you really don't say you have an all-comers policy.  There are certain criteria that can be applied, like interest, knowledge; is that correct?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could a -- well, could a group, consistent with your revised all-comers policy, require that members who want -- anyone who wants to become a member show a particular level of knowledge about the subject of the group?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if the CLS required anybody who wanted to become a member to pass a test on the Bible, that would be okay?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If the school adopt an all-comers policy--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --for the purpose--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --Well, could I just ask one quick question relating to that?  If -- if an all-comers policy is adopted for the purpose of discriminating on the basis of viewpoint, does it violate the First Amendment?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If this were an employment case, and when an employee is denied promotion the employee said it's for reason A, and then after litigation begins the employer says, well, no, it really wasn't for reason A, it was for reason B because of a policy that we've long had, but there's never -- there's no written documentation of this new policy; and then at a later point in the litigation the employer says, well, it wasn't really either for reason A or reason B; it was for reason C -- do you think that summary judgment could be granted in favor of the employer on the issue of pretext?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, section 66270 applies to programs conducted by a post-secondary educational institution, and your position is that if -- if a religious group complies with your policies and then it conducts religious services, those religious services are conducted by Hastings?

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The statistical issue is very interesting, but I -- I wonder, if we were not looking at this through AEDPA, why we -- why a court should necessarily have to start with the question -- with the elements of the prima facie -- with the question of whether there is unconstitutional underrepresentation, when in the end, as I understand Duren, the defendant has to identify some aspect of the jury selection process that has a disproportionate impact on the group involved and is unreasonable?  And unless that can be done at the outset, why struggle with these statistics?  Now, here, to illustrate, the aspect of the jury selection process that the Sixth Circuit thought was unreasonable was the prior practice of choosing the jurors first for the district courts, the misdemeanor courts, rather than the circuit courts, the -- the felony courts.  But the -- the trial judge, it seemed to me, address this in -- in a very thoughtful way, and he said there just isn't any proof that this old system had that effect.  And it's hard for me to see how it could have that effect, unless the -- the number of jurors chosen for the district courts in Grand Rapids was disproportionate to the number chosen for the district courts in the other jurisdictions within the county.  So that seems to me to be the end of the case.  And why does it make sense to -- to struggle with this rather complicated statistical problem, if at the end of the day, it's going to come down to something of that nature?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But concluding that it's systematic doesn't mean that the defendant wins.  It just means that the State has to -- has to justify the -- the mechanism that's causing -- that's causing this -- this situation.   INTERRUPTING ",08-1402
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It says that the State has to show that it has a reason, a good reason, for -- the aspect of the selection process that has been identified as causing the disparity.  But does it say that it's the State's obligation to go through every factor that may cause the disparity and justify every one?  Or is it the defendant's obligation to point to some aspect of the selection -- of the -- of the system that causes the disparity?  Then once the defendant identifies that, then the State can show if it -- can try to show that there's a good reason for it.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But that's the only factor that the Sixth Circuit identified as illegitimate, was this -- was this siphoning system.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It rejected everything else, didn't it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Are there -- are there courts that you know of that do what you are suggesting needs to be done?  When a juror does not show up, the judge issues a bench warrant, and -- and the police are sent out to arrest the person and drag the person into court, or somebody says, I am a single parent, and I have children, and I'm too poor to have a nanny or an au pair, and, therefore, please excuse me; and they say, no, you have to find some way of getting here.  Are there courts that do that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Isn't that the case--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --If -- if Grand -- if Grand Rapids uses a disproportionate number of jurors in its district courts, then you are going to have this problem -- the only way to fix the problem would be to have a separate jury system for the district courts.  If you have the -- the circuit courts going first, then the people in the district courts are going to have the problem that you identify.  If you have a system in which it's all done randomly -- circuit court, district court -- the people who come toward the end are going to have the problem.  So I don't see any way out of this, if in fact there was a statistical basis for it, other than having a separate selection process for the district courts.  Is that what you think is necessary?

Alito, Jr.  You addressed the -- the effect of the issue here on persons who are in State institutions other than penal institutions.  What would be -- what's the effect of the issue here on land use restrictions?  Are there many cases in which issues involving land use restrictions are -- are raised in litigation against the State as opposed to a municipality?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Suppose Congress passes a statute that creates a private right of action against both the Federal Government and against the States and in both instances authorizes all appropriate relief.  Are damages available in the action against the Federal Government as well as the State government?   Sarah Harrington  Well, it would depend on the context to answer both questions.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, the State -- the State provision is a Spending Clause provision.   Sarah Harrington  Then the answer would be yes as to the States.  This Court has been clear in cases such as Franklin and Barnes that in the Spending Clause context, unless Congress indicates an intent to rebut the presumption somehow--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And what about the Federal Government?   Sarah Harrington  --In the Federal Government probably not, although this Court has looked to background principles in interpreting words such as ""appropriate"".   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What sense does that make?  Other than -- I know you are representing a client and so special pleading for your client is -- is to be expected, but I find that very difficult to accept.  If ""all appropriate relief"" includes damages as against the State that accepts Federal money, then you know, what's good for the State should be good for the Federal Government.   Sarah Harrington  Well, I would say two things.  First, in both cases what you want is a clear statement of an intent to waive the sovereign's immunity, either by the Federal Government or the State government.  And also that it's important to keep in mind that in cases such as Franklin and Barnes, this Court was construing statutes that did not say anything about what remedies were appropriate, didn't mention remedies whatsoever.  And so we don't rely so much on RLUIPA's use of the phrase ""appropriate relief"" as we do on the Spending Clause context.   ",08-1438

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  As far as the interests of your client are concerned, is there any functional difference between what happened here and what could happen very routinely even if the board had five members, namely that after the case was assigned to a three-member panel one of the three members of the panel became unable to sit on that case, but the remaining two members were able to reach agreement so the case could be decided?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  There is a well-established practice on the court of appeals that when a three-judge panel for some reason loses one of the members due to a death or resignation or recusal, the panel can continue to decide the case if the remaining two judges can agree.  And -- and do you see -- do you think the -- the situation is different with the NLRB for some reason?  Or do you think that that -- that those decisions on the courts of appeals are unlawful as well?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

Is that -- is that not correct?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The amicus says that the members of the board not serving on a panel are given the opportunity to review draft decisions, thus no case will issue unless it reflects the majority opinion of the full board.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So that can be, in effect, the opportunity for full board review before a draft decision is issued in final form; is that the way it works?   Samuel A.

First, there isn't any opportunity for full board review of cases.  But more important, if you have only two members on the board and only two members on the panel, the process is very different from a panel in which there were three members, or in which two members can be supplemented with an additional member if they can't agree.

Are the courts of appeals unanimous on the question of whether the enforceability of an arbitration agreement by a nonparty is a question of State law?  I think there's at least a Fourth Circuit decision that says it's a question of Federal law, but why -- why do we have to decide that and why is your argument dependent on it?  Suppose that is -- suppose that were a question of Federal law, what would that -- I mean, it might change the ultimate outcome of whether there's an entitlement to a stay, but I don't see why it has any effect on a question of whether there is jurisdiction.

It is simply their -- their argument is that it informs an interpretation of the language of EEOA, which is that the State is required to take appropriate action, which is a very vague standard.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can I ask you this question about the Ninth Circuit's decision, which is what we are reviewing?  Suppose -- I know there -- there is a debate about how well Nogales is doing at this time.  But let's suppose Nogales came in, and they said this: We had plan A back when this was originally litigated, and now we have an entirely different plan, and this plan doesn't cost one penny more than what we were spending in 2000.  But it is a very good plan, and it has produced very good results.  As I read the Ninth Circuit's decision, they would not grant relief from the judgment under those circumstances, because they focus exclusively on incremental funding for EEL programs and Arizona's funding model.  Isn't that correct?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, but isn't -- that isn't really my question.  Isn't -- isn't it the case that the Ninth Circuit judged the -- the permissibility of relief under 60(b) solely with regard to incremental funding and Arizona's funding model?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's the way it was litigated originally, but I thought the whole focus of the motion for relief from the judgment was: We have a new plan, and it is not tied to funding, and it will produce good results without looking at incremental EEL funding.  And wasn't the Ninth Circuit obligated to look at that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why does it matter that there is -- why focus on incremental funding for ELL programs exclusively?  What difference does it make where the money comes from -- where it comes from, putting aside federal money that can't be supplanted?  I just don't understand that.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that may have been their -- that may have been their position originally, but at the time of the 60(b) hearing, what difference does it make whether the money came from funds that were designated for ELL program, or from general State funds, or from county funds?  What difference does it make whether the money was taken from some other program that the school was operating?  Suppose they fund -- they take the money for the ELL programs from money that was previously used for music instruction, or art, or gym, or teaching German or anything else.  Now those may all be bad things, but what does that have to be with the EEOA?   Samuel A.

What -- what is the government -- what is the burden on the government, and what would be the burden on Chicago or the State of Illinois in a requirement that within some reasonably brief period of time after that that there must be the equivalent of the filing of a complaint in court, just as you would for the arrest of an individual without a warrant, where the only issue would be whether there was probable cause for the seizure, not whether there, you know, is some innocent owner defense, but just whether there's probable cause?

Is that your figure?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, whatever the period is: 10 days, 14 days, whatever.  Some short period.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I have two questions: Must it be an adversarial hearing, and must the State disprove the innocent owner defense?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, but my understanding of Krimstock is that a lot of those seizures -- and others know more about this than I do -- were for DWI, and that it is possible to assert an innocent owner defense there.  And that's where I see a great impracticality in this.  I -- I don't see how you can expect the State to come into court within such a short period and have any burden of contesting an innocent owner defense without compromising a criminal investigation.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, let me give you this example which is pretty much based on something that you -- you wrote in your own brief.  Joe is arrested on a drug offense driving a car, and there are drugs in the car.  But Joe isn't the owner of the car; John is the owner of the car.  Then John comes in 10 days later or 14 days later and says, well, you know, I never had any inkling that Joe was using the car to deal in drugs and had no reason to know that.  And you think that within that short period of time the State has to disprove that, you know, that John didn't have--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --reason to believe that Joe was involved in drug dealing?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, the situation is much worse than that, that they don't have the -- that they need time to investigate.  They may have the registered owner under investigation.  They may think he is involved in the drug conspiracy as well.  They may have him on wiretaps.  They may be preparing to arrest him.  Now, you want to force them to come into court within 10 or 14 days and disclose the details of a -- of a pending criminal investigation and prepare to -- that makes a great--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --Well, then I don't understand how this -- how you can possibly have the innocent owner issue adjudicated at this quick hearing.  I can understand the argument that you have to have the filing of the equivalent of a -- of a complaint when you -- that has to be filed when someone is arrested without a warrant, where it's not adversarial and you establish probable cause for the seizure.  But when you start to go beyond that in drug forfeiture cases, at least, not -- not DWI cases, I just don't see how that's workable.   INTERRUPTING ",08-351X
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Price Waterhouse was a bench trial.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And Mount Healthy was a bench trial, wasn't it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Now, would the -- if there is a direct evidence requirement, it may arguably cause a great deal of problem when the trial judge has to give an instruction to the jury, because then the -- the jury will first have to decide whether a particular type of evidence is present in the case before it can tell what -- who has the burden of proof and what the standard is.  But if Price Waterhouse is understood simply as a way for a judge conducting a bench trial to look at the evidence, does it present any of the problems that have been identified with the Price Waterhouse -- that interpretation of Price Waterhouse as applied to jury trials?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if it's just an instruction to a judge conducting a bench trial, it could mean that if the -- if the judge sitting as the trier of fact finds that there is direct evidence, strong evidence supporting the plaintiff's claim, then the judge will need to have strong evidence, stronger evidence on the other side in order to rule against the plaintiff.  It's not hard to figure out how it might work out in that situation.  The problem comes when it has to be posed in the form of a jury instruction.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But Desert Palace was a Title VII case, wasn't it, under the 1991 amendment to Title VII?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can I ask you this?  Do you think that there is a tenable distinction between a mixed motives case and a non-mixed motives case?  In every employment discrimination case that gets beyond summary judgment, aren't there mixed motives at play?   Lisa S. Blatt  --I think there's a lot to be said for that argument, and this is a very difficult and unsettled question under Title VII.  I think what would be on the table if this Court ever had an appropriate vehicle -- and this certainly is not the appropriate vehicle to get into this question -- there would be several options on the table.  You could have what your view suggests, which is after summary judgment you could get a motivating factor instruction, that the jury would be permitted to find both impermissible and permissible motives.  You could also have a special verdict form that asks the jury: Do you find that there were two causes, one of which was an impermissible factor?  And you could have a situation which I think prevails in trial courts now -- and has been the EEOC's practice -- which is -- and it's not the most analytically clean, but they basically give the instruction, either a determinative cause or motivating factor instruction, on what they think best fits the evidence.  And I think it's important for the Court to understand, as we -- the law exists now under Title VII and under all the other anti-discrimination acts, there are two regimes out there.  There's a mixed motive regime and a determining factor regime.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is there any -- is there any empirical evidence to show whether any of this really makes a difference.  Have there been studies on the effect of the 1991 amendments, whether they have made a difference in the way cases actually come out?   Lisa S. Blatt  --No.  Let me just say two responses.  Not that I have seen empirical.  I can tell you the EEOC's experience, and that is they sometimes prefer a ""but for"" all the burden being on them, and sometimes they prefer the motivating factor instruction.  And despite what Respondent points out, they have some defendants that think they like the affirmative defense.  So I -- and sometimes counsel just agree on what the instruction should be.  And it hasn't caused that much of a problem, although there is a lot of confusion about this kind of case, where the defendant is insisting on one instruction and the plaintiff wants another instruction.  And that's what Judge Colloton is reserving in a footnote saying: On remand I am going to have to sort this out.   Samuel A.

There may be an issue as to what the assistant principal could reasonably infer from the facts that were known by him, whether he could reasonably infer facts that would create a reasonable suspicion that there were drugs hidden in the plaintiff's undergarments.  Is that a question for -- for the finder of fact in a case like this, so that it can't be -- there can't be summary judgment for either side unless no reasonable factfinder could find to the contrary?

They need -- the school needed to have a direct statement from Marissa Glines that -- that Redding had the -- had the pills in her undergarments; is that correct?   David O'Neil  --The particularized suspicion could come from information from students that reliably adverted to the location of the contraband.  That's the--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But you have to have direct evidence that the -- the -- it can't be based on inferences?   David O'Neil  --No--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is that the distinction you are drawing?  The location has to be supported by direct evidence.  Somebody has to say that that's where it is.   David O'Neil  --No, Justice Alito.  We believe that if teachers were aware of the general practice and it was common knowledge that students did hide contraband in this way and -- that would be relevant to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether this student was following that practice.  But we don't believe that the examples that were provided in Petitioners' reply brief establish anything like that practice.  Petitioners cite 8 cases over the course of approximately 30 years in which contraband was found in those locations.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If Marissa Glines had said specifically that Savana Redding has pills someplace on her person and she's going to distribute them at lunch in the cafeteria, would this be a different case?   David O'Neil  --It may well, Justice Alito.  In that circumstance it would likely be the reasonable thing for the teacher--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is the difference between that situation and this situation?  The differences are slight.  Wouldn't that at least be a question that has to be decided by the trier of fact?   David O'Neil  --That may present a triable issue.  Here--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I mean, the student says, she has -- she has crack someplace on her person, and she's going to distribute it to kids during the lunch hour, and so they search her -- her garments, and they don't find it.

Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is that a question of law or is that a question that goes to the trier of fact, whether you could infer reasonable suspicion about the presence of the pills in those locations?     Adam B. Wolf  Right, because for the Ninth Circuit, this -- it was self-evident to the Ninth Circuit that the -- that there was not a reasonable inference.  And without that reasonable inference, there was no reason to treat it as a jury question, but if there were a reasonable inference, then it strikes me as something that might be -- that might be better suited for determination by the jury.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, to play the devil's advocate on that, why couldn't the assistant principal reason as follows: that he has information from -- from Ms. Glines that Ms. Redding has drugs.  He has information from another student that drugs are going to be consumed during the lunch hour.  Putting those two together, he reaches the -- he suspects that the person who has the drugs has the drugs on his or her person so that they can be distributed at lunch.  And then having searched every other part of -- having searched Ms. Redding's outer garments, what's left are her undergarments.  So therefore there's a reasonable suspicion that the drugs are -- are located there.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What's wrong with that?   Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  I thought you just said we could -- you were suggesting an -- as an alternative, that -- that Edwards be limited to situations where the questioning is about the same offense.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I mean, this isn't fanciful.  We just were asked to take a case involving a statute of limitations issue for a murder that was committed like 30 years ago, and it said suppose somebody is questioned by State authorities for a murder and taken into custody and then released and then, 30 years later, taken into custody by Federal authorities and questioned for a civil rights violation, based on the same underlying transaction.  You would say the Edwards rule applies in that situation?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I can think of -- I can think of at least one situation in which the Court has held that there is a time limit in which something has to be done in order to comply with a Constitutional requirement.

Now, I suppose by an analogy to what Justice Scalia just said about the message of dog fighting videos, the people who produce crush videos think they have a message, and the message is that this is -- this is sexually exciting or it's exciting in some way to see a woman in high heeled shoes crushing a little animal to death.  Do you think that is constitutionally protected?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You are not -- you are not even willing to say that that could be prohibited?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

Because we are trying to determine whether this is overly broad.  And this is the category of activity that Congress particularly targeted.  So to me at least it's important to know whether at least as applied to what Congress principally had in mind, the statute could -- could pass constitutional muster.  If it were, you know, as applied.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But in determining whether this is over -- overly broad, do we -- do we think of all of the hypotheticals that we possibly can think of that might fall within this statute: somebody hunting in the District of Columbia, somebody producing fois gras with a goose and say,  ""Well, we've thought of a lot of hypothetical situations where this statute might apply and therefore it's overly broad?

Alito, Jr.  If it's the fact that during the ten years when this statute has been in effect there has been no decrease in hunting videos and hunting shows on TV, and all of the rest -- the only perceptible change in the real world is that these -- is that the market for crush videos dried up, at least until the Third Circuit's decision, does that have any relevance?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, isn't that -- isn't that due to changes in technology?  Before people could show -- could watch videos at home, this sort of thing would -- would be very difficult.

INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If this is not a discretionary decision for the district court -- let's assume it's not a discretionary decision for the -- for the administrator.  But if it's -- and if it's also not a discretionary decision for the district court, if what the district court is required to do is to say what the plan means, what would you suggest that the district court should have looked to, when the -- the provision, the -- the plan language that the district court has to look at is very bare bones?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, Respondents say that this was a -- sure, it's a -- a benefit to them to be -- to have this offset only by the amount that they received and not take into account the time value of money, but this was an incentive that lured them into accepting employment again with Xerox.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Then I don't understand what the purpose of the remand from the Second Circuit to the district court, after the Second Circuit's first decision, was.  In other words, you're saying that they -- they found that anything other than an offset for the amount of money that was actually received by the beneficiary upon leaving Xerox would be -- would violate the notice requirements.   Matthew D. Roberts  Well, I don't--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So that interprets the plan.  There's nothing left to do, then.   Matthew D. Roberts  --I don't know that the -- that the court of appeals actually found that the first time around.  Our point is that that was the consequence of the lack of notice that was in -- in the summary plan description.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I understand you to be saying that the concept of any appreciation of that amount based on the time value of money is invalid, because there wasn't proper notice for that.  So there's nothing left to do on remand, it seems to me.  I don't understand what the purpose of the remand was.   Matthew D. Roberts  Well, I -- we -- we think in most cases, it would have been an abuse of discretion for the district court in light of the lack of notice in the summary plan description to apply an appreciated offset.  But the district court also did consider the reasonable expectations of the plan -- plan participants, and there might have been other countervailing considerations that could have been advanced by the -- the plan administrator, perhaps, about the financial solvency of the plan or some other matters, but -- but those weren't presented here.  The point is that, once the court -- when the court remanded, the first task for the district court on remand was to look at the plan terms because this was a benefit action, determine whether those plan terms addressed how to calculate the offset, but here, the court couldn't rely on the plan terms, really, for two reasons.  First, as the district court said, the plan said virtually nothing about how to do it; and, second, the point that I was making before, ERISA prohibited the court from adopting an interpretation that provided for more than the -- an offset greater than the face value.

What does the plan mean?  That would be the issue.  Isn't that the question, if there's no deference due to the administrator?   Samuel A.

Here the district judge in effect takes four plus million dollars from the taxpayers of Georgia and -- and awards it above the lodestar calculation to these attorneys and says -- and I -- I certainly take him at his word -- this was the best performance I have seen in 28 years.

And I wonder if you could explain why that is so.  Here, the City of Chicago continued to use this test for quite a number of years after it was administered.  And so as you interpret the statute, I gather that someone could still file a disparate impact claim 6 or 7 years after the test was first administered, and quite a few years after it was first used in making a hiring decision.  And how can that be squared with Congress's evident desire in Title VII to require that an EEOC charge be filed rather promptly after the employment action is taken?   Samuel A.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But isn't it the case that before the 2005 amendments, bankruptcy courts were recognized as having discretion in calculating projected disposable income to take into account changes in the debtor's income after the filing of the plan, and shouldn't we presume that -- that Congress intended to continue essentially the same regime, unless Congress provided some clear indication that they wanted to depart from it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It is odd that Congress provided this very detailed formula and -- and that they would provide such a detailed formula and then say: But the bankruptcy court can modify that based on a projection.  But still we have the word ""projection -- projected"".  And your interpretation leads to very strange, really absurd results; isn't that true?  And you have to devise some really elaborate escape strategies in order to allow a debtor to avoid those very strange results.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But you say that that can be done only if the debtor fails to file a form that the debtor is required to file; isn't that right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What do you do with the situation in which the change that is projected to occur and in fact may be almost certain to occur is one that causes an increase in the debtor's income?  Let's say the debtor was unemployed through almost all of the lookback period and then just before the filing of the plan gets a job with a good salary.  You would say that the -- if you just look at the lookback period, the debtor would be required to pay practically nothing.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is a creditor to do in that situation?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But can the -- can the plan be modified based on -- can the plan be modified based on something that was known before the plan was confirmed?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if it can't, then how is this modification remedy going to work?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Your argument is that the Court has to confirm a plan that is really not confirmable because the debtor can't possibly make the payments under the plan, but then can turn around immediately and modify the plan so that it does call for payments to be made.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I thought that -- explain it, then?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What do you say about cases in which moving the 6-month period can't solve the problem?  For example, if the debtor had good income for many years going back, but then slight -- shortly before the filing of the plan loses his or her job, and there is no prospect that the debtor is going to get another job?  Or it could be the converse, has very low income for a long period and then right before gets a job.  So you are not going to be able to cure those problems by moving the 6-month period.  What do you do then?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But do you think bankruptcy courts are supposed to be economic forecasters?  For example, if you -- after calculating the debtor's income during the 6-month period, the 6-month lookback period, should the bankruptcy court said, well -- say: Well, it's -- inflation is projected to be such-and-such over the term of this plan, so I am just going to increase it by the amount of inflation; or: This person works in a particular industry where historically, over the last five years or ten years, there's been a 3 percent increase in salary per year, so I'm going to multiply it by -- multiply the disposable income figure like that?   Sarah Harrington  Certainly not, Justice Alito.  Bankruptcy--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, why not?  You say that the bankruptcy courts should take into account things that are likely to occur in the future.   Sarah Harrington  --Well, bankruptcy courts -- we are not saying that bankruptcy courts should ever speculate about what might happen in the future.  What we are saying is that bankruptcy courts should take into account what they know, in this case, already has happened, but also what they know will happen.  And so to give an example of a change that would benefit creditors, if as -- as I mentioned earlier, if a debtor has secured a higher-paying job just before or just after she filed her petition, a Court should be able to take into account the fact that her income going forward would be greater than would be reflected in the calculation of her current disposable income.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What if the debtor is a waiter and during the last month of the 6-month period, because of some change of the economy the waiter's tips have gone up either way up or way down?  What's the court supposed to do then?   Sarah Harrington  --Well, I think one purpose of having the 6-month lookback period in the calculation of current income is exactly to take into account those situations.  There are many people who are gainfully employed full time, but whose -- whose income fluctuates over time.  And so requiring that courts use the 6-month lookback period, I think, gives creditors a better sense of whether the current income figure provided by the debtor is accurate.  It reduces the chance for strategic filing because it sort of takes some of the significance away of the time of filing.  And so it seems fairer in that case to consider that 6-month average in a case where income fluctuates up and down as an accurate sense of what the -- what the debtor's current income is.  And again, in many -- in a significant number of cases the calculation of a current disposable income will be a good prediction of what the debtor's disposable income will be going forward.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can I ask you this?  There seems to be at least a subtle difference between your position and the government's position.  You say that the projected disposable income will be different from the disposable income calculated during the lookback period when it is known or virtually certain that there will be differences in income or expenses.

Let me give 2 hypotheticals, and they both involve companies that have one product, and this is their one product.  The first one was what I mentioned before, and I wasn't -- I wasn't clear about your answer.  All that's alleged is that a very large number of people took the drug and that three people, after taking the drug, within a week developed a certain syndrome.  That's the first one.  Is that enough for materiality?  The second one is that a company receives a telephone call: Hello, I'm a general practitioner from wherever, and I treated a patient and the patient took your medication and shortly after that developed this syndrome, and I think there might be a connection.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  This drug, let's say it's a drug to relieve the common cold and the effect is loss of the sense of smell.  Five million people take it.  Three people, after taking it, lose their sense of smell.  Is that enough for materiality by itself?   Samuel A.

Have they been proceeding on the assumption that title to inventions vested in them automatically or have they been very careful about getting assignments from all of their employees?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  There are two things that cut very strongly against your argument.  I mean, there are many things that cut in favor of it, but the two things that seem to me to cut pretty strongly against your argument are: First, that it has long been the rule that inventors have title to their patents initially, even if they make those inventions while working for somebody else.  And the second is that you are relying on a provision that says that the nonprofit organization may elect to retain title, which means hold onto a title, that the -- the organization already has.  There's just no accepted definition of the word ""retain"" that corresponds to the meaning that you want to assign to that word.  ""Retain"" does not mean obtain.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Isn't it the case that at least some components, possibly many components, of the Federal Government for the last 30 years have been proceeding on that assumption that assignments were necessary?  The grants here were -- were from NIH, isn't that right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And one of the amicus briefs points out that the NIH compliance guidelines say by law an inventor has initial ownership of invention; however, awardee organizations are required by the Bayh-Dole Act to have in place employee -- employee agreements requiring an inventor to assign or give ownership of an invention to the organization--   ",09-1159

But this statute says if the taxpayers pay for the research, if the research is 100 percent funded by the taxpayers, taxpayers don't get the first priority.  The first priority goes to the universities.  So it's totally different from the vesting statute.  This is a Federal subsidy for universities and other nonprofits, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING ",09-1159

Alito, Jr.  The Federal law and the State law do seem to be exactly the same on this point, but I have -- I don't understand how these two provisions fit together when E-Verify is used.  Suppose an employer -- the first thing the employer does is receive the forms from the employee, from the I-9 process.  He looks at the forms.  Well, they reasonably seem to be authentic.  So that employer now has the good faith defense that's provided under -- by the I-9 process, under both Federal law and State law.  But under both Federal law and State law, the employee -- employer either must or may also use the e-verification system.  The employer gets back a notice of non-authorization.  But what -- and that creates, supposedly, a rebuttable presumption under both systems that the employee is not authorized to work.  How does that fit together?  If you have a complete defense for having used the I-9 process in good faith, the whole e-verification process seems to be irrelevant under both Federal law and State law.

Would they all have to be given individual notice and asked to opt out?   Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  Now, what does the ruling -- that doesn't speak to the number of personnel who are available in the system to attend to medical needs or mental illness?  It doesn't speak to the extent of the facilities that are available for those purposes.  It seems to be -- there seems to be a disconnect between those two.  Could you explain why that is narrowly tailored?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  See, that's what I don't understand.  You can have a -- could you not have a prison where the cells are somewhat crowded and 137.5 percent of designed capacity is not -- is not unconstitutional in itself, is it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You could have a prison where the -- the cells themselves are crowded, and yet there are other facilities available for medical care and plenty of staff to attend to those things.  So what's the connection?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But why order the release of around 40,000 prisoners, many of whom, perhaps the great majority of whom, are not going to be within the class in either of these lawsuits?  Why order the release of all those people, rather than ordering the provision of the construction of facilities for medical care, facilities to treat mental illness, hiring of staff to treat mental illness?  Why not go directly to the problem rather than address what seems to be a different issue altogether?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If all they do is to build more cells, they are not going to address the problem.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I still don't get it.

If -- if I were a citizen of California, I would be concerned about the release of 40,000 prisoners and I don't care what you term it, a prison release order or whatever the --   Samuel A.

Because a dying declaration may very well be testimonial under -- is likely to be testimonial under the Crawford test.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can there be--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --Can there be a situation in which the primary purpose for a statement or for the question that elicits the statement is to respond to an ongoing emergency rather than to gather evidence for subsequent use in a legal proceeding when the statement relates to something that has occurred, perhaps just a few seconds before, but it relates to something that has occurred as opposed to something that is occurring at that very moment?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But I understand, but we need to know where to draw the line.  So, you concede that the line is not between a statement about he is hitting me with a baseball bat as opposed to he just finished hitting me with a baseball bat and is headed out the door?  That is not where the line is drawn.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I really would like a clear answer to this.  Is -- can there be an ongoing emergency where the statement relates -- where the statement recounts something that has occurred, not something that is occurring?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, suppose they get a 9-1-1 call.  There's -- a man has just been shot on the corner of Fifth and Main.  They go to Fifth and Main; they find a man there; he's shot; he's bleeding profusely; he's in shock; and they know nothing more about what's happened.  And they say, well, what happened?  Well, he shot me.  Who shot you?  It's John Jones.  Now what about that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, the police under those circumstances don't know whether John Jones is going on a shooting spree; this is just the first of numerous victims.  Maybe it's a gang fight.  He's shot one member of an opposing gang; now he's going to go shoot another member of an opposing gang.  How can they -- how can you answer that question, what's the primary purpose there?  I just don't understand it.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I'm still trying to understand your conception of the scope of the ongoing emergency doctrine.  Would it be fair to say that your idea is that the police have to have specific evidence that there is an immediate threat of physical violence that they need to respond to, in order for the ongoing emergency doctrine to apply?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And in a case of doubt they can't do it.  So if they don't know whether there is an immediate threat or not an immediate threat then that doesn't fall within that exception; that's your idea?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I thought you just said that wasn't the test, past versus present.  Didn't you say that about 10 minutes ago, it's not the difference between something that is taking place and something that has taken place?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The witness has to say there is an emergency?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  There is a report of shooting at a school, and the police go and they find two students lying on the ground.  One is dead and the other is severely wounded and they ask the one who is wounded did it.  ""It's John Jones"".  Now does that -- is that an ongoing emergency?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No.  Why is it not an ongoing emergency?  What would be an ongoing emergency?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That is a very specific information.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What if there are three students who have been shot, four students who have been shot, but nobody says, well, I think he's still in the building, he may have an interest in shooting some more students?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Of course that's the emergency.  Because how are they going to find the person that they are looking for if they don't know who it is.  What if he's thrown away his gun?  Of course if they come upon him and he has the gun in his hand, then it's not a question.  What if he has disposed of it?  They have to know who to go for.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I'm totally puzzled now as to when you think there is an ongoing emergency and when there isn't.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You made by the Declarant.  It can't be inferred from the circumstances.   ",09-150X

If the term ""unavoidable"" was intended to carry its ordinary meaning, what need was there for the rest of that language:  ""Even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings? ""  If it was improperly prepared or didn't have the proper directions and warnings, then the side effects are avoidable.  So that language is surplus, isn't it, if ""unavoidable"" really means unavoidable?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But isn't it true that at the time, there was a distinct minority view that you could not recover for design defects for vaccines?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But in those--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --It has to have all three of those characteristics?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But I thought you just said that freebase would qualify, and freebase would not have the second of those characteristics; isn't that right?  It was -- it would not be prepared using a base?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if it had any base?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Other than crack and free base, are there other forms of cocaine base that are actually in use in any substantial amounts in this country by drug users?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Are there actually people in the United States who are smoking coca, coca paste?  I thought that that was exclusive to South America.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Are you aware of cases where that's happened?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  To go back to your definition of crack, just so I'm clear on it, if a substance -- in the second prong of your definition, if a substance is tested and chemically it is pure [C17H21NO4,] no trace of sodium bicarbonate, no trace of ammonium, is it possible for a defendant to be convicted and given the crack penalty?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's right.  And I don't think -- could you just reiterate what the second prong of your test is because I thought -- I was under the impression it required the presence of a reactant.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So you need extrinsic evidence about how this particular substance was prepared in order to satisfy it?  If you don't have the trace elements of the reactant, you need evidence that that's how this was made?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What if it's pulverized?  I don't know whether that's possible, but could you grind it up so that it's not rock-like anymore, so it's like a powder--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

There was no need to have it described in clause 2 if there's nothing implied in Romanette (ii) that is not also in Romanette (iii) with respect to cocaine.  On your submission, it's just bad draftsmanship?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What about optical and geometric isomers of cocaine?  Those -- those fall under Romanette (ii), Roman (II), but not under (iii).  Are there such things?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, my understanding of how coke -- how the paste is produced is the following: You start with the leaves; then people vigorously macerate the leaves by stomping on them for an hour or more; and then this mixture is -- this -- what's left is mixed with an alkaline material such as sodium bicarbonate, an organic solvent, such as kerosene, and water; and what you end up with is a gummy, yellowish solid called coca paste; is that -- that's correct?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yes.  Now, if a chemist analyzed that or then analyzed crack or freebase, wouldn't there be present in the coca paste lots of other substances that would not be present, in quantities?  Other substances would be present in quantities in the coca paste that would not be present in the crack or the freebase?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So a DEA chemist could test -- could test a substance and say this is coca paste of the type that is smoked in South America by some people.  This is crack or freebase that has been mixed with water into a pasty substance -- a chemist could make that -- that differentiation, couldn't they?   ",09-1533
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  2244 doesn't make any reference to judgment, 2244(b).  And now you bring in the concept of a judgment by looking at another provision.  But if 8 of your brief can be correct; namely, that when a prisoner such as Petitioner obtains habeas relief from his sentence but not his conviction, any habeas petition after his resentencing that challenged his conviction would be successive.  You suggest that there are two judgments; there is a judgment of sentence and there is a judgment of conviction.  But for habeas purposes, the only thing that is relevant is the judgment pursuant to which the Petitioner is held in custody.  And that is the judgment -- that is the sentence.  So I -- I -- if your argument is correct that you look to whether there's a second or successive application as to a judgment, then the point you make in footnote 8 just cannot be true.  So that if Petitioner gets sentencing relief, gets resentenced, in the second petition the Petitioner can challenge the conviction.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I understand that.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if a -- if someone has a -- a judgment of conviction, but is no longer in custody, that -- that person cannot bring habeas petition, isn't that right?

Alito, Jr.  Is it your argument that we have -- that we should go that far?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  We don't need to go that far?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Where do we draw the line?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Where does that come from?  Where does that test come from?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I understand the argument.  I don't really -- it's not too helpful, at least to me, to say, as far as we need to go in order to reverse.  That's really not how the statute ought to be interpreted, I would say.  What does it mean?  Now, I understand the argument that ""aggrieved"" means all the way to what's -- all that's necessary is what is necessary to satisfy the Constitution.  And I understand that argument.  It's a very broad argument with a lot of implications.  But if that's not correct, then what is the correct test and where does it come from?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Suppose Thompson were not Regalado's fiancee at the time.  Suppose they were just -- they were just good friends.  Would -- and everything else happened, and he alleged that he was fired in retaliation for her engaging in protected conduct.  The way the company wanted to get at her was by firing her friend.  Would that be enough?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How does that translate?  How does that Burlington Northern standard translate into this situation in which there is some sort of relationship between the -- the person who engaged in the protected conduct and the person who suffers the adverse employment action?  That's what's troubling to me about -- about the theory.  Where it's a fiancee, it's -- that's a relatively strong case, but I can imagine a whole spectrum of cases in which there is a lesser relationship between those two persons, and if -- if -- if -- unless there's a clear line there someplace, this theory is rather troubling.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can you help -- can you help provide where the clear line is?  Does it go -- does it include simply a good friend?  Does it include somebody who just has lunch in the cafeteria every day with the person who engaged in the protected conduct?  Somebody who once dated the person who engaged in the protected conduct?  Are these all questions that have to go to a jury?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Put yourself in the -- in the shoes of an employer, and you -- you think -- you want to take an adverse employment action against employee A.  You think you have good grounds for doing that, but you want -- before you do it, you want to know whether you're potentially opening yourself up to a retaliation claim.  Now, what is the employer supposed to do then?  They say, well, let's -- we need to survey everybody who is engaged in protected conduct, and now we need to see whether this person who we're thinking of taking the adverse employment action against has a, quote, unquote, ""close relationship"" with any of those people.  So what do you do?  Do you call everybody in from the company and you say, now, is -- you know, was -- are these people dating?  Did they once date?  Are they good friends?  What are you supposed to do?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I understand that.  I do understand that, but I wish you -- I would like you to answer my question.  Does the employer have to keep a -- a journal on the intimate or casual relationships between all of its employees, so that it knows what it's -- it's opening itself up to when it wants to take an action against someone?

And then the next entry in the transcript that we have is: Well, Mr. Gordon snuck away before we could set a new trial date.  Now, Mr. Gordon was defense -- was the defense attorney?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So when did he leave?  Do we know when he left?  He was present when the judge said that she was going to declare a mistrial?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, certainly it's good practice.  If both counsel agree that there is manifest necessity for a mistrial, then there isn't going to be a double jeopardy issue in the case, isn't that right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why would it have been difficult?  Why would it be difficult for counsel to say, may we have a sidebar, and say, Your Honor, I don't think that there should be a mistrial, I think you should ask the jury to deliberate further?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That isn't what the judge said just before she got the response.  She said: Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not?   Samuel A.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The Michigan Supreme Court cited four factors in support of its decision: the length of the deliberations in relation to the complexity of the case, the heated discussions among the jurors, the fact most importantly that the foreperson said that the jury would not be able to reach a unanimous verdict, and the fact that there was no objection by defense counsel.  Is there any decision in this Court that says that under -- that in a case in which those four factors are present, that the trial judge may not grant a mistrial?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And is there -- could you give us a long list of -- of lower court cases holding that in a case where those four factors are present, a trial judge may not grant a mistrial?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The question is when those four factors are present, why are they not sufficient to establish that the judge was exercising sound discretion?  Unless there is a decision of this Court or perhaps a huge body of lower court case law, saying that, no, even when those four factors are present you may not grant a mistrial, how do you justify the conclusion that you are asking us to draw?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, why is that -- why is that so?  If Mr. Gordon thought that this jury was 11-to-1 for acquittal, do you think he would have been reluctant to ask for a sidebar and object to the granting of a mistrial?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Are you really saying that?  You're saying that a lawyer in your office defending a client who thinks that the jury is leaning, is 11-to-1 for acquittal, and the judge says, well, we're going to have a mistrial and the acquittal is going out the window, the lawyer is going to be reluctant to say: Judge, may we have a sidebar, and then go to the sidebar and object to the granting of a mistrial?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I'm not suggesting that they were or they weren't.  I'm just asking about what defense counsel would do in that situation.  Maybe they are more timid in Michigan than the ones I'm familiar with.  I would think that they would not be hesitant to raise an objection if they thought it was going to prejudice the client.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So are you suggesting that whenever the trial judge abuses his or her discretion in granting a mistrial, there can be relief under AEDPA?

When are we going to get into a situation in which the plaintiffs are asking for prospective relief and the matter cannot be brought before a municipal or county policymaker?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Now, if that's the case, why wouldn't one of the following be possible?  If you -- you say we have no discretion here, we are required -- we are totally bound by the State procedures; we can't add any new procedure.  They say, well, that's unconstitutional.  So -- and you are choosing to do something that is unconstitutional that is required by State law.  In that situation, won't you have adopted a policy?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  An Ex Parte Young situation.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What would happen under California law if you said, we agree with the Respondents that additional procedures are constitutionally required, so even though California law doesn't allow this, we are going to create these procedures because we have to comply with the Constitution.  What would your situation be under California law?  Would you be subject to -- what could the State do to you?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I'm sorry?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But whether you were free to do it or not under California law, how can there not -- how can it not be your policy that you have refused to provide these procedures which they say are constitutionally required?  Your policy is to follow an arguably unconstitutional State requirement rather than comply with what is arguably required by the Constitution.  Why isn't that a policy?  Now, all that's at stake is -- and of course it's a matter of practical importance, but all that's at stake is a monetary dispute between the State of California and the County of Los Angeles, which as far as the federal Constitution is concerned, is the same thing as the State of California.  So why should we be concerned about this at all?  I don't understand why there is not a policy here.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yes, but all that is involved is money between -- between California and a creature of California.  As far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, California could abolish the County of Los Angeles.  California could subsidize you for your attorneys fees or they could levy some sort of -- something upon you and require you to pay them additional money.  None of that -- what's the constitutional concern in all of that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But do you think that the Federal court has to decide the issue of California law, namely, whether you have freedom under this particular statute to add an additional procedures to the California statute?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, isn't that something that should be decided in State court?  Why isn't this a beef between the State and the State's creature, the County of Los Angeles?

Well, what difference does it make?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  Now we have a situation.  The clerk denies the marriage license.  And then I presume you can take the matter before a municipal policymaker, and the municipal policymaker will say, this is our policy, license denied, or this is not our policy.  And then Monell is satisfied, right?  If the policymaker says, it is our policy to deny licenses under these circumstances, that's a policy.   Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  Isn't that dramatically contrary to the way criminal appeals have been handled for a long time?  There's a very short period of time for a defendant to file a notice of appeal in a criminal case, and you're saying that that is dramatically extended by the possibility of -- of restitution later on or by the fact that the restitution order will be entered later?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yes, I understand that.  But you're saying the defendant is -- the defendant is incarcerated, let's say; is convicted, is sentenced to prison.  The defendant wants to take a quick appeal.  The defendant thinks he's going to win on appeal.  And you're saying, well, no, you have to wait 90 days before you can file your notice of appeal?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How is your position -- how is your position consistent with the thrust of the victims' rights legislation that Congress has enacted in recent years, including the statute that's before us here?  Now, in this case, the victim -- the victim's medical bills were paid by the United States.  But that isn't always going to be the case, and sometimes victims are going to have a lot of lost income.  So you have the victim, like the victim here, who is beaten to a pulp by a defendant and loses a substantial amount of future income as a result, and you say that if the judge makes a mistake, it's just too bad for the victim.  The victim gets nothing because the judge waited too long.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do you think that's what Congress had in mind?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yes, but wasn't -- wasn't the whole thrust of the victims' rights legislation that up to that point, Congress thought prosecutors were not sufficiently attending to the rights and the interests of victims?  They were doing their own prosecutorial thing, but they weren't involving victims, making sure they knew about court proceedings, and so forth.  And you're saying, well, if the court makes a mistake and the prosecution falls down in its responsibility, the person who suffers is the victim who gets victimized again.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, why isn't the--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --But isn't there a difference between those two situations?  A fine is a criminal penalty.  It goes -- it -- the prosecution is brought in the same of the sovereign.  The fine goes to the sovereign.  It's a traditional criminal penalty.  Restitution is not a traditional criminal penalty.  It's much like, arguably, attorneys' fees in a civil case.  It is -- it is like -- it is really a -- a benefit for the victim.  It is not something that inures to the benefit of the sovereign.  And so why doesn't it make sense to view that judgment of restitution as a separate judgment, just as the award of an attorney's fees is a separate final appealable order in a civil case?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It can also include forfeiture.  What's -- what is the rule for forfeiture?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

It's argued that an environmental impact statement is likely to be issued very soon, or fairly soon.  Maybe the Solicitor General could give us an estimate.  If we agree with your argument that the Ninth Circuit applied the wrong preliminary injunction standard and remand for them to apply the right preliminary injunction standard, the case may be moot by the time they do that.

In almost any other context, granting tax exemptions to one group but denying them to another group would be viewed as -- if there isn't a good reason for drawing the distinction, as discrimination, wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And it did so with explicit language by -- in -- what is it -- (a)(4), by referring to property that is subject to a property tax levy.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So what you're saying is that the ordinary interpretation of the concept of a discriminatory tax should not be applied here, because Congress used specific language to take tax exemptions out of the determination of discrimination under other provisions.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What sense does that make?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What sense does that make?  The fact that they specifically took it out of some provisions but not out of this provision, you think, leads to the implication that they meant to put it in here, too, where they could have easily used language here to put it in.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So it's a commodity that is purchased by only railroads and one other class, and there is a 4 percent sales tax on this commodity, but the other class is exempt from the tax.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  This gets to what troubles me about this case.  Although the Sixth Circuit referred to summary judgment in its opinion, it seems to me the Sixth Circuit actually reviewed the evidence at trial and determined that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the evidence at trial.  So I don't know why this case actually presents the question on which cert was granted.  It seems to me it presents a question of -- a purely factual question in the end, whether there was -- whether judgment as a matter of law was appropriate.  And you never raised the judgment as a matter of law.  You never raised in the court of appeals, as I understand it, the argument that the defendants' ability to object to the entry of judgment as a matter of law was waived because they never filed the Rule 50(b) motion.  Isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, suppose we were to hold that they couldn't review the denial of summary judgment.  The case is remanded to them and they say: Okay, well, we made a slip of the pen when we referred to summary judgment in the prior decision.  We really were saying that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law and, although there wasn't a Rule 50(b) motion, that was waived because it wasn't raised on appeal.  So we are -- we come back to exactly where we are now.  All we have done is to correct a slip of the -- what was arguably a slip of the pen, perhaps motivated by their belief that the Rule 50(b) issue is jurisdictional.  But it really is not under our cases distinguishing between jurisdictional questions and claims processing questions.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. Mills, I got you started on this, but none of this is the question on which we granted review, is it?  We didn't grant review to decide whether a court of appeals can consider judgment as a matter of law where there isn't a 50(b) motion and no argument is made that the -- that issue was waived by failing to make the motion.  We didn't grant review on that.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And your argument is that where the district court denies summary judgment on a qualified immunity issue that is based even purely on an issue of law, there can't be a review unless that's renewed -- there can't be appellate review unless that purely legal question is renewed in the Rule 50(b) motion.  That's your argument?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But what if the facts are utterly undisputed?  There is a videotape of exactly what went on.  Nobody has the slightest disagreement about the facts.  The only question is whether the right was clearly established, and the district court rejects that at summary judgment.  What benefit -- what is the point of saying that the defendants have to raise that same issue again in the Rule 50(b) motion?  It's utterly a -- a pointless exercise.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The -- determining what is a mixed question is notoriously difficult.  What about the -- the situation where the -- the ruling is, assuming certain facts to be true, the -- the right was not clearly established?

Let's say there is a grandmother who has raised a son who was killed in Afghanistan or in Iraq by an IED.  And she goes to visit her son's -- her grandson's grave, and she's waiting to take a bus back to her home.  And while she's at the bus stop, someone approaches and speaks to her in the most vile terms about her son: He was killed by an IED; do you know what IEDs do?  Let me describe it for you, and I am so happy that this happened; I only wish I were there; I only wish that I could have taken pictures of it.  And on and on.

Now, I thought you were beginning to say that my hypothetical is different because Mr. Snyder made his son into a public figure; and the question I wanted to ask in that connection is whether every bereaved family member who provides information to a local newspaper for an obituary thereby makes the deceased person a public figure?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But if the grandmother called up the local paper and said, let me tell you something about my grandson--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --who was just killed in Iraq.

Alito, Jr.  If an administrator -- if an administrator issues a summary plan description that is 100 pages long and is basically the same thing as the written instrument and that's a violation of the requirement in ERISA that it be a summary and that it be intelligible to ordinary readers, what remedy is available to a beneficiary?

Alito, Jr.  If the question is whether someone is predominantly a student or an employee, why shouldn't we ask: Why are they enrolled in this program, and why is the institution enrolling them in the program?  Why are residents enrolled in the program?  Are they enrolled in the program to make money or are they enrolled in the program either because it's a licensing hurdle they have to clear or they want additional education, and why is the institution hiring them?  Is the institution hiring them to get the value of their services or is it hiring them for educational purposes?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In general, why are residents -- why do medical school graduates become residents?  Are they doing that because they want to earn the 40 to $50,000 a year that they are paid or are they doing it for some other reason?   Samuel A.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Am I correct that you think ""post-conviction or other collateral review"" means anything that occurs after the conclusion of direct review?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Then what does the phrase ""or other collateral review"" add?  Why -- why wouldn't Congress just say ""post-conviction review""?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can I return to the question Justice Ginsburg asked a couple minutes ago?  Let's say we have a case in which a defendant convicted in State court has some exhausted Federal claims that this defendant wants to raise in a Federal habeas; also files a motion seeking a reduction of sentence based purely on a request for leniency, sentence within the range prescribed by the statute.  What purpose is served by tolling the time to file the Federal habeas during the pendency of this request for leniency in the State court?  You say comity, but in concrete practical terms what purpose is served?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In your experience, does that happen a lot?  You have somebody who is sentenced to a 5-year sentence and that's within the range, also has legal challenges that would result in no conviction, no time whatsoever and no criminal conviction, that person decides to give up on the legal challenge because the 5-year sentence might be reduced to 3 or 2 or 1?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What would happen if the statutory maximum for an offense in Rhode Island is 5 years and the sentencing judge imposes a sentence of 10 years, and the defense attorney at that time says, Well, you can't do that; that's more than a statutory maximum, and the judge goes ahead with it and then an appeal is taken?  Are you saying that the appellate court in Rhode Island would not entertain that argument?  They would say you have to go back and make a Rule 35 motion in the trial court?  I mean, that's the procedure.  That seems odd.  Is that it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could I return you to something more basic?  Do you think the term ""collateral review"" is a legal term of art, or is it a term that we can -- we should interpret simply by looking up the word ""collateral"" in a dictionary?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Isn't -- if I look up ""collateral attack"" in Black's Law Dictionary, won't I find a definition there?  Won't it tell me that this is something other than the proceeding?  This is an attack on a judgment outside of the proceeding that led to the entry of that judgment.  Isn't that what the term generally means?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It is part of the case.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What about just a regular motion for a new trial, not based on newly -- on newly discovered evidence?  Is that collateral, or is that part of the criminal proceeding?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What's wrong with the argument that nothing that occurs in the criminal case itself is collateral?  What Congress had in mind when it spoke about collateral review was something like habeas.  Let me give you an alternative interpretation of this, and maybe it's completely wrong, but you will tell me why it's wrong.  Post-conviction is a term of art.  Many states, including Rhode Island, have post-conviction review statutes.  So Congress wanted to have that time, the time when those proceedings were tolled -- were pending, were tolled -- but not every State uses that phrase.  Not every State uses that term.  They have other names for the proceeding, and that's what's meant by ""other collateral review"".  Collateral review is a term of art.  It's not something that you understand by looking up the word ""collateral"" in a dictionary.  What's wrong with that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I'm not saying it has to do with whether it's legal or something else.  It has to do with whether it's in the criminal case or not in the criminal case.   Samuel A.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I thought that -- I don't want to interrupt your complete answer.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But I thought that was the gist of your argument, the heart of your argument, that traditional unconscionability in California and elsewhere focuses on unfairness to the party who is before the tribunal.  So here it would be unfairness to the Concepcions, rather than unfairness to other members of the class who are not before the court.   ",09-893X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, maybe you can explain it this way.  Compare what the Concepcions have available to them under the contract with what going through the arbitration, all the procedures leading up to arbitration and arbitration, against what they would get at best if this were allowed to proceed on a class basis.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why is -- why are they better off with a -- with a class adjudication?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And -- and isn't that what distinguishes this from the ordinary unconscionability analysis?  If the district court correctly understood the way the AT&T Mobility scheme works and -- and the district court said that under the revised arbitration provision nearly all consumers who purchase the informal -- who pursue, I'm sorry, the informal claims process, are very likely to be compensated promptly and in full, etcetera, etcetera.  If the district court understood that correctly, the scheme here was -- is found to be unconscionable because it doesn't allow the enlistment of basically private attorneys general to enforce -- to enforce the law.  And isn't that quite different from ordinary unconscionability analysis?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can I take you back to a question that was asked a few minutes ago, because I'm not sure I understood your answer.  What is the difference between a State rule that says that the rules of civil procedure must be followed in any adjudication and a rule that says that class adjudication must always be available?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yes, uh-huh.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, I just -- I'm not putting this under an unconscionability label.  These are just general rules, and the question is whether they -- whether they can be applied, whether they constitute discrimination against -- against arbitration.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, but I really would appreciate it if you would answer my hypothetical on one that was posed before.  What is the difference -- let me change it slightly -- between a rule that says you must follow the rules of evidence in every adjudication and a rule that says that class adjudication must always be available?  I think your answer comes down to the proposition that the former is inconsistent with the idea of arbitration, and therefore, that's why it's not allowed, and the latter is not inconsistent with the idea of arbitration, and therefore, it is allowed.  Is that correct or not?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, okay.  It amounts to the same thing.  Insisting on compliance with the Federal -- with the California rules of evidence is an obstacle to arbitration, but allowing -- insisting on the availability of class adjudication is not an obstacle to arbitration.  But in the end--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --we have to make a value judgment about whether these things, one thing or the other, fits with arbitration.  That's what it comes down to.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And when it -- when it imposes the rule that the -- the rules of evidence apply across the board, it says it feels that these are necessary in order for parties to be treated fairly in every method of adjudication.

And now I want to argue with new counsel in the first post-conviction proceeding not only that counsel was ineffective at trial, but also that all these other claims are meritorious.  Are you saying that the counsel to whom the Petitioner has a right is limited to making only the ineffective assistance of counsel claim and cannot go on and represent the Petitioner on these other claims?

Alito, Jr.  Well, following up on Justice Kagan's question, I have -- I have difficulty seeing how providing 12 weeks of leave for self-care for both men and women affects the incentive of an employer who we will assume has an inclination to discriminate against women based on the possibility that a -- a woman applicant for employment may become pregnant.  I -- I just don't see how that would affect the incentives of -- of an employer in that situation.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, (A) is not at issue, right?  Okay.  So we're just dealing with (D), which concerns a serious health condition.  So you have an employer who is willing to discriminate on the basis of gender, and the employer has two applicants for employment, a man and a woman.  And the employer says, well, if I hire the man, he might take 12 weeks of leave for a serious medical condition.  And if I hire the woman, she might take 12 weeks of leave for a serious medical condition which might be something that either men or women could get, or it also could be a sickness related to pregnancy.  So, there still is -- there still would be an incentive for this hypothetical employer to discriminate against the woman.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But how does it do that?  That's what I'm -- I understand that and it's a worthy objective.  I just don't understand how giving both men and women 12 weeks for self-care affects the incentive.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, with respect to the Commerce Clause, could I ask you this.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Assume for the sake of argument that for the applicants for particular provisions -- particular positions, I should say -- where the applicants are typically of a certain age, men tend to take less sick leave than women, because women also take sick leave for pregnancy-related illnesses.  So giving everybody 12 weeks eliminates the possibility that women who will be taking -- want to take additional -- want to take more sick leave will be fired because they exceed the amount of sick leave allowed by the employer for everybody.  Now, isn't that connected to eliminating discrimination in employment?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I don't think -- I have difficulty with the incentives argument either, honestly, either as the (D) or as to (C).  But I'm just talking about an argument based on consequences.  If an employer says you get 2 weeks of sick leave, period, after that if you can't come back you are fired, that may, at least for applicants within a certain age range, that may have a much more severe or a more severe impact on women than on men.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What would the answer to that be, that that's not intentional discrimination?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, what if Congress had added three additional subsections here, and said that an employer has to provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that an employee can go to a health spa; 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that the employee can travel; 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that the employee can take an educational course.  Now, those could be taken advantage of by either men and women.  It makes both men and women increasingly unattractive as employees and therefore reduces any special disincentive that might have been created by (A), (B), and (C).

Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Isn't that often a very difficult determination under the law?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  There are a lot of -- there are a lot of -- I think -- well, there are a lot of law firms.  I think all law firms other than public interest firms are for-profit firms, and the attorneys are part-time employees of municipalities and other government units to perform various functions, part-time judges, part-time prosecutors.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, now you're talking about history.  But I want to know how -- how the courts are to determine and why it should matter how a municipality sets this up.  Suppose the town had hired Mr. Filarsky as a part-time town employee.  So he has the certain -- he has a one year contract or six month contract or something for a certain amount of money to perform services for a certain number of hours.  You would say that he would be entitled to qualified immunity then?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  He's an employee.  They passed a resolution saying he's an employee of the town.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I thought there was a distinction between employees and independent contractors.  Is that the distinction you are drawing or not?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You are saying it's clearly established that there isn't a difference between going in and looking for the insulation, et cetera, and telling him to bring it out.  Because they clearly established the -- that as a condition of employment in a situation like this, the employee cannot be required to submit to a search?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But the Court's cases are a mix of history and -- and policy.  The Court has recognized both absolute immunity -- has recognized absolute immunity in instances where there wasn't absolute immunity at common law; isn't that true?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Suppose a municipality were to -- or a State were to abolish all civil service rules and all the special rules and go back to employment at will for government employees, would that -- would that take with it the whole qualified immunity regime?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It seems strange, because the immunities -- at least some of the immunities -- long predate the establishment -- the institution of the civil service system.  Everybody is subject to market forces.  Every person who works is influenced by market forces to some degree, isn't that correct?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, the political appointees within the United States Department of Justice are not protected by civil service, so should they lack immunity?   Samuel A.

INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But you allege that -- that Mr. Cooper suffered a severe emotional distress when he was confronted with the fact that his records had been turned over.  So you're -- you're saying that the court -- that on remand, there would have to be a separation of the degree of distress that he suffered as a result of simply knowing that somebody in the FAA had access to his Social Security records, but disregard the distress that somebody in that situation would naturally feel when confronted with the fact that a criminal violation that he had committed had been exposed?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But you agree that the act does not allow recovery for what would have been regarded at common law as general damages?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  ""General damages"", that's the term that they peeled off, right?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But general damages is a term from -- from the remedies in defamation cases, right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And there are two types of damages in defamation cases, special damages and general damages and if you -- is that correct?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And you subtract general damages and what do you have left?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But the problem is that -- that your definition of actual damages and the general definition of actual damages includes some things that fell within the rubric of general damages.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Let me just try this one more time.  You -- you say that there is a right to recover actual damages but no right to recover general damages.  So what you think is recoverable is actual damages minus general damages?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, suppose this were a common lawsuit for slander per quod, and what was said was that Mr. Cooper received Social Security disability benefits.  Now, he would -- and he claims that causes him great distress because of the extrinsic fact that he was known to be a pilot, and therefore, people who -- who knew that he was flying around an airplane even though he was so severely disabled that he was entitled to get Social Security disability benefits, that would damage his reputation.  Now, the damages that you're seeking, the emotional distress that he allegedly incurred, what would that be?  Which -- under what category of damages would that fall?   Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  Yes.  The State employee sends out the -- the will to show cause and proof that, evidence that the -- the noncustodial parent is in arrears on the child payments.  So let's see what would happen if counsel is then appointed in one of these cases, where both the custodial parent and the noncustodial parent are indigent and perhaps not very well educated.  Counsel is appointed for the noncustodial parent, and counsel comes in and says this is the income of my client, and he's hurt, he was hurt on the job, all his -- his income is Social Security disability benefits, and he doesn't have enough money to pay child support.  Now, the custodial -- the non -- the custodial parent who has no attorney says he's not really hurt, I see him, I see him walking around, he's going hunting, he's shooting baskets, he's driving around in a new car.  It may not be the -- the title may not be in his name, he's -- he's out on the street corner, he's buying drugs, he's drinking alcohol, but I don't have a lawyer and I can't prove any of this.  So you've created a great imbalance there, haven't you?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why isn't something like what the solicitor general suggested adequate here?  The State provides a very clear form for the noncustodial parent to fill out, and then in court the judge goes through it step by step, are you working?  How much are you making?  Do you have any other money?  What expenses do you need for living?  And then if you run into some of these complicated legal problems or arguably complicated legal problems that you referred to, maybe in particular cases there would be need for the appointment of counsel.  But why isn't that adequate to deal with this situation rather than a categorical rule that you have to have counsel appointed in every case where there's an issue about ability to pay?

And then the Petitioner admitted that until recently, apparently, he had been taking meth.  He had been snorting coke.  The judge could have said, all right, you had the money then to buy those drugs; now, where did you get that and why do you no longer have that source of money?

Because the Court in Carlson didn't say that there is a Bivens action because in this particular State there isn't a viable State action, but it might be different in another State where there is a viable State claim.  It did it on basically a categorical ground.   Samuel A.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is that -- is that true?  If we were to look at all the statutes of limitations in the -- in the U.S. Code, we would find that they are generally or exclusively drafted like section 1658, the general statute of limitations provisions, and are geared to or are triggered by the accrual of the action rather than some event?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Before you turn away from the statute of repose, could I just ask you one more question--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --on -- on that?  If -- if 16(a) reports are not filed, how likely is it that a potential 16(b) plaintiff will find out within the 2-year period that there were these trades?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What would -- what are the other filings that might disclose this?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if you were drafting a statute of repose, how would you phrase it other than the way this is phrased?   Jeffrey B. Wall  I think normally what Congress does is it says there should be no jurisdiction after a particular time, because it's not trying to differentiate among the application of different equitable background principles.  But there are statutes--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Before you get to that, do you have an example of a -- a classic statute of repose that we -- I could look at to see how they should be phrased, and not one that says that there shall be tolling -- there shall not be tolling except in some circumstances, one that just says,  ""this is it; no tolling whatsoever? ""   Jeffrey B. Wall  You mean other than statutes as in Merck and Lampf, et al., where there were tiered structures?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Right.  A standalone provision.   Jeffrey B. Wall  I think that the statute in Beggerly was an example where the Court said, even though it runs from accrual, it incorporates a discovery rule and it sets a 12-year limit.  So textually and contextually -- I mean, I don't think there is any classic formulation.  I think that's why Petitioners can't point you to anything, because the courts always look to all the indicia of statutory meaning: Text, context and structure.  So the same language can create a statute of limitations or repose.  So in Lampf and Merck, if those statutes hadn't had a two-tiered structure, just the language of the outer prong of the statute alone, I think the Court would have treated it as a statute of limitations.  The Court didn't say in Lampf that language creates a statute of repose, full stop.  It drew a structural inference by looking at both of the prongs and comparing them to each other.  So when Petitioners say, whoa, but they've borrowed the language of the outer limit and we know that's repose, well, we only know it's repose in the two-pronged provisions because of their structure.  And this provision doesn't have that structure.  So I don't think I can point you to any classic formulation, because the same words can be either limitation or repose, depending on what else Congress does in that statute.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Now why is that true?  Somebody could be a -- an insider without knowing that the person was an insider.   Jeffrey B. Wall  --That's right.  But 16(a), except for the criminal sanctions, is a strict liability provision.  If you are an insider and you fail to file, you've violated 16(a).  Now, you know, it's a separate question on 16(b), but I think everyone here agrees that if you have a violation of (b) you necessarily have a violation of (a).  You can't be forced to disgorge the profits from a trade you weren't required to report.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, I understand that.  But I thought the point was -- I thought the question was whether there is the kind of concealment that would invoke equitable tolling when the concealment is not done knowingly, when it is not done in -- in knowing breach of a disclosure obligation.   Jeffrey B. Wall  I think the -- the breach of a duty, a statutory or common law duty, especially where that duty is designed to aid in the enforcement of a private right of action, is and has been considered by courts to be concealment.

And you want to say no, it doesn't begin to run from that point, it begins to run from the point when some other completely different external event occurs, if it ever does occur, which is the filing of the 16a report.  Texturally, how do you get to that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And it requires actual -- is that right?  It requires actual knowledge on the part of the plaintiff?   Samuel A.

As of April 29th, as I recall, there was not a problem with the representation.  And the decision was made on June 30th.  Now, on June 16th, that's the time when Clair sent his letter.  By this point, the petition had been pending for a long time before the judge.  The judge presumably was approaching the point where he was going to issue his decision.  He saw the letter.  He could not see any way in which the matters that were discussed in the letters could lead to a claim that would go anywhere.  As to the physical evidence, if it couldn't have been tested at the time of trial, there would not have been a Brady obligation, and an actual innocence claim here would be quite far-fetched in light of the very incriminating statements that -- that Mr. Clair made in the tape recorded conversation.  Had he substituted counsel, he would not have been under an obligation, I think, to allow substituted counsel to amend the petition, which had been pending for a long period of time.  So he said: Counsel is doing a proper job; there doesn't appear to be a conflict of interest; and I'm going to deny this.  Now, counsel could have been appointed and in fact was appointed to represent Mr. Clair going forward.  Why isn't that a fair reading of what he did?  And if so, what need was there for further inquiry?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But the interests of justice is such an open-ended test.

To me that is the sound basis for those decisions.  But I have to agree with what Justice Kagan said.

You say that a report is a usually formal account of the results of an investigation given by a group or person authorized to make it, right?   Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  Well, could I ask you about a document to which your adversary referred?  The Department of Justice and all of the other departments are required annually to issue what are termed Freedom of Information Act reports.  Now, is that a report--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --under the False Claims Act?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But this report is -- doesn't seem to involve a process that's any less mechanical than responding to a FOIA report.  It's basically a compilation of statistics: how many requests were filed, how long it took to process them, exemptions that were claimed, and so forth.  So what's the difference?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I -- I understood the definition that I read to be the position that you are advocating, not simply some dictionary -- some definition that happens to appear in the dictionary.  I understood that to be the test that you were saying we should adopt.  Am I wrong?  Did I misread your brief?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But if we adopt your definition, isn't it true that a lot of things that are labeled Department of Labor report, Justice Department Freedom of Information Act report, are not reports?

Alito, Jr.  Well, may I ask you why a FOIA response doesn't satisfy the Second Circuit's test?  An investigation, the Court says, quote,  ""implies a more focused and sustained inquiry toward a government end. ""  Now, the government end in responding to a FOIA request is compliance with FOIA, and somebody has to search for these records and determine whether any exemptions apply, and that would seem to be focused and sustained.  So what element is missing?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How do you determine which government ends count and which government ends don't count?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's the only government -- compliance with FOIA is the only government end that doesn't count?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So a report that goes to a department or agency's compliance with some law that is not directly related to the mission of that department, that would qualify as a -- as a government end for these purposes, but FOIA's the only thing that doesn't count?

Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Every report is a mean -- means of public disclosure.  Does -- the Freedom of Information Act report is a means of public disclosure, that's the reason that Congress required it.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But I'm -- I'm still struggling to find out what the definition is of -- of a report or an investigation.  You say it's a substantive analysis of facts.

Alito, Jr.  --there is no remedy that can put the parties back into the position where they would have been had the error regarding the legal issue not occurred.   Samuel A.

Would you still be entitled to specific performance?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I mean, that's pretty incredible.

Alito, Jr.  Well, I don't know if that's going to be so hard to show.  Do you think it's feasible to draw a distinction between this case, where there was arguably inaccurate legal advice, and the case in which the defense attorney simply makes a terribly mistaken calculation about the chances of a favorable verdict at trial?  A favorable plea bargain is offered, caps the guy's possible sentence at let's say three years.  The defense attorney says, we've got a great shot at an acquittal, let's go to trial.  I'm going to rip the prosecution's witnesses apart.  The trial turns out to be a disaster.  Convicted on all counts.  25 years.  Do you think that it's impossible for the rule that you want us to adopt here to be applied in that situation as well?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --a situation where the -- where the defendant turns down -- where a plea is turned down and the defendant goes to trial, are there any facts in -- any facts that would make any remedy other than specific performance the correct remedy in that situation?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You're recommend -- you're recommending specific performance as the remedy for your case, and I agree with you that is, if there is to be a remedy, it's the only remedy that makes a -- any modicum of sense.  The remedy of giving a new trial when the person has already had a fair trial makes zero sense.   Samuel A.

But let's say a prosecutor offers a plea deal in a case in which the trial is going to take 6 months and it's going to cost a million dollars and if they try that case, there are going to be other cases that they won't be able to try.

Utah cited was The Montello, which seems to cite nothing whatsoever.  So where do we -- is that the end of the trail?  Is there anyplace else we can look?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All of this, I take it, derives from the rule that preexisted -- preexisted the adoption of the Constitution, that the sovereign owned the navigable rivers within its borders.  Is there some body of common law that addresses this, that would shed some light on whether that means the whole river or it means segments?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So what -- what is the origin of the rule that the original 13 States owned the navigable rivers or parts of the rivers, but not the parts that weren't.  That was some feature of American colonial law?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I don't see why portage is relevant at all.  What is the basis for the rule that I assume it's the sovereign owns the navigable rivers?  I assume it's because they are viewed, they were viewed as highways for transportation and commerce.  And to the extent that there is an obstruction that cannot be traversed by a boat, then there isn't going to be any commerce or transportation along that area.  Now there might be an argument that the sovereign should own the land next to the river so that you could portage around it, but what, what would be the justification for saying the sovereign owns the portion of the river that can't be traversed at all by boat?

Alito, Jr.  The rule that you are arguing for might be an established rule that we should follow, but as a matter of theory I don't understand what the justification is for State ownership of a non-navigable portion of the river if the reason for the underlying rule is so that people will not put up obstructions on the river so that they -- it can be maintained as an -- as an avenue of commerce.  I can see that you -- why the State would own that, because otherwise riparian owners could put up fences and obstructions and charge tolls and -- and that sort of thing; but if it's not navigable I don't see what it has to do with -- with commerce or transportation.

And it doesn't have anything to do with humane treatment, assuming the same methods of slaughter are used?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, I wasn't speaking of the California law.  I was speaking of the law that prohibits the -- the slaughter of horses.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, there are States that have public funding without having a matching fund provision.  I would appreciate it if you would compare these two regimes.  The first is exactly what Arizona has now.  The second is exactly what Arizona has now minus the matching fund provision.  So under the second one you have very strict contribution limits, and you have reporting of all contributions.  Now, why does the addition of the matching fund provision serve an anticorruption interest?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But even if it is the case that those candidates who choose not to participate are willing to spend additional money even though it triggers matching funds, I don't see what that proves.  A candidate who is deciding whether to participate or not presumably makes a calculation at the beginning: Do I want to spend more than the matching fund amount, even though I know that if I do that, the other side will get additional money?  Now, if they say, no, I don't -- I'm not going to do it under those circumstances, they will take the public financing.  And if they choose the private financing, it means they probably made a decision going in that they're going to -- they're going to be one of those who is willing to suffer the consequences of spending over the amount.  So I don't see what this -- I don't see what that proves.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

And that has to do with the independent expenditures.  Let's say there are two candidates running for governor, and one who is a participating candidate is taking a position on a very controversial Arizona issue with which I disagree, and the other is a non-participating candidate who is taking a position on that controversial issue and I agree with that.  Now, if I choose to run an ad, pay for an ad supporting the non-participating candidate, I know that the -- the candidate that I dislike on that issue is going to get an additional amount of funds, and -- but if I choose to run an ad supporting the participating candidate, the opposite doesn't happen.  Now, why isn't that a clear-cut discrimination based on the content of speech?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But if I'm the independent -- if I'm the independent expenditure maker, I haven't made a choice at the beginning.  I haven't decided to participate or not participate.

Under the State court decision, the defendant has the option of either pleading guilty to the charge -- in which case he will be right back where he is now -- or he can insist on a trial.  If he insists on the trial, you need to prove that he was driving with a revoked license.  That seems to me -- if there ever was a slam dunk trial, that seems to me that's the slam dunk trial.

Because I don't see that -- advising him that he had an option at some point in the past which was no longer available really doesn't have much of a -- doesn't have any bearing on the voluntariness of his plea to a later less-favorable offer.

So you've got -- you're got prejudice right there, right?   Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  So if you want to question anybody in prison about anything, you have to give them Miranda warnings.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What sense does that make?  Why is one more in custody depending on the subject that the police want to question the person about?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So whenever -- so whenever a prisoner is isolated and questioned about a crime, no matter where it occurs, the Miranda warning has to be given?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  About a possible crime?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If the prisoner is stabbed in the yard, and there are 50 prisoners in the yard at the time and the prison guards want to question everybody to see what they saw, they all have to be given Miranda warnings?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If it's a witness in the outside world, the witness is unlikely to be in custody.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It does.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So these -- all these people in your view are in custody, and they all are being asked questions that may incriminate them--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --and they don't have to be given Miranda warnings unless they are suspects.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  When will that not occur?  In my hypothetical, the stabbing in the yard, you mean you think the guards are going to say,  ""Okay, all you guys stay here, now we're all -- we're going to question each of you individually with everybody else, the other prisoners present? ""   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And then they will be isolated.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So they all will get Miranda warnings.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can I can you this?  Suppose you have this situation: the police officers go to a prison.  The -- a prisoner is brought to an interview room, and the police officers are there with that prisoner in the interview room.  They say to him: We are investigating allegations that you committed child abuse.  Now, you are free to leave if you want to, and we will see that you go back to your cell right away.  He says, No, no, I want to explain this; I welcome this opportunity to speak to you.  Do they have to give him Miranda warnings?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But they said: We would like to talk to you about it; but you don't have to talk to us; you are free to go.  And he says immediately: No, no, there is a misunderstanding here; I want to explain this; I am glad you came and asked me about this; I don't want to go back to my cell.  And you say that's coercive.   ",10-680X
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  There is something very strange about the rule we are applying here.  A warrant was issued by a judge in the Superior Court, isn't that right.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And -- and so that judge, who is a lawyer and was appointed as a judge and presumably has some familiarity with the Fourth Amendment, found that there was probable cause to search for all of these things.  And now we are asking whether a reasonable police officer who is not a lawyer and certainly is not a judge should have been able to see that this call that was made by a judge was not only wrong but so wrong that it -- you couldn't reasonably think that the judge might be correct.  Is there some way to phrase this, if this rule is to be retained in any form, is there some way to phrase it so that it is narrowed appropriately?   ",10-704X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is it the case here that a reasonably well trained officer would not -- would understand that this warrant was defective in authorizing a search for guns other than the shotgun in question when a provision of the California Penal Code says that a search warrant may be issued to seize items intended for use in committing a crime?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You have your client who has discharged a sawed-off shotgun at his former girlfriend in an attempt to kill her.  And he is known to be a member of a violent gang, and he has threatened to kill her, and so a reasonable police officer would -- could not think, well, he might have some other guns and he -- and there would be an intent to use those in the commission of the crime that he has threatened to commit.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I'm sorry.  Excuse me.  Mr. Bowen--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --Well, that was just -- that a misstatement on my part.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  He could not think that about Mr. Bowen?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  It was found that there was probable cause to believe that he was living in these premises, isn't that correct?  And you're not contesting that.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It's not an issue before us.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, on the assumption that he was living in those premises, then what is wrong with a reasonable officer thinking: He's tried to kill her in the past using one gun; he's a member of a gang; he is very likely to have -- to possess or have access to other guns; those other guns may be found in the home where we believe he is living, and he is intending to use them to carry out the threat that he has promised, the threat that he has made?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What about the gang paraphernalia?  Why couldn't an officer reasonably believe that there was a probable cause to seize that -- to search for and seize that, because it would link Mr. Bowen with this residence where they hoped to find the shotgun?  And you dispute the fact that he is -- that he is associated with that residence.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Then why couldn't a reasonable officer think that that would be the case here.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, well, if they have probable cause to believe that the sawed-off shotgun is there; let's suppose they find the sawed-off shotgun.  Then there's going to be an issue at trial: was it his sawed-off shotgun?  And anything that links him to that residence is valuable evidence.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I thought this was a test of what they could -- what a reasonable officer could have believed, not what they in particular believed?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, to come back to a question that was asked before--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --suppose they were issuing -- suppose the warrant just sought this -- the -- that particular weapon.  They execute it, and they come to a room in this house and it's got Mr. Bowen's name on it, and inside there is a gun cabinet and there are -- there's -- there are a whole -- there is a whole array of guns, legal -- let's say he legally possesses them.  There's a -- there's a -- these are assault rifles, there are pistols; and it's known that he's threatened to kill his girlfriend.  You say -- would the police be able to seize those?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  All sorts of legal weapons--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --that could be used.  Could they -- could they seize those?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Let's--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --I am hypothesizing--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --he has a license for all of these.  He's not--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --The circumstances are exactly the circumstances here--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --except for the two things that I changed.  It's his room, and it's his gun cabinet.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What happens if they don't find him?  He is still at large.  They have to leave the weapons there?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --why?  On what grounds could they seize them?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It's his room.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  They can't say we are going to take them under -- we're going to take them so that he can't use those to kill his girlfriend which is what he has threatened to do?  They just have to leave them there--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --and if he happens to come back and -- and get those weapons, and he kills her, well, that's just too bad?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You really -- you really are not answering my question.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  My question is: everything is exactly the same except that it's his room and he's not a felon and he possesses them legally and there they are and they see them.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And your answer is they can take them; in which case my question is, why wouldn't they have probable cause to search for those in the first place?  Or they can't take them, in which case I say well, what about the possibility that he will come back, get those weapons and carry out his threat using those weapons?   ",10-704X

Alito, Jr.  So you could -- the plaintiff could allege some kind defective service at the time when the title insurance was purchased?  There really is no service provided at that time, is there?

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, this is where I have problems with your argument, because this doesn't seem to me to be a fiduciary relationship and I don't see where the duty of loyalty comes from.  And to say that Congress can just impose some attributes of a fiduciary relationship wherever it wants seems rather strange.  Let me give you this example.  I take my car to an auto dealer to have -- because it's making a strange sound.  And I say: Call me up when you figure out what you think is the problem.  And they call me up and they say: Well, there are certain things wrong with it, and it's going to cost you $1,000.  And I say: Okay, now, thanks for diagnosing the problem; where should I have it fixed?  Should I have it fixed at your shop or should I go to another place and have it fixed?  And they say: Well, have it fixed at our shop.  Now, is there a breach of a duty of loyalty there?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I know.  But we are looking for whether there is an injury in fact.  Put aside the question of whether there is a breach of the duty in law.  There is allegedly here.  I just don't see where there is an injury in fact, because I know -- I'm an idiot if I don't realize -- that they have a strong economic incentive to say: Come have it fixed at my place.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Would there be injury-in-fact if the plaintiff knew everything that was relevant to this had -- had -- was an economist who had studied the effect of these things on title insurance price and quality, and in fact, had -- was aware of every single transaction that had ever occurred between the title insurance company and the title agent?  Would there be injury, in fact, in that situation?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And nevertheless said, okay, I understand this is what I'm getting into, but I'm going ahead.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That wasn't really my question.  My question was does the statute permit it.  If Vermont wanted to do that, the University of Vermont or some other entity wanted to do that, would the statute permit it?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can I ask you this question?  Do you agree with the Solicitor General's interpretation of the statute?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Did you make that argument below?  Is that a change in your position?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, the court of appeals on page 22a of the petition, summarizing what it understood you to be arguing, says:  ""The statute only imposes restrictions on the sale or use of such data for marketing or promoting a prescription drug. ""  That was an inaccurate characterization of your -- the Second Circuit did not understand your argument?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could you please -- could you please answer yes or no?  If you're changing your position, you're changing your position.  It seems to me this is an important point, and if the Second Circuit based its decision on a misunderstanding of Vermont's interpretation of its own statute, I would think you would at least bring that out in the petition for rehearing.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The problem I have with your argument is that I don't really know what a complaining witness is in the grand jury context.  Let's take the Federal grand jury as an example.  Do you think there are complaining witnesses before Federal grand juries?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  A complaining witness I would think is a person who files a complaint, who causes -- in the Federal system it would be someone who files a complaint and attests to it under Rule 5.  That person is asking that charges be brought.  That's what it means to be a complaining witness, filing a complaint.  Nobody -- no witness before a Federal grand jury asks that an indictment be returned.  They provide testimony, and they may want an indictment to be returned, but it's the prosecutor who asks for the indictment to be returned.  So I don't see how there is a complaining witness in that sense in the traditional grand jury context.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, let me give you another example that I think happens with some frequency.  You have a Federal grand jury and you have testimony by an FBI or a DEA case agent, a person who's been working on the case, and that witness provides a lot of information supporting the charges that the prosecutor wants returned.  You also have a cooperating witness, someone who has entered into a plea bargain and in exchange for that is providing a lot of incriminating testimony.  Now, is there a complaining witness in that situation?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Which one is it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Both?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The holding -- the holding that you are asking for isn't going to do very much good if the -- if the mere issuance of the grand jury subpoena renders the person not a complaining witness.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In that situation, then why not subpoena everybody?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You said that the issuance of a subpoena in itself is not sufficient to make somebody not a complaining witness.  So if you are issued a subpoena you still might be a complaining witness if you really didn't need to get a subpoena.  If you could have been persuaded to go without a subpoena, then maybe you could be a complaining witness.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If somebody--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --At common law did any grand jury witnesses have absolute immunity from a claim for malicious prosecution?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, could--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --And could there be malicious prosecution liability for a witness before a grand jury who was not a ""complaining witness"".   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So you are not really asking us to adopt the common law rule, are you?  You are asking for a variation of the common law rule that is limited to complaining witnesses.  Or are you going further.  Are you saying that no witness before a grand jury should have absolute immunity from a so-called 1983 malicious prosecution claim?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if I understand your answer, that you're not -- that this whole business about complaining witness is irrelevant.  Any -- no witness before a grand jury gets absolute immunity.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Any witness could -- who would satisfy the elements of the malicious prosecution tort could be liable?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  That's a little different, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Are those -- are those cases involving grand jury proceedings like the one here which does look somewhat like the complaint situation?  Or are they more traditional grand jury settings?   ",10-788X
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I have the same -- I have the same concern as Justice Breyer.  Let me try to ask the question in a different way.  Can you give me an example of a case in which someone would qualify as a complaining witness under Mr. Pincus's definition and yet would not have done something outside of the grand jury that would be sufficient to make out a claim of malicious prosecution?  If that situation doesn't exist, then I don't see any difference between your position and Mr. Pincus's position.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Paragraph 29 of the complaint alleges Mr. Paulk and Mr. Hodges, acting under color of law, in retaliation and wrongfully influenced and instigated the prosecutorial decision to bring charges against Mr. Rehberg.  Why isn't that sufficient to support a claim of so-called malicious prosecution without regard to the evidentiary -- or without regard to the grand jury testimony?   ",10-788X
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Suppose I said your brief does not cite a Supreme Court decision.  Would that be a correct statement?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, we have hundreds and hundreds, probably thousands of opinions, and you didn't cite -- there were many of them that you didn't cite.  You cited quite a few, but you didn't cite all of them.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  As I understand your argument, you satisfy the -- the ground for seeking deletion or correction was satisfied even before Novo wrote the new use code that you claim is overly broad.  When the use code said simply the use of repaglinide with metformin, the -- the ground for seeking deletion or correction was satisfied, wasn't it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, but that's another -- so there are two oddities in the way you read the statute.  Now, maybe Congress just did a bad job of drafting.  But the first is the one we were discussing before, and that's the second one, that -- your -- your beef really is not that the patent does not include every use.  Your beef is that the source -- the use code is too broad, and yet that is not the ground that the statute sets out for seeking deletion or correction.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Suppose you didn't file the -- suppose the counterclaim provision wasn't available, and Novo -- you filed a paragraph IV certification and Novo sues you for infringement.  Could you not defend the infringement action on the ground that your use of the -- of the drug was not in -- did not infringe their patent?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why -- why is that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If the patent holder -- if the patent holder writes a use code that is ridiculously, totally, unreasonably broad, is there anything that FDA can do about that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, what about after -- what about after there has been litigation and a court has decided that a use code that was written in a particular case was totally unreasonable?  Does that mean that the writing of that was in violation of some provision of the Food and Drug Act or FDA regulations and that there would be some sanction against the company that did that?

Is there jurisdiction to consider 2 through 10?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, in that situation then, if the State moves to dismiss the arguments that are made by Petitioner on issues 2 through 10, would the -- would the panel be obligated to do that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It could do that without issuing a new -- without issuing a certificate of appealability, without saying we think that the judge who issued the certificate of appealability was incorrect, that jurists of reason could disagree on issues 2 through 10?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But is it necessary for you to go -- is it necessary for you to go as far as you seem to be going?  Would it be possible to read (c)(3) as mandatory but not jurisdictional?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if -- well, I understood what you just -- your argument to be that it doesn't even have any effect, that so long as there is any document that's called the certificate of appealability, then anything can be considered by the court of appeals panel without the issuance of a -- of a certificate of appealability covering the issue.  But if it's mandatory but not jurisdictional, then if the State moves or maybe if the court, if the panel sue sponte, identifies the fact that there may be an error, there is an opportunity for a new certificate of appealability.  If nothing is done, then -- then there isn't a problem.  It's not a jurisdictional issue that lingers forever.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You're saying 99 percent of the -- of the defendants who take an appeal through the Texas system don't file a petition with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals?

Alito, Jr.  No, but my question is this: Suppose that no effort has been made by counsel to provide -- to obtain treatment for the petitioner to restore the petitioner to competency prior to the point when a motion is made to stay the proceeding.  The six-to month period would still begin to run at the time when the motion for the stay is made, or would it begin to run at some earlier point or some later point?   Samuel A.

Would there be any obligation to begin the treatment prior to the -- to the time when the motion for a stay is -- is filed?  Could many years go by with the same attorney representing a client, and then at the very last minute -- and no effort is made to obtain treatment that would restore the petitioner to competency, and then at the very last minute, a motion for a stay is entered, and then this period of time -- 6 months, 9 months, a year, whatever it is -- would begin to run?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, here, the motion -- when was the motion made, the motion for a competency determination and a stay?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And when was that?  Do you remember the date, roughly?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And when was the initial habeas petition filed in district court?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Of 2000?   Samuel A.

INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, why isn't what you're proposing just a mechanism that will permit stays in virtually every capital case, if that's what the petitioner wants -- if that's what petitioner's counsel wants?  Let's say you have a case where there is a small amount of mitigating evidence about the petitioner's childhood, but not enough to sway the sentencing authority.  It's alleged that if the petitioner had been -- if the petitioner was competent, the petitioner could provide a lot more information about what went on during his childhood years; and, therefore, the proceeding has to be stayed indefinitely until the petitioner is restored to competence or he dies, as happened in Rees.  What do you do with that situation?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if the district court says, well, there's a little bit here, and I can't rule out the possibility that there might be a lot more that's locked in the petitioner's mind, but he is unable to provide it because he is incompetent, then I'm going to grant a stay until he is restored to competence; and, then that would be insulated from being overturned on appeal by abuse of discretion standard; that's what you're arguing?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do you think that is consistent with AEDPA; that Congress, knowing, in particular, that a lot of district judges and a lot of court of appeals judges don't like the death penalty and will go to some length to prevent the imposition of that sentence, that we're just going to leave that all to the discretion of every individual district judge?

If the Court were to hold that obtaining a material witness warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment where the statutory requirements, and in particular establishing materiality, are met, why would it be necessary for the Court to decide whether there's absolute immunity when a prosecutor seeks a material witness warrant?

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is this a -- is this a realistic hypothetical that you've posed?  Now, in order to detain someone under the material witness statute, that person, potential witness, must have material testimony, not just relevant testimony, material testimony, testimony that would be of some importance in the criminal prosecution.  So your hypothetical is a situation in which there is a witness and this witness has important testimony that could be used in a pending criminal case, and yet the prosecution has absolutely no interest in calling that person as a witness.  How often is that going to arise?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Your argument is that the Constitution does not allow a material witness to be detained, so long as the witness says in court that he or she will show up for trial, no matter how much evidence there is that this person poses a great risk of flight?  If the person says in court, I will be there, that's the end of it, the person cannot be detained?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You might turn out--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --You don't think that an official reading all this Court's cases saying subjective motivation is not proper in determining the application of the Fourth Amendment would be able to think that this would apply here, too?

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Jurisdictions have an incentive to get a warrant, I would think.  Even if they -- even if we were to say that they don't need one, they certainly have a strong incentive to get warrants because it insulates the search to a much greater degree from later challenge at a suppression hearing.  So why shouldn't it depend on the practicalities in a particular jurisdiction?  Not every jurisdiction has prosecutors and judges who are staying up at, you know, 3:00 o'clock in the morning on Sunday morning waiting for the phone to ring or for -- to receive some sort of an electronic message that there has been a stop and somebody wants a -- wants a search warrant.  Maybe, you know, big jurisdictions can do that, but small ones can't.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is there a difference between what you're--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --Is there a difference between what you are advocating and the approach that's now taken in the General Removal Statute as it's been amended recently under 1446(c)(2)?  So there as I read it, the amount demanded in the complaint is not necessarily controlling.  A case can be removed even if the amount demanded in the complaint is below the jurisdictional threshold and then the defendant can prove that the real amount involved exceeds the jurisdictional threshold.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Even if this case were handled on remand to the Arkansas Supreme Court exactly like a Federal class action, I don't understand how absent class members would ever be able to -- to determine whether by failing to opt out, they had compromised part of their claim.  I don't see how, even if they're notified that there's a $5 million cap -- and I don't know that Rule 23 requires that, but suppose they're notified of that.  They can't tell whether by remaining a member of the class their claim is going to be compromised at all.  It would depend on lots of different things, including how many members are in the class after it's certified.  And that's something they can't know.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1450
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Under your argument, the amount that's demanded seems to be totally meaningless.  Here, we are told that the real amount is only slightly above the $5 million figure, but I don't think that makes any difference.  So let's say that what was -- you stipulate you are not going to get more than $5 million, but really the value of the claim is $50 million.  And you say that's perfectly okay.  It will be dealt with later when the case -- after the case has been remanded to the -- to the state courts.  Isn't that right?  So the $5 million is just -- just means nothing.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In practical terms.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Okay.  But does that matter?  We assume, I think, that the real amount is a little bit over $5 million.

Alito, Jr.  Suppose this were an individual action, and the amount is -- an individual diversity action -- and the amount that is pled is under $75,000.  The defendant still can remove the case and prove that the amount is really higher than that, because the practice of the State in question is to allow a recovery that is over $75,000.  So why shouldn't the same approach apply here?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Wouldn't it be perverse if the rule were that in an individual action where a plaintiff is simply stipulating how much he or she is demanding -- individually -- which the person can do, it's possible to look behind that number.

But if they had probable cause to believe the person was removable, then they could hold the person, presumably, until the person's status was completely verified; isn't that correct?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, in that--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --In that regard, we are told that there are some important categories of aliens who can't obtain registration, cannot obtain Federal registration, and yet they are people that nobody would think should be removed.  I think someone with a pending asylum application would fall into that category.  How would section 3 apply there?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I have the same question as the Chief Justice.  Suppose that the Federal Government changed its priorities tomorrow, and it said -- they threw out the ones they have now, and they said the new policy is maximum enforcement, we want to know about every person who's stopped or arrested, we want to -- we want to their immigration status verified.  Would the Arizona law then be un-preempted?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, suppose that every -- suppose every law enforcement officer in Arizona saw things exactly the same way as the Arizona legislature.  And so, without any direction from the legislature, they all took it upon themselves to make these inquiries every time they stopped somebody or arrested somebody.  Would that be a violation of Federal law?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But what if they said, well, we don't care at your priorities are; we have our priorities, and our priority is maximum enforcement, and we're going to call you in every case?  It was all done on an individual basis, all the officers were individually doing it--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --that would be okay?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's what I can't understand because your argument -- you seem to be saying that what's wrong with the Arizona law is that the Arizona legislature is trying to control what its employees are doing, and they have to be free to disregard the desires of the Arizona legislature, for whom they work, and follow the priorities of the Federal Government, for whom they don't work.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, could I ask you this about 2, before you move on to that?  How is a -- this is just a matter of information.  How can a state officer who stops somebody or who arrests somebody for a nonimmigration offense tell whether that person falls within the Federal removal priorities without making an inquiry to the Federal Government?  For example, I understand one of the priorities is people who have previously been removed, then that might be somebody who you would want to arrest and -- and remove.  But how can you determine that without making the -- the inquiry in the first place?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, what if they just, they stop somebody for a traffic violation, but they want to know whether this is a person who previously was removed and has come back or somebody who has just -- just within the last few hours possibly come -- well, let's just -- somebody who's previously been removed?

Alito, Jr.  --What provision authorizes the filing of anything other than a discrimination claim in district court?  I don't see it.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  “ Cases of discrimination ”--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --Yes.  It says,  ""shall be filed under Title VII. ""  So you are saying that a nondiscrimination claim can be filed under Title VII?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I understand that a lot of courts have read it that way.  I find it difficult to see how it fits in the statutory language.  And in particular, since the second sentence of subsection (2) there has its own filing deadline, it seems strange to have a district court review the timeliness of the filing before the MSPB.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I don't understand why you're giving this up, and I don't see -- I also don't see any provision that says that -- that specifies what the standard of review in the district court is for a nondiscrimination claim.  (C) sets out the standard of review in the Federal Circuit for a nondiscrimination claim, but it pointedly says nothing about the district court.  Doesn't that suggest that that claim doesn't go to the district court?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can't an employee take a mixed case appeal to the Federal circuit?   ",11-184X

Alito, Jr.  Why doesn't the language that Justice Kagan referred to, the requirement that the board within 120 days decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action, mean that the board has to dispose of both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action, not that it must actually adjudicate those two issues?  What if you have a threshold, you have a threshold timeliness issue that is completely dispositive?  You're saying that this language means the board nevertheless has to decide the merits of the discrimination issue?   ",11-184X

INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That I understand.  But beyond that I really don't understand the difference between the two positions.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, let me -- let me read you two sentences and tell me whether you think there is a difference between them.  First one:  ""Is there a fair possibility that this particular evidence caused the jury to convict? ""  Second statement:  ""Is there a fair possibility that this jury would have -- this jury would have convicted without the evidence? ""  Do you see a difference between those two?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is the difference?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Look.  If you win your client will get a new trial.  Let's suppose that the new trial is exactly like the trial that took place.  Every single thing is the same except the error is corrected.  All right.  Isn't that essentially the harmless-error analysis?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, maybe the majority in the court of appeals was wrong in its application of the harmless-error test.  I don't think that's the reason why we took this, why we took this case.  What I'm concerned about is the test.  Now, the only aspect of -- the only thing that I understand that really differentiates your position from the government with respect to the test is whether the focus is on a rational jury or on this particular jury.  And when you say the focus should be on this particular jury, aren't you calling for a speculation by the -- by an appellate court?  How is an appellate court supposed to tell whether this particular jury was different from a hypothetical rational jury?   INTERRUPTING ",11-199X
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. Yang, you may be taking a harder position than you really need to.  Why shouldn't the rule be that the -- the appellate court should look at what would be done by a rational jury, except in the kind of extraordinary circumstances that have been posited by Justice Kagan's hypothetical and a few of the other questions, simply because it's so difficult to determine what a -- what the jury was actually doing.  We have a rule that prohibits consideration of what goes on in the jury room.  But suppose we didn't have that.  Suppose that it was all videotaped, and the jury didn't know what was going on, so you could -- you could watch it and see.  If that were the case, then surely the rule would be what would this jury have done?  But most of the time, it's just speculation to tell what a jury -- what they did -- did they come back quickly?  Well, that shows that this evidence was so bad that it caused them to render a quick verdict in what otherwise would have been a difficult case.  Did they take a long time?  Well, it shows it was a close case, and therefore, any error might have tipped them one way or the other.  You just can't tell.   ",11-199X

Gee, I won the Medal of Honor.  I was a Rhodes scholar, I won the Nobel Prize.  There's a personal -- the First Amendment protects that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You acknowledge that the First Amendment allows the prohibition or the regulation of false speech if it causes at least certain kinds of harms.  And the problem I have with your argument is determining which harms you think count and which harms don't count.  Would you go as far as was suggested earlier to say that only pecuniary harm counts?  If you -- if you say that, then the -- the classic case of intentional infliction of emotional distress is unconstitutional, going up to someone and saying falsely, your -- your child has just been run over by a bus.  So how do we determine which harms are sufficient?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  When you say imminent, you mean -- what do you mean by that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if that's the standard then most of the prosecutions for making false statements to a Federal law enforcement officer are not going to survive, are they?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, then you're not really talking about imminent harm, I don't think.  You're just talking about harm.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It seems to me what you're arguing is that we should determine that there are certain harms that are sufficient to allow the prohibition of a false statement and there are certain harms that are not sufficient, irrespective of what judgment Congress made about the significance of those harms.

My understanding is that the university had over 5,000 classes that qualified as small and the total number of African Americans and Hispanics who were admitted under the part of the plan that is challenged was just a little over 200.

Is the critical mass for the University of Texas dependent on the breakdown of the population of Texas?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It's not.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I thought that the whole purpose of affirmative action was to help students who come from underprivileged backgrounds, but you make a very different argument that I don't think I've ever seen before.  The top 10 percent plan admits lots of African Americans -- lots of Hispanics and a fair number of African Americans.  But you say, well, it's -- it's faulty, because it doesn't admit enough African Americans and Hispanics who come from privileged backgrounds.  And you specifically have the example of the child of successful professionals in Dallas.  Now, that's your argument?  If you have -- you have an applicant whose parents are -- let's say they're -- one of them is a partner in your law firm in Texas, another one is a part -- is another corporate lawyer.  They have income that puts them in the top 1 percent of earners in the country, and they have -- parents both have graduate degrees.  They deserve a leg-up against, let's say, an Asian or a white applicant whose parents are absolutely average in terms of education and income?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, how can the answer to that question be no, because being an African American or being a Hispanic is a plus factor.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But would 3 percent be enough in New Mexico, your bordering state, where the African American population is around 2 percent?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, in terms of diversity, how do you justify lumping together all Asian Americans?  Do you think -- do you have a critical mass of Filipino Americans?  Cambodian Americans--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --Cambodian Americans?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But do you have a critical mass as to all the subgroups that fall within this enormous group of Asian Americans?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  If you have two applicants who are absolutely the same in every respect: They both come from affluent backgrounds, well-educated parents.  One falls within two of the groups that are given a preference, the other doesn't.  It's a marginal case.  It's the last -- the last position available in the class.  Under the Texas plan, one gets in; one doesn't get in.  Now, do you agree with that or not?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

Your ROTC argument -- you make -- you make -- you devote a lot of attention in your brief to the military.  Could you explain your ROTC argument to me?   Samuel A.

And just -- I don't want to cut you off, but--   Samuel A.

If the employee had both constitutional and nonconstitutional claims, perhaps that employee could take advantage of the review scheme that's outlined by the government.  But in the situation where there's purely a challenge to a statute, the employee would have the option of bringing the claim in one of the district courts.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  There are at least -- at least three different kind of constitutional claims and I'm not sure where you're drawing the line with respect to your argument.  There is a claim that -- that the agency acted in an unconstitutional manner, not that any statute is unconstitutional--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --but there is unconstitutional executive action.  There is an as applied claim.  Let's say that the plaintiff says that the registration requirement is unconstitutional as applied to me, not to other people, but to me because I'm a conscientious objector or I have religious objections to military action that the United States is taking at this particular time and then there is -- there is a claim that the statute is unconstitutional in space.

INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I suspect that if this were litigated in district court, the government would move to dismiss and would take the position that it doesn't matter; even if women can now do 99 percent of the -- the things that are done in the military, the -- the Registration Act is still constitutional.  Wouldn't you take that position?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Would you say that if -- if it can be proven that they have -- that women are now, that the percentage is now high enough, the statute may be unconstitutional?

Let's say it's a Brady claim.  And then it also has two other claims, two other arguments.  They are State law claims, and each one is dealt with in two pages.  And then the State court, intermediate court of appeals, issues an opinion that addresses only the two State law claims and says nothing about the Federal constitutional claim.  You would say there that -- that it's conclusively presumed that they adjudicated the Federal constitutional claim?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why is it necessary to go so far as to require a plain statement?  Why wouldn't you protect the same interests if you had a rule that said that there is a presumption that they have adjudicated the claim on the merits, but that it can be rebutted if there is a strong inference that they overlooked it or a very strong inference that they overlooked it.  Then you wouldn't have situations like the one that Justice Sotomayor posed in her hypothetical or the one that I just mentioned.   Samuel A.

I thought -- and your answer on the music was, well, that probably wouldn't count because it's the authority to decide just one thing.   Sri Srinivasan  Well, we don't -- I guess, we don't know enough about the threat to force her to clean the toilets for a year to know whether it's only one thing.  But it could be, for example, that if there -- in the scope of a particular day, you have three particular options as to what you might do, monitor the beach, clean the facilities, including the toilets, or prepare meals, then it's something that covers the entire day.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But your argument is if the only authority was to decide who cleans the toilets, then -- then that would not -- that wouldn't count, because that's just one thing.   Sri Srinivasan  No, I think that -- I don't think we have an answer to that until we know how much of the day's work is encompassed by cleaning the toilets.   Samuel A.

Suppose that it's -- it's the assignment of offices, and all of the offices except one have heating and air conditioning, but one has no heating and no air conditioning.  And so -- and that's the only authority that this person has is to assign desks.  That person says, if you don't do whatever it is that I want you to do, I'm putting you in the office where there's no heating, and there's no air conditioning.  And you would say that doesn't count because it's just one thing.  It's not a broad range of authorities -- of authorities.

Sri Srinivasan  No.  I think if you take the record as a given, that a grant of summary judgment in favor of the employer would be in order.  But in the normal course what this Court does when it announces a new standard is it remands for the lower courts to deal with the application of the standard to the facts.  And the conclusion in our brief is just, I think, a parroting of that normal conclusion.   ",11-556X

Well, if we -- if we agree with that without having any party defending the rule that was adopted by three circuits, then surely -- well, then, why shouldn't we just remand this case for the lower courts to decide this, this summary judgment issue, and -- and permit further development of the record if the record isn't fully developed?

Alito, Jr.  If you were willing to concede that this would be a close case under the Second Circuit standard or under the EEOC guidance, then there might be an argument in favor of our applying those tests -- or one of those tests to the facts of the case, because then that might provide some guidance, even though we are supposed to be a court of review, not a court of first view.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I think your first reason is -- is so broad, it is clearly incorrect.  It's so broad, you ought to go on to your second reason.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You know, we've had hundreds of years of trespass cases in this country and in England.  Has there -- do you have a single case holding that it is a trespass for a person with a dog to walk up to the front door of a house?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That really wasn't my question, was it?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If a dog on a leash is brought up to the front door of a person's house, was that a trespass at the time when the Fourth Amendment was adopted?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is the case that says that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You don't have the case.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What if he goes to--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --he goes to deliver the tickets, and he sniffs?  He doesn't intend to sniff before he goes, but he goes the deliver the tickets, and he smells the marijuana.  Is that a search?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, he doing exactly the same thing.  Two officers go up to two identical houses.  One goes up with the subjective intent to sniff.  The other one goes up with the subjective intent to drop off the tickets to the Policeman's Ball.  Your answer is one is a search, one is not a search.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I thought the relevance of technology was that the technology that we have now was not necessarily -- was not -- much of it was not available at the time when the Fourth Amendment was adopted, so we can't tell what the -- what people in 1791 would have thought about it.  But that's not true of dogs.  Dogs were around.  They have been around for 10,000 years.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --and they've been used -- and they've been used to detect scents for 10,000 -- for thousands of years.  Certainly, they were available for that purpose in 1791, weren't they?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But they had been trained to track people, had they not?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So in 1791, if someone -- if the police were using -- or somebody was using a bloodhound to track someone who was suspected of a crime, and the bloodhound -- and they used the bloodhound to track the person to the front of -- to the front door of a house, would that have been regarded as a trespass?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And what's the case that says that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Without implied consent.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Actual or implied consent.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, are there cases that say that the implied consent exists only where the person is coming to the door for a purpose that the homeowner would approve if the homeowner knew the purpose of the person coming to the door?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So why is that?  Why is that?  If you took a poll of people and said do you want -- do you want police officers who suspect you of possibly engaging in criminal conduct to come to your front door and knock on the door so they can talk to you and attempt to get incriminating information out of you, would most people say, yeah, I consent to that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You draw a distinction between dogs that are not drug detection dogs and ordinary dogs.  Would you draw the same distinction between a police officer who is not expert at detecting the smell of methamphetamine and a police officer who is expert at detecting the smell of that drug?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  To knock on the front door, yes.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, don't we have to accept that?  Don't we have to accept that as a statement of Florida law?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do we not have to accept that as a statement of Florida law?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I thought the reason -- I thought the rationale in Jones, what Jones added, was that it is a search if it was a trespass.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And so I come back to the very first question I asked you, do you have any authority for the proposition that this would be a trespass?  Any case that says this is -- any trespass case in the last five hundred years in any English-speaking country?   ",11-564X

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I just don't see how you can get purpose into this statutory language.  It says nothing about purpose.  It says, capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.  How does purpose get in there?  Whose purpose are we talking about?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I think you may -- you may very well have a good argument, but if you're relying either on purpose or on indefinite mooring, then you've lost me.  I don't see how they get -- how you get those into the words of the statute.  Suppose you have a boat, and it's tied up at the harbor here in Washington.  It hasn't been moved for five years.  It's indefinitely moved -- or 10 years or 20 years.  But if it's capable, if you could untie it and sail it out into the river, doesn't it fall within the definition?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If someone builds a replica of an historic watercraft, a Viking boat, the kind of outrigger canoes that the Polynesians used throughout the Pacific Ocean, and the purpose of this is to display it in a museum, no one has any intention whatsoever of ever putting it in the water, but it's built so that if they did, it would -- it would function just like its historic antecedent, is that a vessel?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What if it was more seaworthy so that it could be towed 200 miles without suffering any damage, even if there are, you know, small waves, let's say?  And the reason why it was built that way was so that when the person moves the person wouldn't have to hire a moving company to come with a van and take out all the person's personal belongings and ship those by -- by land.  This -- this is capable of moving and moving all the stuff that's in it without having anything damaged.  Would it be the same?  What would be the result there?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I really just don't understand your answer.  Mobility surely was a -- was a purpose of this because it was moved.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It can be moved.   Samuel A.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, Mr. Messenger, I'm confused by this whole line of argumentation.  I didn't think there was any issue in this case about the right of the plaintiffs or any of the other affected workers to say whatever they want on their own.  That -- they're not prohibited from doing that, are they?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So there isn't any issue about that in the case.  I thought the issue -- and they can try to -- to meet with anybody they want as many times as they want.  I suppose that -- that person has a perfect right to say: Enough is enough; I don't want to meet with you for the fifth or for the first time.  I thought the issue was whether they could be required to pay for somebody else to go and speak and possibly say things that they disagree with.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. Messenger, do you think the issue of exclusive representation is inextricably tied to the issue of the assessment of an agency fee?  Can't you have the former without the latter?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I thought the State took the position that these individuals are State employees for one purpose only, collectively bargaining.  Isn't that their position.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if one of these individuals commits gross misconduct, causes the death of a patient, the State has no liability?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If the plaintiffs in this case were to be unionized -- excuse me -- in a unionized Federal workplace, would they be assessed a mandatory agency fee?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  No, they would not, Justice Alito, and we're not -- we're not here making an argument that as a matter of policy States ought to adopt fair share or not.  The thing that matters to us is the principle of First Amendment law that's at stake.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So the Federal Government doesn't think that it needs to assess a mandatory agency fee from, let's say, the employees in the Border Patrol.  In order to make sure that the Border Patrol has high morale, sufficient salary, sufficient benefits, it can do without the agency fee in that situation?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  It hasn't, but the key point for us, the point of vital importance for the United States here, is that the Court continue to recognize the context, the First Amendment context of the government as manager of its own operations.  And whatever choice the United States has made, many States have made different choices in their role as manager of their own operations.  And under this Court's established case law, which Abood, I think, is a quite good example of, the principle that when the government is acting to further its operations as manager they get substantial latitude.  Now, there's a limit on that, of course.  They can't use that authority to -- they can't leverage that authority to affect the way citizens interact as citizens--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do you think that the specific factual background of what occurred here provides a basis for skepticism about Illinois's reason for adopting this?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  I don't think so.  When the legislation was enacted, it was enacted with a very large bipartisan margin, and I just don't think it would be appropriate in the context of the government as manager of its own operations to look behind and try to consider motive.  This is a choice that many--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I thought the situation was that Government Blagojevich got a huge campaign contribution from the union and virtually as soon as he got into office he took out his pen and signed an executive order that had the effect of putting, what was it, $3.6 million into the union coffers?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --Whatever happened--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's the sequence; isn't that correct?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --Well, I think the issue before the Court is the constitutionality of the statute that was enacted subsequent to that by a large bipartisan majority, and I don't think it would be appropriate to look behind the legislature's action to consider and try to evaluate its motives.  And I think under our Federal system States get to make choices.  It's true not every State does it this way, but many do.  They do so for reasons of efficient management of their internal operations and that's the principle that we think is of critical importance here.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is it true that from -- from the beginning, there have been members of this Court who have questioned whether there is any principled basis for distinguishing between the chargeable and the nonchargeable expenses and also have questioned whether as a practical matter that can be done?  Justice Marshall made that argument, did he not?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Yes.  Certainly, that question has been raised.  But those questions were actually all raised before--   ",11-681X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. Smith, what I don't understand is why the union's participation in this is essential.  The State can say, this is how much these people are being paid, it's not enough, we want to increase it, we want to increase it by 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent, whatever it is.  They need some -- they should have extra benefits.  Well, we'll give them these benefits and these benefits and these benefits.  Why do they need to have the union intervene here?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that's fine for the workers who want the union to represent them in making these demands.  Let me give you this example, which I think gets to what the plaintiffs in this case find disturbing.  Let's say this is -- this involves the a teachers union.  So the teachers union is negotiating about the issue of tenure and merit pay, and the union is opposed to any change in the tenure system, it's opposed to merit pay.  Now, there's a teacher who's not a member of the union who disagrees completely with the union on these issues, but this teacher -- and the teacher is not a member of the union, but still has to pay a pretty hefty agency fee, maybe $700 a year.  So the teacher is paying this money to the union to make an argument to the employer with which the teacher completely disagrees.  Now, if this teacher just wants to get back to a neutral position, the teacher is going to have to spend $700 or maybe $500 of his or her own money, pay that to another organization that will present that teacher's point of view to the employer.  How can that be -- what would you say to that, to that teacher?  That, you know, You have a right to be -- You have a right to say whatever you want on these issues, but you don't have a right to be a teacher?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. Smith, are you saying that this -- that the unions reluctantly accept the duty of being the exclusive representative for all the employees?  They don't really want to do this, but the law requires them to do this, but because the law requires them to do this then they have to get this agency fee?  Is that really -- is that realistically what happens?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Seriously, the unions do not want to have the -- they don't want to be given the status of the exclusive bargaining agent for the employees?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What about the issue of--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --Well, let me ask you a question about pensions.  Now, that's a very big public policy issue.  I think in Illinois, the legislature recently cut pensions of -- of public employees.  That would be a subject -- that could be a subject of -- of collective bargaining, right?  So that would be -- bargaining on that would be chargeable?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if the -- if the union spends a lot of money trying to bargain on that issue, that's -- that's a chargeable expense, is it not?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  Now, what do you say to the young employee who is not very much concerned at this point about pensions, but realizes there's a certain pot of money, and it's either going to go for pensions or it's going to go for salary at the present time.  So that employee who's not a member of the union has to pay for the union to bargain with the -- the State to achieve something that's contrary to that person's interest.  But you say that person is a free rider.   ",11-681X
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can I ask you a question about timing?  Let's suppose that the district court in Washington moves expeditiously and issues a decision in mid-February.  Are there insuperable problems with postponing the Texas primary so that the plan that is to be used can -- doesn't have to be formulated until after the district court in Washington has ruled?  Texas has a very early primary.  Some States have them for congressional races in -- in the fall, and the latest presidential primary I think is at the end of June.  So why can't this all be pushed back, and wouldn't that eliminate a lot of the problems that we are grappling with in this case?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if we have a binary choice, if it's either the plan enacted by the Texas legislature or the plan that's already been drawn up by the court, yes, that could be presumably resolved rather quickly.  But what if neither of those is fully acceptable.  Then is it -- is it practicable to have the primary on the date that's been agreed on?  And if not, then would you just prefer to limit us to those two possibilities or would Texas entertain the possibility of moving the primary back?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What are neutral districting principles?  Anybody who draws a map faces at the outset certain legal constraints, constitutional constraints, restrictions that are imposed by the Voting Rights Act, maybe some State law restrictions to the extent they are not inconsistent with Federal law.  Once you have gotten beyond that point, all you have left is districting policy.  They are policy choices and there are many factors that can be taken into account in drawing a map: How compact you want the districts to be, to what extent are you going to respect zones of economic interest, to what extent are you going to try to preserve old districts, what about incumbents, what about party registration?  Are you going to try to have balance or are you going to try to favor one party or the other?  That's all -- those are all questions of policy.  And the question is who makes those policy decisions?  Are they going to be the policy decisions that were made by the legislature, or are they going to be the policy decisions made by the district court?  And to say they are going to apply neutral districting principles is a subterfuge.  There is no such thing.   Sri Srinivasan  I guess I would disagree with you, Justice Alito.  I want to make two preliminary observations on what a district court is supposed to do in this regard, and then I'll try to walk through the principles that should guide this inquiry.  The first preliminary observation is what a district court is not supposed to do, and what a district court is not supposed to do is to take the unprecleared plan as a given, because section 5 forecloses it.  Now, what's a district court supposed to do?  It's not at sea, contrary to the underpinning of some of the arguments made today, because the district court starts with the last legally enforceable plan, which after all is the last manifestation of State policies and priorities.  So you have that as a starting point.  And then it has to modify that plan, of course, to deal with malapportionment issues and to comply with section 2 and section 5--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I don't want to interrupt you too much, but even if you do that, even if you start with the old plan and then you modify it to the extent necessary to comply with Constitution and statutes, there are still -- I'm sure our computer could shoot out dozens and dozens of possible maps, and somebody has to choose among them.  Now what criteria does a district judge, does a district court use in making that choice?   Sri Srinivasan  --There is discretion in the inquiry, Justice Alito.  I am not going to -- I'm not going to disagree with that.  What it looks to is the districting criteria that had been applied by this jurisdiction in the past.  For example, in this case--   ",11-713X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Let's say a legislature says -- says we have a new policy, and that is that once we've satisfied our constitutional obligations and our obligations under the Voting Rights Act, the only thing we are going to do is try to draw the districts that are the most compact possible, compactness over everything else.  They draw up a plan that embodies that policy, and it's challenged under section 5.  Now can the district court just say well, that's -- the State's policy is compactness over everything else, but we don't agree with that, because we have other neutral principles that advance the interest of the collective public good, which is the -- the term that this -- the -- the words that this Court used.  Can they do that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if they can't do that then you are saying that they are constrained by State policy, except to the extent the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act requires otherwise.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if Texas says we don't care about maintaining voting precincts; this is -- this is a matter of -- of administrative burden and expense, and we are willing to bear that, so disregard that.  The district court can say well, we think, we disagree with you; in order to make it more convenient to hold the election and less expensive for Texas, we are going to respect voting districts.  They can do that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But could they do that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could the district court do that?  That's my question.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

They see somebody come out the door and start to go down the steps, doesn't look like that person has noticed their presence.  Now, they have the choice, if you prevail, of either rushing in and stopping the person within the curtilage, in which case they could detain the person, or they could allow the person to walk some distance outside of the site of the house and then stop the person, and that would allow them to execute the warrant without endanger -- without enhancing the danger to them from potentially armed people inside or allowing of the destruction of evidence.  What -- in that situation, what argues in favor of your rule, that if they want to detain this individual, they have to rush in and stop him before he leaves the premises?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, without interrupting -- in that situation, officer safety is undermined by your rule because it requires them to stop the person on the premises and, therefore, tip off those inside, potentially, about their presence.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could you explain what you mean by the immediate vicinity?  Is it based on -- on property line?  Is it some absolute distance from the -- the entrance to the premises?  Is it based on how far you could see from the -- the site of the search?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, what if the person comes out the door and walks -- and has walked 50 feet down the block within sight of the entrance at the time when the police are entering to make the arrest?  Would that person be in the immediate vicinity?   Samuel A.

What's wrong with that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that may all be true, but then what -- what can one infer from the fact that a dog alerted a number of times when no contraband was found?  I think what you just said was the explanation could be the dog detected an odor, but the substance wasn't there, or it could be that the dog was cued or the dog was confused or the dog is not very competent.  So what can one infer from these field performance records?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, excuse me.  Where -- when nothing is found, how can you tell whether the dog alerted to a residual odor or simply made a mistake?  Now, there may be cases where there is other evidence that suggests that drugs were present in that location, and, therefore, that is something from which you can infer that the dog was alerting to residual odor; but, the fact that you don't have evidence of that doesn't mean that there wasn't residual odor.

You keep saying that the -- in the case of the individual, the individual was here.  But the organization can be here, too.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. Gannon, suppose two people are tortured, and one is an alien who has never been within 10,000 miles of the United States, and the other is a U.S. citizen.  The position of the United States is that the alien can sue, but the U.S. citizen can't?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, but two victims of torture, you don't find that to be an incongruous result?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I'm asking about your position, the position of the United States.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do we assume for purposes of this case that your client, a corporation, has a Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What are the peers of the Southern Union Company that would sit on the jury, other railroads?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, in 1790, in fact in the first Judiciary Act and in the Crimes Act of 1790, Congress enacted statutes, criminal statutes that authorized a fine and left it entirely to the discretion of the court.  Were those unconstitutional?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  There was no maximum.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if it's totally up to the discretion of the judge, that's fine.  But if Congress enacts a statute that structures the fine and says, if this is the case then so much, if that is the case then so much more, then you have to have a jury trial?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What sense does that make?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That may be what Apprendi said, but is it consistent with the original meaning of the jury trial right in the Sixth Amendment?  These statutes give me pause on that score.   ",11-94XX

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If we agree with you -- if we agree with you that the test should be whether the subsidiary is an alter ego of the parent, would that depend on the -- the law of the particular State in which the suit is brought or would it be based on some general understanding of alter ego liability?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That would mean that due process would mean something different potentially in California and New York, for example.  Wouldn't that be rather strange?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, in the situation of individuals, does the -- does the due process rule regarding taxation of individuals by a State align with the -- the ability of somebody to sue that person in the State?  Somebody -- for example, if someone is a partner in a law firm that has offices all over the country, they may be paying income taxes in many jurisdictions.  Are they subject to general jurisdiction?  If there's a -- if you have somebody who works in D.C. and never goes to California but has to pay some income tax in California, are they subject to suit in California for any--   Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  You have Federal claims, you have Argentine claims; isn't that correct?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But California law controls personal jurisdiction.  It doesn't, does it, necessarily control corporate liability, let's say, with respect to the Argentine claims?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If we assume for the sake of argument that there isn't a preservation issue regarding this in-home -- this at-home question, why shouldn't the rule be that unless a corporation is incorporated in the jurisdiction or has its principal place of business in the jurisdiction, the -- the acts of the subsidiary are not attributable unless it's an alter ego.  It's a nice clean rule; many of the prominent scholars in this area think that the American doctrine of general jurisdiction doesn't serve any good purpose.  Now that specific jurisdiction has been expanded, it makes us an international outlier.  Why shouldn't we have a nice clear rule like that, and everybody will know exactly where things stand?

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. Keisler, do you really mean to say that the only difference between greenhouse gases and the air pollutants that Congress clearly had in mind when it enacted the Clean Air Act is that greenhouse gases don't have a localized effect?  Isn't there also a big difference in that the quantity of greenhouse gases that are emitted by sources are much greater than the quantity of these other pollutants and that's why there's this discrepancy between the statutory threshold and the threshold that EPA has--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --substituted?   ",12-1146
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can I ask you this question about -- can I ask you this question about EPA's position?  Because this is something I don't understand.  On the one hand, EPA says that applying the statutory thresholds to greenhouse gases would transform the PSD program into something that would be unrecognizable to the Congress that enacted the program; isn't that right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  On the other hand, EPA says, but that's what we're going to aim to achieve at some point down the road.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And then they're never going to get to the statutory thresholds.  I thought EPA said well, we're going to work toward that.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that's -- then I don't understand the position.  If -- if applying the statutory thresholds makes the program unrecognizable, and yet that's what they're going to aim to do down the road, get to -- get to the statutory thresholds, will it become more recognizable at that point?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Are greenhouse gases the only air pollutant for which EPA has the authority to change the statutory thresholds?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But could it do -- could it do this for another pollutant, something other than any of the greenhouse gases?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Here we have a statutory provision that has very specific numbers, and the agency has said these numbers are absurd.  We're going to multiple them by 400.  Now, in the entire history of Federal regulation what is the best example you can give us of an agency's doing something like that, where it has taken a statute with numbers and has crossed them out and written in the numbers that it likes?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Isn't your argument Congress has acquiesced in that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I thought there was a very short time lag between EPA's assertion of the authority to regulate the ozone-depleting substances under the PSD program and the enactment of--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --So was it a full 2 years?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  General, I don't want to interrupt your summation, but on the -- let mejust ask this quick question.  On the issue of what happens with a facility that is subject to the PSD program because of the emission of other pollutants, the Petitioners argue that the permitting process would be entirely different for greenhouse gases because it would make no sense to require monitoring of local air conditions and -- air conditions.  It would make no sense to try to assess the effect of the emission of the greenhouse gases on the area in the region.  Could you just give a quick response to that?   ",12-1146
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Does the record show how many clinics in the State are covered by the law?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In one of the examples that is given in one of the amicus briefs in this case, and they -- they provide a lot of background, is a State law that creates a buffer zone around every fraternal lodge.  What would you say about that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, they haven't entirely eliminated speech because employees are permitted--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --to speak within the scope of their employment; isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, how far do you think -- what do you think a State legislature or Congress needs to find in order to establish a zone around some category of facility at which there -- they have some evidence that there have been some disruptions and some obstruction?   Ian H. Gershengorn  --So, Your Honor--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Take the example of -- I think it's -- it's a real -- real ordinance someplace you can't have, there's a buffer zone around fraternal lodges.   Ian H. Gershengorn  --So, Your Honor, I'm not aware of the history of fraternal lodges, but what's at issue here is really--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What would they have to find?  Or slaughterhouses.  Or labor -- or sites where there are strikes.   Ian H. Gershengorn  --So I think -- I think, for example, in the slaughterhouse or what they found in -- around circuses and conventions is the idea that there is massing of people that prevents the orderly ingress and egress to and from the facilities.  What the State was dealing with here was not an isolated incident, but the State had 14, 15 years of history of the massing.  They had tried other things.  They had tried the statutes that Justice Scalia identified.  They had tried a narrower buffer zone, and the testimony was it wasn't working, and that the police were coming in and said, we can't enforce it.  Why is that?  Because they had a hard time measuring consent, evaluating what does--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What kind of a record do they need?  Could -- could there be a State law that says no picketing around any -- you can never have a picket around any store to try to prevent people -- to tell people don't go -- don't patronize this store.  Could they do that?  Isn't that Thornhill v. Alabama?   Ian H. Gershengorn  --Right.  And what -- actually, in Thornhill, they struck that down.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Right.   Ian H. Gershengorn  But it was very different from this statute.  Thornhill's was you can't go anywhere near the facility and it was -- it was only one type of speech.  This is content neutral and it is -- it is a narrow buffer zone.  Justice Kagan, I really urge you to -- because--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I mean, I understand.  Stop.  I'll ask this one more time.   Ian H. Gershengorn  --Yes.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I think it's -- I understand the -- the desire to create a buffer zone around certain sensitive facilities.  What I'm asking is: What requirements, if any, does Congress or a State legislature have to meet before they can do that?  If it is done, do we simply say they -- they have a rational basis for it and that's it, so they can establish basically a buffer zone around any kind of a facility they want.  If not, then what needs to be established?   Ian H. Gershengorn  So, Your Honor, I think in the evidentiary realm, it's hard to have hard-and-fast rules.  I would say you would need a lengthy history of serious congestion and other problems and -- and a -- some sort of showing that the alternatives weren't working, but that's what's here.  This problem has been going on in Massachusetts since 1994.  This is not something the legislature woke up one day and said in light of one incident, we're going to -- to deal with this.  They tried other things.  They -- and the evidence, therefore, supported this.  What would it take to support a broader statute?  It's hard for me to say, but I think this record shows.  Justice Kagan, can I--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  One more thing.  What about the example of a strike?  There certainly is a long history of labor violence in places where there are replacement workers.  Could that -- could it be done in that situation across the board?   Ian H. Gershengorn  --So I think that would be a very broad statute and hard -- hard to defend.  But if there were before the legislature, as there is in this case, the kind of congestion -- and the solution, I submit, is much narrower than the Petitioners are suggesting.  It is to clear out an area around the entrance.   ",12-1168
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  May I ask you a question about a distinction that is in this statute?  Now, let me give you this -- this example.  A woman is approaching the door of a clinic, and she enters the zone.  Two other women approach her.  One is an employee of the facility, the other is not.  The first who is an employee of the facility says, good morning.  This is a safe facility.  The other one who's not an employee says, good morning, this is not a safe facility.  Now, under this statute, the first one has not committed a crime; the second one has committed a crime.  And the only difference between the two is that they've expressed a different viewpoint.  One says it's safe; one says it's not safe.  Now, how can a statute like that be considered viewpoint-neutral?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that's what she -- what she's doing is what she's saying.  She approaches and she says this is a safe facility.  The other one says it's not a safe facility.  They have a bad safety record.  And they're -- they're the only people in the zone.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If it's as big as this courtroom, they're the only three people in that zone.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The difference is a viewpoint difference.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, you could have created a completely silent zone.  Now, I don't know whether that would be permissible or not, but it would be a different question.  You could have -- you could say nobody can speak here.  People can shovel snow.  If they work for the -- for the clinic, they can sweep the sidewalk, they can do maintenance, they can go in and they -- and out, but they can't utter a word.  Well, that would be a different statute.  But that's not this statute.  This statute says that there is an exemption for employees of the facility if they are operating within the scope of their employment.  And surely coming out and saying this is a safe facility is within the scope of their employment.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So how do you justify that?  Forget about the conduct now.  The speech that's allowed.  One can speak and say it's safe.  The other cannot speak and say it is not safe.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You think it's incidental?  What if there's a real question about whether this is a safe facility?  That's incidental speech?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, before you sit down, can I ask you this question that's suggested by the AFL-CIO briefs.  Suppose the State legislature has hearings, and they say there's a long history of violence and obstruction at sites where there is a strike and replacement workers have been called in.  Could the -- could a State pass a statute that says there is a 35-foot zone like this around every location in the State whenever there is a strike and there are replacement workers?  Could they do that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  Could Federal law do that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In every case, in every case--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --there could just be a flat rule.  Doesn't matter whether there is any history at that place, any indication there's going to be violence.  Maybe there will, maybe there won't.  Across the board, a zone around every place where there's a strike.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You don't think there's a history -- you don't think there's a history of violence at places where there are strikes and replacement workers?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's not my understanding of the labor history.   INTERRUPTING ",12-1168
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, under Section 1912, the government could -- did reserve an interest for a public highway; is that correct?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could I ask you again about Section 912?  Your patent says that it is subject to those rights for railroad purposes as have been granted to the railway company in particular, and its successors and assigns.  Now, that was -- that patent came after the enactment of 912, and 912 clarifies the rights of -- or changes the rights of railroad companies and says that if they abandon property, within one year after that, they -- there can be a public highway established on that -- on that property.  So why wasn't your patent subject to that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, you didn't get your property from the railroad.  You got it from the government.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You got a patent from the government.  So the question is: What were they conveying to you?  And if you read the patent in connection with 912, isn't it clear they're conveying to you every -- arguably everything other than this right to have a public highway established on that land when it was abandoned by the railroad?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I still don't understand it.  You say this was purely an easement.  All right.  So that means that when there's an abandonment, the government has complete title to the property, right?  They convey that property to you, but before they do that, they say that there's this reservation of rights with respect to the establishment of a highway.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's your argument, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah.  Okay.  And may be--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --It may be a good argument.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But that's your argument.   ",12-1173
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. Yang, I have to say I think the government gets the prize for understatement with its brief in this case.  You have a sentence in your brief that says,  ""We acknowledge that there is language in this Court's opinion in Great Northern and in the government's brief in that case that lends some support to petitioner's contrary argument. ""  Here are the subject headings of the government's brief in Great Northern.  ""The right-of-way granted by the Act of March 3, 1875, is in the nature of an easement. ""  ""The language of the 1875 Act shows that only an easement was granted. ""  ""The legislative background and history of the 1875 Act show that the grant was of an easement rather than a fee. ""  ""Subsequent administrative and congressional construction confirm that only an easement was granted. ""  Under the first sentence of the summary of the argument--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --That may be.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But the term ""easement"" is a well-known term with an established meaning.  And you're saying that -- you said it was an easement.  The Court said it was an easement.  You -- you persuaded the Court to say it was an easement.  And now you're saying this is some kind of property right that has no name, previously unknown to the law.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You have several objections, I take it, to what the Federal Circuit has said.  One is that you think objectively baseless is too low, correct?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You also don't think bad faith is necessary?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And do you also believe that litigation misconduct taken in conjunction with a case that is, let's say, of little merit, but perhaps not as low as the standard that you have, that you're suggesting, would justify an award of fees?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Let's say that I'm a district judge someplace and I rarely get a patent case.  How am I supposed to determine whether the case is exceptional if the standard is, take everything into account, litigation misconduct, the strength of the case, any indication of bad faith, and decide whether it's exceptional?  Exceptional compared to what?  I have very little basis for comparison.  How do I do that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Compared to what?  Compared to the types of cases that the District Court hears on a more regular basis?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Or patent cases?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  See, this is what I find somewhat troubling about your ""take everything into account"" standard.  Most district court judges do not see a lot of patent cases, and when they see one it's very unusual.  So you've got these patent attorneys showing up in court.  They are different from other attorneys.  [Laughter]  Sometimes they -- particularly if it's a very technical case, they speak a different language.  They do things differently.  The district judge is struggling to figure out how to handle the case.  And then the -- one -- one party wins, the other party loses and the party that wins says, this was an exceptional case and you should award fees in my favor under 285.  And the district judge says: How can I tell if this is exceptional?  If I had 25 patent cases, I could make some comparisons.  But I don't have a basis for doing that.  Now, the Federal Circuit has a basis for doing it.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is that really true?  There's nearly 700 district judges in the country.  If we had a statistic about the average number of patent cases that a district judge hears and receives on, let's say, a 5-year period, what would it be?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is the difference between -- you say the correct phrase is ""objectively unreasonable""?   Roman Martinez  When we're dealing with just that, a case that raises a weak legal argument.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's different from objectively baseless.  That's a little higher than objectively baseless.   Roman Martinez  It's not clear, Justice Alito, how the Federal Circuit conceives of it.  And let me just explain why, I think they use the term ""objectively baseless"".  In some of their opinions when they are talking about that term, they seem to use ""frivolous"" as a synonym.  In other cases when they're talking about that term, they seem to use ""objectively unreasonable"".  So we think there's a little bit of confusion.  We think the Pierce case makes very clear that justified and reasonableness are the same thing and that a reasonable argument is not the same as merely a non-frivolous argument.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And that's higher than the Rule 11 standard?   Roman Martinez  The Rule 11 standard, when it comes to unreasonable arguments, is frivolous.  And so we think that it should be a little bit lower than that standard and it should be closer to something like in EJA.  The -- I would like to get to the Chief Justice's question earlier about why not defer to the Federal Circuit's view on this statute, and I think two principal reasons.  First of all, I don't think the Federal Circuit's view really has any basis in either the text or the history of the -- of Section 285.  So that's reason number 1.  Reason number 2 is I think if the Federal Circuit had had a consistent view over its history or if the Federal Circuit were not internally divided on this issue, that may be a consideration.  Deference might be more appropriate.  But here there is no consistent history and the Federal Circuit, as we've seen in Kilopass, is divided.   ",12-1184

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I have some difficulty understanding what the Sixth Circuit was doing.  And maybe you can help me with that.  The district court as I understand it said to the Petitioner: You lose for two reasons.  First, you don't really have evidence of actual innocence, not enough anyway; and second -- and I can understand that, because the evidence -- well, the most that is suggested by the affidavits is that Jones was a participant in this murder, not that Perkins was not responsible for the murder.  But anyway, so you lose for two reasons.  First, you don't really have evidence of actual innocence; second, you weren't diligent.  The Sixth Circuit grants a certificate of appealability only on the issue of diligence and they say diligence doesn't make any difference.  Well, where does that leave the petitioner?  He's already lost on the question of whether there's evidence of actual innocence and there was no appeal on that issue.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that may be what they're contemplating, but they can't get to the issue of whether the district court adequately addressed the issue of adequate innocence -- of actual innocence unless that issue is before them.  And the issue isn't supposed to be before them unless -- isn't before them unless the certificate of appealability was issued, and there was no certificate of appealability on that issue.   INTERRUPTING ",12-126X
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I don't understand that.  The district court -- or you seem to suggest the district court was wrong in saying that there wasn't sufficient evidence for an actual-innocence claim.  Maybe that's the case, maybe it was wrong.  But if it decided that issue and the issue wasn't appealed, then the issue is settled.  And that's the problem that I see.  Now, how do you get around that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Did you ask for a certificate -- what other issues did you ask for a certificate of appealability on?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What other issues did he ask for a certificate on?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, you are asking for what is potentially a very big exception to the 1-year statute of limitations.  If you took a poll of all of the prisoners in Michigan, how many of them do you think would say they are actually innocent?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Very few would say they are actually innocent?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Oh, credibly say.  But how many would say that they are actually innocent?  A lot.  And a lot would be able to come up with evidence that is equal to what the petition -- what the Respondent here has come up with.  Now, do you think it's plausible that Congress, in establishing this new 1-year statute of limitations because it doesn't want these things to drag on indefinitely, intended to create an exemption that broad so that anybody who claims to be actually innocent can at least get over -- can get to the point where the Court has to decide whether the -- has to weigh this evidence of actual innocence to see whether it gets over the threshold?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is that plausible given what Congress was trying to do in AEDPA?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But that's very odd, because if you have somebody who's actually innocent, then you're saying that person can't get out of prison unless the person happens to have a good constitutional claim that's totally unrelated to the fact that the person is actually innocent.  That's very odd, isn't it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, assuming for the sake of argument that there is this exception.  Why shouldn't diligence be required?  How can it be equitable to allow someone to bring a claim when the person has -- involving new evidence, when the person has not been diligent in presenting this new evidence to the court?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, as your -- as your adversary says, there's nothing really procedurally complicated about filing a Federal habeas.  There -- there are forms -- I've read hundreds of them that have been filed by pro se petitioners, and there is nothing technical about claiming: “ I'm innocent of this offense ”.  This isn't a legal issue.  It's something anybody can understand.  I've got an -- I've got my sister's affidavit, I have an affidavit by a third person, I have an affidavit by a person who worked in the dry cleaning shop that shows that I'm actually innocent.  Why doesn't -- what is the reason for waiting 5 years to file that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But I -- I don't understand your answer about why it took him 5 years from the -- from obtaining the last affidavit to the filing of the Federal habeas.  You said he couldn't get a lawyer.  He really didn't need a lawyer to do this.  He didn't have access to a library.  This isn't a legal issue, this isn't a complicated legal issue.  It's a factual issue that anybody who watches detective shows on TV can understand.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But you think that Congress, which in AEDPA was trying to speed all this up and get rid of the delay and make things simpler, intended to allow that?

But this arbitration took place in the United States because the parties agreed that's where it would take place, right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So your -- your argument is that by agreeing that the arbitration would take place in the United States, they bought into U.S. arbitration law, no international modification?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  See, I would have thought that there would -- there'd be an argument for saying that the first options principle shouldn't apply to international -- or to a bilateral investment treaty.  The whole point of these treaties, as I understand it, is to take these disputes out of the courts because of distrust, at least of the courts of the country against which the claim is asserted, and -- and put it in an international tribunal where some sort of standard international principles would apply, but that's -- you don't like the idea.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could I ask you just a -- a practical question and maybe the answer to this is obvious.  Is it too late now for you to begin litigation in Argentina?  Wait 18 months and then pursue arbitration?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What about this -- what about this principle.  If something, if some requirement seems to serve virtually no purpose, it's unlikely to be a condition of consent; would you accept that?   Ginger D. Anders  --No, I think that is still -- that would be grafting on a default term onto the treaty that may not reflect the treaty parties' intent.  I think when states negotiate for these conditions on consent, what they are looking to are--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, there is nothing in the treaty that talks about consent at all, so we have to decide whether some requirement is a consent, is on something which consent is conditioned, or it's just a procedural requirement that would be decided by an arbitrator.  Would you not -- would you disagree with the proposition that if something really is trivial, it doesn't seem to accomplish much of anything.  It's a historical vestige.  It's unlikely to be a condition of consent.   Ginger D. Anders  --I think one of the things the Court could look to is the nature of the requirements, does it serve sovereign functions, but I think in doing that analysis it's important to look to what the state says are the functions that its requirements are serving.  So for instance, our notice requirement in our treaties, they serve the purpose of giving us advance notice of particular claims and time to correct problems that may have been caused that we can correct and, therefore, avoid arbitration to begin with.  So I think you would look to the nature of the requirement, the text of the treaty, whether it's mandatory or whether it's expressly conditional.  You can also look, obviously, to what this Court has called its interpretation, so that would be the postratification understanding.  If this were our treaty, we would bring in, you know, the letter of transmittal that the State Department had provided after it had negotiated the treaty.  You know, there would be a lot of information like that that a Court could look to.  And I think as the Court noted in the Sumitomo case, you can have similar language in similar treaties that have different meaning because there is different negotiating history or the aids to interpretation point different ways.

And that is important to me because I don't see what it accomplishes.  I can understand a waiting period, but this is more than a waiting period.  You have a party who doesn't want to litigate in the -- in the courts of Argentina.  It doesn't think it's going to get a fair shake there.  What is the point of requiring this -- now, I understand, it's a requirement.  But if it's not very important, if it isn't going to achieve anything, that seems to me to weigh against the conclusion that it's a -- that it is a condition of consent.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Let me just interrupt before -- before the time expires.  But I don't understand -- I don't know what the procedure is in Argentina.  Let's assume their civil procedure is like ours.  So you say they have to file a complaint.  All right.  They file a one-page complaint.  They do the minimal necessary to keep the case alive in court.  Maybe they don't even do that, because they don't care; they don't want the thing to be -- to be decided.  All they're doing is running out the 18 months.  What is achieved by that?

And that -- that can explain that language.  The language that they are -- that SUB payments are to be treated as if they were wages doesn't necessarily mean that all of those SUB payments are not wages.

Is that your position?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The States are not bound by the same separation of powers doctrine that underlies the Federal Constitution.  You couldn't have a Federal initiative, for example.  They're free of all that.  So start from the proposition that a State has standing to defend the constitutionality of a State law un -- beyond dispute.  The question then is, who represents the State?  Now, in a State that has initiative, the whole process would be defeated if the only people who could defend the statute are the elected public officials.  The whole point -- you know this better than I do, because you're from California -- the whole point of the initiative process was to allow the people to circumvent public officials about whom they were suspicious.  So if you reject that proposition, what is left is the proposition that the State -- State law can choose some other person, some other group to defend the constitutionality of a State law.  And the California Supreme Court has told us that the Plaintiffs in this case are precisely those people.  So how do you get around that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I don't think you can have it both ways.  Either this case is the same, this would be the same if this were Utah or Oklahoma, or it's different because it's California and California has provided all these--   Samuel A.

But what is your response to the argument which has already been mentioned about the need to be cautious in light of the newness of the -- the concept of -- of same-sex marriage.  The one thing that the parties in this case seem to agree on is that marriage is very important.  It's thought to be a fundamental building block of society and its preservation essential for the preservation of society.  Traditional marriage has been around for thousands of years.  Same-sex marriage is very new.  I think it was first adopted in The Netherlands in 2000.  So there isn't a lot of data about its effect.  And it may turn out to be a -- a good thing; it may turn out not to be a good thing, as the supporters of Proposition 8 apparently believe.  But you want us to step in and render a decision based on an assessment of the effects of this institution which is newer than cell phones or the Internet?  I mean we -- we are not -- we do not have the ability to see the future.  On a question like that, of such fundamental importance, why should it not be left for the people, either acting through initiatives and referendums or through their elected public officials?

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, in the gift -- in the gift situation.  But Congress requires certain information from the buyer, whatever that means; right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The -- the dealer has to record the name of the buyer; right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And the address of the buyer?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And do an instant check on the buyer?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Now, why would -- why would Congress have wanted those things with respect to the person who was just the straw purchaser and not the person -- the person who's actually going to acquire the weapon?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why wouldn't they be concerned about the starting point?  Let's say there's a man, Mr. Straw, and he holds himself out as a gun buyer, puts, you know, a website, creates a website.  He puts something in the Yellow Pages under ""Straw Man"".  And he says: You want to acquire a gun and you don't want the dealer to record your name and you don't want to have an instant check on you, you come to me.  And so these people come to him and whenever they do, he goes to Joe's gun shop and -- with the other person.  He says, I want to buy a gun, but this fellow with me is going to do all the talking.  So the guy who's with him talks with Joe about different types of guns, costs and everything.  After that's done, the person who's done all the talking says, now, my friend, Mr. Straw, is going to buy this gun.  He gives Mr. Straw the money, Mr. Straw buys the gun, and the dealer writes down Mr. Straw's name for the fifteenth time that month, his address, does another instant check on it.  What sense does that make?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You still have not explained what purpose is served by obtaining the name of the straw purchaser and doing an instant check on the straw purchaser.  You said that it allows the tracing of the weapon, but that's not going to be true in the case of a straw purchaser, because the person, the straw purchaser, isn't necessarily and probably in the vast majority of cases isn't going to get the name or any information about the actual recipient.  That's the whole purpose of having a straw purchaser.  So then what purpose is served by this?  It's just meaningless.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So they find the gun dealer and the gun dealer says, I sold it to Mr. Straw.  And then they go to Mr. Straw and Mr. Straw said: My client took it.  Okay, who's your client?  I have no idea.  He came into my store.  He contacted me.  I didn't ask his name.  He didn't give me his name.  And that's the end of it.  So no purpose is served by putting down the name, the address, doing the check on the straw purchaser.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, what you're saying is they did a meaningless thing.  That was the compromise.  They would do something that's utterly meaningless.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  --Well, the thrust of a lot of what we have been presented with in the briefs and what we have heard this morning -- and by the way, I think this is perhaps the most important criminal procedure case that this Court has heard in decades.  The attorney for the State began by listing a number of crimes just in Maryland that had been solved using this.  So this is what is at stake: Lots of murders, lots of rapes that can be -- that can be solved using this new technology that involves a very minimal intrusion on personal privacy.  But why isn't this the fingerprinting of the 21st century?  What is the difference?  If it was permissible and it's been assumed to be so for decades, that it is permissible to fingerprint anybody who's booked, why is it not permissible to take a DNA sample from anybody who is arrested?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, as to the first, in our cases involving searches for -- where a urine sample is taken to determine drug use.  The urine can be analyzed for all sorts of things besides the presence of drugs, and the Court has said in those cases, we are only going to consider that -- we are considering that this is a reasonable search with respect to the determination of whether the person has taken drugs, not all the other information--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --that can be obtained from it.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What was the purpose of fingerprinting before it was possible to make fingerprint comparisons by computer?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I would assume that before it was possible to do computer searches, the way in which fingerprinting established identification, what it did in that respect was to identify the person arrested on this occasion so that if the person was arrested again, then the police would know that it was the same person.  There was no way of -- no practicable way of taking the fingerprints of somebody who was booked and determining whether that person -- you didn't have anything to compare it to.  And they certainly -- you couldn't do it manually.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

The first is the case in which the petition is timely filed and -- as you see it, but the claimant does not prevail because the claimant is unable to prove that the injury was caused by the vaccine, but there was a reasonable basis for the argument and the argument was made in good faith, so there would be eligibility for attorneys' fees.  The second is a case in which there is a question about when the statute of limitations begins to run.  And one of the points at which it can begin to run is when there is the onset of significant aggravation of an injury, which seems like a question about which there could be a factual dispute.  And in that situation as well, the claimant does not prevail on the statute of limitations argument, but there was a reasonable basis for thinking that the petition was submitted within the period after the -- the onset of this significant aggravation.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, the Solicitor General's standing argument is very abstract.  But here is one possible way of understanding it, perhaps the Solicitor General will disavow it, but it would go like this: The President's position in this case is that he is going to continue to enforce DOMA, engage in conduct that he believes is unconstitutional, until this Court tells him to stop.  The judgment of the Second Circuit told the Executive Branch to comply with the Equal Protection Clause immediately.  The President disagrees with the temporal aspect of that, so the Executive is aggrieved in the sense that the Executive is ordered to do something prior to the point when the Executive believes it should do that thing.  Now, wouldn't that be sufficient to make -- to create injury in the Executive and render the Executive an aggrieved party?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, how are you aggrieved?  “ Aggrieved ” means that you are deprived of your legal rights.  And you don't think that you've been deprived of your legal rights because your rights -- your obligations under the Constitution supercede DOMA, and you haven't been deprived of anything that you're entitled to under the Constitution.  So how are you aggrieved?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could I just -- before you go on to the House group, could I just clear up something?

It could have said “ certified domestic units ”, and then defined this in exactly the way that Section 3 -- exactly the way DOMA defines “ marriage ”.  Would that make a difference?  In that instance, the Federal Government wouldn't be purporting to say who is married and who is not married; it would be saying who is entitled to various Federal benefits and burdens based on a Federal definition.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can I take you back to the example that you began with, where a member of the military is injured.  So let's say three soldiers are injured and they are all in same-sex relationships, and in each instance the other partner in this relationship wants to visit the soldier in a hospital.  First is a spouse in a State that allows same-sex marriage, the second is a domestic partner in a State that an allows that but not same-sex marriage, the third is in an equally committed loving relationship in a State that doesn't involve either.  Now, your argument is that under Federal law the first would be admitted, should be admitted, but the other two would be kept out?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Let me take you back to the example.  Your -- your position seems to me, yes, one gets in, two stay out, even though your legal arguments would lead to the conclusion that they all should be treated the same.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, let me get to the question I asked Mr. Clement.  It just gets rid of the word “ marriage ”, takes it out of the U.S. Code completely.  Substitutes something else, and defines it as same-sex -- to include same-sex couples.  Surely it could do that.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So it's just the word “ marriage ”?  And it's just the fact that they use this term “ marriage ”?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But if the estate tax follows State law, would not that create an equal protection problem similar to the one that exists here?  Suppose there were a dispute about the -- the State of residence of your client and her partner or spouse.  Was it New York, was it some other State where same-sex marriage would not have been recognized?  And suppose there was -- the State court said the State of residence is a State where it's not recognized.  Would -- would you not have essentially the same equal protection argument there that you have now?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Just -- if I could follow up with one -- one question.  What if the -- the hypothetical surviving spouse, partner in North Carolina, brought an equal protection argument, saying that there is no -- it is unconstitutional to treat me differently because I am a resident of North Carolina rather than a resident of New York.  What would be -- would that be discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation?  What would be the level of scrutiny?  Would it survive?   ",12-307X

Would you -- would you make the same argument if that's what was said?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You would?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, the facts as I understand it were that he became very angry during a test, during a flight simulation test.  He took off his headset, pushed back his chair, threw the headset, started cursing at the instructor, and then later, he was -- he was showing anger and cursing for a period of time in other parts of the facility.  Does it go beyond that?  Is that fair?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  And you think based on that, you could say, we believe this man is mentally ill?   Samuel A.

And it says in Footnote 5 it gives no weight to the jury's findings of fact with respect to the facts that it found on the immunity question.  And then at the end of Footnote 6 what it said was, having found that there is no immunity, then it was proper for the trial judge to submit the defamation issue to the jury and the jury made findings on the defamation issue.  Is that -- is that your understanding as well?   Samuel A.

Now, maybe those 3 minutes would make a difference, make a difference in the impression on the TSA.  That would be enough in your view?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, on two of the -- on two of the three statements, the difference between the literal -- the very strict truth and what was said is very slight.  You dispute that.  They'd said he's an FFO officer and he may be armed.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's literally true.  It's literally true.  He's an FFO officer.  He has a gun.  He may be armed.   Samuel A.

INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, do you think it makes a difference we're talking here about a pilot?

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can I take you back to -- to Justice Ginsburg's question, because I'm -- I don't -- I'm not sure you got at what troubles me about that.  Suppose there is a substance, a -- a chemical, a molecule in the -- the leaf -- the leaves of a plant that grows in the Amazon, and it's discovered that this has tremendous medicinal purposes.  Let's say it -- it treats breast cancer.  A new discovery, a new way -- a way is found, previously unknown, to extract that.  You make a drug out of that.  Your answer is that cannot be patent -- patented; it's not eligible for patenting, because the chemical composition of the -- of the drug is the same as the chemical that exists in the leaves of the plant.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But you're making -- you keep making the hypotheticals easier than they're intended to be.  It's not just the case of taking the leaf off the tree and chewing it.  Let's say if you do that, you'd have to eat a whole forest to get the -- the value of this.  But it's extracted and -- and reduced to a concentrated form.  That's not patent -- that's not eligible?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, when you concede that, then I'm not sure how you distinguish the isolated DNA here, because it has a different function.  Will you dispute that?  Isolated DNA has a very different function from the DNA as it exists in nature.  And although the chemical composition may not be different, it -- it certainly is in a different form.  So what is the distinction?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, the issue here is a very difficult one.  It's one on which the Government has changed its position; isn't that correct?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Yes, Your Honor.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It seems that there is disagreement within the Executive Branch about it.  This case has been structured in an effort to get us to decide this on the broadest possible ground, that there's no argument, that it's just about 101, it's not about any other provision of the Patent Act.  Why -- why should we -- why should we do that?  We have claims that if patent eligibility is denied here it will prevent investments that are necessary for the development of new drugs or it will lead those who develop the new drugs, new diagnostic techniques, to keep those secret, not disclose them to the public.  Why -- why should we jump in and -- and decide the broadest possible question?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Well, I would -- again, I would point the Court to what the Court said last term in Mayo, which is that the determination of patent eligibility really is a double-edged sword.  And it may be that in a -- in a particular case, maybe this case, although we are not expressing a view on it, you could sort the issue out on some of the other criteria, but that won't generally be true, and the proposition of whether you can patent the gene itself is a question we think of fundamental importance, and it raises exactly the two-edged sword concern that led the Court to conclude what it did in Mayo.

Alito, Jr.  What -- do you know what those guidelines were?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could you explain the procedural situation before the Michigan Court of Appeals?  There was a motion by the Respondent for a remand to the trial court to create a record; is that -- that correct--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel?  And so the -- the question that the court of appeals had to decide was whether the materials that were submitted by the Respondent were sufficient to justify the hearing.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And the court of appeals, I gather, said they're not sufficient and cited, among other things or principally, the fact that the Respondent had claimed innocence, and that was the reason for the change of attorney.  So the issue really wasn't -- that was before them was really not entitlement to relief, but in the course of deciding whether there should be a remand, they necessarily got to the issue of whether there was an entitlement to relief.

Alito, Jr.  This is one of the aspects of your argument that seems really puzzling to me.  I don't know when a human being first got the idea of putting on clothing.  I think it was one of the main reasons, probably the main reason, was for protection.  It's for protection against the cold, it's for protection against the sun.  It's for protection against -- against thorns.  So you want us to hold that items that are worn for purposes of protection are not clothing?   Samuel A.

Isn't it -- isn't it awkward to refer to the changing of clothes when all that the person is doing is putting on clothing on top of clothing that the person is already wearing?  That's not the way the term is normally used, is it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What you just said -- what you just said, I find quite confusing.  I can make a list of things that are considered to be clothing.  One of them would be a jacket perhaps.  One would be a vest.  And if you tell me that a vest is not clothing if it's made out of metal, then I don't know why Mr. Schnapper is not right that a jacket is not a jacket if it's got extra flame protection -- protecting chemicals in it.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But when somebody in the meat packing industry puts on something that would be clothing but also puts on all these other things that you say are not clothing, you would say in that situation putting on all this additional stuff is not ancillary, and that is for what reason?

Suppose you have in Minnesota or one of the States where you say the covenant is simply a way of effectuating the intent of the parties, you have a contract between two very tough and nasty businessmen.  And they write right in their contract, you know, we're going to comply with the literal terms of this contract, but we do not promise each other that we're going to proceed in good faith or that we are going to deal with each other fairly.  We are going to take every advantage we can under the literal terms of the contract.  Now, would that get rid of the covenant under Minnesota law?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, how do you account for the fact that in many States the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is read into most contracts, but is not read into employment contracts?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, doesn't that discrepancy show simply that the State has different policies with respect to those two types of contracts?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  An at-will employment contract is a contract that gives the employer sole discretion as to whether to retain an employee.  And here we have a contract that says that the airline has sole discretion to determine whether to terminate somebody from the frequent flyer program.  So what is the difference?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  May I ask you a question about something slightly different?  An amicus brief submitted in support of your position by California and some other States points out at some length that there are now a lot of frequent flyer programs in which a lot of miles are earned by making purchases other than for -- for flights and in which miles can also be spent for things other than flights.

Alito, Jr.  At these hearings when they have been conducted, what do they look like?  The rules of evidence would not apply, I assume, so the government could call, let's say, a case agent who would provide a summary of some of the evidence, enough of the evidence that was submitted to the grand jury to establish probable cause in the opinion of the prosecution, and then what would happen?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You could call witnesses.  Could you subpoena witnesses?  Could you require the disclosure of the names of government witnesses?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, this was an unusual -- that's a somewhat unusual situation where you had been -- there had already been a trial of someone else who was allegedly involved in the scheme.  But what if that was not the case?  In the more ordinary situation, what would happen?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

Do you agree with that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And what if it's the same evidence, the same evidence is introduced before the grand jury.  Let's say it's a credibility determination.  The grand jury finds the prosecution witness credible, the judge finds the prosecution witness not credible.  Is there, then, an ethical obligation to dismiss the charges?   Samuel A.

All the talk about whether -- about defendants being exonerated, that the judge is going to find a lack of probable cause, that's, you know, that's fantasy land for the most part.  But what it's really about is about discovery.  Prosecutors hate preliminary examinations.  When do they ever occur in Federal felony cases?  They are always, almost always eliminated by indictment.  The defense bar hates grand jury proceedings.  They would like to have a preliminary hearing where they get some discovery of the government's trial case, and that's what this is all about.  So it seems to me that what's important is the nature.  If there is going to be any kind of a hearing, what is going to take place at this hearing?  And what typically happens beyond what I mentioned before, a case agent taking the stand and providing some summary of the, of the evidence that was provided to the grand jury?

Would you disagree with the proposition that the motivating factor analysis creates special problems in the retaliation -- in the retaliation context?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I know it's not going to go away.  Let me give you this example, this hypothetical.  An employee thinks that he is about to be fired.  And let's -- let's suppose that the employer really has a good, nondiscriminatory reason for firing the employee.  On the eve of that the employee makes a spurious charge of discrimination and does it in a way to maximize the embarrassment to the employer.  Then the employer formally makes the decision to terminate the employee.  And what the employer says at that time is, we were going to fire so and so anyway for all these other reasons, but now because he has done this and really embarrassed us publicly, we are really happy that we are going to fire him.  Now, how does that work out under the motivating factor analysis?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is that correct?  Can't you -- can't you succeed on a retaliation claim if your underlying substantive claim is invalid.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, no, I understand that.  And it's not a policy question.  It's a question of interpreting the statute.  But I understood your lead argument in favor of a particular interpretation of the statute to be it can't mean what the Petitioner wants it to mean, what the Petitioner says it means, because that would make no sense.  And the point of my question was to explore the possibility that there might be a very good reason why Congress would want a different causation standard for substantive discrimination and retaliation.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Price Waterhouse is a little different from subsection (m) though, isn't it?

It's not something you can even think about.  But when you are talking about retaliation, when you are talking about an employer who has been, perhaps publicly, charged with discrimination and the employer knows that the charge is not a good charge, it's pretty -- it's very, very difficult to say to that employer and very difficult for the employer to say: I'm going to take this completely out of my mind.

Isn't it illegal for a candidate to take campaign contributions and use it to buy a Maserati?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I don't see how that really gets to the point.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What troubles me about your -- what troubles me about your argument, General Verrilli, and about the district court's opinion is that what I see are wild hypotheticals that are not obviously plausible or -- and lack, certainly lack any empirical support.  Now, you've -- you've chosen to use the same hypothetical the district court used about the $3.5 million contribution that would be -- that could be given by a coordinate -- which involves all of the House candidates and all of the Senate candidates in a particular year getting together with all of the -- all of the parties' national party committees, plus all of the State party committees, and then -- and that's how you get up to the $3.5 million figure; isn't that right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Now, how -- how realistic is that?  How realistic is it that all of the State party committees, for example, are going to get money and they're all going to transfer it to one candidate?  For 49 of them, it's going to be a candidate who is not in their own State.  And there are virtually no instances of State party committees contributing to candidates from another State.  And the other part of it that seems dubious on its face is that all of the party -- all of the candidates for the House and the Senate of a particular party are going to get together and they are going to transfer money to one candidate.  There really -- you cited in your brief the example -- best examples, I take it, of -- of contributions from some candidates to other candidates.  They are very small.  Isn't that true?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I don't understand that--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --Unless the money is transferred to -- you have to get it from the person who wants to corrupt to the person who is going to be corrupted.  And unless the money can make it from A to B, I don't see where the quid pro quo argument is.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I understand--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --These -- these aggregate limits might not all stand or fall together.  Let -- just take this example, if you can just take a minute and walk me through this step by step.  You have somebody who wants to corrupt a member of the House, and this person's strategy is to make contributions to multiple House candidates with the hope, the expectation, the plan that those candidates are going to transfer -- transfer the money to the -- the member that this person wants to corrupt.  Now, how is that person going to accomplish that given the earmarking regulations, and -- and the limits on how much one member can contribute to another?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if you're -- I mean, if you're not going to defend the application of the aggregate limits in that situation, doesn't it follow that, as applied to that situation, these are -- these are unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, then just explain to me how it's going to be done.  The person gives to member A with the hope that member A is going to give it to member B.  If the person even implies, when making the contribution to A, that person wants it to go to B, that's earmarked.  So how is this going to be done?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, they are making -- they are making the argument that there are -- that the regulations that already exist about transfers from one entity to another prevent a lot of what you're complaining -- what you're -- what you are worried about.  But if they are not sufficient, they could be bolstered.  The aggregate limits are a very blunt way of trying to get out -- get at the problem that you are -- that you are worried about.  That's their argument.  What -- are -- is that wrong?  There is nothing more that could be done to prevent transfers from joint fundraising committees or from one member to another or from State parties to candidates?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I just don't understand that.  You mean at the time when the person sends the money to this hypothetical joint fundraising committee there is a corruption problem immediately, even though -- what if they just took the money and they burned it?

Michigan law is whatever the State supreme court says it was.  We might agree, we might disagree.  So I think we have to start from the proposition that the law didn't change, because that's what the Michigan Supreme Court said.  So there must be some other ex post facto principle that applies when there's a certain type of unfairness.  And I wonder if you could articulate what that principle is.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I think you're -- what you're arguing is that under certain -- in evaluating certain constitutional claims, the -- the question of what State law is is not dispositive.  I don't think you're arguing that a Federal court has a right to tell a State court what State law is.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I mean, suppose this were a diversity case.

INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's the issue.  It's not -- it wouldn't be a question of whether there was a violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege at the time when the statements were later introduced in the Kansas trial.  Isn't it very well settled in this Court's precedents that the introduction of statements obtained -- that the introduction of statements at a trial is not -- does not implicate the Fifth Amendment privilege?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that's the issue, as I see it.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  And maybe Mr. Katyal will.  That the issue is whether there was unconstitutional compulsion at the time when the statements were obtained.  But I thought it was very well settled that if there -- there wasn't compulsion at that time, then the later introduction of the statements into the -- into evidence at the trial does not implicate the privilege against self-incrimination.

But now that I've seen the new guidelines, I think that those really fit best under the factors that I have to consider under the statute in determining the correct sentence, so I'm going to reimpose exactly the same sentence.  Not because it's required by the guidelines, in fact, I'm going to go outside the guidelines.  I just think, with the enlightenment that the new guidelines have provided me, that that's the best sentence.  Would that be -- would there be an ex post facto problem there?   Samuel A.

Now, you can argue that strict scrutiny should only apply to minorities and not to students who are not minorities, but I thought the Court decided that a long time ago.   Samuel A.

Let's say that a State statute says essentially what the plan at issue says.  It says that a claim for the incorrect denial of insurance benefits must be brought within three years after the proof of loss.  And now let's assume we agree with you, that under ERISA, any statute of limitations for the denial of benefits must begin not when the proof of loss must be filed, but upon the denial of benefits.

Alito, Jr.  Ms. Lenz, am I correct, the instruction that was requested but not given was as follows: Quote,  ""A defendant is not compelled to testify and the fact that the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him in any way. ""  That was the instruction?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So suppose that the -- you put on evidence of -- to show that he was qualified for the death penalty and put on evidence of aggravating factors, and the defense put on absolutely no mitigation evidence.  The instruction would say, would it not, that the fact that the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him in any way with respect to the failure to put on any mitigation evidence at all?  Is that correct?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, when a party has the burden of producing evidence on something, isn't the customary way of dealing with that to instruct the jury that the defendant had the burden of producing evidence to show this, rather than to -- to talk about inferences that can be drawn from their failure, from that party's failure to produce evidence.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, the jury was instructed:  ""You shall consider such mitigating or extenuating facts and circumstances as have been presented to you in the evidence and you believe to be true. ""  Now, I suppose they could have been -- the mitigating evidence could have been put in by the prosecution, but for the most part they're going to be put in by the defense.  So when the judge says you can consider whatever mitigating evidence has been presented to you, isn't that tantamount to saying that the defendant has the burden of producing evidence of mitigation if the defendant wants to do that?   INTERRUPTING ",12-794X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Let me -- let me give you this example.  Let me pretend to be a juror in a -- in a Kentucky capital case.  And the -- and let's assume in this case the prosecution puts on evidence to show eligibility and some evidence of aggravating factors.  The defense puts on no evidence of mitigation.  Now, the judge tells me you shall consider such mitigating or extenuating facts and circumstances as have been presented to you in the evidence, and you believe to be true.  Okay?  That's Instruction Number 4.  I assume that you don't have an objection to that.  And then the judge gives the instruction that you requested: A defendant is not compelled to testify, and the fact that the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him in any way.  So now I'm back in the jury room, and I say, well, now I have to consider mitigating evidence.  And, you know, there are a lot of things that could be mitigating in a capital case.  I'd like to know about the defendant's childhood.  I'd like to know whether the defendant was -- was abused.  I'd like to know whether the defendant was remorseful.  And I haven't heard anything about this.  And I don't know what to do because the judge told me I should consider the mitigating evidence that's been presented to me.  On the other hand, the judge told me that the failure -- the fact that the defendant didn't put on any mitigating evidence can't prejudice him in any way.  So what am I supposed to do?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, it doesn't really.  It says the fact that he didn't testify, and he could have testified about child -- about his childhood or about remorse or any of these other things, that shouldn't prejudice him in any way.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, just tell me what I'm supposed to do as a juror.  The judge says consider the evidence that's put before you, but the fact that the defendant didn't put this evidence before you in the form of his testimony shouldn't prejudice him in any way.  I'm -- I'm pulled in two different directions.  I don't know what to do.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, what it may show is that the prosecutor didn't think that it was going to make a difference, and so why raise an objection that could create everything that's happened since then, over something that isn't going to make a difference in a case where you have an incredibly heinous crime.  The prosecutor may have thought, this jury is going to return the verdict that I want anyway, even if this instruction is given.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You don't think that's a possibility?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What do you think is the worse adverse inference they might have drawn?   INTERRUPTING ",12-794X
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, in Justice -- Justice Kagan's hypothetical and in some of the others, it seems that it's really irrelevant in whether the assets in question are securities or some other asset.  And it's also -- and, therefore, a fortiori it's irrelevant whether if it involves securities, whether they're covered or they're not covered.  Now, would you be willing to concede that in that situation, where it really -- all you're talking about is an asset.  It doesn't matter whether it's a covered security or a -- a Rembrandt or gold, that in that situation 10(b) doesn't reach the case?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Does it matter that there -- apparently, that there is not an allegation that there actually were any purchases or sales of covered securities?  It says in -- the statute says,  ""in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security. ""  And there weren't.  I don't believe there's an allegation that they actually were purchased or sold.  Does that matter?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What's your best case on that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can I take you back to the test that you think we should apply here?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The test that Mr. Clement articulated and that you agreed with seems to amount to -- to saying, when exactly what is alleged here is alleged, that that's within 10b or 10b-5, that's not that helpful as a precedent going forward.  Now, the test that Justice Breyer suggested, whether something would affect investors' confidence in the securities market, I don't know how we can -- and you say, yes, this would -- that would be met here -- I don't know how we can determine what -- whether something, certainly of this nature or maybe even further removed, would in effect -- would affect investor confidence.  Somebody might read about this scheme in the paper and say, well, you know, there's a lot of hanky panky going on with the sale of any kind of securities and CDs, I'm just going to keep cash under my mattress.  How do we -- how would we determine that?   INTERRUPTING ",12-79XX
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I don't understand what the first textual flaw is.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is the jumping off point for this flaw?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Right.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, everybody -- the case proceeds on the assumption that the -- that the CDs were not covered securities.  The question is whether it's -- the “ in connection with ” requirement is met by the allegation, which is interpreted to mean that there would be future purchases and sales of covered securities.  So I'm not sure what you're getting out of the fact that covered securities is a -- is a defined term.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It doesn't say a misrepresentation about the covered security.  It says, “ a misrepresentation in connection with ”.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, all that's in the text of the statute is “ in connection with ”, which is open-ended.  So I don't know what you're going to get from the text of the statute.   INTERRUPTING ",12-79XX
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  On Dayton, if the only relief available had been reinstatement and back pay, would that matter?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, those cases are different.  But why is there a -- why is there a greater federalism concern in those cases than in this case where the IUB has a legitimate interest in how much citizens of Iowa pay for a telephone service?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But then, if the question is whether something is tied to something that can be regarded as criminal or quasi-criminal, what about Middlesex County?  That's not criminal.  Or is not criminal.   ",12-815X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, could you give me an example of State administrative proceedings that would not fall within your understanding of the scope of Younger?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, suppose it's a licensing procedure.  Somebody's been denied a license to be a barber or a hairdresser and the person wants to challenge that in Federal court.  Would Younger apply there?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why not?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, suppose there's some -- there's an -- an administrative agency in the State that hears appeals from that.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is it correct that under Eighth Circuit law the party that wants to bring the Federal lawsuit has to go to State court first?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I thought that -- I thought that Sprint said that they had to go to State court whether they wanted to or not or else they wouldn't be able to go to Federal court.   ",12-815X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I -- I assume you would agree that the manufacturer of the cartridges that compete with Lexmark would have standing here.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But it's not a very big step from the manufacturer of the cartridge that competes to the manufacturer of the chip, which is really the essential component of -- or an essential component of the cartridge that competes.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, maybe the answer is when we just can't believe that Congress really meant the literal words of the statute to be interpreted without some limiting principle.  So here, Congress says ‶ any person ″ and any person surely includes people who purchase printer cartridges.  So if we don't think that -- that Congress really meant for every single person who purchases a printer cartridge to be able to file a claim in Federal court with no amount in controversy requirement, then that would be a situation where some consideration of prudential standing would have to take place.   INTERRUPTING ",12-873X
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Suppose the comments in this case only disparaged the cartridges themselves and not the chips.  Then would the chip manufacturer, would your client have standing?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that may be true, but I don't understand how you get from the zone of interest to the limiting principle that you are suggesting, which is that the zone of interest includes only those businesses, other than the direct competitor, whose products are targeted by the false statements.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  Well, to change it, suppose the statements don't implicitly, even implicitly, target Static Control, but the effect of the statements is to drive Static Control out of business.  You would say there would be no standing there?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  So in Justice Breyer's hypothetical about the soda fountain that sells ice cream with chocolate sauce and there is a statement that the chocolate sauce is poisonous, if the effect of that is to drive out of business a little company that manufactures ice cream that's used there, that company would not have standing?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if Bailey's was the only place that sold this chocolate sauce, Bailey's might have standing.  That would be similar to this case.  But if other places also sold this chocolate sauce, then Bailey's is out.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Suppose that Lexmark had not made disparaging comments about Static Control, but had simply made false statements about its own product.  Suppose it said that if you use our products, our cartridges, they will emit some sort of vapor in your house that will promote good health.  Who would be within the zone of interests there?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Who would be within the zone of interest?  Only -- would other printer cartridge manufacturers be within the zone of interest in that situation?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, it's not a reasonable interest test then.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Am I correct to think that your rule is that the only people who have standing under the Lanham Act are competitors and people whose products are disparaged?  And if that is true, then are you not arguably advocating the most restrictive test for Lanham Act standing other than the categorical rule?   ",12-873X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, give me an example of that.  Give us--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --And I don't -- I don't understand the example.  The -- the alleged aider and abetter learns about this after it's happened?  That's the idea?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, let me change -- let me -- maybe this is the same as Justice Scalia's hypothetical, but let me try it.  Suppose that two guys have a meeting and it's -- it's in a place that's -- where there's an electronic eavesdropping device.  In fact, there's a camera.  So it's all recorded.  So we know exactly what was said.  And the principal says, here's the deal, I'm going to rob a convenience store and I'm going to carry a gun.  And the aider and abetter says, well, all right.  I'm in on the -- you know, I'm in on robbing the convenience store, but I don't want anything having to do with the gun.  I think you should carry a baseball bat.  The principal says, no, that's the deal.  I'm robbing the store.  I'm carrying a gun.  Take it or leave it.  Are you going to drive me there?  And -- and the other guy says, I hate guns, I don't want to have anything to do with guns.  I -- I hate this idea about the guns.  They go back and forth.  And the -- the principal says finally, look, this is it.  This is the deal.  I'm using a gun.  Are you going to help me or not?  And the guy says, well, all right.  I'm going to drive you, but I want it noted for the record that I'm opposed -- I'm opposed to the use of a gun.  [Laughter]   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  See -- so I don't really see -- I can't -- I can't think of a situation where a person facilitates the crime, knows what the crime is going to be, knows that a gun is going to be used but doesn't intend for the gun to be used.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In those two situations, knowledge and intent, seem to me to be -- to be the same thing.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I don't understand your hypotheticals.  If you could give it to us again.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But you facilitate--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --Or in my -- in my hypothetical, could a rational jury say he knew about it, but he didn't intend it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, in my case -- and I'll finish.  I want to ask another question about this.  But in my case, if the judge had given the instruction, it's enough that he knew about it.  He facilitated the crime when he knew there was a gun.  Would that be error?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I understand your argument about intent, but are you also arguing that the -- that the actus reus instruction was insufficient?  The instruction about what your client did?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do you think it's necessary for an aider and abetter to facilitate every element of a criminal offense?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if there were not -- if the -- the drug offense were not illegal, there -- there wasn't a drug offense and then the -- the additional firearm element, it wouldn't be necessary for him -- for the defendant to facilitate every element of that offense.  It's dependent on the fact that there's this other criminal conduct.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, let me go back to my earlier hypothetical about the taped conversation.  Suppose that the alleged aider and abetter there says, I intend for you to use the gun.  I have that intent.  However, I'm not going to do one thing to help you get the gun or use the gun.  I don't want to -- I'm not going to.  There's an actus reus problem there because he doesn't facilitate the use of the gun?   ",12-895X
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could the defendant here have -- could the defendant here have been convicted of possession of the ammunition on the theory that -- under the instructions -- would the instructions have allowed that conviction on the theory that the defendant aided and abetted somebody else's possession of the ammunition?

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In the Stewart case to which you just referred, the court said,  ""The parties do not dispute that the district court properly denied the motion to dismiss the case for improper venue under 1406(a). ""  because Respondent apparently does business in the Northern District of Alabama, which was not the jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause.  So what -- if we were to write an opinion in your favor, what would you suggest we say about that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that's -- that's true, but it means that the entire discussion in Stewart is beside the point.  The Court wrote a decision about an issue that really never should arise because the party seeking -- as you see it, the party seeking to enforce the forum selection clause should proceed under 1406.  So Stewart said, well, if -- if you proceed under the wrong provision, this is how it should come out.  It makes the whole decision essentially meaningless, doesn't it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I don't see how that would -- I don't see how that would work.  You're -- this is the argument you made in your reply brief, that if this -- if the case had been filed in the jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause, that court could nevertheless proceed under 1404(a) and transfer it back to the Western District of Texas, for example.  That's -- that's your argument, right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In exceptional cases.  But 1404(a) says that it can -- a case can be transferred to a district where it might have been brought.  And your argument under 1406 is that they couldn't be brought in the Western District of Texas, that's a place where there's a wrong venue.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  May I ask about -- just go ahead.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can I ask you this about the Professor Sachs' argument?  Doesn't it lead to the consequence -- doesn't it show that -- wouldn't it mean that Justice Scalia's dissent was correct in Stewart and the majority was wrong in Stewart?  Because if this is -- if this is contractual -- suppose Ricoh in that case had moved -- had adopted -- had taken the approach that Professor Sachs has recommended and moved for summary judgment, 12(b)(6) or summary judgment; that would be a contract issue.  It would be governed by Alabama law.  Alabama law says the forum selection clause is no good.   INTERRUPTING ",12-929X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, the interests -- the interests of justice that the district court weighed almost all boiled down to the interests of your client.  The inconvenience of witnesses.  Well, Atlantic Marine, to the extent we're talking about their witnesses, they're not concerned about the inconvenience of having their witnesses go to -- to Norfolk.  But your witnesses -- the other witnesses are your witnesses.  So that's a factor that goes to your convenience.  Compulsory process to produce witnesses, same thing.  So what were the public interests that -- what were the interests that were weighed here that are not the interests of J. Crew?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if they're not your witnesses, then they're -- they're Atlantic Marine's witnesses.  So why should that be -- why should the inconvenience of Atlantic Marine's witnesses be a factor that weighs against Atlantic Marine's position that the case should be tried in Norfolk?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Who -- who is going to call these witnesses, you or Atlantic Marine?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You do, so they're your witnesses.  The fact that they don't work for you is -- is immaterial here.  So let's say they're out of the picture.  Now, what else -- what's left?  What other public interests are involved?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is -- Texas contract law is so arcane that the judges in the Eastern District of Virginia can't figure it out?  Is that right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Oh, okay.  [Laughter]   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if 1404 -- if the court--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --And what would be the authority for dismissing the case if it had specified the State court?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If 1404 is the correct procedural route, why shouldn't the rule be something like this: Where there is a forum selection clause, the burden is on -- the burden of trying to establish venue in some other jurisdiction is on the party opposing the forum selection clause, not the party that's invoking the forum selection clause.  And the only factors that can be considered against the forum selection clause to -- to result in an exceptional case where that wouldn't be honored are factors that have nothing to do with the convenience of the -- of the party that doesn't want it tried in -- in the selected forum or with the likelihood of success of the party that doesn't want it tried in the sel -- in the jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause.  So in your case, if there had been a hurricane that wiped out the courts of the Eastern District of Virginia for some period of time so no cases could be tried, or there was an incredible back load of cases there that would prevent the case from being tried, maybe that would be -- those would be something that might amount to an exceptional circumstance, but everything else is off the board.  What's wrong with that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, why should that -- why should that be, where there's a forum selection clause?   INTERRUPTING ",12-929X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But your reading of this statute gives (h)(3) a very, very narrow scope; isn't that correct?  And I just want to see if I understand exactly how narrow it is.  It would apply -- first of all, does it apply to any employment-based or diversity-based petitions?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  It applies to an F2A petition filed by a legal permanent resident on behalf of that person's spouse; right?  And -- and if that -- if they have a minor child, then the minor child would be a derivative.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Benefit sharing.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Suppose there are two -- suppose there are two lawful permanent residents who are exactly the same except that one has a minor child and one has an adult unmarried child.  So the latter files an F2B petition and gets in line on a particular date, right?  Then the former, the lawful permanent resident who has an unmarried -- who has a minor child, files an F2A petition and gets in that line.  But then by the time the date comes up, the child has aged out and so now you would say that would be converted to an F2B petition.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But the person would be -- the child would be at a much lower point, right, than the first one?  Why would Congress have wanted that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Right.  And the other one would be higher up.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Oh, okay.  I see.  Thank you.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is your real quarrel here with the idea of an appropriate category or with the automatic conversion?  On the Respondent's view, why isn't there an automatic conversion?  Because they say that as soon as the person ages out they can be moved into -- into another category.  That sounds like it's automatic.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, why isn't it automatic?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Automatic just means something occurs without anybody having to initiate the change.   Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  --There is no question that the Voting Rights Act has done enormous good.  It's one of the most successful statutes that Congress passed in the twentieth century and one could probably go farther than that.  But when Congress decided to reauthorize it in 2006, why wasn't it incumbent on Congress under the congruence and proportionality standard to make a new determination of coverage?  Maybe the whole country should be covered.  Or maybe certain parts of the country should be covered based on a formula that is grounded in up-to-date statistics.  But why -- why wasn't that required by the congruence and proportionality standards?  Suppose that Congress in 1965 had based the coverage formula on voting statistics from 1919, 46 years earlier.  Do you think Katzenbach would have come out the same way?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Then why shouldn't it apply everywhere in the country?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, you do really think there was -- that the record in 2006 supports the proposition that -- let's just take the question of changing the location of polling places.  That's a bigger problem in Virginia than in Tennessee, or it's a bigger problem in Arizona than Nevada, or in the Bronx as opposed to Brooklyn.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, the statistics that I have before me show that in, let's say the 5 years prior to reauthorization, the gap between success in Section 2 suits in the covered and the non-covered jurisdiction narrowed and eventually was eliminated.

Is it your position that this would be a different case if it were brought by, let's say, a county in Alaska as opposed to Shelby County, Alabama?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, Section 5 -- the Section 5 activity may show that there's a problem in the jurisdictions covered by Section 5, but it says nothing about the presence or absence of similar problems in noncovered jurisdictions, isn't that right?

What's the difference between those two?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Isn't the reasoning of Ahlborn that when we know to a certainty how much the medical expenses were and what -- what part of the judgment this represents or the settlement represents medical expenses, then only that much can be assigned to the government?

Alito, Jr.  Well, this is what I envision happening, if the -- if the parties can't -- if the State and the -- and the recipient of the -- of Medicaid assistance can't come to an agreement.  Basically, you have to make an estimate of what the damages would have been if the case had been tried and then you determine that the medical portion of the damages would have been 15 percent and so you reduce, then you take the amount of the settlement, and the amount of the settlement that is attributable to the medical expenses is 15 percent.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can I ask a question about where your argument might lead?  I think you acknowledged earlier that if we hold that your statute cannot be challenged under the Tax Injunction Act and it's ultimately determined to be constitutional, this would be very attractive for all the other States to copy.  So let's -- let's suppose that that happens and so now every State has a law like this, and every State -- and there are many different variations in the forms.  Maybe there are 50 forms that have to be submitted to State tax authorities.

Now I will have to submit potentially 50 different forms to all of these States reporting that somebody in South Carolina purchased something from me that cost 23.99.  Now, I know you have a -- you have a requirement that it has to reach a certain threshold, but I don't see it and that's just something that you've chosen to do.  But that's where this all could lead, couldn't it?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, Congress wrote a statute with terms that seem most naturally read to have a technical meaning, restrain, suspend, enjoin, assess, levy, and collect.  Those are not -- those are not the terms that one might use if one were speaking colloquially.  Let me come back to Justice Kagan's pizza example.  So her clerks are collecting money for pizza to be had at night and let's say the Chief Justice says this is fine, but you -- you may not use court e-mail to try to collect this.  Now, would you say that the Chief Justice has restrained, suspended or enjoined the collection of the pizza money?  You might say he's made it a little bit harder, maybe he's interfered with it.  But would -- would anybody naturally use those technical terms.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, let's say we're back in -- we're in the pre-internet era and I order something over the phone from an out-of-State vendor.  So this vendor is going to mail it to me across State lines.  And let's say this particular vendor is somebody who feels very strongly that everybody ought to pay taxes that are due.  So this vendor voluntarily, once my order has been placed, says to me, now, I'm going to ship this to you in your State and I'm not going to charge you -- say I'm not going to make you pay sales tax in my State.  I just want to remind you that you are obligated under the law of your State to pay use tax.  Would you say that that vendor has assessed the use tax?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yes.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that's -- that's what you're arguing here, isn't it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's exactly what happens.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You would say that by saying that, making that illegal statement, they've enjoined the -- the payment of the tax?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  They have restrained it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Before your time expires, what's your best formulation of the connection that you think is required?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The likely effect culminating in collection just seems to me that it benefits collection in some way.   ",13-1032
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can we begin by looking at the text of the statute?  What does the phrase “ relating to a controlled substance ”, et cetera, modify?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, let's say we were let's say we're back in high school and we have to diagram this sentence.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  We could start out that way, and maybe we'll get beyond it, but let's start out that way.  We have a phrase here, “ relating to a controlled substance ”.  What does it modify?  It has to modify a noun.  What noun does it modify?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If it modifies “ law ”, then I think you've lost the case.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that was my question.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that -- that might be sensible, but I -- I really do need to start with the text of the statute and understand what you make of the text of the statute.  So if “ relating to ” modifies “ law ”, do you deny that the law -- that the -- the Kansas law in question here relates to a controlled substance?  Or do you read relating to a controlled substance to mean relating solely to controlled substances as defined by Federal law?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But the law -- the law relates to what it relates to.  It doesn't relates to.  It doesn't relate to something at one time and something at another time.  What does the law relate to?  The law relates to a long list of drugs.  The great majority of them are on the Federal list.  A few of them are not on the Federal list.  Now, if it said relating solely to drugs on the Federal list, you'd have an argument.  I just need to know what you want us to do with the text of the -- of the statute.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It certainly is possible for “ relating to ” to modify “ violation ”.  It's an awkward way of phrasing it, but that is possible.  It's a noun.  It could modify that.  So what would the violation be?  Is the -- the violation then is not -- the violation, I take it, then, would be the alien's conduct, what the alien did.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is that right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So what then happens if the alien's conduct relates to a Federally controlled substance, but the conviction is under a law that does not relate to a Federally controlled substance?  What if the alien, for example, is convicted of burglarizing a house for the purpose of stealing drugs that are in the house?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The law doesn't relate to a controlled substance, but the conduct does relate to a controlled substance.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What if the -- what if someone was convicted of possession of a pipe that is very well designed to smoke crack, but maybe conceivably could be used to smoke a little bit of tobacco.  So it -- maybe it's lawfully sold in some places because it could have a legitimate use.  What would -- what would happen then?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  He's convicted of possessing a crack pipe.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It's necessary to show that -- that there was crack in the pipe?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, in your view, in order to make -- in order to make this count as a -- as a deportable offense, it would be necessary to show that there actually was crack in the pipe or that he actually used the pipe to smoke crack.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, crack is a Federally controlled substance.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So I didn't understand the answer to your question.  Would -- would it be -- would the crack pipe itself be enough or do you have to show actual crack?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  When you say “ categorical approach ”, you mean the modified categorical approach, do you not?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In -- in a jurisdiction like Kansas or in any foreign jurisdiction that has a list of controlled substances that is a little bit broader than the Federal list, lists at least one or two that are broader than the Federal list, the pure categorical approach would never result in -- in removal; am I right?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In a removable offense.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How would it?  You'd say -- the person was convicted of selling a drug that is categorized, that is on a list or part of a list, that would be the element of the offense.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So you would have to look beyond that to see which particular drug.  That's the modified approach, is it not?   ",13-1034
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Under your definition -- under your understanding of this, what practical work is done by the phrase as defined in Section 802 of Title XXI?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You said a couple of minutes ago, and I had assumed this to be true, that under the laws of all the States, the great majority of controlled substances are on the Federal list, and there -- in some instances -- are a few additional ones and you said that all of those laws would be covered.  If that's the case, then I don't see what was achieved by putting the reference to the Federal list in the statute.  They might have just said relating to a controlled substance.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do we -- do we even know that this is a -- a proper conviction under Kansas law, that the Kansas statute actually means what it's been interpreted here to mean?  The Petitioner pled guilty to this, I think, because he got a break, because he could have been charged with something -- if, in fact, he had Adderall, which is a Federally controlled substance -- he could have been charged with something more serious.  So he pled to this misdemeanor.  But it's really hard to believe that the Kansas statute actually regards as drug paraphernalia anything that is used at any time to contain a controlled substance.  Suppose somebody buys marijuana or some other drug and it's in a plastic bag.  So the plastic bag is -- that's one violation.  The person puts it in a pocket; that's another violation.  The pocket is -- is drug paraphernalia.  Takes it out of the pocket and puts it in the glove compartment of a car; that's a third violation.  The car is equipment that's used to store it.  Takes it out of that, puts it in something -- it -- it can't really mean this, but we don't have State court interpretations.   INTERRUPTING ",13-1034
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But how do you propose -- how do you propose that we determine whether it's based on commercial activity? Take their failure-to-warn claim.  Why isn't that based on something that occurred in the United States? You're just -- are you just asking us to -- to step back and say, well, in that case we -- we really think they're just trying -- they have a -- they have a tort that occurred in Austria, a negligence tort that occurred in Austria, and they're just trying to plead around it with these other claims?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, it might be -- it might be a claim that couldn't prevail, but why does that answer the question?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In the Chief Justice's example, he -- he stated that there was negligence in the United States.  But what if there's no evidence of that? There's a -- there's a problem with the landing gear when the plane lands in Austria, and the claim is that there was a failure to inspect in the United States, or a failure to do proper maintenance in the United States.  Would that be different?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What if you have a tort claim that has one element in the United States, how do -- how does a court determine whether the gravamen of the claim is in the United States or elsewhere?   Edwin S. Kneedler  I think -- I think focusing on what -- on what the defendant's conduct is that actually caused the injury.  And here, the -- the only difference between this case and Nelson is the argument that the purchase of the ticket, which is the -- by the way, the only commercial activity that was relied upon below.  The Ninth Circuit says this at Phaneuf 13 and Footnote 4.  Respondent is now trying to broaden that into the entire operations of the railroad which would actually be an assertion of general jurisdiction. Anything that would arise in the operation of a railroad in -- in Austria could be the subject of a suit if it was deemed to have substantial connection with the United States.   ",13-1067

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  This is -- this is spinning out into degrees of abstraction that I hadn't anticipated.  But it's hard for me to believe that Congress really had any intent whatsoever on -- on these issues.  I don't envision members of Congress sitting around thinking about these things.  But put that aside.  Do you -- is it your argument that we should follow congressional intent or not?  Or is it your argument that Congress's intent was to adopt -- to say this is jurisdictional and we delegate, basically, to the courts the -- the determination of what is jurisdictional?  So if they change their mind about the difference between jurisdiction and non-jurisdiction, then that's what this should mean.  Which -- which is it?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So it's not what Congress intended.  You're saying that if they intended to -- all they thought about was they had one idea about jurisdiction, they couldn't conceive of another one, they wanted it to be jurisdictional in accordance with their idea, but that would change.

[Laughter]  This question about the -- the issue that you've been addressing in response to Justice Scalia's question.  In -- in the Fourth Amendment context where it is purely -- the inquiry is purely objective, we have case law on what is reasonable suspicion, what is probable cause.  Now, if you apply that to a First Amendment case where there -- where it's asserted that there is a security -- there may or may not be a security concern, would it not be necessary for us to identify a -- a degree of suspicion or probable cause that the Secret Service would have to have before making -- before moving people for security reasons?  I imagine whenever the President is out in public, there is some degree of risk.  You want no risk?  You know, keep him in a bunker.  So at some point -- do you see what I'm saying?  They--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --The Secret Service has to make a decision about how much information they need before they can -- they should move people or change a route or something like that.  So the courts would then have to set that standard.   ",13-115X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, what about the other situation, which is similar to your case but not exactly similar -- not exactly the same.  You don't plead any evidence of direct intent -- any direct evidence of intent on the part of the officers, but you have two groups.  One's pro, one's anti, and the officers put one group one place and one group the other place.  Now, the distance from the President to the two groups is not the same.  One is somewhat closer, one is somewhat farther away.  The -- the things that are in between the group and the President are different.  Maybe in the group that's further away, you might think the things are -- they might -- one might think that there are fewer obstructions, maybe there are more obstructions on the other side.  So you plead that the -- the placement of the anti-group was less favorable than placement of the pro-group and is that enough?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What more do you need?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, you -- you plead intent.  Would you be -- if you pled intent based just on the disparate impact, would you be in violation of Rule 11?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What more would you need?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What -- then what does happen if a district court does allow discovery of things what the Secret Service thinks are confidential?  Under certain -- how far should demonstrators be away from the President?  How high must a fence be before we think that it provides security against a thrown object?  Suppose the district court allows discovery of all of that.  What are they supposed to do?  They have to file a mandamus petition with the court of appeals and get -- have the court of appeals -- try to persuade the court of appeals to review a discovery order?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Just out of curiosity, was there anything to prevent someone from leaving one these groups and going over to the other group?   Samuel A.

Otherwise, so -- it was consolidate -- it be -- became part of a single action and, therefore, it was -- it was tantamount to a claim.   Samuel A.

Maybe it was wrong to have this in camera, but why was the statement that we don't want to disclose our strategy a statement that -- that challenges that -- that the challenges that I'm going to make are going to be pretextual?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I don't understand that. When you -- when you're trying a case and you're deciding which jurors to exercise peremptory challenges against, do you not take into account what your defense is going to be? What your defense strategy in the case is going to be.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, let me give you an example.  Let's say your defense strategy is going to be that the police officers planted incriminating evidence. All right? And if that's going to be your defense strategy, will you not be particularly diligent in exercising your peremptory challenges to try to get rid of anybody who seems to have sympathy or an identification with the police.  That's a strategy. It's not pretextual.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Now, there may not have been that here.  The prosecutor may not have had a strategy like that.  I -- but I just don't understand this argument that you're making, that merely stating I don't want to disclose to my adversary what my trial strategy will be is a confession that I am going to exercise peremptory challenges pretextually, and I just don't want defense counsel there to call me on it.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Of course it's speculative that defense counsel, had defense counsel been present, would have been able to point to the other juror, Anna. We've had a number of cases where defense counsel was present at the voir dire, which I think should be the rule in almost every situation, and only later, years later on appeal when -- as particularly when you have many, many jurors questioned, as apparently was the case here, does somebody realize, well, this juror who was dismissed, has answers seem to be somewhat similar to this other juror who -- who wasn't challenged.

1,"Samuel A.

A friend, let's say.  Let's say it's a friend who lives two blocks away. Now, if this friend doesn't -- is not himself a convicted felon or doesn't have some other aspect of his record that would prevent him from buying a firearm, he could go to a licensed firearm dealer, presumably, and purchase it directly; right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So why should the situation -- and that would be true even though he is a friend of the convicted felon, and there might be some risk that he would allow the convicted felon to use the firearm.

Alito, Jr.  But I thought you understood -- I though you were saying that the district court would have the discretion to prevent that transfer if the district court thought there was some risk that this individual would allow the convicted felon to have access to the firearm.

Does it -- was there a greater danger of quid pro quo corruption or the appearance of corruption or bias or coercion, the difference between what she did and what she could have done?  And what she could have done as I understood your answers is the following: She could have -- a letter could have been sent by a committee and the letter could have -- could have said that Petitioner gave us your name and asked us to solicit a contribution from you, and that's what we're doing.  And the letter could either say,  ""and we'll let the judge know if you gave a contribution.

Did somebody receive the Congressional Medal of Honor or not?     --No, I agree with that.  There was a false statement of a verifiable -- verifiable fact, but it was a false statement anywhere, anytime; even like at home, if you make the statement, it could be covered.

You argue that they can't.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Now, why is that?  Is it -- is it your position that there's something about the corporate form per se that is inconsistent with the free exercise claim?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  But is it your argument that there's something about engaging in a for-profit activity that is inconsistent with a free exercise claim?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  Well, what is it about--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --a for-profit corporation that is inconsistent with a free exercise claim?  Do you agree with the proposition that was endorsed by one of the lower courts in this case, that for-profit corporations must do nothing but maximize profits, they cannot have other aims--   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

Let me read you what HHS said in the regulation:  ""With certain particularly significant protections, particularly significant protections, Congress required grandfathered health plans to comply with a subset of the Affordable Care Act's health reform provisions. ""  ""On the other hand, grandfathered health plans are not required to comply with certain other requirements of the Affordable Care Act; for example, the requirement that preventive health services be covered without any cost sharing. ""  So isn't HHS saying there, quite specifically, these, in our view, are not within this subset of particularly significant requirements as to which there must be immediate compliance?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, we can ask Mr. Clement what his position is on this.  But you say they have already asserted that it would be inconsistent with RFRA as they understand it to provide for a for-profit corporation, like the ones involved here, the sort of accommodation that HHS has extended to so-called religious nonprofits, perhaps with the modification that was included in our stay order in the Little Sisters case.  Have they taken a position on that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I thought that -- I was taken by your answer.  I thought it was the government's position that providing coverage for the full range of contraceptives and other devices and drugs that are covered here is actually financially neutral for an insurance company, that that reduces other costs that they would incur.

INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It is a religious question and it's a moral question.  And you want us to provide a definitive secular answer to it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What about the implications of saying that no for-profit corporation can raise any sort of free exercise claim at all and nobody associated with the for-profit corporation can raise any sort of free exercise claim at all?  Let me give you this example.  According to the media, Denmark recently prohibited kosher and halal slaughter methods because they believe that they are inhumane.  Now, suppose Congress enacted something like that here.  What would the -- what would a corporation that is a kosher or halal slaughterhouse do?  They would simply -- they would have no recourse whatsoever.  They couldn't even get a day in court.  They couldn't raise a RFRA claim.  They couldn't raise a First Amendment claim.

Because they didn't hold that their reasonable basis standard was satisfied here.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if it's not purely subjective, if it's the reasonable basis test, what does that mean?

I I would like some more concrete guidance as to what is reasonable.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But this is always going to come up after it's been shown that the statement turned out the statement of belief turned out to be incorrect.  The registration statements says, We believe X.  It turns out X is not true.  So it's not going to be very hard in that situation for a plaintiff to allege that he that the issuer did not make a reasonable investigation because if if they had done a reasonable investigation, they would have discovered that X wasn't true.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  They say, someone pleads that they said we believe there were no bribes paid, and then later it's discovered that lots of bribes were being paid off someplace.  So they alleged all the things that have turned out to be inconsistent with the statement of belief, and they say had they sent someone there to investigate, they would have found this, they would have found that.

I thought that your -- I thought the reason why you've argued this case the way you have, trying to convince us to draw a very sharp distinction between right and remedy is because you believe that North Carolina has the right under State law to devise its own version of the exclusionary rule.

Alito, Jr.  Now, I know that we are -- asked you to argue this vagueness issue, but when you were here before, you didn't think that the statute was vague as applied to your client.  As I remember, your argument was it's clear that your client did not fall within the residual clause, largely because he was convicted.  The offense that's at issue is a possession offense, and you argue that none of the specific offenses listed is -- is a possession offense.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if it's not plainly included, why do we have to get to this issue at all? Why should we reach out to decide a constitutional question?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But we get -- almost every case that comes here involves a dispute among the lower courts about what something means, about what the constitutional rule is or what the statutory interpretation should be. So the mere fact that there's disagreement about this, that shows that it's unconstitutionally vague?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In -- in James, in 2007, we held that the residual clause -- we said the residual clause is not unconstitutionally vague.  In Sykes, in 2011, we reaffirmed that. Can you give me other examples of instances in which the Court has overruled a constitutional holding that has been twice reaffirmed within a period of 8 years? Has that happened frequently?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, do you think the issue is whether the statute is unconstitutionally vague or whether this Court's interpretations of the statute create the basis for a vagueness argument?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can -- can a statute be vague simply because this Court messes it up?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Suppose the -- suppose the question of whether it's a serious potential risk of physical injury to another were a factual question submitted to the jury to be determined on the basis of what your client did.  Would that be unconstitutionally vague?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is that a yes or a no?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I wasn't asking about a recidivist statute.  I was asking about a statute that imposed a particular penalty for possession of -- of a sawed-off shotgun.  And it says or it -- someone is convicted under a statute that has this language and the possession of the sawed-off shotgun was -- had just occurred. Do you think you think that would not be unconstitutionally vague?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, Congress was trying to do something here and some may think it's a good thing to do, some may thing it's not a good thing to do, it's a legitimate thing to do.  And that is to impose an enhanced penalty for people who -- felons who possess firearms and have a record of prior convictions for certain category of offenses. Now, if you don't use -- if -- if the -- the residual clause is held to be unconstitutionally vague, is there any other way that Congress could accomplish that end?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why does that solve the problem, has as an element the creation of a serious potential risk?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, an offense that prohibits the possession of a -- of a sawed-off shotgun has as an element the possession of a sawed-off shotgun. So you'd have to decide whether that element creates the risk.  I don't see how that solves it.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I -- I don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but just this quick question. If -- if Congress assigned a committee or a person to go through the criminal code of every single jurisdiction and identify those offenses that didn't fall within any other provision of ACCA, but met, in the judgment of those -- that individual or those individuals, the residual clause standard, how many do you think they would come up with?

INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In the Armed Career Criminal Act in general, and the residual clause in particular, has caused no end of problems for this Court.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Go ahead.  Has there been any suggestion at any point in this case -- in the district court, in the court of appeals, in the papers that have been filed here -- that the decision was based on anything other than the reasoning of the district court?  Any other reason been given?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Let me give you an example of something that happens quite frequently and maybe you can tell me if this situation is any different from that.  A district court has to make a decision on something as to which the district court has discretion.  A party urges the district court to make a particular decision based on one ground.  And the one ground is based on a legal error.  The district court rules in favor of that party but says absolutely nothing.  Now the issue is raised on appeal, the argument is that the trial judge abused his or her discretion.  Now, would that be insulate it from review for abuse of discretion on the ground that, well, we really don't know why the judge did what the judge did?  The judge didn't say anything.  So the judge might not have based the decision on this one -- on this legal error, the only ground that was urged upon the court.  It might have been based on something else.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What would be -- is that different from this situation?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That might be a little premature.   ",13-719X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Maybe you answered this before, but is it your position that under the Class Action Fairness Act the court of appeals has absolute discretion, unlimited discretion, to decide whether to take an appeal or not?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Any reason whatsoever is okay?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So what if the court of appeals says, we are not taking this because we just don't like the Class Action Fairness Act.  We think it's bad public policy; we are never going to take one of these.  That's okay?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I was going say -- and this is not certainly true of the Tenth Circuit -- but suppose things change and we get to the point where each judge on the Tenth Circuit is sitting on ten cases a year, and so they can have a ten-month vacation.  And they say, well, we don't want to take this, because, you know, we may not have a ten-month vacation, we'll have a nine-month vacation.  Would that be all right?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, all the Class Action Fairness Act says is, I believe, is that the court may take the case.  It doesn't -- it doesn't specify the scope of discretion.  It doesn't say it's absolute.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Outside of the Class Action Fairness Act, may a district court -- is a court of appeals barred from reviewing a decision of the district court to remand the case based on docket control?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can we infer anything from that as to whether Congress thought that that would be a proper reason under the Class Action Fairness Act?   ",13-719X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that's not true of terms of art in statutes, is it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, some of them are very technical, and I doubt that the -- the general public has any understanding of some very technical terms that appear in statutes.  So would they not be read in light of what someone who is knowledgeable in that field would understand the -- the term to mean?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I'll give you an example.  The Dodd-Frank Act refers to Tier 1 Capital.  Do you think that the average person on the street has any idea what Tier 1 capital is?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Among the general public or among people who are knowledgeable in that particular area?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Isn't your--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --Go ahead.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In a recent law review article written by two authors, one of whom is a -- is the deputy solicitor in the Patent and Trademark Office, the office -- the authors said that they surveyed a very large number of cases to try to find any in which the difference between de novo review and clear error review of factual questions by the Federal Circuit made a difference in the outcome and they couldn't find any case in which this fascinating legal debate had a practical significance.  Now, you want to introduce a level of complication to this.  The Federal Circuit says de novo for everything, and you want the court -- you want the Federal Circuit now to struggle to determine which are factual questions as to which there's clear error review, which ones get de novo review, whether it's the ultimate question.  Is it worthwhile as a practical matter?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And you say that factual findings that are subject to clear error review must be, quote,  ""in some sense distinct from the meaning or validity of the patent. ""  I don't understand what that means when the issue is the meaning or validity of the patent.  If the evidence is -- is relevant, then it is -- there is a connection.  So what does that mean, in some sense distinct?   Ginger D. Anders  Well, it means that the district court is making a finding based on -- based on science, based on expertise, somebody's -- somebody's expertise in the field and making a finding about a matter that isn't just what does this term mean in the patent.  It's making a more broad finding.  So for instance, what does this type of scientific process, what type of data does it produce?  You can say that's related to the patent because of course the patent uses SEC and one question is what kind of data does it produce.  But it is also a finding of fact to say, as a general matter, the way science works is that SEC produces MP without further calculation.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that sounds like every factual finding.  It sounds like you're saying that anything that is a factual issue is subject to clear error review.  But I thought you were saying something less than that.   Ginger D. Anders  Well, I think that is a factual finding, but then what the district court has to do is take that information which allows it to assume the -- the perspective of a skilled artisan and then decide what it tells it about the patent itself.  And that's a question of looking at -- at the document itself.  So the fact that the patent uses SEC, does that raise an inference about what the term “ molecular weight ” in the patent means or not.  That's a question of textual analysis.   ",13-854X
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if a patent is--   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  --Mr. Phillips, can I try this out and see if you agree with me.  If a patent is like public law, if it's like a statute or like a rule, then factual findings regarding the meaning of that patent are not entitled to clear error review.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Any more than factual findings regarding the meaning of a statute are -- or the Constitution are entitled to plain error review.  What was the original understanding of the Second Amendment?  That's a factual question, but it's not subject to plain error review.  What did Congress intend if you think Congress intended things?  That's a factual question, but it's not subject to plain error review.  Now, on the other hand, if a patent is private law, if it's like a deed or if it's like a contract, then Rule 52(a) comes into play.  Do you agree with that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, you began by -- by criticizing Alabama for supposedly imposing quotas.  But listening to your argument, it sounds to me that you are just as interested in quotas.  You're just interested in lower quotas.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if you -- if they want to keep it at 70 percent, that's that may be illegitimate in your view.  But if they take it down to the minimum that would be required in order to produce the desired result, that's a -- that's a -- a permissible quota.  So why are you using this term “ quota ” at all?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, why did you use it?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You think there's a difference between the two?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Did the district court understand you to be asserting a district-specific -- district-specific claims?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Where -- where do you find that in the -- in the opinion of the district court?  I thought the district court interpreted you not to be making that claim.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, explain -- now that you're talking about districts, could I come back to the question I asked at the beginning, so that I understand what we have to decide.  On page 128 of the Joint Appendix, there's a paragraph in the district court opinion that explains what the district court understood to be -- to before it on the issue of intentional discrimination.  I see nowhere any indication that the district court construed your pleadings and your other submissions to raise a claim about any specific district.  The third point is we construe the filings of the Democratic Conference plaintiffs as arguing that certain senate districts constitute racial gerrymanders.  There's nothing like that with respect to your client.  Maybe I'm missing something.  So if that's how the district court understood your position, then maybe it was wrong, but that would be the threshold question we'd have to decide, wouldn't it be, that if you have to be district-specific, we would have to say the district court misunderstood the claims that you were asserting?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The district court understood that?  Then why did it include this paragraph and why did it not go through any districts that it saw you as challenging?  It went through some that it saw the other plaintiffs as challenging, none with respect to you.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  General, you say that the district court erred in addressing the claim of racial gerrymandering on a statewide rather than a district-specific basis.  I would assume that that was an error on the part of the district court only if a district-specific claim was asserted by the plaintiffs, but you don't address that issue.   INTERRUPTING ",13-895X
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, the Solicitor General just said that if you look at that district, it has a very bizarre shape and the effect of the bizarre shape is to pull in predominantly African-American areas and exclude predominantly white areas.  Is he correct on that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could I follow up on Justice Breyer's exploration of what would happen if this was done over?  I assume that Section 5 would not be a consideration so long as a new coverage formula is not adopted by Congress.  Is that correct?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And the legislature could do whatever it wants if it's -- if it relies purely on partisanship rather than on race.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And to what degree would or could -- to what degree would the legislature be justified in doing and to what degree would it be required to take into account the degree, if any, to which Section 2 imposes something like a retrogression requirement?

Alito, Jr.  What does that mean?  They -- what does that mean in relationship to the distance that must be involved?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The problem is we don't -- the jury would not know and the court would not know what you are looking at, what ultimately you're concerned about.  You have a number of factors.  But I assume the point of this statute is to impose a severe penalty in cases in which Congress thought there would be great emotional distress for the person who is forced to accompany that person.  Now, that could depend on lots of things, not just the distance traveled.  So to -- applying a purely spatial test to that just doesn't make any sense.  You can't say is it substantial in relation to the thing that this statute is getting at.  That is what I have a problem with.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is the reason for this?

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could I ask you -- I'm sorry.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You wanted to finish that.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It doesn't seem clear to me that these two theories are actually separate.  They -- they -- when Congress enacts a criminal statute, it often adds a lot of synonyms.  So, you know, in the -- in a theft statute, whoever embezzles, steals, or unlawfully and willfully extracts or converts, et cetera, they're not necessarily all distinct.  And I don't really see a difference between making unauthorized access and exceeding authorized access. Let's take the first, making unauthorized access.  Let's say somebody has access to some -- an employee here in the building has access to -- lawful access, proper access to some records.  If that employee at night sneaks into some other place in the building and starts looking through files, that person is making unauthorized access. And in the other situation, exceeding authorized access, let's say a person doesn't have any -- any access to any files in the court, but sneaks in and looks at those files.  That person had zero authorized access and, therefore, exceeded authorized access. I just think these are -- it seems to me, reading them, they're two ways of saying the same thing. So the issue that's presented here may not -- the issue that you've asked us to decide may not actually be presented by the facts of this case.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Suppose that there's a -- that there's a two-count indictment and there's plenty of evidence to convict on Count I and zero evidence, not one scintilla of evidence, on Count II, and the jury convicts on both counts; so the -- defendant is entitled to a judgment of acquittal on Count II. But you seem to be saying in that situation, the court would say, this is a crazy jury.  This is an irrational jury because their verdict on Count II is totally ridiculous; and therefore, the defendant is entitled to judgment of acquittal on Count I as well, despite the fact that there's plenty of evidence on Count I. Is that what you're saying?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, what's different -- what's the difference between that and the argument you just made?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That -- that would be a revolutionary holding.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, why was the instruction erroneous? You concede that these two methods of violating the statute are discrete? They're not just different ways of describing the same thing?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, suppose you had an indictment charging someone with exceeding authorized access and there was a factual dispute about, let's say, the date on which the employee's employment ended, so therefore, the date on which any authorized access that the employee had to records of the employer ended, you would say that, if you did not succeed in proving beyond a reasonable doubt that, as of the date when the access was obtained, the employee had ceased to be employed, that that employee would be entitled to a judgment of acquittal? That seems rather odd.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, couldn't there not be --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why shouldn't the rule in this context be the same as the rule for timely filing a Federal habeas petition?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You think that the State's interest in the habeas context in finality and comity is stronger than the defendant's interest in a direct criminal appeal in requiring that the charge be filed on time where what's at stake is -- is a criminal conviction?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But -- but just take a situation where, under the habeas rule, it would be proper for the -- the district court to raise the statute-of-limitations defense on its own motion.  Why would that not fit within the plain-error rule?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Suppose the court of appeals in -- in a direct appeal sees that the statute of limitations for a particular offense is six years and the indictment was filed 25 years after the event.  Can the court of appeals say to the government, look at this.  It looks like it's too late.  Do you have any explanation for this? And the government says, well, no, doesn't -- we can't think of anything. Do you have to wait until habeas to correct that?   ",14-1095

Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  May I ask you about the statutory language that seems to me to present the greatest problem for your position.  Maybe it's not fatal, but what I'm referring to is the provision that says the term applies -- so we're looking at whether the -- the State offense here is described in the Federal arson statute.  And then there's language that says, the term applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law. What do you make of that? It can be argued that what that means is that, when you have a Federal offense with a jurisdictional provision, you disregard the jurisdictional provision because you're never going to find that in a State provision.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But suppose --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Go ahead.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Take two -- two defendants. One is convicted of the Federal offense of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, where you have to prove a connection between the firearm and interstate commerce.

Suppose the complaint in this case made no reference to any Federal regulations but -- I'm not that familiar with the pleading rules in New Jersey, but suppose they would -- it was, you know, notice pleading and so there's no reference to the regulations but they -- they sought to prove their case by arguing that the New Jersey -- the New -- the rule in New Jersey should be the same as the Federal regulation.  Would that fall within your test?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why couldn't the New Jersey Supreme Court -- why couldn't the New Jersey Supreme Court say this is our interpretation of a provision of the -- the New Jersey Uniform Securities Act, with respect to short selling, this is what it means, and without ever referring to Reg SHO, adopt basically the same or exactly the same rule that is incorporated in that regulation?

Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  So you seem to be saying that the category of claims they did not want adjudicated in State court are only these: Those in which the plaintiff is asking for the enforcement of a Federal duty, and there is no comparable State duty at that time, and the State court is unwilling to recognize a comparable State duty in the context of that litigation. So these are essentially cases in which the State is basically hostile to the Federal duty.  And those are the only cases that Congress did not want to have adjudicated in State court.

But actually, of the 34, only 6 of them signed the brief that was submitted by a number of States making that argument.  23 States, 23 jurisdictions submitted that brief; 17 of them are States that established State exchanges.  Only 6 of the States that didn't establish State exchanges signed that brief, how do you account for that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, the puzzle that's created by -- by your interpretation is this: If Congress did not want the phrase ""established by the State"" to mean what that would normally be taken to mean, why did they use that language? Why didn't they use other formulations that appear elsewhere in the Act? Why didn't they say, ""established under the Act""? Why didn't they say, ""established within the State""? Why didn't they include a provision saying that an Exchange established by HHS is a State Exchange when they have a provision in there that does exactly that for the District of Columbia and for the territories? It says that they are deemed to be States for purposes of this Act.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So why would they do that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, before you -- before you get on to that, that -- your answer doesn't explain why -- why ""by the State"" is in there.  Then why didn't they say ""established under 1311""?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, why didn't they say ""in the State""? That's the phrase you just used, ""in the State."" Why didn't they say ""in the State""?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So when the statute says, ""each State shall establish,"" it really means the Federal government shall establish if a State doesn't establish.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And if that were the correct interpretation, you wouldn't 1321 at all.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Would you agree that there -- that there are provisions of the Act where the exact same phrase, ""established by the State,"" has to be read to mean established by the State and not by HHS?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  There are some provisions like that.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  Well, let's take one -- let's take one.  I'd be interested in your answer to it.  42 U.S.C. Section 1396w-3(h)(1)(D) which says that each State shall establish procedures to ensure that an Exchange established by the State utilizes a secure electronic interface.  And they say that if that is read to -- if ""Exchange established by the State"" there is read to mean an HHS Exchange, that means that the State in which that Exchange is established is responsible for making sure that the Federal Exchange has a secure electronic interface.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And the State --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  As I understand your answer to be that there are Federal regulations telling the States what they have to do here, and they've all done it.  But the fact remains that the State has some obligation under the regulations to make sure that there is a proper interface with the Federal Exchange.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is the provision that says that only a -- only a qualified individual can be -- can enroll in a plan under an Exchange?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Qualified health plan.  But what's the provision you were referring to when you said that an Exchange may enroll only a qualified individual?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I understand your argument is that it's a -- it's a logical inference from a number of provisions that only a qualified individual may purchase the policy, but I gather there is no provision that you can point to that says that directly.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  ""Qualified"" is used in the -- in the lay sense of the term, it's not a technical term here.   INTERRUPTING ",14-114X

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, before you get to that, could we begin with what the Ninth Circuit decided? You're entitled to defend the judgment on any ground that you like, but -- that was presented below, but the only issue we have to -- we have to reach is the correctness of the Ninth Circuit's decision. Now, I understand what the Ninth Circuit to have held, to be this, that the hovercraft rule is not barred by the second sentence of Section 103(c) of ANILCA, because the hovercraft rule does not apply only in Alaska, because it applies throughout the country. Is that -- that's a correct understanding of what they held?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, no.  I want to -- I understand the -- the holding -- and I -- I stand ready to be corrected -- to be what I stated: That the hovercraft rule is not barred because it isn't Alaska-specific. And, I mean, you filed a 58-page brief and, as I read it, you didn't get to the reason that the Ninth Circuit based its decision on until page 49, and you devoted exactly a paragraph to it. And why don't you concede that it's wrong? It's a ridiculous interpretation, is it not? (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, you -- you want to talk about waters, and -- and after this question I won't say anything more on this, but is the Ninth Circuit's holding limited to waters? The -- the State of Alaska on page 20 and 21 of their brief cite a notice in the Federal Register by the Park Service in which they defend the regulation of nonfederal oil and gas activities on the basis of Sturgeon, on the ground that Section 103(c) of ANILCA applies only to Alaska-specific regulations.  And since these are not Alaska-specific, those -- those regulations apply. So they understand it to apply to something more than just navigable waters.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It's solely to apply to Alaska --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- within such unit?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Solely to apply to nonpublic units to lands in Alaska.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What can you do about why this provision that you -- you reproduce on 7a gets around the first section of 103(c)? This -- that provision allows regulation of waters within Service units, but the first section, as I read it, says that nonpublic land within the boundaries of -- of a CSU is not part of the CSU.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Let's say that part of a river is within a CSU.  And do you read this statute to mean that the --the Park Service could regulate boating 500 miles downstream from that part of the -- on that river, because it's relating to waters that are within the CSU?

And what -- what should we be concerned about there? What -- what would prevent the problem in -- in communities like that?   INTERRUPTING ",14-1373
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, would that be true if, let's say, one-half of 1 percent of the residents of South Salt Lake or Salt Lake City have outstanding warrants?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that's true, there's a downside.  If the officer makes an illegal stop, the officer exposes himself or herself to all sorts of consequences. But you're saying that, let's -- if the -- on the statistic that I gave you, if there's a 1 in 200 chance that there's going to be an outstanding warrant, so the officer says well, you know, I don't have -- I have no reason to stop this person, but if I stop 200 people today illegally, then I'm going to find one who has an outstanding warrant, you would say that that -- that gives the officer the incentive to make those 199 illegal stops.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  As I understand your position, you don't argue that the arrest was unlawful; is that right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So the arrest was lawful. And when the officer is making the arrest, it's permissible for safety purposes for the officer to frisk the person who is being arrested.  Do you agree with that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So it's a -- so it's a lawful search, correct.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Isn't it -- can you -- can you give me one other example of a situation in which this Court has held that the fruit of a lawful search must be suppressed?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, in any circumstance.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I'm just pointing it out that that's a curiosity, isn't it, to have a law -- to suppress the fruit of a lawful search? And maybe you need strong circumstances to justify such an unusual and unprecedented result.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if the individual is going to be arrested and put in jail, isn't it standard procedure and lawful procedure for the authorities to search that person thoroughly? They couldn't have a person bring drugs into -- into the jail or things that the person might use to hurt himself or other people?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So it would -- well, what does that mean? It's -- but it's not -- it -- that doesn't -- that's lawful conduct on their part, right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Okay.  But -- so you're asking for the suppression of the fruit of a lawful search.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, we really don't know very much about exactly what happened here, which is unfortunate.  But what the officer testified was that he didn't just grab this guy and say give me an ID and then -- and then run a warrants check.  He did say that he -- he approached him and he said -- identified himself.  He said he thought there might be drug activity going on in the house, and he asked him to tell -- he said, ""I asked him to tell me what he was doing there."" Now, we don't even know what he -- unless I'm -- it's someplace else in this record, we don't even know what your client said.  But he could have said, what am I doing there, yeah, I live there, or, my mother lives there, or, my best friend lives there. But whatever -- we don't know what he said. But then at some later point he ran a warrants check. So how can we infer from that, that the whole point of the stop was to run the warrants check?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You agree that attenuation is based on -- on deterrence; that the attenuation determination is based on a calculation of the deterrent effect of the ruling.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And -- and your deterrence argument doesn't depend at all on statistics?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if one in a thousand people has an outstanding warrant, that's enough?

Couldn't Congress do that?   ",14-1418
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, let me mention one of them.  Suppose that it were possible for a woman who does not get contraceptive coverage under a grandfathered plan or under a plan offered by a church or under a plan offered by a religious nonprofit to obtain a contraceptive-only policy free of charge on one of the Exchanges.  Why would that not be a least -- a less restrictive alternative?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What -- what type of a burden does that impose? Is it because these -- these Exchanges are so unworkable, even with the help of a navigator, that -- that a woman who wants to get free contraceptive coverage simply has to sign up for that on -- on one of the Exchanges?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So she'll have two insurance cards instead of one.  She'll have one from the employer, and she'll have one from this plan, just as a lot of people have one insurance card for medical services and one for prescriptions --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- for dental or vision.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, we can talk -- we can talk about that in a minute, but continue with that.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But why would that be? He would be -- he would be paid under the -- under the contraceptive plan.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, you don't think that they would be willing to sell them if you subsidize them at 115 percent, which is what you were doing in the case of those who provide services under self-insured plans.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What about the women -- what about the women in grandfathered plans --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- under -- in grandfathered plans that offer no contraceptive coverage? What about them?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But, you know, in the long run we're all dead.  But what's going to happen in -- (Laughter.)   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- in -- in the interim? What was the reason why Congress did not require contraceptive coverage right away under the grandfathered plans? It required coverage right away under the grandfathered plans for 25-year-olds so that they could get coverage under their parents' health insurance plan.  It would have been no great administrative difficulty for the grandfathered plans to put in contraceptive coverage, preventive care coverage right away, just as they did for the 25-year-olds.  And yet Congress said, for the really important things, like covering the 25-year-old graduate student, yes, you have to do that right away.  But for these other things, including what we're talking about today, you can continue to have -- not to provide that coverage for women as long as you maintain your grandfathered status.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, but to -- to come back -- to come back to the point that you were making about the Americans with Disabilities Act, that certainly is a good point for the Americans with Disabilities Act.  It can be very expensive to retrofit facilities to accommodate people with disabilities. But are you saying that the burden of simply instituting coverage for preventive care as it was done for coverage for 25-year-olds is comparable to making architectural changes?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could you -- could you address Mr. Clement's hypothetical about where the -- the government would come into a -- an unoccupied room in the Little Sisters facility that's not being used for anything.  They don't interfere at all.  They even pay rent.  And they come in there, and they establish a Title X clinic, and they are distributing contraceptives on the Little Sisters property.  And there's no financial burden.  There's actually financial benefit to them.  Is that different from the situation here, and if so, why?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, you say in your brief, you admit in your brief that, at least in the case of the self-insured plan, the -- the notice or the -- the form or the notice becomes part of the plan.  This is their health insurance plan established under ERISA, and you are putting a new objectionable element into the plan.  Isn't that correct?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But it -- it is -- it's their plan, and you admit that you are putting something into their plan that they object to on religious grounds.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So the difference between that and Mr. Clement's hypothetical is that one involves something tangible, physical property, and the other involves something that's intangible.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's the distinction.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, in the case of an insurance plan, isn't the insurance policy part of the plan? Isn't the insurance policy the way in which the -- the employer provides the benefits that are available under the plan?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, for the employees who have to buy the plans on the Exchange because they work for a small employer and the employer doesn't offer health insurance, does that arrangement frustrate the government's compelling interest?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Couldn't the Executive deal with the problem of what's available on the Exchanges at the present time in this way: Policies are available that provide comprehensive coverage.  Could the Executive say, as a matter of our enforcement discretion, we are not going to take any action against insurers who offer contraceptive-only policies, and in fact, we are going to subsidize those insurers at 115 percent, just as we do in the situation of the self-insured plans?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why would that not be -- why would that not be a valid exercise of your enforcement discretion?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  One way --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  One way of looking at what the State is doing is not to criminalize the assertion of a constitutional right, but to criminalize reneging on a bargain.  And the bargain was, we give you a license to drive, and in exchange for that, you consent to a -- to a blood-alcohol test under certain circumstances.  And if you renege on that bargain, then that's what's criminalized.  Why isn't that a better way of looking at this?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You mean --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But we're interested in -- in other possibilities.  And so if you assume that a State can condition the -- the right to -- the ability to drive on the State's roads -- and let's assume this is not somebody who is crossing the border.  Assume a State can condition the -- the ability to drive on a State's roads on consenting to a blood-alcohol test, perhaps under certain circumstances.  Let's say this is done in writing at the time when the person applies for the license, so it's not -- it's not just implied. Why does that -- what is different about that situation from a number of other situations that I can think of? For example, conditioning a -- a license to operate an interstate passenger train on submitting to a blood-alcohol test in the event of reasonable suspicion.  The person is operating the -- the train under the influence of -- of alcohol, or the same thing with someone who is operating aircraft. Or suppose there were a law that said that if you want to enter certain government buildings, such as this building, the -- the condition of entering is consenting to a search, and you have to sign something, you have to go through the magnetometer.  And then if a person got through that, and there was reasonable suspicion that the person had smuggled in some kind of a weapon, the person would be subjected to a search.  What would be the difference between that situation and this situation?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Suppose the Breathalyzer test was improved, there's better technology.  So let's suppose that all that's required is to put the Breathalyzer a couple of inch -- an inch from the person's mouth and wait for the person to breathe, and that would be sufficient to measure blood-alcohol. That -- would you say that's a search?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  So if you compare that with what -- what has to be done here, what is the big -- what is the big difference between those? That you have to put a straw in your mouth?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It doesn't seem -- it doesn't seem realistic.  The reason why people don't want to submit to a blood-alcohol test is that they don't want their blood-alcohol measured.  It's not that they object so much to blowing into a straw.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Let me give you a hypothesis of what he may have been saying, because I think this may be a little bit too hard on the judge. This was an unusual prosecution.  It was a murder prosecution where there was no evidence of motive.  I think that's pretty rare.  The judge may have been saying something like this: I have -- I have identification evidence here. And by the way, I -- I read the -- the whole -- everything -- the whole record and -- that's in the appendix and the closing argument of defense counsel.  There was no -- the defense here was not that these were witnesses who made an honest mistake.  They just didn't get a good opportunity to see the -- to see the perpetrator.  The -- the -- argument of the defense, as I read it very clearly, was that something was going on here and these two witnesses were identifying -- were -- were falsely -- knowingly identifying the wrong person.  Something was going on. There's evidence that the victim was selling drugs, very strong evidence that the victim was selling drugs, and that's what was going on here.  And so the judge said -- may have said to himself, why does the -- the -- why would the accused take a baseball bat and beat this kid, this 17-year-old kid who has a lot of drugs in his pockets, riding around on a bike? Why would he just beat this kid to death? And there -- he -- I would be concerned about finding this -- the defendant guilty if I thought there was no motive in this case.  But I can see that there could well be a motive in this case, because people in the drug trade kill each other.  And that seems to be exactly what was going on here.

It would depend on the standard of review.  But there's evidence that -- that Nelson, the victim, was selling drugs.  Could you not infer -- could a reasonable finder of fact not infer from the record here that this kid, this 17-year-old kid with 40 packages of drugs, who's hanging around in front of this -- in front of this bar, was there for the purpose of selling drugs?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And the -- and the -- the defendant walked up to -- there's evidence that the defendant walked up to this kid standing in front of the -- of the bar selling drugs, and spoke to him for some period of time, right?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yes, but there's evidence of that, if -- if you believe that, that that took -- that took place, right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  There's evidence of that. So could someone infer from those two facts that -- that if this kid was pretty openly selling drugs and the defendant walked up and spoke to him to some -- for some period of time, he knew what he was doing?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Now, the question on -- on the merits of -- putting aside the issues of -- of AEDPA and harmless error, when would it -- when does it violate due process for a judge in a bench trial to make a finding on a fact that is not needed for conviction? And what case of ours --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- sets out the standard for that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is the --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is the standard?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I'm trying to figure out what the standard is, if you could put it in words. Suppose that the -- the trial judge had made a finding, like the -- the court of appeals appears to, about the -- the -- the time of nautical twilight, and suppose the trial judge was wrong on that.  Then what? So the trial judge has made a finding of fact on a fact that's not necessary for conviction. Might conceivably have some relevance to the determination.  So what is the due process standard for determining whether that requires a new trial?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It depends -- when you're reading this -- in reading what the judge said, it depends on -- the reasonableness of what the judge said may depend on whether you think that the judge inferred that Larry Owens killed the victim because he knew he was a drug dealer, or whether the judge was -- in attempting to fill in the blanks of this case, inferred that he knew he was a drug dealer from the fact that there was proof that he killed him.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if you know that the victim is a drug dealer and the defendant talked to the victim, and then the defendant proceeded to beat his brains out with a baseball bat, you could probably infer from that the reason why he did it was that he knew he was a drug dealer, could you not?

Alito, Jr.  I -- I see that -- I -- I see that argument as to ERISA as originally enacted, but I am very troubled by the fact that it now authorizes the collection of data for the purpose of improving health outcomes -- health care outcomes.  I -- I don't see how that -- unless the anti-preemption provision saves the day, I don't see how that does not undermine your principal argument, which is that ERISA may preempt reporting of financial data and that sort of thing, but it doesn't preempt the collection of data regarding health care.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I really don't see how that can possibly be.  If Congress enacted an amendment tomorrow that says one of the core purposes of ERISA is to collect health care information, and here is a -- here is the health care collecting requirement, you would say, well, that's not preempted, because that wasn't the purpose when they enacted the preemption provision, originally.

They get $10,000.  They split it up, $5,000 each.  And on that very same day, it happens to be their birthday, and their rich uncle comes and gives each of them $5,000 as a birthday present.  So they go out to party, and one of them -- and they both spend $5,000 partying.  One of them spends the money from the bank robbery.  The other one spends the money that was given to them by their rich uncle.  And your position is that the one who spent the money from the so-called ""tainted assets,"" the money from the bank robbery, is entitled to use the remaining $5,000 to hire an attorney, but the other one is out of luck?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What sense does that make?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The problem with this argument is that as a matter of economics and -- and common sense, money is fungible.  To say if the -- if the so-called tainted money has been spent, and what's left is the untainted money, it doesn't make a difference which -- you know, which pot has been spent and which pot hasn't been spent.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, yes, but then there's -- that's all sorts of complicated rules in those areas. I mean, let's -- suppose you have -- and none of that necessarily applies here.  Suppose you have the situation where what's at stake is money that's going to be used for restitution, all right? So at the beginning of the case, the question is whether the defendant can spend that money to hire the attorney of the defendant's choice, which is certainly a very powerful interest, or whether that money, at the end of the case if there is a conviction, is going to go to the victims. So how do you -- how do you try to accommodate those two interests?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

You could have a second jury impanelled only for the -- the penalty phase.  But then in a case like this, you would need to essentially repeat all the trial evidence, including calling victims again, because that -- because the State was relying on its evidence from the trial phase, and that is generally, we submit, going to be the case.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Isn't it true, General Schmidt, that it makes a big difference whether this is done under the Federal Constitution or under Kansas law? And presumably, the Kansas Supreme Court understood that it had the capability of basing its decision on Kansas law.  But if -- if it did that, it would have to take responsibility for the decisions in these cases, which involve some of the most horrendous murders that I have seen in my 10 years here.  And we see practically every death penalty case that comes up anywhere in the country.  These have to rank as among the worst.  So it didn't take responsibility for that.  It said it's the Eighth Amendment, and we have to apply the Federal Constitution. Now, it may be they will say, well, we're going to say that Kansas law requires this, but then it's their responsibility; isn't that true?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I wasn't speculating on why they did what they did, but the consequences of basing it on the Federal Constitution.  One of the consequences of basing it on the Federal Constitution is that they don't have to take responsibility for it.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If were on a -- I'm sorry. Finish the sentence.       I was just going to say, that is not death for the worst offender, Mr. -- Justice Alito, that's -- that's -- that's the death penalty to be imposed for the worst interpretation of jury instructions.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If -- if I were on a jury and I were told that the burden -- that mitigators do not have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, I would find that confusing because then I would ask what is the -- the burden of proof on mitigators? And I don't think there's any way, really, to answer that question. So maybe this is a situation like trying to define reasonable doubt where less is more.  It's better not to get into the question of burden of proof at all. And let me -- just to finish this -- this suggestion, and maybe it's misdirected, but you mentioned the mitigator of -- of child abuse.  What would -- if there is any burden of proof, what would be the fact as to which it would apply? The overall category that this person had a bad childhood or that the -- the individual was beaten by his mother or beaten by his father or subjected to sexual abuse or was around people who were using drugs? Unless you define what the mitigators are, which can't be done, I don't see how you can apply any kind of burden of proof.     Well, Justice Alito, I think this Court has never said that if jury instructions are, by silence, confusing, that that silence alone is enough to rise to an Eighth Amendment violation.  Here, our point is that the instructions themselves injected the confusion.  And so I don't think this Court is going to police every possible thing that the jury might thought in their heads.  The point is here they mentioned only one standard, beyond a reasonable doubt.  They mentioned it 9 times.  And they said that the mitigating circumstances had to be found to exist. If the jury interpreted it this way, then this Court -- then the Court would be blessing a jury instruction on beyond a reasonable doubt for the first time ever in its history that said that a jury, all 12 of them, might have believed mitigating circumstances actually existed and could not give it effect.  That is what the effect of --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What does it mean to say there's no burden of proof?     Well, I think it means that -- that --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Every juror decides individually?     I think that -- in Kansas, I think that's right.  Now, of course you could have minimum thresholds, evidence, and relevance, and so on, as this Court's decision in Tennard said. This is the opposite.  This is the highest standard in all of law, beyond a reasonable doubt.  It's never been done.  And these jury instructions did so. And look, I understand that we could read these facts and say these are horrific crimes, as you said, Justice Alito.  But so, too, Reginald Carr had a horrific upbringing.  And I think the jury was entitled, and this Court's decision in Stringer says, that it is -- when -- when the injection of an arbitrary factor is put in and two juries could reach different results on the same facts, that violates the Eighth Amendment.

Alito, Jr.  But would it not be true that the Kansas issue -- the Kansas law issue could be raised in a State collateral proceeding? Why is a remand necessary?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In the ordinary case, let's say a State Supreme Court decides an issue.  They make no -- they make no reference whatsoever to State law. They based it on the Federal Constitution.  It comes up here; we reverse.  We would not remand and say, well, you didn't say anything about State law, but it's possible that you might want to find that the same rule applies under State law.  We wouldn't do it in that situation, would we? In every case like that we would remand?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, is that what we have done in such cases? We've remanded all of those for them to say, well, you didn't mention State law, but maybe you want to think about State law?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.

The second two people are unmarried siblings.  They've lived together for 25 years.  Their financial relationship is the same as the -- the same-sex couple.

Alito, Jr.  -- why that would not extend to larger groups, the one I mentioned earlier, two men and two women, or why it would not extend to unmarried siblings who have the same sort of relationship?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I was somewhat surprised by the arguments you made in your brief because they are largely a repetition of the arguments that we just heard with respect to Question 1. I thought the point of Question 2 was whether there would be a -- an obligation to recognize a same-sex marriage entered into in another State where that is lawful even if the State itself, constitutionally, does not recognize same-sex marriage. I thought that's the question in Question 2.  Is -- am I wrong?     It is the question in Question 2, and this Court's decisions establish that there is not only a right to be married, but a right to remain married; that there is a protected liberty interest in the status of one's marriage once it has been established under law.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What if it's not a plural relationship? What if one State says that individuals can marry at the age of puberty? So a 12-year-old female can marry.  Would a State -- would another State be obligated to recognize that marriage?     I -- I think probably not.  But the State would have, in that instance, a sufficiently important interest in protecting the true consent of the married person. And -- and most States don't recognize minors' ability to consent, certainly not to something that is as important as marriage. But what we see, in fact, is that, quite in contrast to the non-recognition laws at issue here, the States do recognize the marriages of person who, by age, would not have been able to marry within their own States. That is the long-standing practice of all of the States, precisely because of the abomination, as it was referred to in the old treatises, of the notion that a -- persons could have a different marital state in some jurisdictions than others.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You're saying that --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You're saying that the laws in some States, the States that you're referring to that recognize only opposite-sex marriage are pretextual?     The -- the -- their -- their nonrecognition laws are pretextual, yes, because the longstanding practice of these States is to recognize marriages that are validly celebrated elsewhere precisely because of --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well --     -- the fundamental --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- other than the distinction -- we have the distinction between same-sex marriage and opposite-sex marriage.  What is the next most dramatic variation that exists in the marriage laws of the States?     Well, at the time, certainly interracial marriage when --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  At the present time, what is --     Well --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- most -- the next most dramatic difference?     Well, I -- I think that, if I could, the -- the antimiscegenation laws actually are the closest analogy, but what's different between them, if I could -- because it goes to Justice Sotomayor's question, and then I'll try to answer yours -- is --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well -- well, I had asked a simple question.  At the present time, what is the next most dramatic variation in the marriage laws of the States?     It probably is age.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And what is the -- what -- what's the range?     The -- the -- I think it goes from 13 to 18.  And -- but -- but as I said before, the tradition of the States -- the issue does not come up that much, but the tradition of the States is to recognize a marriage that was entered into by someone of an age that could not have been entered within the State, because of the nature of the marriage once it's established, recognizing that the fundamental nature of that relationship is not one that the State should put asunder.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I thought you answered me earlier that a State could refuse to recognize a marriage in -- contracted in another State where the minimum age was puberty.     Well, they -- they could, and I do believe that if, in the individual case, it was shown that it was because of lack of consent, the -- the State could decide not to recognize the marriage.  But with respect to the categorical nature --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  This second question puts both you and Mr. Hallward-Driemeier in a very unusual situation, because, first of all, we have to assume that this first question has been decided against the Petitioner, or we wouldn't get to the second question. So we have to assume that we would hold that a State has a sufficient reason for limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples.  And Mr. Hallward-Driemeier acknowledged that a State could refuse to recognize an out-of-state marriage if it has a very strong public policy against that marriage, if it's a polygamous marriage, if it's a -- a marriage of very young individuals. So the question is whether there could be something in between.  So there -- there's a -- a sufficient reason to -- for the State to say, we're not going to grant these licenses ourselves, but not a strong enough reason for us not to recognize a marriage performed out of state.  I suppose that's possible, isn't it?   ",14-556X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  When Congress enacted the Hobbs Act, did it intend to exercise the full measure of its authority under the Commerce Clause?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  Could Congress enact a statute under -- under Raich, based on the reasoning of Raich, prohibiting the theft of a controlled substance just as it has put -- enacted statutes prohibiting the growing of marijuana or the production of other controlled substances?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could it enact a statute that makes it a crime to steal a controlled substance, exercising its Commerce Clause authority under the reasoning of Raich?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  On a case-by-case basis, then, why can it prohibit the growing of marijuana across the board without proving anything about the particular marijuana in question, but according to you, it cannot prohibit the sale of -- I'm sorry, the theft of marijuana?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why is that needed -- why is that not needed in a situation in which the person is growing marijuana? For personal use?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I don't think there's any question that this is a jurisdictional element and the jurisdictional element has to be proven.  That's not the issue. The issue is the meaning of the jurisdictional element.  And if the jurisdictional element means, as interpreted in Raich, and it's a -- you know, it's a controversial area of constitutional law, but it's a precedent and you're not challenging it -- so the jurisdictional element as interpreted in that case is anything that has an effect on -- anything -- any purely -- any local activity that is of a type which, if taken in the aggregate, would have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, that falls within the Commerce Clause. If the jury is instructed in that way, and that's basically the way I think it was instructed here, all they have to find is that there was a theft of -- there was a robbery of drugs, and it had some effect on the supply of drugs.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah, well, that's -- that's the -- that's what Raich -- that's the interpretation of the Commerce Clause. Do you want the jury to decide what the Commerce Clause means? It would be an interesting -- under those who -- who think that juries once upon a time had the authority to decide legal issues.  Do you want them to decide whether the majority or the dissent was correct in -- in Gonzales?   ",14-6166

Do you agree with that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Because then you do run into these limitation -- in the search for a limiting principle, which you seem to be addressing.  So Congress could prohibit and has prohibited a person from possessing even a very small amount of marijuana, right, a single cigarette, a single marijuana cigarette?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if one person steals a marijuana cigarette from another person, robs that person of one marijuana cigarette, that's a violation of the Hobbs Act?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It falls within the Commerce Clause, doesn't it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Suppose someone robbed the farmer in Wickard v. Filburn of the wheat that the farmer was growing for personal consumption.  Would that be a violation of the Hobbs Act?   INTERRUPTING ",14-6166
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that's what I wanted to ask about.  As a practical matter, in evaluating excessive use of force claims, how much difference does it make whether there's a purely objective standard or a subjective standard.  It will be the rare case, I would imagine, where there's direct evidence of the officers' subjective intent.  So the subjective intent is going to be inferred from objective factors. So give me an example of an excessive use of force claim that would involve the unreasonably -- a use of force that's objectively unreasonable, but there is not the subjective intent to harm.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, in a case where there's -- where the jury thinks that there was force that was objectively unreasonable, and in particular, if it's a -- if it's a 1983 claim or a Bivens claim, where the officer has qualified immunity, it doesn't seem to me that there are going to be very many cases where the difference between these two standards will result in a different outcome.  Am I wrong?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't persons who were being arrested and persons who have been convicted and are incarcerated have the same due process rights as detainees?   John F. Bash  Because the Due Process Clause permits the punishment of people who are convicted.  And as this Court interpreted that in the context of convicted prisoners, it's that convicted prisoners may be subject to hasher conditions than pretrial detainees.   ",14-6368

Congress does that; is it different?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Based on what you said this morning, I don't really understand the -- excuse me -- the limiting principle of your argument.  You've said that the number of cases is not determinative, there could be a great many cases.

I mean, let's be honest about what's going on here.  Executions could be carried out painlessly.  There are many jurisdictions -- there are jurisdictions in this country, there are jurisdictions abroad that allow assisted suicide, and I assume that those are carried out with little, if any, pain.  Oklahoma and other States could carry out executions painlessly. Now, this Court has held that the death penalty is constitutional.  It's controversial as a constitutional matter.  It certainly is controversial as a policy matter.  Those who oppose the death penalty are free to try to persuade legislatures to abolish the death penalty.  Some of those efforts have been successful.  They're free to ask this Court to overrule the death penalty. But until that occurs, is it appropriate for the judiciary to countenance what amounts to a guerilla war against the death penalty which consists of efforts to make it impossible for the States to obtain drugs that could be used to carry out capital punishment with little, if any, pain? And so the States are reduced to using drugs like this one which give rise to disputes about whether, in fact, every possibility of pain is eliminated. Now, what is your response to that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And is that -- is that your argument?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You're marking -- you can make one of two arguments.  And one is that the death penalty is unconstitutional because there is no method that has been used in the past or that can be devised that is capable of carrying that sentence out without inflicting some pain, pain that's unacceptable.  That's an argument that you can make.  But I don't understand you to be making that argument; am I right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So you are arguing -- you want us to reverse a finding of fact of the district court on the ground that it is clearly erroneous.  When was the last time we did that?   Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  No, that -- but that's not the point.  The point is, if it's a lethal dose, or it's potentially a lethal dose, then how are you going to do a study to determine whether, in fact, it renders the person insensate?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If an -- if an anesthesiologist rendered a person completely unconscious, and then the person was burned alive, would that be cruel and unusual punishment?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yes.

So the second ""or"" could be a substitute for a semicolon. But let me ask you another question about the language that you just read.  As I understand your argument, this provision would apply to sexual abuse involving a minor and also abusive sexual conduct involving a minor. Is there any difference between those two things?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So why did Congress put them both in?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, there's something that jumps out.  It's a strange list, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse.  Sexual abuse would include aggravated sexual abuse.  So that seems to be -- the reference to aggravated sexual abuse seems to be redundant.  And abusive sexual conduct, if understood in ordinary -- in the terms of ordinary language, does seem to duplicate sexual abuse. But there's an explanation that jumps out, and that is that this -- almost this precise terminology appears in Sections 2241, 2242, and 2243.  And in those provisions, all those terms are defined so that they mean something different. So it seems to jump out at the reader that that's what Congress was doing in this list. Why is -- what is wrong with that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, it could have done it more clearly.  That's certainly the answer to this whole case.  They could have handled this issue a lot more clearly. But that is the -- the idea that they were picking up the definitions in the Federal provisions is one explanation for this rather -- this list.  The other makes the list terribly redundant, and I haven't heard your explanation as to why they would do that. Why include both sexual abuse and aggravated sexual abuse? Why include sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But your -- your argument is that it is just a coincidence that Congress came up with this list of three terms that are redundant and that just so happen to be almost exactly the same three terms in the same order that appear in the Federal provisions.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But they used -- they used --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  When they use ""sexual abuse"" and ""sexually abusive conduct,"" they were not -- they -- they had in mind the Federal provisions, but they didn't want those terms in this provision to mean the same thing as they mean in the Federal provision, even though, according to you, there is no generally accepted understanding of the difference between sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct.

And not only is there redundancy, but there's ambiguity about what is meant by sexual abuse as opposed to abusive sexual conduct, and why they had to put in aggravated sexual abuse in addition to sexual abuse.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could I come back to the issue of classroom diversity? Because that does seem to me to be something that could be measured.  And maybe there's evidence in the record that measures it.  I don't know.  So that's what I want to ask you.  But the University knows which students, even if -- assuming that the students don't know, this University knows which students were admitted because they were in the top 10 percent and which were not. And presumably they have a record of all of the classes and which students enrolled in which classes.  And so it would seem to me to be possible to determine whether the students who were admitted under the 10 percent plan were less likely to choose to enroll in the classes in which minorities are underrepresented than the students who were admitted under holistic review.  Now, maybe that's in the record.  I haven't found it.  Is there anything in the record to show that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, the issue in this case is not whether the University can have holistic review.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The issue is whether they can have as a component of holistic review after they have taken into account other characteristics that are not dependent on race; they can add race as an additional characteristic. And so if it were -- is there -- would there be any way of determining, if there were a remand, which of the non-top 10 admittees were admitted solely because of race? In other words, these students would not have been admitted taking into account leadership and family, education and socioeconomic background and hardship and everything else.   ",14-981X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, on that point, can you determine which of the holistic admittees would not have been admitted if race was not added to the -- to the determination?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's not really my question.  My question was if you look at an individual person, can you tell whether that person was admitted because -- solely because of race? Whether that person would not have been admitted were it not for the fact that the person was an African-American or Hispanic?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What -- one of the things I find troubling about your argument is the suggestion that there is something deficient about the African-American students and the Hispanic students who are admitted under the Top 10 Percent Plan.  They're not dynamic.  They're not leaders.  They're not change agents.  And I don't know what the basis for that is.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It's -- really it's based on a terrible stereotyping that --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is the basis for that --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah.  But what is the basis for saying that? That's what I don't understand.  It's kind of the assumption that if the -- if a student -- if a black student or a Hispanic student is admitted as part of the Top 10 Percent Plan, it has to be because that student didn't have to compete against very many whites and -- and Asians.  In -- in the high school class, it's a really pernicious stereotype.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I don't doubt that that is one of the things that it does, and I would have thought that that would be something that you would regard as beneficial.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Wasn't that the -- the reason for adopting affirmative action in the first place because there are people who have been severely disadvantaged through discrimination and -- and lack of wealth, and they should be given a benefit in admission --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- but that's one -- one of the things that it does, but it's not the only thing that it does.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  This is a statistic that jumped out at me, which it seems to me contrary to the stereotype on which the Fifth Circuit panel proceeds and on which you proceed.  Of the African-American and Hispanic students who were admitted under the Top 10 Percent Plan, 21 percent had parents who had either a bachelor's degree or a four-year degree.  And for the holistic admittees, African-Americans and Hispanics, it's 26 percent.  This is from a Class of 2008. So there isn't -- it seems to me it refutes the idea that all of these minority students who were admitted under -- or most of them admitted under the 10 percent plan come just from these predominantly overwhelmingly black and Hispanic schools with poor students.  It's just -- it doesn't seem to be true.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, on that subject, I don't know of any -- you haven't mentioned in your briefs anything that the University of Texas has done to increase racial diversity at the classroom level, other than this admissions program. And I mentioned during your -- your friend's argument a way in which you could determine whether the top 10 admittees are any more or less likely to enroll in classes -- small classes where there is a lack of racial diversity than the holistic admittees.  And I don't see -- and you haven't made any effort, as far as I can tell, to measure that.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But I don't -- you could have determined whether this is -- whether the admission -- the addition of race to the holistic equation has done anything to increase classroom diversity.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And you haven't done that.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No.  As -- as comparing, this goes back to your -- your underlying claim is there's something deficient about the top 10 admittees, and I -- maybe -- if you have -- do you have evidence that they are less likely to -- to enroll in the classes where there's a lack of classroom diversity --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I -- but that's where I'm looking for evidence that that's true.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is it -- what is it -- have you looked at the top 10 percent admittees, for example, to see how many of them are leaders, which is certainly -- and certainly a legitimate factor to look for, students who are leaders. At -- do you say, well, there are -- there are just not very many leaders here; these are students who all they do is study.  There's no evidence of that as far as I can tell.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I don't know what that --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I don't know what that proves.  Sure.  I -- I'm sure that there are holistic admittees who were great students.  They made a wonderful contribution to the university. I'll -- I don't know whether you're going to be able to determine that they would have not -- they would not have been admitted if race hadn't been taken into account.  They probably -- they would have -- many of them would have been.  Maybe all of them.  But beyond that, what is to say that there are not comparable students who were among the top 10 percent admittees? I bet there are.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I -- I could use -- I can use the help. (Laughter.)   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well -- well, that's my question.  But -- (Laughter.)   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, there's an aspect of the holistic review process done at the University of Texas which may militate against the admission of African-American and Hispanic students for a -- an ostensibly race-neutral reason, and that is, that as I understand it, standardized test scores count pretty heavily in that process. One of the things the University says it's looking for is students with high SAT scores who are not in the top 10 percent of their class.  And there are many who think that SAT scores and ACT scores are culturally biased.  So if you put less emphasis on that, you might not have the numbers that you just recited. Well, it's rather strange that we -- we construct a process that may disadvantage African-American and Hispanic students for an ostensibly race-neutral reason.  So then we have to add race in as a special factor to counteract that.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I thought the -- I thought the record showed the Top Ten admittees have a higher grade point average than the holistic African-American and Hispanic admittees.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But, I mean, once they get to --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Once they get to -- the SAT is supposed to predict how you are going to do in college.  And I thought the record showed that the students who had lower SAT scores but did better as a -- by measure by high school rank did better at the University of Texas; isn't that -- isn't that the case?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But do you think that the African-American and Hispanic students who were admitted under the Top 10 Percent Plan make inferior officers when compared to those who were admitted under holistic review?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do you think that the -- that the ROTC graduates from the University of Texas make superior officers to those who -- who graduate from, let's say, Texas A&M or Texas Tech?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Now, that's certainly important, but to come back to my first question, is there anything to suggest that the top 10 percent students are less likely to enroll in ROTC or, when they do, they're not as good as the -- as the holistic admittees?

I think that the court can use its broadly applicable rules for enforcing existing property divisions; in this case, the Arizona rule is one that prohibits a party from unilaterally harming the interest of the other spouse, and gives a makeup remedy.  But there's still important protections that the Spousal Protection Act gives to disability benefits.  No matter what, the anti-attachment provision -- this isn't the Spousal Protection Act, other federal law, which is the anti-attachment provision -- protects disability benefits from any kind of award to satisfy a property claim.

I don't understand how you can say it's a procedural right.  You said -- you said the statute is void for vagueness.  That certainly is substantive.     Your Honor, you say the statute is void for vagueness because when it is being applied to an individual, that individual is given no notice that lifetime banishment is going to be the consequence of what he thought to be a safe harbor --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And what if he was given notice in some other way?     I think it depends in what way.  But this Court said in Johnson -- I mean, Johnson actually had notice.  Johnson knew that the illegal -- that the sawed-off shotgun was illegal, but this Court struck the statute.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So that makes my point.  He had notice.  He knew.  So where's the procedural violation?     Well, for -- for the vast majority of people and the people who are affected by it, it is procedural. But, you know, Your Honor, I just realized, in this colloquy, I never did answer the other part of Your Honor's question, Justice Alito, about the reasons why the vagueness standard applies here, the criminal vagueness standard. So the first I said, before you ever get to Jordan, is that the -- that 16(b) is itself a criminal statute. The second reason is, to the point that Justice Gorsuch was making about the relationship between -- between criminal law and immigration law, there is not an area of law where the two are as integrated, and 16(b), in particular, excuse me, the ACCA provision here, in particular, has very significant criminal consequences. The aggravated felon label, once you are an aggravated felon, now that's in the INA, certain immigration crimes are triggered.  And so aggravated felon becomes a -- an element of a crime. And I'll give you an example.  If -- if this -- if this vagueness analysis works the way the government says it works, Mr. Dimaya can be deported because he had sufficient notice or the statute was sufficiently clear, but an aggravated felon who reenters this country is prosecuted as an aggregated felon. So, if he reentered the country, he can then be not -- he then -- he can then not be prosecuted as an aggravated felon because the statute would be too vague.  That makes no sense, which is exactly why this Court adopted the rule that it adopted in A.B. Small and that four members of this Court repeated in Northwestern Bell, which is, if Congress makes that choice to give civil and criminal ramifications to the same statute, the very same statute, if the statute is void for vague in one context, it's void for vague in the other. And, by the way, that other context in A.B. Small was a silly little contract case, not, you know, even, you know, the licensing of a nursery.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I mean, maybe you have in your head a list of -- you could categorize any offense that I might mention and say that's a crime of moral turpitude, that's not a crime of moral turpitude.  I couldn't do that.     Well --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And I doubt that somebody who's facing possible removal consequences would be able to answer that question.     Well, Your Honor --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Okay.  Shooting a bald eagle, is that -- is that a crime of moral turpitude? Some people would think so.     It is -- it is not.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It is not.  How about --     And, by the way, nor is flag burning.  And -- but let me -- but let me answer the question this way. You don't have to know, but you -- you have to be able to go to someplace like a lawyer who can tell you what the answer is. And where does a lawyer go? There are 14 pages of -- of Kurzban, where every single possible crime is categorized as in or out based upon decades of -- of judicial and other interpretations.  That's how one knows.   ",15-1498
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. Rosenkranz, could I ask you this: Suppose Congress enacted a statute that said any person who commits a crime of moral turpitude in the District of Columbia or with -- within the special or maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States shall be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, would that be unconstitutionally vague?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But that seems to me -- I mean, I'm surprised by -- somewhat surprised by your answer.  That seems to me to be at least as vague as 16(b)  And yet the holding in the Jordan case on which you rely was that that -- that a -- a deportation statute that permitted deportation for a person convicted of a crime of moral turpitude satisfied the applicable vagueness standard there.  So --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But, I mean, unless you're willing to say that the criminal statute that I hypothesized would satisfy vagueness standards, I -- I don't see how you can say that the same vagueness standard applies in criminal cases and deportation cases.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So why does crime -- then the statute making a crime of saying anyone who commits a crime of moral turpitude sentenced to 20 -- up to 20 years, that would be -- that would satisfy vagueness for a criminal statute?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What -- is DUI a crime of moral turpitude?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How about failure to file an income tax return?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How about unlawful entry into the United States?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I mean, if that's your answer, it totally ignores that this is not a criminal case.  And it certainly is true that deportation has more severe consequences than the typical civil case. But there are many other civil cases that can have a devastating impact on someone, such as child custody, loss of a professional license, complete destruction of a business, loss of the home.  Now, assuming that there is some sort of vagueness standard that applies in civil cases, I would have thought your answer would be that it's a sliding scale and that the -- the standard for civil cases is not the same as the standard for criminal cases.  But how much specificity is required in the civil context depends on the severity of the consequences of the case.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No.  That's not exactly the way the Court -- what the Court said, or at least it's not necessary to read Jordan that way.  I think Jordan can be read to say, look, the dissent has raised this new argument, it wasn't briefed, it wasn't argued.  The dissent says this is unconstitutionally vague; we are going to apply the criminal standard here and it satisfies the criminal standard.  It -- it didn't say assume for the sake of argument, but I think it can certainly be read that way.  And if you don't read it that way, you are stuck with a conclusion that a statute making a crime of moral turpitude punishable by a felony term of imprisonment would satisfy the vagueness standard for a criminal statute, which I think is very difficult to defend.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, would you say the same thing if it didn't -- if this statute did not incorporate a definition that is also used in criminal statutes and simply had the same standard in a purely immigration statute? So no reference to a -- a definition that also applies in criminal cases.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I don't think that makes the slightest bit of sense.  Suppose there were a criminal statute that says that it is a crime -- it is a felony to charge an unjust rate.  And then the -- there was a civil statute that incorporated that, and we would say, well, because you can't make it a felony to charge an -- an unjust rate or price.  You can't have that in the civil statute.  You can't incorporate it into the civil statute.   ",15-1498
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  When -- when there is a suit against an entity like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the question is whether that is really a -- a suit -- whether that is a suit against one of the states and, therefore, subject to sovereign immunity, we would look to see who would pay the judgment.  So that's Mr. Katyal's argument. Why wouldn't we do the same -- why should we not do the same thing when it is against an employee?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could a State give greater immunity to an Indian tribe than is available under Federal law?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So the Connecticut supreme court could do that if it wanted to?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So you think it was waived. Was that argument? Waived.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Now, on the facts of this case, is there any argument in favor of official immunity? Mr. Clarke is not a member of the tribe. He's driving a limo on I-95 transporting gamblers and he rear-ends Mr. Lewis, who is not a member of the tribe. You think there's any argument in favor of sovereign immunity for Mr. Clarke under the facts of this case?   Ann O'Connell Adams  For official immunity, based on the facts as you've described them and as I understand them, no.  Driving is -- is a quintessential activity that involves no policymaking authority.  I think the Federal Drivers Act shows that and cases of this Court show that. I would stress that this Court -- the case was dismissed at the most preliminary stages, so the Respondent hasn't had an opportunity to develop any kind of an official immunity argument.  I suppose there could be some reason that he could give why he would be authorized to drive in a way that would otherwise be reckless, maybe like a medical emergency or something. We just -- I don't know that anything like that was happening.  As far as I understand it, this was a typical traffic accident where a car was rear-ended. And in such a case, there would be no entitlement to official immunity.   ",15-1500
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, what would happen in all the 1983 actions or all the Bivens actions if there was an agreement by the government employee -- employer to indemnify the individual?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The problem -- the problem with that argument is that it -- it seems to suggest that the State's motive will be to provide protection for somebody like Mr. Clarke.  But the State of Connecticut has a very strong incentive to -- to be solicitous of the interests of the Mohegan tribe because the State gets an enormous amount of revenue from this casino.  Isn't that true?   ",15-1500
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do we know -- do we know exactly --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I'm sorry. Do we know exactly how Wisconsin and the county define ""common ownership""? For example, if one lot is owned by an individual in that person's own name, and then the adjacent lot is owned by a wholly-owned corporation or LLC, is that considered to be common ownership? Or if one lot is owned by, let's say, four siblings and the other one is owned by only three of the siblings, would that be common ownership?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How can you say that the impact is not -- is categorically not great? If some -- somebody buys a lot next to that person's house with the expectation of selling it at some point in the future to meet real needs that come up then, and then the -- a regulation is adopted that says well, sorry, you can't sell it, that there's no hardship there?   Richard J. Lazarus  The -- the hardship -- the question though is how do you define the extent of the hardship.  And what you want -- what you need to look at under the Penn Central analysis is what the economic impact is, and to define the parcel part of that is to -- to identify what the impact is. In -- for instance, in this case, the economic impact on the Murrs, right, has to take into account the shared value of the two because the fact is, if you look to what -- there is no general issue of material fact with the lower courts on this question. The value of the two parcels together for one house is $698,000.  The value of two houses separate, with a house on each, is $771,000.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that's fine except that, in order to realize the value of the two lots put together, they would have to move away.   Richard J. Lazarus  Right.  But -- and -- and the -- and they --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Now, they think that's irrelevant.   Richard J. Lazarus  The takings inquiry is what the economic impact is on them.  It shouldn't be a different test depending upon their particular subjective preferences, then someone else's subjective preferences.  The -- the fact is --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I thought the -- I thought that what you're saying is we have to look at what's fair and just, and now you say, well, we disregard the situation of -- of the particular people who are involved.   Richard J. Lazarus  Well, no.  You're looking at -- it's several things.  You're looking at first what the economic impact is.  Define the parcel in a way which actually evaluates the real impact.  Not a fictional impact, but the real impact.  The real impact here is very little. You're also taking account the -- the State law.  You're looking at the law at the time to figure out what the reasonable expectations are of people. You're taking that into account as well. The other thing you're taking into account, Your Honor, is the point you mentioned before. Contiguousness by itself wouldn't be enough.  We aren't arguing that.  One thing you look at is the State law for expectations. You also look at the physical and geographic characteristics of the property; in other words, to find out whether there was any real potential here for unity of use and integrative use.  For instance, in this case, if Lot E and F were different and you had one up above and one down below, that might well be a harder case to suggest that there was that kind of unity of use, integrated. And you look at those three things, because what you're trying to look for to evaluate the parcel is you're trying to see what the real burden is that people are suffering in the case. You know, it's a remarkable finding that there's such a little difference in value between one house on two and two houses each on one.  And the -- and the reason for that, there's actually a formal term in economics for it.  It's called the complementarity principle.  You don't need to know that term.  It's just common sense. There's some kinds of property, land is one of them, that can create value joined that doesn't exist when separate.  The most extreme example are shoes.  No one would pay very much for just a right shoe or a left shoe, but they pay a fair amount for the two shoes together.  Land is not an extreme example like shoes, but the same phenomenon exists --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Suppose you have lots that are not contiguous but they're very close to each other. Now, under your flexible approach with all these different dimensions, are they ruled out as a single parcel?   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  I think it would be very difficult to say that those kinds of noncontiguous properties function as an integrated economic unit.  So I think it would be the rare case where it would be appropriate to aggregate those property interests.  But I think that it is important to keep in mind that there are so many different ways that property interests arise, that it is important to have a flexible, nuanced approach here. And Justice Alito, I would just point to the example we raised about the large developer who acquires a large tract, maybe a thousand acres of property, and subdivides it into hundreds --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That can easily be taken care of by making the rule look to the -- the lots as defined at the time of the acquisition rather than something that was done prior to -- prior to the time when -- when a rule would be -- would be applied.  But, you know, it's fine to say that there are all these dimensions and they should be nuanced and who can be opposed to something that's nuanced.  But what are we looking for? What are we looking for? We're looking at all these dimensions to determine what? Could you just say as precisely as you can what we would -- we should be looking for in defining what is the property that is taken using all of the different dimensions that are relevant in your view?   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  I think the clearest articulation I have is to say that you should be looking for what in the interest of fairness and justice is an accurate way to measure economic impact.  And that's the point of the relevant parcel determination.  It's focused specifically on the economic impact prong of the equation.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And is it the economic impact on these particular owners or on some category of hypothetical owners?   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  It's always been an individualized inquiry focused on these particular owners.  And I think that the facts of this case well illustrate the point that when you're conducting that kind of evaluation, it's often the case, as -- as Mr. Lazarus said, that you're going to have a shared value, a reciprocal value that --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But what if a lot -- but what if a lot was -- was preserved? What if it was bought for the purpose of selling it at some point in the future and/or it was preserved for that purpose so that nothing was built on it so that it could readily be sold?   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  I think that those kinds of reasonable investment-backed expectations have a role to play, but I don't think that they can be dispositive. Because, again, the point of the relevant parcel determination is to accurately gauge economic impact. But I do think that it's important --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, why wouldn't they be determinative? I thought you said it was we look to legitimate expectations.  There, their expectations are completely frustrated.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  It's certainly the case that anytime anyone's alleging a regulatory taking, the premise of the claim is that they're being prevented from doing something with their property that they wanted to do with it.  We think that that's not sufficient to alone define the relevant parcel because it might be the case, as it is here, that there's actually not much of an economic impact at all. And if that's the case, then this isn't the kind of regulation that is requiring someone to shoulder a burden that in the interest of fairness and justice should be --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that comes back to my -- but -- but you're saying that they have to move. They can't afford to build a big house here, which is what everybody wants.  They don't want these little modest houses anymore.  They want McMansions.  They -- they have to move.  That's what you're saying.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  But to the extent that a court were to conclude that that is an undue interference with their investment-backed expectations or that the character of that government action is actually unjust and anomalus, then I think that this Court's precedent already builds in sufficient protection for those kinds of interest without trying to rely solely on expectations to identify the relevant parcel.   ",15-214X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if lots are contiguous, that's the end of the question for you; right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, let me give you this example.  A -- it's not that far from this case.  A plumber and his wife buy a small lot, but it's a lot on which you can build houses at that time, and they build a modest house.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And they say, you know, we're going to -- there's a lot next door, let's buy that; we can use it as a yard for our children when they're growing up.  And then after they're grown, we can sell it, and we'll have some money for retirement. And that's a buildable lot at that time. And then this new regulation is adopted and now the side lot can't be sold at all.  And they say: Well, look, you've taken away this valuable asset we were going to use for our retirement. And the answer is: Well, no, because you could -- you could sell your whole property, and somebody who wants to build a big house could build on that property. And they say: Well, that's fine, but we like our little house.  We'd like to stay in our little house. Now, what is fair about that situation?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What do you mean by they were ""involuntarily merged by government action""?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Right.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That wouldn't fall under your regulation?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And that's a very fine argument, except for the fact that it's completely contrary to the reasoning in Palazzolo.  Justice Kennedy's opinion in Palazzolo rejects that.  And the debate between Justice O'Connor in concurrence and Justice Scalia in concurrence is about exactly that. And you don't even cite Palazzolo in your brief, do you?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Now, which --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If -- if one lot is owned by a wholly owned corporation or an LLC and the other is owned by the owner in the owner's own name, are they considered to be under common ownership under Wisconsin law?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What -- what about --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Would it matter to you if it were not possible to build a house that bridged the two lots? Suppose one was at the bottom -- one lot is at the bottom of a cliff and the other is at the top of a cliff.  Would that matter to you?   ",15-214X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, there is very little specific evidence in the record in this case with respect to why any particular clinic closed.  Basically, your argument is that the law took effect, and after that point, there was a decrease in the number of clinics. So suppose you win here, and the State then examines what happened in each of these clinics and comes up with evidence showing that in quite a few instances, the closure was due to other factors.  And so then they would -- then could they take the position, well, the decision of this Court holding that the law is facially unconstitutional is not binding on us by res judicata, and so you would have to sue them again, and they would be able to make the same argument you're making now.  Is that correct?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What's the difference?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Was it that -- was that their burden?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  As to how many, of the total that you claim closed, do you have direct evidence about the reason for the closure?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah.  And as to how many -- how many are you claiming total closed as a result of the law?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And of the 20, how -- as to how many do you have direct evidence?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Because if -- if you go through this -- now we're not talking about a huge number of facilities.  I really don't understand why you could not have put in evidence about each particular clinic and to show why the clinic closed.  And as to some of them, there is -- there's information that they closed for reasons that had nothing to do with this law. Now, maybe when you take out all of those, there still would be a substantial number, and enough to make your case.  But I -- I don't understand why you didn't put in direct evidence. I mean, I could give you examples: Planned Parenthood Center for Choice, Bryan, Texas.  Is that one of the ones you're talking about?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Okay.  There's a news report.  Planned Parenthood and -- and the Huffington Post reported that this was closed as a result of the 2011 Texas Women's Health Program bill, which cut funding for family planning services.  It's not the law that we're talking about here.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I understand that. And you put quite a bit of evidence that's not in the record in your brief.  But my point is why is there not direct evidence about particular clinics?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is it correct that the number of ambulatory surgical centers performing abortion has increased by 50 percent since this law went into effect?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, one -- one quick question about capacity.  I don't want to take your rebuttal time.  But your co-counsel put in -- is also litigating a case like this in Louisiana.  And in that case, the plaintiffs were able to put in evidence about the exact number of abortions that were performed in all of the facilities.  Why could that not have been done here? Why wasn't it done here?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is this true of every provision of the -- of the ASC law?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Not the regulations -- yes, in the regulations.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Every single provision. Then why was the whole thing held to be unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But there are -- there are things that go -- that go -- I haven't checked everything as compared the abortion -- the prior abortion clinic licensing law against the ASC requirements, but there are some where there's an increase in what's required.  It seems pretty reasonable. Under the -- under the -- the old -- the old law, there had to be a nurse, but not necessarily a registered nurse.  Under the new law, there has to be a registered nurse who has a CPR certificate.  So do you think that's unreasonable to say that there has to be a registered nurse who knows how to do CPR?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, it's all --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It's work, but maybe the district court should have done that work. I mean, I read through this, and I was surprised.  I read through these regulations.  I was surprised by how many are completely innocuous.  And many of them have nothing to do -- they have to do with basic safety.  They don't even have anything to do, in particular, with abortion.  So the entrances to the clinic have to be at grade level.  You have to have an elevator.  The -- the corridors have to be wide enough so that you could bring in a stretcher if somebody has to be taken to the hospital.  And -- and things of that nature --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I don't know why things couldn't have been severed out, if there were some that were --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  There is no evidence -- there's no evidence of the actual capacity of these clinics.  And why was that not put in? Particularly since, if we look at the Louisiana case, we can see that it's very possible to put it in.  And some of the -- some of the numbers there are quite -- quite amazing. There's one -- a doctor there performed 3,000 abortions in a year. So we don't really know what the capacity of these -- of these ASC clinics --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- are.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah.  But what is it based on? It's based -- you know, he -- it's not based on any hard -- any hard statistics.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, common sense --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  He said that -- that the number of -- the percentage of abortions at the ASCs went down by 4.4 percent, and there was an increased demand for abortion.  But there's no statistic showing that there actually was an increased demand for abortion in Texas.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And as to the -- the clinics where there is direct evidence, does the direct evidence show whether the cause was the admitting-privileges requirement or the ASC requirement or both?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do you think that Federal district judges or this Court is well qualified to determine whether there is a different risk, regard -- with respect to abortion, as compared to other procedures, that may or may not have to be required -- may or may not have to be performed in an -- in an ASC?

Would there be anything unconstitutional about that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Isn't it true --   Samuel A.

If this immunity is analogous, for example, to absolute -- a category of absolute immunity for a government official or qualified immunity for a government official, those are also immunities from suit; and therefore, under the collateral-order doctrine, an adverse ruling could be appealed.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, no.  Because you could test -- you could determine jurisdiction under the Bell v. Hood standard, and then you can move to dismiss the complaint under 12(b)(6)  And if you're unsuccessful, you could take appeal under the collateral-order doctrine.  Why doesn't that serve interest just as well, without producing some of the unfortunate -- arguably unfortunate collateral consequences of labeling this as jurisdictional, among which is the fact that this Court would have to decide all sorts of questions even if they are not contested by the parties?

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  May I ask you about the basis for the legal rule you're asking us to adopt? And let's just assume, for the sake of argument, that there isn't any Federal rule that sheds very much light directly on this question. So then your argument seems to come down to two points: One is that there's nothing that gives the -- the -- expressly, or maybe even by implication, gives the trial judge the power to do this.  But trial judges do hundreds of things that are not expressly authorized by rule.  So what -- we -- we certainly couldn't adopt that rule, a Federal judge -- a trial judge can't do anything unless there's a rule that says the judge can't -- can do it.  Trials would come to an end. The other is based on the common law.  But there were all sorts of common law procedures, and procedures that continued into the 19th century, that have been abandoned in modern practice. So you want us to say if there was a -- an established practice at common law, and into the -- maybe the late 19th century.  Trial judges today in the Federal courts today must follow that rule unless there's something that gives them a dispensation.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But it has to be absolutely necessary.  What should the -- what should the -- the trial judge -- at one point jurors weren't allowed to eat during deliberations -- so what did -- the first trial judge who said it might be a good idea to allow them to have lunch. (Laughter.)   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What -- was that absolutely necessary? What -- what would be the thought process there?   INTERRUPTING ",15-458X

Suppose that a Governor is going to make a -- eventually going to make a decision that will help either A or B and hurt either A or B, and the Governor says, you know, I'm going to have a preliminary discussion about this with members of my staff.  We're not going to come to any decision, but we're going to talk about it.  And whichever of you pays the most money will be able to sit in on this staff meeting.  What about that?   Samuel A.

Those apply to Federal employees and Federal officers.  What do they have to do with a Governor of a State or a State employee?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, what I think we're looking for is some limiting principle.  Now, you -- you started to say something about campaign contributions --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- and I know that this case doesn't involve campaign contributions.  But certainly a campaign contribution can be the quid, can it not?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  Well, gaining access by making campaign contributions is an everyday occurrence.  And maybe it's a bad thing, but it's very widespread.  How does it -- how does that play out?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. Dreeben, if I could just follow up on that. If a -- a Senator writes to a Federal agency and says, this union or this company is, you know, critical to the economy of my State, and, by the way -- he doesn't say this, but, by the way, they are the biggest contributors to his campaign -- would you please meet with them? What would not make that a crime?

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, what if the case was simply in the office and he had supervisory responsibility over everything that occurs in the office, but it's a big office.  If a question arose, somebody could bring it to him, but there isn't any indication of personal involvement.  Would that be enough?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You see, the problem --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah.  The problem that -- that is presented by this case is not -- is where this constitutional line is going to be drawn.  You want us to get into -- get pretty deeply into the issue of a constitutional recusal policy for judges.  So it's really not enough to just say what happened here was bad. Let's assume that -- that that is the case. Assume for the sake of argument -- I'm not saying one way or the other -- but how far does this go? And that's what I'm -- that's what I'm interested in. So supervisory authority would be enough, you said, but it depends on the issue? Why would it depend on the issue?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But that's the -- that's the line-drawing problem.  Why does it matter that it's the death penalty? What if it was not a capital case, but he -- he signed the indictment?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What if he signed the indictment?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  He signed the indictment. Let's say the -- the former -- the then-prosecutor signed the indictment, and there are thousands of indictments in a county like Philadelphia, so --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That would be enough?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What do you do with the fact that Chief Justice Castille was not solely responsible for the decision in this case? This was a decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.  Now, you say it was structural error.  Suppose that the court had been divided and Chief Justice Castille voted to affirm the decision of the lower court.  Would that decision still be invalid on the ground that he shouldn't have been participating?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Doesn't that mean it's not structural error?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So he might have persuaded a majority to vote to reverse, and then he turned around and he wrote an opinion saying that there should be an affirmance.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If we agree with you, doesn't that lead inevitably to the rule that a majority of the judges on a multi-judge panel have the authority to require the recusal of a colleague?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, wouldn't they -- wouldn't that have to be the consequences? Suppose that -- suppose you make a recusal motion.  You want Chief Justice Castille recused, and the other justices on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court say we think that he should be recused, and we're afraid that if we go ahead with this decision with his participation, the decision is going to be subject to attack down the road.  And we can't allow that to happen, so we're going to require him to be recused in order to prevent him from tainting our decision-making process or creating at least the appearance that the decision-making process is tainted. So that would have to be a consequence of your rule, would it not?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  They could just take their chances.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And he says, no, I disagree with you.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can we do that --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- without holding that there was a dupe -- a constitutional violation? What would be our authority to require them to do it over again?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  When was the last time a prisoner was executed in Pennsylvania, other than those instances in which the prisoner decided that he did not want to pursue appellate remedies?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So what's at issue here is only the death penalty, not the conviction itself, correct?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And nobody has -- nobody other than these so-called volunteers has been convicted since 1978 -- has been executed since 1978?   ",15-5040
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  We're talking about --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  We are talking about a constitutional recusal rule which would have very serious consequences.  So if it's -- even if it isn't absolutely necessary that that rule be very clear, certainly it is highly desirable that it be very clear so that everybody can determine with a degree of certainty when the time -- when the decision is made whether recusal is constitutionally required or not. And I really don't see a clear rule that would encompass this situation, other than a rule that said that a judge may -- is required by the Constitution to recuse in any case in which the judge had personal participation as a prosecutor. Anything other than that seems to me to be pretty fuzzy, but that would be a pretty far-reaching rule.  So can you think of one that is less -- that is not as far-reaching as that but nevertheless is clear? If we talk about the number of years that passed or how significant the -- how significant the issue was or things of that nature, those are all going to be subject to a lot of uncertainty and debate.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, you have two arguments: One is that dismissal is mandatory; the other is that the district court and the court of appeals applied the wrong standard in determining not to dismiss here. As to the first, what would you say about the case where the disclosure is very limited, seen by only one person, let's say; it was inadvertent, it was not done in bad faith, and it causes no harm? You would say dismissal is required even under those circumstances?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But that doesn't --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That doesn't sound like a per se rule, then.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  On the issue of harm to the government, did I understand you to say that the question is actual harm and not likelihood of harm at the time of the disclosure?   John F. Bash  We think on that factor, it's actual harm, but we think the second factor, severity, correlates with potential harm.  So if you issue a press release saying we brought a suit, the potential for harm there is enormous.   ",15-513X
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if we issue an opinion -- when we issue an opinion in this case, it will change the legal landscape. And I would appreciate it if you would respond to one of the arguments Ms. Sullivan made toward the end, which is that if we issue an opinion that affirms in this case where there were -- which involves the type -- the greatest degree of bad faith in this -- in violating the seal requirement that is really possible to imagine, that will stand for the principal in future cases, that even if an instance in which there was complete bad faith, dismissal is not appropriate.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Under --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You have a textual argument that I -- that I understand, but one of the arguments you mentioned at the outset was that an examination of the legislative history shows that Congress intended to produce the sort of result that was produced here, and I wonder if that's really a plausible argument. If you're correct, then two things happen; at least two things happen.  One, Kansas retains on its record an inaccurate -- inaccurate information about the presence of a sex offender, which can have a lot of adverse consequences for a lot of people.  I don't see why Congress would have wanted that to remain. And do you really think Congress was unconcerned about the United States exporting pedophiles to the Philippines or to other countries? Do you think that -- that they were not concerned about not only the human rights implications of that, but our relations with other countries?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if I could then come back to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical of someone like your client who moves from Kansas to Illinois, what, in the language of the statute, would prevent that person from going to the registry office in Kansas before departing and reporting there that he was moving to Illinois and his new address in Illinois would be whatever it would be? Why does that not fit under this -- under the language of the statute? Or would you agree that it does?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if you -- if you agree to that, then I don't see why -- why there is a difference between that situation and the situation where the -- the person leaves Kansas and goes to the Philippines.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why would it not be --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why would it not be sufficient under 42 U.S.C. 16913(c)?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, it says, ""shall not, later than three business days after each change of residence, appear in person in at least one jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a) and inform that jurisdiction of the change of address."" So prior to leaving, he is within the period of not later than what -- than three business days after the change of residence.  And at that time when he goes to the registry office in Kansas, he is residing in Kansas.  So he falls within subsection (a).   ",15-5238

INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And countries like the Philippines where the -- the Petitioner here went are known places that are attractive to sex tourists who go there to abuse young children and -- hasn't Congress evidenced a concern about this both for the human rights aspects of the problem and, also, I would think, for relations with the government of the Philippines?

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I'm not sure that really answers the question.  Because the vacated conviction may be worthless for a reason that is irrelevant to the point that Justice Kagan was making, which seems to be the situation here.  It's -- it's a wrongful conviction because an element was missing, but that doesn't undermine the argument that the two verdicts were inconsistent.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  They lack legal effect, but it is a historical fact that it occurs.  So surely they can be used to prove a historical fact.  For example, suppose there's a case in which the -- in which the question is whether a witness who testified for the prosecution was bribed.

And I just wanted to ask you about some Federal laws that are highlighted in the amicus brief filed by the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, and get your reaction whether a program like that would be permissible under the Missouri constitution. So one of them is a Federal nonprofit security grant program providing grants through the Department of Homeland Security to harden -- harden nonprofit organization facilities that are deemed to be at high risk for terrorist attacks.  So if you have a -- a synagogue that is at high risk for an attack by an anti-Semitic group or a mosque that is considered to be at high risk for attack by an anti-Muslim group, would the Missouri constitution permit the erection of bollards like we have around the court here?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Okay.  Here's another one. I have two more, if you'll indulge me. This is a Federal program that provided grants for the repair of buildings near the Federal building in Oklahoma City that were damaged by the bombing there.  Would that be permitted?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Okay.  Last one.  This is a New York City program that provides security -- money for security enhancements at schools where there's fear of shooting or other school violence.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So what is the definition of a church? So a religiously-affiliated school is not a church under the -- under the Missouri constitution?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But why --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why would that be so?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Oh.  So suppose you -- we have the -- a school that's run by the Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia.  And then next to it we have a -- a Jesuit elementary and secondary school.  One would be eligible, one would not be eligible?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But even though they're equally controlled by a religious organizations?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And -- and so long as the money is granted based on neutral criteria that are faithfully applied, I don't know how you can draw a distinction between a program that's open to everybody and a selective program. I mean, suppose Missouri offered 50 full college scholarships every year to students who achieved certain academic criteria -- who satisfied certain academic criteria, and this was open to public school students and private school students.  But, you know, after a few years, the school saw -- the State saw that a disproportionate number of these were going -- among those given to the religiously affiliate, to the private schools, a disproportionate were -- a number of the scholarships were going to students at schools that are affiliated with a particular faith. Would it be, then, justified to say, well, we better not -- we better disqualify every student who went to a religiously affiliated school so there aren't any hard feelings?   Samuel A.

Suppose the person is convicted -- suppose the evidence involves the burglary of a trailer. So you'd have the rather ridiculous situation of a jury -- if that was -- if those are separate elements, then if six of the jurors thought, well, this trailer is not very movable, so I think it's a house, and the other others say, well, you know, it's possible you could hook it up to a truck and move it, so it's a vehicle.  So there couldn't be an agreement, and the defendant would be acquitted.  That's a rather strange result that the Iowa legislature might want to avoid.

And, I mean, I want to -- if you look at page 96A of the Joint Appendix, the first sentence of -- I'm sorry, the paragraph 8 on that page, can you tell me if you were a district court judge, would you have seen in that argument the argument that the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act is unconstitutionally vague?

Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can I ask one other -- one other thing? Something strange seems to have happened between the petition stage and the briefing stage in the case. The question that you asked us to take was whether a bankruptcy court may authorize the distribution of settlement proceeds in a manner that violates the statutory priority scheme.  And you said there's a square conflict on that issue, with the Second Circuit and the Third Circuit on one side and the Fifth Circuit on the other side.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And we took the case. But then the question that you address in your brief refers to ""structured dismissal."" There is nothing about structured dismissal in the question that you asked us to take, and there is no conflict on the question of structured dismissal, is there?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Now, you're not asking us to decide the broad question whether there can ever be a structured dismissal.  But you are asking us to decide whether the priorities have to be followed in a structural dismissal, and unless the answer to that question follows from the answer to the question that you presented in your petition, you have changed the question that you have asked us to decide.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You're saying that -- that there can never be a distribution of estate assets except in compliance with the priorities?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  One which -- that's not what you just said?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What would be your principal basis for distinguishing the exception that Ms. Spinelli outlined at the end of her argument from what happened here? I thought your argument was that the priority scheme applies to everything that happens in a Chapter 7 and a Chapter 11.   Sarah E. Harrington  Yes.  So in our view, prepetition distributions in Chapter 11 that violate the priority scheme are not permissible under any circumstances unless there is consent of the impaired priority claimholder.  And so critical vendor orders, if they are done over the objection of the -- of the claimholder who skipped, we think those are not permissible. Now, most of the time those sort of first order distributions happen in a plane of reorganization, not in a plane of -- in a case of reorganization, not a liquidation case.  They happen with the consent of the senior claimholders, and they are generally premised on a -- on a prediction that -- that allowing that kind of distribution will ultimately result in every creditor getting more money at the end of the day.  So none of those factors apply here. You didn't have consent.  This is not an ongoing concern, and there is certainly no finding that everybody is going to get more money at the end of the day.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Ms. Harrington --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah, if I could just -- go ahead.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  There is another logically prior question.  And I don't know what you -- what do you think we should do with the question of whether the bankruptcy court has to approve settlements at all?   Sarah E. Harrington  We think that --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  There is nothing in the Code that says that they have to.   Sarah E. Harrington  So we think that -- that a bankruptcy court does have to approve a settlement that disposes of a claim held by the estate or asserted against the estate.  We don't think this Court needs to reach that question in this case if it doesn't want to, because we think it's very clear that a -- what a settlement cannot do is provide for the distribution of estate assets. I think it's important to remember, State assets don't belong to the debtor, and they don't belong to a subset of creditors.  They belong to the estate. And so the Code provides only specific ways that those assets can be distributed.  In Chapter 11, that's through a plan.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What --   Sarah E. Harrington  Go ahead.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is your response to the argument that your argument regarding Section 103(a) makes the provisions that specifically make the priorities applicable in Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 superfluous?   Sarah E. Harrington  Well, it doesn't, because if you look at those provisions, and one of them is Section 1129(a)(9), and then it's Section, I think, 726 in Chapter 7, they don't just say Section 507 priority scheme applies.  They also specify exceptions, and they specify the manner in which it applies. And so in Section 1129(a)(9), it says, priority claimholders can agree to an impairment of their rights.  That exception is not included in Section 7 -- in the -- in the Chapter 7 analog.  It also says -- tells you what it means to pay a priority claimholder either through cash or through deferred cash payments.  Depending on the type of 507 claim, the -- the parties have a right to demand one or the other. And so there is more to it than just saying, oh, Section 507 applies.  It tells you how it applies and in what circumstances.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So those are just exception provisions?   Sarah E. Harrington  Exception, but it also sort of tells you what it means to fully -- in -- in the Chapter 11 context, it tells you what it means to pay a priority claimholder.  And so some priority claimholders, I guess, can demand cash on the date of confirmation; others have to agree in some circumstances to deferred cash payments.  And so there is definitely more content to. In the Chapter 7 context, it also tells you which type of 507 claims are allowed based on when the associated proof of claim was filed.  So those -- in both cases, they kind of -- they add more substance than the Respondents would have you believe. I'd just like to point out that Congress enacted the priority scheme precisely to prohibit the kind of collusive looking agreements that happened here, where you have high-priority and low-priority creditors kind of squeezing out the middle creditors.  And the Court should not allow parties to make an end run around that prohibition by just scrapping the main settlement or -- or structured dismissal on what is really, in essence, an unconfirmable plan. We think that's what happened here.  The parties -- some of the parties reached an agreement. The agreement couldn't be confirmed as a plan because it abrogated the rights of priority claimholders and they did not consent.   ",15-649X

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is there any difference in practical terms between that and your causation argument or apportionment?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is the difference?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The Solicitor General has proposed a test with four factors to determine the article question.  Do you agree with those? Are there others you would add?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But this hypothetical is --   Brian H. Fletcher  -- in a different way.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  This hypothetical is not helpful to me, because I can't get over the thought that nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks.  What if it, you know, costs, I think, $1800 when it was first sold in the United States? What if it cost $18,000? What if it got 2 miles per gallon? What if it broke down every 50 miles? So if that is a real question, if it is a real question whether the article of manufacture there is the design or the entire car, gives me pause about the test for determining what is the article of manufacture.   Brian H. Fletcher  Well, I think that those things can be taken into account at the second step of the test, if you decide that the relevant design -- the relevant article of manufacture is the body of the car, but for all of the reasons you just pointed out.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No.  But what if you -- you were saying it's an open -- it would be a difficult question.  You'd have to apply numerous factors to determine what is the article of manufacture there.   Brian H. Fletcher  Well, I -- then I think if you're skeptical about that, I think our test for article of manufacture also lets some of those considerations play into that test, because it gets to whether there are other conceptually distinct invasions, or other components of the product unrelated to the design.

Is that -- is that basically what you said?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

But you mean it in a different sense, and I don't really understand what -- what that means.  Once you get beyond the pure -- where is the design applied? Is it applied to the inside? No.  It's applied to the outside.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Okay.

And I -- if you can give me a yes-or-no answer to this question, I'd appreciate it. Under Hall and Atkins, must a State use current medical standards, for example, DSM-5, as opposed to older standards, for example, DSM-IV? Yes or no.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Then I don't know --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- how you can recover on the question -- you can prevail on the question that you presented to us.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I don't understand what you mean by ""prohibit."" You mean prohibit the -- the lower courts from using a standard different from the one that the court of criminal appeals has said is the standard that has to be used everywhere in Texas? So each -- each trial level judge would apply a different standard, whatever that judge thinks is the right one?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And you think that this is a question of trial court discretion? A trial court has the discretion to use the newer standards as opposed to the -- as opposed to the standards that the court of criminal appeals says are the appropriate ones?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  As opposed to the ones that the court of criminal appeals had itself adopted.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. Sloan, I don't think you finished answering my question.  There are two -- let me rephrase it this way: There are different things in the Briseno or Briseno opinion. One is the -- the medical standards that are taken from the medical publications that were current as of the time of that decision.  And then there are these additional considerations, and that's what's regarded as the Briseno factors. But if you -- let's take a -- disregard the latter.  The first part are current -- are medical standards that were current at that time, are they not?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I think the court's -- would you say something about the adaptive behavior? Because I think that may be a stronger leg.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But what was the -- what is the problem with their analysis of that point?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Okay.  On that one, is there a consensus in the medical community that that's improper?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, here is an article written by a number of experts, recent article from the Journal of American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, Assessing Adaptive Functioning in Death Penalty Cases after Hall and DSM-5.  One of these experts was cited in the -- in -- in one of the supporting amicus briefs by professional organizations in Hall, which says that any assessment of adaptive functioning must give sufficient consideration to assets and deficits alike.

Alito, Jr.  Well, I understand what an equal outcome would be, but I don't understand what an equal opportunity means when an equal outcome is not practical.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do you agree with Mr. Fisher that cost has no place in this calculation? No matter how expensive it would be and no matter what the impact in, let's say, a poor school district would be on the general student population, cost can't be considered? And do you think in the real world, school boards are disregarding costs entirely?   Irving L. Gornstein  So they're definitely not disregarding costs entirely, because there could be two different programs, both of which are reasonable, and they would take into account costs, surely, in deciding which of those reasonable programs to adopt. But more generally, I would say the answer is no in the usual case.  And -- and from Cedar Rapids, that's -- what the Court said is you consider cost in deciding what the standard should be in the first place, but cost can't define what the standards are. And that makes sense to me in -- in light of the way you look at this statute.  Congress obviously knew, when it passed this law, that there were going to be some significant expenses associated with some kids, and that's why it gave money and made it an opt-in program.  So at the very least, it seems to me, Cedar Rapids and the structure of the statute tell you that in the usual case it can't be cost, but --   Samuel A.

Yeah, I don't see how you can have a benefit unless you're making some progress. ""Significant,"" ""meaningful,"" they're synonyms.  If something is significant or meaningful, it's more than de minimis.  And if it's more than de minimis, you could say it's significant.  It's something that you note.  So it's really -- I mean, what everybody seems to be looking for is the word that has just the right nuance to express this thought.   Samuel A.

If -- if we were to look at what the lower courts have been doing -- we don't see very many of these cases, the lower courts see a lot of them.

Alito, Jr.  Well, what if the -- the Guidelines themselves said that the term ""crime of violence"" means, among other things, burglary of a dwelling, arson, extortion, involves use of explosives, involves possession of a sawed-off shotgun, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another? Would there be a vagueness problem then?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But the Guidelines provisions are the -- are the Commission's words.  Now, they borrowed them from a statute, but they didn't have to do that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But they did.  So they -- they were their words, and they interpreted their words in the commentary.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Let me ask you a more -- let me ask you a more fundamental question.  And I don't want to unduly shock the attorneys who are here from the Sentencing Commission, but imagine there were no sentencing guidelines. So you have a criminal provision that says that a person who's convicted of this offense may be imprisoned for not more than 20 years.  That's all it says. Now, is that unconstitutionally vague?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, that seems to be a lot -- a lot vaguer than what we have here.  So how do you -- how do you reconcile those two propositions?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Are you saying there's more arbitrariness under this provision than there was under the pre-Sentencing Reform Act sentencing system, where a judge would pick a sentence between zero and 20 years based on that judge's personal ideas about retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation? And in practice, there were judges who, under that system, always imposed a very light sentence for a particular offense and other judges who always imposed a heavy sentence for that particular offense.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If I go through the Sentencing Guidelines -- I mean, I just opened them at random.  I can see provisions that would generate a -- you know, an arguable vagueness challenge if they were in a criminal statute. How about more than minimal planning? Do you think that's sufficiently -- that that's sufficiently clear to satisfy vagueness concerns if, you know, you're -- you're guilty of this offense if it involved more than minimal planning? Or the difference between a serious bodily injury and a permanent or life-threatening bodily injury? And those are just -- I mean, just open this at random.   ",15-8544
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So basically, your argument is that there's a continuum, so that if you have complete judicial discretion, barring the consideration of some impermissible invidious factor, within the statutory guideline range, there's no vagueness problem. On the other hand, if you have mandatory guidelines, you may have to apply vagueness principles to the mandatory guidelines. Now, here it -- so someplace in the middle you get -- you are close enough to the mandatory that that has to apply.  That's -- that's your argument?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if advisory guidelines are subject to vagueness challenges, then surely mandatory guidelines would be subject to vagueness --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  So it's for vagueness purposes. Now, suppose what the Court had said is the Guidelines are purely advisory.  Now, you know, they're -- the Sentencing Commission, very respected group, studied the problem; judges, you really ought to read them, you ought to take them into account, but in the end, it's your call, based on the factors that are set out in the Sentencing Reform Act. Would the result be the same?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But what will happen ten years from now? Let's say ten years from now when you have -- there's no district judge anymore who even remembers the mandatory guideline regime and there are departures in 85 percent of the cases, and the judges go through the drill.  They -- you know, they calculate the Guidelines and all of that, but then they go on and impose the type of sentence that they think adequately serves the legitimate purposes of sentencing.  Would your argument be the same then?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's like jurisdiction, that we are bound, we have no choice but to decide retroactivity before deciding anything else.

They have a warrant to search this motorcycle because it's been involved in criminal activity.  They want to get the vehicle identification number from it.  And they see it.  Let's say it's parked two feet from the curb.  But arguably -- or it's parked where it is here, maybe in the curtilage, maybe not in the curtilage. The -- that warrant would be insufficient?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And this is my question about your argument based on the curtilage.  We -- we ask whether a search within or outside the curtilage in order to determine whether the Fourth Amendment applies at all. But that's not really the question here because there is probable cause, and there is the motor vehicle exception to the warrant requirement.  So the issue is not whether there was a search.  Yes, there was a search.  And, yes, you know, if it -- if it was the curtilage, then there was -- there -- there was an intrusion on the protected area. But the warrant -- the motor vehicle exception to the warrant requirement, I take it, is based on two things.  One is the -- the risk that the vehicle is going to be moved during the time when the warrant is sought and, second, is a consideration on the other side of the risk that if there's not a warrant, the police will be wrong about probable cause and the degree of intrusion on property, on legitimate property interests that occur in that situation. It's a balancing.  It's not a consideration of whether it's on the curtilage or not.  And it's hard to see why the balance is any different here than it would be if this motorcycle had been parked on the street.  The -- the risk that it will be moved seems to be almost exactly the same.  And what -- what is the additional invasion of privacy?

Alito, Jr.  So if this motorcycle were parked on the street and it was covered by a tarp, you would say that the motor vehicle exception doesn't apply because it's covered by a tarp?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So what's the relevance of the tarp?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But the --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Did -- coming back to Justice -- to the -- to the question, did we say in Jardines that the curtilage is to be treated the same as the house for all Fourth Amendment purposes? I thought the issue in Jardines was whether -- was whether officers who did not have probable cause were permitted to walk up to the front of the house, at which point they acquired probable cause.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do you dispute the fact that they had probable cause to believe that the thing that they saw covered by the tarp was the motorcycle they were looking for?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, it's not like Jardines --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  He had probable cause -- you -- I thought you admitted he had probable cause to believe that the thing covered by the tarp was the motorcycle that he -- had eluded him by driving 140 miles an hour.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So he has probable cause to search that motorcycle, to find the -- the vehicle identification number, which will tell him the owner of the motorcycle, which will help him arrest the person who committed this crime, right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So the case comes down to this: If the motorcycle were parked on the street or maybe further down the driveway, and, therefore, not in the curtilage, they wouldn't need a warrant.  They could search it.  But because it was parked a few feet further away, although in a spot that's visible from the street, they could search it in the first instance because of the risk that the motorcycle will be taken away, but in the second instance, moved a few feet further up the driveway, still visible from the street, can't be -- they can't search it because of the additional invasion of privacy that is involved in walking those few feet up the driveway?

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I mean, they're --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- garages.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But, Mr. Cox, you know the -- the Fourth Amendment says the people have the right to be secure in their homes, papers, persons, and effects.  So in the curtilage -- the curtilage issue goes to the question of whether it is a search of the home. If it's not in the curtilage -- curtilage, then it's not a search of the home, the Fourth Amendment doesn't apply. But once you get beyond that, it is a search of the home, the ultimate Fourth Amendment question is always: Is it a reasonable search? And that's where we are here.  Is it reasonable? It's a balancing of interests.  That's what reasonableness meant in -- at the end of the 18th century; it's what it means today. And so you have to grapple with the real privacy interests that are involved in the case versus the other considerations; namely, the mobility of the automobile.  And that, I understand your argument to be, is why it's reasonable to draw a distinction between an enclosed place like the house or garage and an open place like a driveway, even if it technically falls within the curtilage.

How can that be satisfaction of attorney's fees, if it's a nominal amount?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But that's the -- that's the word that's used in the statute.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah, but you could say that the fee -- that the award has to satisfy the attorney's fees up to the cap. There wouldn't be anything odd about that.  It just seems that -- you don't think that that's an odd use of the term ""satisfy""? I mean, suppose --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

The -- the dictionary definition of ""impede"" is: Interfere with or slow the progress of. So anything that makes the work of the IRS more difficult impedes the work of the IRS.   Samuel A.

What do you have besides the mens rea?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, where does this come from in the language of the statute? I mean, this -- that's what troubles me about this.  If I read ""impede"" to mean what it means in ordinary language, slow the progress of, you don't even have to impede.  It's enough that you endeavor to impede. The only limiting thing I see here is ""corruptly."" And, you know, the old, you know, the old saying, it's lawful for taxpayers to avoid taxes but not to evade taxes.  So the line is -- the line can be very -- can be very thin.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, let me just give you a variation of the hypothetical that's already been given.

Let's say it's just a policy question.

Suppose that it was alleged that town officials in someplace in northern Wisconsin where the Republicans predominate were discriminating against the Democratic candidate for a legislative district by, let's say, not allowing that candidate's signs to be put up along the roadsides, but allowing the Republican signs to be put up along the roadsides, or they were pressuring town -- let's just leave it at that. They're discriminating with respect to these signs.  Now, who would have standing to raise a First Amendment challenge to that?

If you have a system, let's extend it to many towns that are controlled by the Republicans and they're taking down all the Democratic signs.  And if that's an effective strategy, it will mean fewer members of the legislature are Democrats and, therefore, the interests of the Democratic voter in Milwaukee or Madison will be impaired.  It seems like exactly the same thing.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  Well, on the -- let's -- let's look at the race issue. So you have a state where there you have an African American voter in -- in a -- in one part of the state who wants to complain that districts in another part of the state are -- are packed or cracked and, as a result of that, there are going to be fewer African Americans in the legislature than there should be. And that's going to impair that person's interests, including, I would suppose, their right of association.  What -- what is the difference between those two situations?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, Mr. Smith --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. Smith, can I just say something -- ask you a question about the political science? I mean, I -- gerrymandering is distasteful.  But if we are going to impose a standard on the courts, it has to be something that's manageable and it has to be something that's sufficiently concrete so that the public reaction to decisions is not going to be the one that the Chief Justice mentioned, that this three-judge court decided this, that -- this way because two of the three were appointed by a Republican president or two of the three were appointed by a Democratic president. Now, it's been 30 years since Bandemer, and before then and since then, judges, scholars, legal scholars, political scientists have been looking for a manageable standard.  All right. In 2014, a young researcher publishes a paper, Eric McGhee publishes a paper, in which he says that the measures that were previously -- the leading measures previously, symmetry and responsiveness, are inadequate. But I have discovered the key.  I have discovered the Rosetta stone and it's -- it is the efficiency gap. And then a year later you bring this suit and you say: There it is, that is the constitutional standard.  It's been finally -- after 200 years, it's been finally discovered in this paper by a young researcher, who concludes in the end -- this is the end of his paper -- after saying symmetry and responsiveness have shown to be -- looked to be inappropriate, ""The measure I have offered here, relative wasted votes, is arguably"" -- arguably -- ""a more valid and flexible measure of -- of partisan -- of partisan gerrymandering."" Now, is this -- is this the time for us to jump into this? Has there been a great body of scholarship that has tested this efficiency gap? It's full of questions. Mr. McGhee's own amicus brief outlines numerous unanswered questions with -- with this theory. What do you do in -- in elections that are not contested? Well, then you have to -- you have to make two guesses.  How many people would have voted for the winning candidate if it had been a contested election? How many people would have voted for the losing candidate if it had been a contested election? One of the judges in the court below asks: Why do you calculate EG by map, by subtracting from the votes obtained by the winner, 50 percent of the votes, instead of the votes obtained by the runner up? And Mr. McGhee says: Well, I have an answer to this, and I have a forthcoming paper and I'll answer it in the forthcoming paper. (Laughter.)   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And there are all of these questions.  This is -- 2017 is the time to jump into this? That's a question.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah, there is a question there.

The -- the political geography can lead to it; protection of incumbents, which has been said to be a legitimate factor, can lead to a high EG; compliance with the Voting Rights Act can affect that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How are they taken care of at the justification stage? The proposal is to run many -- you know, millions of -- of alternative maps to see whether using some traditional districting requirements, you can produce a map that has a lower -- a lower EG.  But my understanding is that when that's done, those maps do not take into account either incumbent protection or compliance with the Voting Rights Act, both of which can have a very big effect.

So isn't Ashe -- doesn't Ashe simply provide one definition of the same offense?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah, but in Jeffers, the Court held that when the second trial involves the same offense under the Blockburger test and the defendant consents, the second trial can go forward.  So why should it not follow that when the defendant consents, if, in fact, that is done, and the second trial involves the same offense under Ashe, this rule should be the same?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But wouldn't it be odd to say that the defendant in Jeffers has a lesser double jeopardy right when what he is asserting is consistent with what the Double Jeopardy Clause was originally understood to mean, whereas, in a situation like this, what the defendant is asserting is something that was developed by our cases in the modern era but was not what the Double Jeopardy Clause was originally intended to mean. So, when the defendant is asserting the core double jeopardy right and says, I want a second trial, there can be a second trial, but when the defendant is asserting this new elaboration of the right, there can't be a second trial.

If we thought that that would be consistent with the First Amendment, would that doom your case or would you still have additional arguments?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Have we ever said that it would be permissible to ban all political speech on military ground?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How many other states have laws that go as far as Minnesota's?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And what has been the experience of these other cases -- these other states? Have they had brawls in the -- in the polling place? Have they had disturbances in the polling place?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, the states that don't have laws that go as far as Minnesota's, what -- what has been the record there?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And does the record show how many officials would be making these determinations at a general election in Minnesota and how they're selected?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah, the polling officials.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So they're selected by the parties.  So, if a -- an official from one party thinks that the attire of a particular voter violates this law, what happens? That's the final decision?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And who --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I'm sorry.  And who selects the head election judge at any particular place?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I'll ask -- I guess I'll ask the state.  Do you know whether these -- these people have any training? Are they all chosen to be the reasonable observer? Do they, you know, test them to see if they're -- they're the reasonable observer? Do we know?   ",16-1435
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The problem is that so many things have political connotations, and the connotations are in the eye of the beholder.  And on Election Day, you're going to have hundreds, maybe thousands of officials in Minnesota, and every one of them probably thinks that he or she is the reasonable observer, and they're making a determination about whether something has political connotations. And in one of your elections, in 2016, I think, you had -- the President was running, members of the House were running, members of the State Legislature were running, State Judges were running.  There were local elections.  There was one ballot question. So the observer would have to know all of the issues in all of those campaigns and would have to decide whether something had connotations regarding any of those issues. It's -- it's an invitation for arbitrary and -- arbitrary enforcement and enforcement that's not even-handed.  And I -- I have no idea where the line lies. Some of the examples that were raised in the Eighth Circuit were really pretty -- and -- and the state said, yes, that would be prohibited.  An AFL-CIO shirt, that would be prohibited?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah.  Well, that makes it worse, that it has to be -- well, it's not only does it have to be a political message, but it has to be well-known.  What -- what is well-known?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How about a shirt with a rainbow flag? Would that be permitted?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How about a shirt that says ""Parkland Strong""?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Even though gun control would very likely be an issue?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I bet some candidate would raise an issue about gun control.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, what's the answer to this question? You're a polling official.  You're the reasonable person.  Would that be allowed or would it not be allowed?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Okay.  How about an NRA shirt?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How about a shirt with the text of the Second Amendment?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How about the First Amendment? (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah, well, this is the problem.  How about a Colin Kaepernick jersey?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How about ""All Lives Matter""?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How about an ""I Miss Bill"" shirt? (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  An ""I Miss Bill,"" or to make it bipartisan, a ""Reagan/Bush '84"" shirt?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I mean, people go to vote after work, before work, in the middle of doing chores for the day, taking kids to school.  So somebody goes to the polling place and is wearing a shirt, doesn't say anything about a candidate or a ballot issue, but a particular election judge, one of these people picked by one of the two parties, says, oh, that's political, you -- so now this person has a choice. The person can wear a bathrobe or some kind of coverup to go in and vote.  You think that's not kind of humiliating? Or the person can be listed as a bad Minnesotan and, at some point down the road, potentially fined $300, found to have committed a petty offense.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's the situation, right?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You exacerbate that problem by opening up the possibility of similarly partisan or seemingly partisan applications of your very broad statute.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  How is that going to happen? So let's say the -- there's an election judge who's a Republican and this Republican election judge thinks that a particular shirt has political connotations and says, no, you can't go in; you've got to wear -- you've got to cover yourself up or go home and get changed.  Okay? And now that person thinks that's unfair.  Then what happens?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  A Democrat -- a Democratic judge intervenes and then you have a -- you have an argument between these two judges?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And who's the head election judge?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Let me ask you about one of the interests that you assert in your brief, and this is on page 46 of your brief. ""A voter could well feel confused or intimidated if she walked into a polling place and discovered that every other voter held the opposite point of view on any number of controversial political issues related to electoral choices, as evidenced by the political messages displayed on other voters' apparel."" Do you think that's a compelling state interest? Do you think that's even a legitimate state interest?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Now how would an as-applied challenge work on -- on Election Day? You're not going to have an as-applied challenge when somebody goes to vote.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Suppose a group of people want to make a statement about a political issue, not a political candidate but a political issue, and they say we're going to do that by wearing all white on Election Day when we go to the polls. Would that be allowed?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That doesn't express a view on a political issue?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So, if a shirt has ""#metoo"" that would be allowed or not allowed?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So if people want --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So -- so, if a group said, well, okay, we're not going to be able to wear our -- our ""Me Too"" shirt, but we're going to convey the same message by wearing all white, that would be okay?

For example, is there a constitutional requirement for a union to handle the grievances of nonmembers, or is that something that's imposed by state law?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  There are -- there are numerous differences between Pickering and the situation here, but let me just ask you about one.  Do you think there are any limitations on the authority of the State of Illinois to compel its employees to say what the state wants them to say? And if there are limitations, what are they?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, if it's not a function of their official duties.  I understand you could not -- you probably agree with the position you're arguing, but if you didn't, coming here representing the State of Illinois, you couldn't just argue what you like.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's right. (Laughter.)   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I know.  I understand that and in that situation.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But aside from your official duties, are there any limitations?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What are they?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, let me ask you, I'll give you a concrete situation.  In Connick, an assistant district attorney -- the Court held that an assistant district attorney could be fired for circulating a writing that suggested that there was a lack of confidence in the supervisors in the office.  Okay? It was a limitation on what she could say. Do you think the case would have been the same if the district attorney required the assistant district attorney to appear before a meeting of everybody in the office and say: I love my supervisors; they are the best supervisors anybody could possibly want?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, the Court said that that was a matter of -- that was a -- that was a subject of private concern.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Private concern. Private concern.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, then why won't you answer my question about what the assistant district attorney could be required to do? Throughout history, many people have drawn a line between a restriction on their speech and compelled speech. I'll give you an example that's only -- that's quite different given the nature of the -- of the subject from what's involved here. Do you remember the -- the -- the movie and the play ""A Man For All Seasons""? So Thomas Moore didn't insist on saying that he thought the act of supremacy was wrong, but he drew a line and paid for it with his life because he would not affirmatively say that it was wrong. When you compel somebody to speak, don't you infringe that person's dignity and conscience in a way that you do not when you restrict what the person says?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, they're not a -- it's not ""A Man for All Seasons"" scenario.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But I'm just asking you about the point whether you think that compelling somebody to speak is exactly the same thing as saying you may not speak?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And what if the statute -- what if the state statute says that lobbying is a man -- is a mandatory subject of bargaining?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, there's no -- is there any limit on what states can make a mandatory subject of collective bargaining? So if the test is whether it's -- whether the -- it's mandated by the -- by the state, the state can make anything it wants a mandatory subject of bargaining.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. Frederick, I -- when I -- when I read your brief, I saw something I thought I would never see in a brief filed by a public employee union, and that is the argument that the original meaning of the Constitution is that public employees have no free speech rights. Where do you want us to go with that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Should -- should we adopt that rule?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do you think that's a fair characterization of their argument?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if one employee says I deserve a 5 percent raise, is that a matter of public concern or private concern?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  So, if that's a matter of private concern, if the union demands a 5 percent wage increase for all of the employees it represents, can that be a matter of public concern?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It can't? No?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So what -- what if the effect of the 5 percent wage increase across the board would push a city to the brink and perhaps over the brink into bankruptcy.  Would it then become a matter of public concern?   ",16-1466

INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The evidence -- evidence obtained in violation of the -- the privilege would be admissible in a competency hearing or not?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So what about a Gerstein hearing and a bail hearing?   Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  Wouldn't it -- in a criminal -- in a federal case, if there's a complaint, wouldn't it begin at the time of the filing of the complaint? Wouldn't that be the beginning of the criminal case?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I'm just not -- I'm not following your answer.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In a federal case, when a complaint is filed, is that not the beginning of the criminal case, in your view, so that everything that happens after that is part of the criminal case?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  First appearance -- the initial appearance in court, that's part of the -- the criminal case.  The bail hearing is part of the criminal case.  The -- the competent -- if there's a competency hearing, that's part of the criminal case.  It's all part of the criminal case.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If this case -- if this case goes to trial, you will prove that the officer suffered damage as a result of the probable cause hearing or as a result of having been -- as a result of the admission that he made under alleged -- allegedly under compulsion by the city?

I -- I see a number of possible standards that could be used here.  One is purely subjective: What would this defendant have done? I understand the concept; it creates a lot of practical difficulties. Another objective standard would be, is there a reasonable probability of a better outcome if the defendant had gone to trial? That's manageable. That's standard Strickland. But if the test is, would a rational defendant have in -- have gone to trial given the -- the sentence that would be -- that the defendant might face if convicted discounted by the probability of conviction versus the consequences of -- of deportation, I -- I don't know how to do that.  It's -- it's -- because it -- it depends on how a particular person values those two things.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

I mean, I wouldn't do those things, but people do it.  I can't say they're irrational.  They're much less risk averse and they value things differently.  I -- I think --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- it's an unmanageable standard.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I -- you have very sympathetic facts, but suppose we change the variables a bit.  You know, they both can -- they both are a sliding scale.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So you have a much more serious -- the potential for a much more serious sentence.  Let's say, if the person is convicted, the person will serve eight years.  And you have a person who has many more ties to the country to which the person would be removed. Now, how do you make that -- how do you decide whether that's rational?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  At what point does it become irrational?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But that points to a purely subjective test, which, as I said, is conceptually coherent, but creates a lot of practical difficulties, because then the Court is going to have to try to recreate what the defendant would have done.  And, of course, after the defendant has been in prison for a while and is facing deportation, the person -- the person, I mean, I don't know, may have second thoughts. It's very hard to recreate that.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But is that what you're asking us to do, to adopt a purely subjective standard? You say no.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is --   Samuel A.

He came here when he was 25 years old.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  He still has some relatives and friends in Korea.  The sentence that he faces here is much higher.

Alito, Jr.  I -- I understand the argument that the test should be purely subjective. What would this defendant have done? There's language in Hill that supports that.  The language that says is it rational under the circumstances is contrary to that, as I read it, because rationality is not a matter of -- is not a subjective thing.  It's objective. But let's say it is a purely subjective question.  Then I think it's a question of historical fact.  So you have to have a finding of fact by somebody, presumably the judge, in the 2255, and that would be reviewed for clear error.  Would that -- wouldn't that follow?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, I'm not proposing that test, but I'm -- I'm suggesting that that is the consequence of our saying that the test is purely subjective.  We can't decide that this defendant would have, as a matter of fact, gone to trial had he been properly advised.  That's a -- that's a factual question, purely historic fact.  It would have to go back to a judge to make a finding of fact on that question.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In this case or in any case.   ",16-327X
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What about if the category were fundamental rights that implicate the -- the individual's life or health, so that you would have to have an express provision giving the attorney-in-fact authorization to consent to various procedures that a terminally ill person might undergo, and if this were put in that category?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, in this case, what's involved here is care for a -- a person who is unable to look after that -- that person's own care, an elderly person, a disabled person in a -- in a nursing facility. So what if that were lumped together with consent to surgery, consent to terminate feeding, or -- or breathing for a terminally-ill patient.  All of those could be put into a category that implicate life or health.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But the --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But the context here seems different from the arbitration cases that we've had in recent years.  This doesn't involve an -- an arbitration about the amount that you were charged for your cable bill or for your telephone bill.  This involves a situation where an elderly person needs care. And as Justice Kennedy's hypothetical mentioned, it may be that the only facility that's available, or all of the facilities, require the signing of an -- an arbitration agreement which prevents the assertion of tort claims and the -- the elimination of the deterrents that they provide may really implicate the care of someone who is vulnerable.  So this seems like something that is close to or that it falls squarely within the police power of a State. Now, I suppose that there's a connection here to interstate commerce, I don't know what exactly it is, but on the assumption that everything is connected to interstate commerce, I assume that this falls within the FAA. But you see the problem? This is really taking the arbitration precedence that we have handed down in recent years into a different category of interests.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, what about the Wellner -- the Wellner documents.  As I read what the court said in the first part of its discussion about that, it just interpreted the power of attorney as not reaching arbitration.  So there it was just exercising its ordinary powers of contract interpretation.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, do you think every time a State court incorrectly interprets a power of attorney relating to -- as it relates to arbitration, that that raises an FAA preemption issue?

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Could I just ask you a practical question? Would there be anything -- suppose a trustee or the attorney for a debtor said, I am going to -- let's say this case is in Alabama.  The statute of limitations for the collection of debt in Alabama is six years.  I am going to object to every -- any claim for a debt that was incurred more than six years ago. Would -- would that be inconsistent with the duties of the trustee or the attorney?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I'll -- I'll ask Mr. Geyser the same question, but it -- I can't understand why a trustee or an attorney wouldn't take that -- wouldn't take that approach --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- automatically object to anything that is over the -- the statute of limitations.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do you think this good faith defense is objective or subjective?   Sarah E. Harrington  We think it's objective -- or it's the same -- it's basically the same.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It's objective?   Sarah E. Harrington  It's objective.  All we are doing is saying the same standard that would be applied under Rule 9011 or Rule 11 should be applied here.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And you said -- take the case of -- this was the third debt collection act. You're just talking about debt collectors.  So -- but let's under bankruptcy, you have a single creditor, a person who owns a sandwich shop has a claim.  It's -- it turns out that it's clearly barred by the statute of limitations, files that claim.  That's sanctionable conduct?   Sarah E. Harrington  As a practical matter, it probably wouldn't be because they would withdraw.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  As legal matter, it would be under your interpretation.   Sarah E. Harrington  If they didn't have a good-faith basis for believing that the limitations period didn't apply in that case because of tolling or some other equitable principle --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Subjective.  They were acting in perfect good faith subjectively, but not objectively.   Sarah E. Harrington  Well, Rule 9011 requires a lawyer or another party to certify they have done a reasonable investigation and have a good-faith basis for believing that their claims are warranted by existing law.  And so if they haven't done that reasonable investigation or if they have ignored the results of that investigation, which must have been happened here, then they violated Rule 9011 and engaged in unfair and misleading practices.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  May I ask you the question that I -- I asked your -- your adversary.  Why -- why do these time-barred claims slip through? I mean, that's a big part of your argument.  Why don't trustees and attorneys for the debtor automatically object to any claim that is beyond the number of years set out in the statute of limitations?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why is there a big cost in -- in filing an objection?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I can't believe you couldn't even have -- you could have a computer program that does this automatically.  I can't understand why it would be very difficult.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But how many of these would there be in the typical Chapter 13?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I find this is a very difficult case because if -- if your description of Midland's business model is correct, it doesn't seem to me that it has much, if any, social utility. On the other hand, I have real a problem with your -- with fitting your argument into the concept of an affirmative defense.  I thought an affirmative defense was a rule of law that may allow the defendant to prevail if the defendant asserts the defense.  But you want to switch -- you're switching that over to the side of the plaintiff or the person filing the claim. It seems inconsistent with the whole idea of an affirmative defense. The idea of an affirmative defense -- let's take statute of limitations.  The idea is that the defendant may escape liability based on the statute of limitations, but only if a defendant asserts the defense and, if necessary, proves it.  And if a defendant doesn't do that, then the law is perfectly content with having a recovery on a claim that would have otherwise been time barred.   ",16-348X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And I don't see a problem with -- with (F)(iii)  The -- the party is attempting to collect a debt owed or due to someone else, and it concerns a debt which was obtained.  And -- and if obtained, it doesn't mean owed.  You can obtain a debt that you don't own.  I don't see any problem with (F)(iii).   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why would they not be covered if they acquired the debt before it went into -- I'm sorry -- after it went into default? They would be collecting a debt owed -- owed or due to someone else. And they acquired the debt after it went into default; therefore, they don't fall into (iii).   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why do you have to get into assignments at all? All -- all that's needed to defeat your argument with respect to (iii), is to think of a situation in which a person or an entity is collecting a debt owed to another, and that person or entity obtained the debt at a time when the debt was not defaulted.  And that -- it's very easy to think of a situation like that, with respect to the classic debt collector that does nothing but collect other people's debts, if ""obtained"" means getting that debt for collection.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Your -- your answer is that's not a reasonable -- that's not the right definition of ""obtained.""   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So that's what it comes down to, right?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, I'm talking -- I'll take them one at a time.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  As to Clause (iv), I'm not sure I understood what you said.  So let's say your company is owed a debt by other -- to -- other people owe the company a debt.  They get a loan.  They give the -- the party extending the loan a security interest in that debt, and now there's an effort to collect that debt. Who is owed that debt? Is not -- is it not still owed to the -- the original party? It's not owed to the person with the security interest, is it?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yes.  Right.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, this situation -- I -- I mean, it's possible to think of situations that would fall within that.  It may be that they are not things that are -- they are not situations that are very likely to come up in -- in the real world. But the strength of your -- the -- the degree of absurdity that you have to show under (iv), depends on the ambiguity of the phrase due -- ""owed or due,"" and I mean, I think that's not just -- not the first way you'd read that.  It's not the fiftieth way you would read that.  It's just you're -- you're fighting -- you're really going uphill on that.  You need something really strong to overcome that, I would say.

You can ask the defendant's attorney to bring the defendant in and surrender.  I know that that's happened quite a few times.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Sure.  That's something that could happen. Thank you.   ",16-369X
0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That's -- that was a different context.  It had to do with an exception to the warrant requirement.  But the problem with your test, as you articulate it, and as I understand it, is that you start out with something that is said to be unreasonable, but it is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.  And you impose liability for that decision, not for the ultimate decision to use deadly force. And -- and this has come up in a situation like Sheehan where there's a dispute about whether it's reasonable for -- you have a -- a mentally disturbed person and let's say the person has a hostage in a house or there's an innocent person there and the mentally disturbed person is acting in a way that seems to present a serious threat to the -- the innocent person in the house.  And there's a dispute about whether it's reasonable for the police to enter as opposed to waiting for a -- a psychological expert or -- or they only have negotiations for a short period of time before they enter and it's argued that wasn't reasonable, that's not good police practice, they should have waited a longer period of time, and you end up imposing liability. And then once they go in, then they're in a -- in a life-threatening situation and they use force. You end up imposing liability for what is arguably a violation of best police practices, or something that is recommended by experts in this situation.  That's what's anomalous about the rule that you've -- that you've suggested.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, but that's a different way of looking at the situation.  And I agree, that that's a -- you know, that's -- that's the question that you would think you would address under the Fourth Amendment.  You start out with the Fourth Amendment violation, and then you say, did it proximately cause the use of deadly force? But not the rule that you suggested where you start out with something that isn't a violation of the Fourth Amendment, whether or not it represents best police practices or not.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, it may very well be a seizure.  If they -- if they interfere with the liberty of the person who they approach, then it's a -- then it's a seizure, it's a stop.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And that would be the situation in the hypothetical that Justice Sotomayor mentioned, which was presented in your brief, where the police officer jumps in front of a car and doesn't allow the driver enough time to stop.  And then as the driver is approaching the police officer, the police officer shoots.  That's a seizure.  And so you look at the entire seizure, the jumping in front of the car, plus the ultimate shooting to determine whether it's reasonable.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But the Fourth Amendment doesn't prohibit unreasonable interactions.  What it prohibits is unreasonable searches and seizures.  So it's entirely appropriate to look at the whole seizure, but not this chain of interactions that includes a lot of things that happened before there ever is conduct that implicates the Fourth Amendment.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, let me give you two situations.  Situation A: The officers get a warrant, they go to the residence, they knock on the door.  The resident opens the door.  They say: We have a search warrant.  We're going to search your house. All right?  Situation B: They don't get a search warrant.  They think they have exigent circumstances. They knock on the door.  And they -- in both cases, they're uniformed police officers.  They say: We're police officers.  We're here; we're going to search your house.  We don't have a warrant.  We think we have -- we can search your house without a warrant because we have an exception to the warrant requirement. Now, is there more -- is it more likely that there's going to be violence in the second situation than in the first situation? I -- I -- I don't see why there is.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, then, then I don't see where there's proximate cause.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah.  And in my hypothetical, the -- what I -- I neglected to say but should have said was that there weren't exigent circumstances.  So the -- the entry was unlawful, but they had a warrant -- they -- they -- but you still have those two situations.  In one case, they have a warrant. The other case, they say: We think -- and they turn out to be wrong -- that we don't need a warrant. But I don't -- I asked you whether there's a greater risk of violence in one than the other, and I -- I'd like to hear your -- your answer.  Why would there be a greater risk of violence in the situation where the -- the resident knows that it's -- that they are police officers and they're going to conduct a search, as opposed to the situation where there's -- where there's a warrant? Any -- any violence that the resident directs at the police officer is illegal in both situations; right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It's not justified for them to attack the police.  They -- ""Well, I know"" --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  ""You know, I know -- I know you're a police officer, but I don't think you really have an exception to the warrant requirement, so I'm going to shoot you.""

What -- on what other ground can Miller possibly be distinguished?   Samuel A.

I mean, people know, there -- there were all these commercials, ""can you hear me now,"" our company has lots of towers everywhere.  What do they think that's about?

1,"Samuel A.

The person can't prevent the company from gathering it.  The person can't force the company to destroy it.  The person can't prevent the company from destroying it. And according to Petitioner, the customer doesn't even have a right to get the information.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah, Mr. Dreeben, I would read the -- the -- the phrase ""customer proprietary information"" to mean that it is proprietary to the cell phone company and, therefore, not to the customer.  It's customer information, but it's proprietary information about the cell phone company because, if you got that information in the aggregate, you could tell a lot about the company's operation. I assume that -- that that kind of information would be available to the FCC.  And so, if the FCC obtained it, they would have to treat it as proprietary information of the company.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Am I wrong in that?   Samuel A.

Asking another -- asking a party or ordering a party to produce documents is not a search in the literal sense of the word, nor is it a seizure in the literal sense of the word, but cases going back to Boyd, and Hale versus Henkel, old cases say that it's a -- it's a constructive search.  But in the situation where there's this constructive search, then the Fourth Amendment standards that apply to a literal search, what the Court called an actual search, are different.

So does that refer only to those state statutes that suspend the period, or does it also include those state statutes that simply stop the clock?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I don't know it's a debatable -- a debatable position.  I think you have to take a position on it because you're making a textual argument.  And it's hard to make a textual argument that ""tolled"" means something different from ""tolling."" Most of the state statutes stop the clock.  They don't suspend the period.

What is the -- the separation-of-powers rule that you would like us to adopt with respect to a purely jurisdiction-stripping statute?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, on that, suppose, following up on the initial questions, if all that 2(b) said was that an action relating to this land shall not be maintained in a federal court, would you say that is not a jurisdiction-stripping statute?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if one of the things that 2(b) does is to strip jurisdiction, and if ""shall not"" -- ""shall not be maintained"" is a jurisdiction-stripping provision, then I don't see how you can win unless you have a rule that applies to a jurisdiction-stripping statute.  Maybe there are other things in this statute that are vulnerable, so they could be severed. So, to go back to the question I asked, if this is a statute that takes away federal court jurisdiction, what is your separation-of-powers rule?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah, but when -- as succinctly as you can, Congress violates the separation of powers when it deprives the federal courts of jurisdiction in this circumstance.  And what is the circumstance?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But I -- I thought the Chief Justice's examples were instances in which a hypothetical statute deprived the federal court of the opportunity to rule on violations of -- on constitutional -- alleged constitutional violations, the same as the question that Justice Ginsburg gave to you, taking away jurisdiction over cases involving prayer in the schools or jurisdiction over equal protection violations, but this is a statutory case.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I mean, it sounds like this is just based on your -- your analysis of Congress's intent.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Let's take a case that we -- we had earlier this term under the Alien Tort Statute.  I don't know whether you're familiar with it.  But it provides jurisdiction in the federal courts for a suit by an alien concerning certain torts.  And we have the question whether a -- a corporation can be sued. Suppose Congress were to pass a statute that says that no federal court shall have jurisdiction of an Alien Tort Statute suit where the defendant is a corporation.  There are a limited number of cases involving that, pending cases.  Would that be unconstitutional?   ",16-498X

Alito, Jr.  As I understand your position -- and you'll correct me if I'm wrong -- you seem to be arguing that what the defendant is entitled to is an expert who will function, more or less, like the kind of expert who would be retained by the defense, if the defense were simply given funds to -- to hire an expert. Am I right in -- in thinking that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But I -- but in terms of what this expert would do, you'd want an expert who would function more or less like that.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Right.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah, well, that's what I'm --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- that's what I'm getting at.  I don't see how an expert who is chosen by the court and paid by the court can ever function in anything like that capacity for a defendant.  And one thing that is perfectly clear from the opinion in Ake, is that the court would pick the expert, and it's one -- the court will pick one expert and that's it; the defense has to live with it. And I just -- if you could explain how that kind of an expert can ever function like an expert retained by the defense.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It is different from a lawyer, because a lawyer -- you know, a lawyer doesn't have to believe in the client's innocence.  The lawyer has a professional duty, within the bounds of -- of professional responsibility, to do everything that can be done to advance the interests of the client.  But an expert who's going to write a report and is going to testify, presumably, if the person acts in good faith, is going to give an honest opinion.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Am I wrong?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So what would you say to this court-appointed -- you -- you get one expert that's appointed -- what do you say to this expert? Now, I don't really want you to give your neutral opinion.  I want to give you -- I want you to give your most defense-friendly opinion on this?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, no, I understand. That really wasn't my question.  I -- of course you could ask the expert, you know, give me the -- give me whatever is most favorable, give me advice that is most favorable to my client.  But when it comes down to giving an opinion about whether the individual is sane or -- or something that's relevant to mitigation, I don't see how you can ask the expert to do anything other than to give the expert's honest professional opinion. So it doesn't -- it's -- I'm having difficulty seeing how an expert who is appointed by the court -- you get one -- could ever function that way. And I -- I read the oral argument transcript in this case, and there are several places in the oral argument transcript when -- where the court and the attorney for Ake equates an -- an expert who is appointed by the court with a neutral expert.  And that seems to be what that kind of an expert would be, a neutral expert, not an expert who is really part of the defense team.   ",16-5294

Alito, Jr.  And you're not asking us to overrule Chevron.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  So why wouldn't this phrase, ""sexual abuse of a minor,"" be a phrase that is sufficiently ambiguous to justify Chevron?

And that was the point that Judge Sutton made in his dissent, and it has kind of a -- it's an appealing argument when you say it fast.  But the more I think of it, the less sense -- (Laughter.)

And if you look at all these State statutes and throw in all the Federal statutes that you can find that have some relation to this, what you have is a -- a big array of very disparate statutes. So this seems to me like a classic example of Congress saying, we have this category sexual abuse of a minor, and we know that there's all this array of State laws.  And so you, Attorney General, define what should be within this for immigration purposes.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is it your understanding anything other than -- if a stranger does anything to a minor other than commit a rape, then that would not be sexual abuse of a minor because the person wouldn't be a relative or an acquaintance?

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What concerns me about your position is that it seems to blast an enormous hole in the doctrine of procedural default.  Unlike Martinez and unlike Trevino, which were cabined, it -- it seems to me, and you'll correct me if I'm wrong, that if we agree with your position, then anything that -- that an attorney in Federal habeas can examine the trial record, and if that attorney finds anything that seems to be an error, it can be raised in Federal habeas, even if there was no objection at the time of trial, it wasn't raised on direct appeal, it wasn't raised in a State collateral proceeding.  That's where this is going. And if it's an -- if the underlying error is ineffective assistance of counsel, well, whatever it is, all of that will be evaluated by the Federal habeas court outside of AEDPA.  That's where this is going. So this is an enormous hole. Am I not -- isn't that where this -- isn't that what this means? Because the -- the argument in Federal habeas would be there was cause because counsel was ineffective at the collateral -- State collateral proceeding, and this counsel was ineffective at the State collateral proceeding because there was ineffective assistance on direct appeal.  And then counsel on direct appeal was ineffective because there was an error at trial. So the Federal habeas court has to make all of those determinations, and if the court -- the -- which means the court is going to have to look at whether or not there was an error at trial and, in doing that, it is not going to be asking whether a -- whether a State court reasonably rejected the claim because it was never presented to the State court.  So it's going to be de novo review.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, they'd have to find something that they can argue in the Federal habeas was an error, but procedural default would be out the window.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Right.  And the Federal habeas court is going to have to analyze that, which means the Federal habeas court is going to have to analyze all of these alleged trial errors that were never previously raised in the State court.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But Martinez concerned ineffective assistance of counsel in a limited number of States, and Trevino arguably extended it to a few additional States.  But if we accept your argument, it applies everywhere, and it's not limited to ineffective assistance of counsel.  It is -- it applies to every single -- every single type of error that could occur at trial.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah.  But the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel would be based on any type of error that occurred at trial. So here you have a jury instruction error. But if we agree with you, it would apply to the erroneous introduction of evidence, to the -- to improper statements made in closing, to any type of trial error, any type of constitutional trial error you can dream of.

Alito, Jr.  Well, this is -- assuming it's not jurisdictional, it is a mandatory claims processing rule.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And it -- it comes -- it follows from a version of the statute that did impose a hard time limit, did it not?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  And there's at least some question whether Congress really intended to eliminate that or whether it was done inadvertently or whether it was done on the assumption that a time limit in the rules would also be jurisdictional, as this Court had suggested in some earlier cases.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Is all of that -- is any of that untrue?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, given that this is a mandatory claims processing rule, and you said that you didn't think there was anything that would prevent the rules from altering doctrines like forfeiture and waiver, would it be within the discretion of a Court of Appeals to say that we are going to treat this rule, even though it's not jurisdictional, in some respects as if it were jurisdictional, so that, for example, we will sua sponte raise the question of timeliness under the rule?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, how is that consistent with your answer that you -- that that doctrine could be changed via a rule?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, if the doctrine could be changed by rule, could a court of appeals interpret the rule as changing the doctrine? After all, it is a mandatory claims-processing rule.  There has to be some teeth in the concept of mandatory.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, for whose -- for whose benefit do you think something like the 30-day rule was adopted? Solely for the benefit of the -- of the appellee?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Ah, well, if it's at least partly for the benefit of the court, then why is the court stuck with whatever the appellee does on the issue of forfeiture? If the appellee is asleep and this rule was supposed at least in part to protect the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, why can't the court of appeals put some teeth in this? Not by treating it as strictly jurisdictional, but as having -- putting a thumb certainly on the scale in -- in applying the doctrines that you're relying on.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  At what point in time do you think the issue was -- was waived?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So not before that? Nothing that occurred in the district court waived the --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  When was it -- when was it forfeited?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So it wasn't forfeited on the day when the district court entered the order.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It was -- because you -- the order didn't preclude the filing of the notice of appeal prior to the expiration of the time in the order.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So you -- so you think that the appellee had on pain of forfeiture, they had an obligation to inform the other side and the court just prior to the running out of the time, you know, you're going to run -- you're going to have a problem here under the rule if you don't file your notice of appeal right away?

Is it true that the director of the Administrative Office of the Courts can under some circumstances review a funding grant, and, if that is so, how can the funding grant be the exercise of judicial power?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I would think the most relevant language is the language of the statute, ""reasonably necessary."" And I really struggled with that, and also with the phrase ""substantial need."" But taking ""reasonably necessary,"" if it just said necessary, that would be a pretty tough standard. Would you accept the interpretation of reasonably necessary to mean that this is something that a reasonable attorney would think is necessary?   Samuel A.

You're -- what you're saying is that if we take a look at everything that the Fifth Circuit's been doing in this area in lots of cases that are not before us, it's not doing the right thing.

Alito, Jr.  You would assume that the state supreme court relied on the reasoning of the majority and not the reasoning of the concurrence.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And that -- and based on what? What would be the basis of that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What about the commonsense, well-known, well-used -- well-understood rule that a summary affirmance by an appellate court is not interpreted in this country as an adoption of the reasoning of the lower court?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, it said -- didn't it -- I mean, it said a lot.  I think it devoted about 30 pages to this. And I -- I suspect you think that some of the things that it said were wrong, but is it fair to say that in general it said, in fact, said over and over one of the reasons why we find no -- why -- why the judge found no prejudice is that taking into account all the evidence that it suggested is mitigating and all of the aggravating evidence -- and there was a lot of it here -- the addition of this mitigating evidence wouldn't change the outcome? Didn't the court say that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, it wasn't, all right, it wasn't presented at trial, but it was presented to the habeas court.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It wasn't mentioned.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But does that mean it wasn't considered? I mean, it does seem like --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is your answer to the argument that what you're asking the federal habeas court to do really is to grade the quality of the opinion that was written?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I mean, so what if the -- what the habeas court did was this? They said this is all the evidence that is -- is proffered in mitigation, and this is all the evidence that was provided by the state in aggravation, and taking into account all the -- all the mitigation and all the aggravation, we conclude that there's no reasonable probability that a jury would have returned anything other than a sentence of death? Now, would that be -- would that be unreasonable because there isn't a detailed explanation?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  That does sound like grading --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- so let me modify what I -- my hypothetical where there's no explanation, there's just a citation -- there's just a listing of mitigation and aggravation. There's a little bit of explanation.  There are three sentences of explanation or there's a half a page of explanation. At what point does it become, would you say, okay, well, that's enough, it's reasonable?   ",16-6855
1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Where is the question of -- of Georgia law that is implicated here? It would be one thing if it were generally understood in Georgia that a summary affirmance by the state supreme court does not necessarily adopt the reasoning of the lower court.  It would be another thing if it was the rule in Georgia or generally understood in Georgia that the opposite is true. So what do we do with that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Because there is no -- is there a specific rule in Georgia? Is there a well-known practice in Georgia?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do we --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- go that far in this case? I mean, this is not a case where anybody's arguing that the decision of the Georgia Supreme Court is a reasonable one based on some ground that was never raised by anybody below.  The -- the contours of the dispute here are very well known.  Deficient performance, which has largely dropped out, and the question of prejudice.  So it's all about whether there was prejudice under Strickland.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do we have to have a -- do we have to decide in this case what would be the situation where the issue, the ground for affirmance was never raised at all below or where the ground for affirmance that -- that is attributed to the state supreme court is different from the basic ground for affirmance that was addressed by the district court -- by the -- by the lower state court?

Alito, Jr.  The -- the -- the hypothetical would be like this case, or this case would be like the hypothetical.  If the requirement that the plan be established by the church was absolutely critical, as the requirement that the -- the individual have a disability is absolutely critical in the hypothetical, which gets to the question: What is the significance, in practical terms, of a plan's being established by a church? Now, Mr. Feldman says that an entity that establishes a plan is financially responsible for paying benefits under the plan if the plan is unable to do that with its assets.  But you say that's not correct; is that right?   Malcolm L. Stewart  That's not correct.  I mean, in -- in the typical ERISA case, you will have a plan established and maintained by a single employer, and that employer will be responsible for making good on the promises, and -- and that employer may be a defendant in a suit if the promises are breached.  But that doesn't mean that the entity that established as the plan qua ""establisher"" is always going to be on the hook. It -- it in --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can you -- can you tell me what provision of ERISA -- and I'll ask Mr. Feldman the same thing if I have the chance -- what provision of ERISA explains which entity, if any, is responsible for paying benefits if, for example, a defined benefit plan is unable to do that with the assets in the plan?   Malcolm L. Stewart  I -- I don't believe there is a provision of ERISA that spells that out.  My understanding -- and I'm -- I'm sorry, I don't have the statutory cite -- is that there is a provision of ERISA that authorizes the plan beneficiaries to sue, but it doesn't specify who the defendant should be.  And so the courts have devised tests and approaches to determine in particular cases who the proper defendant is.  And to some extent, that will depend upon the way the plan itself is constructed; that is, the plan may say that the responsibility for doing certain things is that of the employer, for doing other things, it may be that of the insurer.  And so the proper defendant may determine on where responsibility is allocated under the terms of the plan. And -- but so I agree that one big difference between this case and the hypotheticals is the -- the hypothetical is constructed in a way that suggests disability has to be crucial to entitlement to benefits, whereas here, there's no reason to think that Congress, in 1980, regarded church establishment as crucial to the exemption.

Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, I'm talking about --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- the literal language of (C)(i), and you're now talking about everything else. The literal language of (C)(i) says: A plan established and maintained by a church includes a plan that is maintained by a principal-purpose organization.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And it's as simple as that, that read literally, it is not required that it be established --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- by a church.  Now, you have other arguments, but --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, in the situation where the church establishes the plan and then turns over the maintenance of the plan to a principal-purpose organization, the audits would be the books of the principal-purpose organization.  There wouldn't be very much to look for in the records of the church. So if that's the -- if that was the purpose of it, I don't see what the establishment requirement --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.  Mr. Waxman, could I ask you about, because I want to understand where the -- the line is here. So let's imagine a case where the evidence of the actus reus is overwhelming, there's not a chance in the world that the defense is going to be able to convince a jury that the defendant did not commit the actus reus, but there's a plausible defense, maybe a pretty good defense, on mens rea. So -- but the client insists: I didn't do it, I did not commit the actus reus. Now, two ways of -- of approaching this on the part of the defendant -- defense attorney, and I want you to explain whether one is required or whether -- whether both are permissible or only one is permissible. One is for the attorney to concede in the opening, yes, he committed the actus reus, but there's a good mens rea defense, and develop that. I take it you would say that's not permissible?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But could the attorney open by saying: Now, they have to prove he committed certain acts but also that he had a certain mental state, and our defense here is going to be that he didn't have the requisite mental state, and everything that's done during the trial is directed toward that.  There's no attempt to put the government to its proof, to try to poke holes in the witnesses who are going to be called to establish the actus reus. Is the latter permitted?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

So I imagine that somebody in Mr. English's position would simply say: I'm not going to be part of this farce that you want to put on.  I'm just withdrawing. And Mr. McCoy would be -- would either have to come up with another attorney very quickly or go ahead without an attorney.  So I don't know --   Samuel A.

It's an extreme situation, and a -- and a difficult one -- but it -- it only occurred because of a number of prior steps, many of which I think are debatable. One, the -- the -- the decision that McCoy is competent to handle -- to stand trial. The second, the -- the judge's ruling, I understand the reason, that English couldn't withdraw.  The decision that there couldn't be a continuance so that McCoy could find another attorney, if he could find one who would put on his far-fetched alibi defense.  And McCoy's refusal to waive his right to counsel and represent himself. Now, if any of those had gone differently, the situation wouldn't have been presented.  So what about the issue of -- what about the issue of competence and allowing English to withdraw? If a -- if somebody like McCoy really sincerely believes that he did not commit these physical acts, but it was all done by -- as part of an elaborate conspiracy, is he -- is he capable of assisting in his own defense?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  If I could --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- just move on to the -- the other part of it.  So, if English says to the judge, look, Your Honor, I can't be part of -- and I don't want to be part of this farce, it -- and this farce that has the predictable result of sending this -- my client to a death sentence, I want to withdraw, why shouldn't the judge let him withdraw?

You -- you seem to be equating -- you seem to -- your argument seems to be that an error is plain unless it's harmless -- unless it is not harmless, isn't that right?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, what is left of it in this context? I mean, you cite three examples in your brief.  One is when the defendant has waived an objection to the guideline -- to the sentence in -- in a plea agreement.  The other is when the defendant has already completed the sentence, in which case I think the case would be -- would be moot. There would be no opportunity to get relief in a direct appeal.  And the other is when the -- the defendant is serving a concurrently running sentence. Do you have others?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Okay.  So, if there's any chance that the guideline error affected the sentence, then the error is plain? That's your argument?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Okay.  Now, if we were to apply that in other contexts, what would be left of the plain error rule in criminal cases?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Okay.  Error -- evidence is erroneously admitted at trial. It's hear -- it's hearsay and it's -- it's inadmissible hearsay.  It's admitted.  So there's an error.  But the reviewing court says that the -- the harmless error standard for non-constitutional errors is met.  But there is a chance that it had an effect on the -- on conviction. So why wouldn't that be a plain error?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But you're changing the standard.  You're changing the harmless error standard when you say that, aren't you?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, my inquiry is what is the difference between the plain error rule and the harmless error rule as you understand them? And you just told me, as I -- what I think you just told me was that the court would have to say it's uncontroverted, that this had no effect, otherwise it would be plain error?   Samuel A.

What the statute says is that you -- someone may not be removed from the list by reason of the person's failure to vote. It can't mean but-for cause because then it would run -- because the -- the statute itself takes failure to vote into account in (d).  That's one of the things that is necessary in order for someone to be removed from the list under (d).  So it can't be but-for. And in the HAVA, Congress used the term ""solely."" So why isn't the best interpretation of this that one cannot be removed from the list solely because of failure to vote?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And I'm looking at -- I'm listening --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And I'm missing -- I'm sorry.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, wasn't it -- wasn't it itself considered to be a ground for being removed? It wasn't necessarily -- these states didn't regard it necessarily as a proxy for anything else.  They just took the position that it was use it or lose it.  If you didn't vote for a certain period of time, that was grounds for taking your name off the eligibility list.   Noel J. Francisco  That's absolutely correct, and that's why it meant to address both of those issues, those states that had a use-it-or-lose-it mentality, you can never do that, and those states that used it to conclusively presume that some other basis for removal has been met. But here Ohio joins the initial failure to vote with the very process that Congress established for determining whether somebody has been removed from the voter rolls. And with respect to the notion that somehow 8(d)(1)(B) does not set forth a separate process apart from the 8(c) Postal Service process, it clearly does.  If you look at Section 8(d), there are two provisions. There's 8(d)(1)(A) which allows you to remove somebody if they've notified you that they've moved, clearly a standalone process. 8(d)(1)(B) is simply the corollary to that.  If you haven't notified us that you've moved, here is another process that states can use to make that determination.   ",16-980X

Alito, Jr.  But is that what Ohio does? Does it say the failure to vote is a ground for removal, or does it say that moving out of the district is a ground for removal, and failure to vote plays a part in the determination of whether a person has moved out of the district? It's evidentiary.  It's not the -- the ground for removal in and of itself.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah, I understand that.  My -- I wonder what your answer would be to this: Suppose the state statute said that if you have not voted for 20 years, then we're going to send out the notice.  Would you say that that violates this Act?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You think that if somebody hasn't voted for 20 years, that doesn't raise an inference that the person has moved or died?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  In and of itself, but, I mean, that isn't enough even to spark an inquiry by sending a -- a postcard saying if, in fact, you've just decided you didn't want to vote for 20 years, but you really want to keep your name on the list, and you're still in the district, send this back.  That would be illegal?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But if not getting the notice back tells you nothing, why did Congress make that part of the determination?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I mean, this is a very -- it's a very important subject.  It's a sensitive subject.  There are -- as a policy matter, there are strong arguments on both sides. Congress had struck a compromise. What we have before us is a question of statutory interpretation, not a question of what we think would be the ideal system for achieving the result of removing people who have moved from the voter lists. And you haven't said very much about the language of the statute.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  How do you get -- if ""by reason of a person's failure to vote"" is not but-for cause, how do you get around the language of (b)(2)?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But that actually isn't what (b)(2) says.  It does not say you can't use failure to vote as a reason for removing someone, except that you can do what is set out in --- in (c) and (d). What it says is that the principle that you can't use failure to vote as a reason for removing someone may not be construed to prohibit.  So the -- it -- it tells you how to interpret the first part of (b)(2).  It is not an exception to the first part of (b)(2).   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  It says -- it says that -- that it's all right if you followed either (c) or (d).  And what --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, it says -- you think you have to follow (c) and (d)?

It's not -- it's not solely, it's not proximate cause.  The only thing I can think of that's left is but-for.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What's the difference --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, in HAVA, Congress used the term ""solely."" Could you say something about -- about that provision of -- of HAVA? That says that states shall include provisions.  It's mandatory. To have a system of file maintenance that makes a reasonable effort to remove ineligible voters, and goes on to say, under this system, ""registrants who have not responded to a notice and who have not voted in two consecutive general elections for Federal office shall be removed from the official list of eligible voters."" By itself, that seems pretty clear. How do you get around that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Except -- but it -- it goes on to say: ""except that no registrant may be removed solely by reason of failure to vote.""   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Now, under Ohio's system, is someone removed solely because of failure to vote?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So the notices -- there's no requirement -- if somebody doesn't vote forever but returns that notice, the person would be removed from the list?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, I understand that, but I don't see how that -- how that's solely.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

1,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But I -- I think -- it seems to me your test, maybe I don't understand it, but it -- it seems to me potentially very broad and also quite vague. Now, the power to bind, an enormous number of executive branch officials have the power to bind the government in one way or another.  Would you disagree with that?   Anton Metlitsky  I don't disagree with the de facto power to bind, but I agree with Mr. Wall that the relevant question is whether the -- where the power has been vested, which is the import of our second precondition.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Okay.  So, I mean, anybody -- any attorney who tries a case on behalf of the government has the power to bind, makes decisions during the course of the trial that are not reviewed by anybody else, I won't call this witness, I won't ask this question. Okay.  So the power to -- the -- the -- the power to bind is enormous. Vested by what -- and you say it has to be in the name of that -- of the office. How do we find out whether it's in the name of the office?   Anton Metlitsky  Well, it's whether the person -- so take your example, an AUSA at a trial makes a binding concession or an Assistant to the Solicitor General makes a binding concession in this Court. The reason that person doesn't have to be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate is because he is exercising the authority of the Office of the Solicitor General or of the U.S. Attorney. He's acting in the name of that office.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Okay.  Let's take an Assistant Attorney General.  I assume that that person is an officer of the United States, right?   Anton Metlitsky  An Assistant Attorney General, yes.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah, and so, if the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division or the Antitrust Division does something, is -- is that person exercising the authority of the Civil Division or the Antitrust Division or the authority of the Department of Justice?   Anton Metlitsky  It's the -- well, if he's exercising authority that has been delegating -- delegated to him, he's exercising the power of his own office.  The -- the reason you know, for example, that precise example, the head of the, say, Civil Division is at the top of the brief. So, when the government makes a decision, a litigation decision, which is a decision that binds the government, the person at the top of the brief is always the responsible officer.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But is that what it turns on, whether -- who's listed at the top of the brief? Do -- do we look at a statute to find out whether it's vested in the office? Do we look at a regulation? Do we look at practice?   Anton Metlitsky  So it -- it doesn't turn on who's at the top of the brief, but who's at the top of the brief derives from the existing legal authority. In the Justice Department, I think it's entirely -- almost all of the authority is delegated from the Attorney General. So one statute vests all of the powers in the Justice Department to the Attorney General, another statute allows the Attorney General to delegate those powers, and so he'll delegate --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But if it's -- if it's a question of -- so the -- an Assistant Attorney General is an officer because that -- certain powers are delegated by the Attorney General?   Anton Metlitsky  Right.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And the U.S. Attorney, the same thing, right?   Anton Metlitsky  I think the U.S. Attorney might have statutory authorities too, but --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, suppose then the -- the U.S. attorney or -- or the head of one of the litigating divisions delegates certain authorities to somebody within that office. Does that make that person a -- a -- an officer?   Anton Metlitsky  No, because the --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why?   Anton Metlitsky  Because the authority rests with the -- the U.S. Attorney.  That's -- that's the relevant office.  The U.S. Attorney can delegate de facto authority, but the U.S. attorney is always going to be held accountable for every decision. So, I mean, that happens as a matter of fact in U.S. Attorneys offices.  As you said, the assistants -- Assistant United States Attorneys have a tremendous amount of discretion.  But everybody understands that when they exercise that discretion, the person that's going to be held accountable for -- for that -- for the exercise of that discretion is the U.S. Attorney, which means that it doesn't -- since the U.S. Attorney is already 100 percent accountable for the decision, it doesn't matter who appointed the assistant. You don't have to hold the U.S. Attorney or anybody else accountable for the appointment.   ",17-130X

And if we abandon anything like Marks, perhaps it requires -- it certainly could benefit from some clarification and maybe some refinement -- but if we abandon it completely, it could have pretty profound changes.  Why should we do that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, you know, Professor -- Professor Re wrote an interesting amicus brief in this case arguing that the logical subset approach is illogical.  And I think there might be something to that.  Let me give you this example. Let's say that nine people are deciding which movie to go and see, and four of them want to see a romantic comedy, and two of them want to see a romantic comedy in French, and four of them want to see a mystery. Now is the -- are the -- are the two who want to see the romantic comedy in French, is that a logical subset of those who want to see a romantic comedy?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, suppose we know nothing more than that.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I mean, if that's a logical subset, I think there's a serious problem with the argument because the four who want to see a romantic comedy might think: I don't want to see anything in a foreign language, particularly in French.  I'd rather go see a mystery or something else.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, can I just ask you this quick question?

What happens in that situation?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So that's never a precedent unless one of the two -- and both of these groups feel very strongly that the other is wrong in identifying the constitutional provision.  So one of them has to give way or else this issue is never going to be resolved?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So the lower courts would then be free to deny relief in -- in all these cases?   ",17-155X

Suppose -- obviously, there is no love lost between your client and the City of Riviera Beach, but, so suppose he comes back to another meeting and he is disruptive and he's arrested.  Will he not be able to file a suit for retaliation and get to the jury on that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do you really think a suit like that could be dismissed under Twombly?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I -- I need some help with what you've said about qualified immunity because I -- I legitimately don't understand it. I -- I don't think there's ever a situation in which a reasonable officer could think that it is lawful to retaliate based on the exercise of First Amendment rights.  So, if there is in a case a genuine issue about the officer's motivation, I don't see how the officer will ever be able to get dismissal based on qualified immunity.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. Rosenkranz, let me -- this is what troubles me.  It would be good if Congress enacted legislation that modernized this, but in the interim, something has to be done. So what happens in this situation? I mean, there's an American citizen who's being investigated for crimes committed in the United States.  The government shows probable cause that there is evidence of this crime in e-mails that are in the possession of an American Internet service provider.  And there they have an urgent need for the information. But the provider has chosen to store the data overseas and, in fact, in some instances, has actually broken it up into shards so that it's stored not just in one foreign country but in a number of foreign countries. Now what -- what happens in that situation? There is no way in which the information can be obtained except by pursuing MLATs against multiple countries, a process that could -- that will take many months, maybe years? What happens?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, we were told that that's what Gmail does.  That's not correct?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  Well, all right.  The service provider has chosen to store it overseas.  There's no way to get the information, other than through these -- these very time-consuming MLAT procedures?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And what could -- and what could you do about it?

Alito, Jr.  Well, if this person is not Irish and Ireland played no part in your decision to store the information there and there's nothing that Ireland could do about it if you chose tomorrow to move it someplace else, it is a little difficult for me to see what Ireland's interest is in this.   Samuel A.

And I -- I don't know whether I agree with their argument or not, but I don't think that's the -- that's the argument. The argument is basically this: You've got a statute of limitations.  The courts have to follow it, like it or not.  Now how does a court justify allowing somebody to file a claim after the statute of limitations has run? And the theory, they say, is that there was this old doctrine of equitable tolling, and when Congress enacted the statute of limitations, it did so with the understanding that it would be subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling. So, in order to allow the -- the case -- the claim to be filed after the statute of limitations has run, it has to fit within the doctrine of equitable tolling.  And equitable tolling requires diligence and extraordinary circumstances. So you have to show that those are present in the case where a new class action is filed after the -- the expiration of the statute of limitations. If -- if, you know -- if you proceed from the assumption that their -- they -- that all of the members of the class had claims that were equitably tolled for all purposes, then, of course, your argument is a good one, but they don't proceed on the basis of that.

And I'm sure that you have probably researched this more thoroughly, but the best I could come up with was that it was taken from old Rule 41(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. So, if that's the case, should we look to the way that rule was applied?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I mean, if you -- do you think that if this situation had been presented to the Congress that enacted the -- the 1968 legislation, which was basically anti-crime legislation, that they would have said, yes, in this case, Mr. Dahda can't be convicted even though what happened here had no effect whatsoever on him?

It's some kind of a -- there's some requirements that have to be in the warrant, and whether or not they had any effect whatsoever, the statute says that there has to be suppression. But when you have that kind of a rule that is purely a formal rule, would you not expect to find in the statute a very clear specification of the things that have to be in the warrant, a very clear checklist, so that somebody can be certain that all of those steps are -- are covered, even if they have no effect?

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I don't quite understand in practical terms -- excuse me -- what that would mean.  So what if the court goes through each of the 3553(a) factors and says, well, you know, as to (A), it's a serious offense and it's serious enough to warrant a sentence of 114 months, and we need to have adequate deterrence, and I think 114 months is the amount that you need for adequate deterrence and so forth? Would that be enough?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why would this preclude appellate review? Isn't it pretty obvious what -- or couldn't the court of appeals infer that what the district court did was this: The district court originally thought 135 months was the right sentence -- that was the original sentence, right, 135?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  All right.  And so the district court thought: Well, the -- the range was lowered, and so I'm going to go down to 114, but taking into account the sentencing factors, I don't think it should go below 114. And I think that's the -- I don't know that you need to spell all that out. And if -- if that's what the court said, would that be sufficient? And, if that would be sufficient, why can't there be appellate review, just as -- based on what was done here?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, why doesn't it tie it to the 3553(a) factors? There's nothing -- there isn't an algorithm that tells you how to put those factors together or to quantify each one.  It's the judge takes into account the various factors, the seriousness of the offense, deterrence and so forth, and says this is the right number.   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What would be the minimum that would suffice here?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, you're asking us to impose a standard.  And -- and you could -- I -- I think it's entirely fair to ask you what would be the minimum that would be required. So you gave me an answer.  The judge would -- if the judge made reference to methamphetamine trafficking, that would be enough?   ",17-5639

What if the district judge says I don't care if the guidelines are subsequently lowered; this is the sentence I'm imposing?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, they're not -- they're not mandatory any longer.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah, so we are after Booker.  So that's what the judge says.  Then what?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You'd have a difficult case if the judge says, I disagree with the guidelines, I'm basing my sentence on the Sentencing Reform Act.  It is not based -- my sentence is not in any way based on the guidelines.  You'd have -- you would have just a difficult case in saying that that's not --   Samuel A.

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Do you think we lack jurisdiction if the order doesn't contain the word ""injunction"" or ""order"" but has the practical effect of doing that?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, as to the district -- as to the congressional districts that are at issue here to start, did the district court simply rubber-stamp what had been presented to it, or did it engage in a pretty thorough, thoughtful analysis of the legality of those districts?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why don't you talk about one of the districts.  Why don't we talk about Congressional District 35 and some of the points that the district court made when it initially analyzed this. Is it not true that this -- this -- the concept of this district was recommended by the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund and supported by the Latino Redistricting Task Force?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But they recommended this as one of the alternatives, right?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Linking -- linking San Antonio and -- and Austin, and they said there was a community of interest.  And the district court said that in its initial opinion, did it not?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I thought there was evidence that there was racially polarized voting in the district as a whole.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You offered evidence about Travis County.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  At the time it acted, it had the district court's opinion, did it not?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah. Isn't what we're looking at?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, has there -- has there ever been appellate review of the district court's determination -- findings as to the 2011 plan? Do you -- do you think that we should just accept those findings as givens? If you're going to place a lot of weight on them, would we not have to review those?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, we can ask General Keller that on rebuttal, but I didn't understand them to say that we agree that all of the findings that were made as to the 2011 plan were correct, and we don't wish to -- we -- we -- we accept them all.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  But what is your evidence that the state adopted the plan previously approved by the court for an invidious reason?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  The advice -- the advice of what? That it was preliminary? The original opinion was preliminary?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, this would be very important going forward.  You want us to hold that a -- a state can satisfy its Voting Rights Act obligations by creating a district where there is a mathematical majority, but that district would not perform for the election of the minority preferred candidate? Do you want us to hold that?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  I thought that's what you were just saying.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah, and did the district court find that? I thought the district court did not find that you can create two performing districts in Nueces County.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Yeah, and to --   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- and to establish liability, is it not necessary to show that you could create another performing district?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  And did the district court find that you could do that, and is it not true that one of the plaintiffs' experts found that one of these districts, if you split Nueces County in half, would not perform one time in 35 elections and the other one -- in the other, it would perform seven times in 35 elections?

0,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, Congress did -- Congress did act.  It enacted 1182(f).   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Why doesn't this fall squarely within the language of 1182(f)?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, maybe you could talk about the text.  It's not a class? Doesn't 11 -- doesn't 1182(f) say whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- or any class of aliens.  So put class aside, although I don't really see why people who are nationals of a particular country don't constitute a class. What about any aliens?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Well, does this proclamation do anything like that? Does this proclamation purport to establish a new permanent immigration policy for the United States?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  What is your basis for saying that it is perpetual?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Can -- can you imagine any situation in which the threat of the infiltration of the United States by terrorists was so severe with respect to a particular country that the other measures that you have mentioned could be deemed by a President to be inadequate?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  You cannot imagine any such situation?   INTERRUPTING Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  Mr. Katyal, would any reasonable observer reading this proclamation, with -- without taking into account statements, think that this was a Muslim ban? I mean, there are -- I think there are 50 predominantly Muslim countries in the world. Five -- five countries -- five predominantly Muslim countries are on this list. The population of the -- of the predominantly Muslim countries on this list make up about 8 percent of the world's Muslim population.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  If you looked at the 10 countries with the most Muslims, exactly one --   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  -- Iran, would be on that list of the top 10.   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  So would a reasonable observer think this was a Muslim ban?   Samuel A. Alito, Jr.  No, I -- I understand that.  And it is one of our fundamental values that there is religious freedom here for everybody in that, number -- adherence to every religion are entitled to equal treatment. My only point is that if you look at what was done, it does not look at all like a Muslim ban.  There are other justifications that jump out as to why these particular countries were put on -- on the list. So you -- it seems to me the list creates a strong inference that this was not done for that invidious purpose.   ",17-965X
