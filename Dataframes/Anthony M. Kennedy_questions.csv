0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I...  I think the same thing that's bothering Justice Scalia, or that prompted his question in any event, is...  is troubling me.  When I...  I read the briefs, I...  I thought that the coerced loan approach, which you object to, did have certain deficiencies, because you had to have testimony what the interest rate is, you have to conform it to the particular transaction, it's hard to administer.  I frankly don't see how yours is much different because you add a premium to the prime rate.  What is that premium going to be?  Why shouldn't it depend on the transaction?  Why shouldn't it depend on the risk of default?  Why doesn't your approach have all of the same problems as the coerced loan approach?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but if that was true, you could bring up the same thing when you're cross-examining the expert on the coerced loan approach and say, well, we don't want 21 percent because there's a wage assignment.  It's the same answer.   Anthony M. Kennedy  So you think a lender has two different loan candidates in front of him, one he thinks is going to go through bankruptcy and the other he thinks is not, so he's going to give the loan to the first one?   Anthony M. Kennedy  That's...  that's very difficult for me to assume.   Anthony M. Kennedy  So, but you're saying...  but you're saying that under the respondent's view, that...  that the creditors would be treated differently?   ",02-1016
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, can you tell me why is it that the petitioners tell us that their standard is so much easier to administer?  Is it because the courts aren't administering it in the right way?  As I listened to it, it seems to me I have two choices.  I can begin with a low rate and add or I can begin with a high rate and...  and subtract.  Why...  why is one any more easy to administer than...  than the other?   Anthony M. Kennedy  In fact, it...  it would seem to me...  and this I suppose helps you...  that if the courts which are using the petitioners' formula are doing it the right way, it might even be harder to administer.  They...  they avoid that problem by just accepting some interest factor of 1 to 3 percent out of the blue although I don't know how they do that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I...  I don't think it's certainly conclusive of the point, but the initial 21 percent rate, I take it, did take into account the risk of default.  So in a sense, the creditor has received up front some compensation for the risk that in fact has occurred.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but...  but overall, you account for that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  The...  the Bankruptcy Code, I take it, has solicitude for debtors.  Isn't that one of its purposes?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Or does that just drop out when we come to the cramdown problem?

The Illinois Supreme Court said, oh, if we allow this, we're going to have roadblocks every other...  every day, every other street and in part that's hyperbole, but on the other hand, it does caution us that there should be some limiting principle and I just don't know if our precedents would support us in adopting your word, oh, if it's used judiciously.   Anthony M.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  I suppose you could also say it's a question of resources.  The Government does not want to have to put on witnesses, get officers up from the border, have them sit in court, go through the motion to suppress, so that you have a very real interest simply in expediting trial procedures by taking the course you did.  I don't know if that helps you on this article 3 problem or--   Anthony M. Kennedy  On the 25 percent figure, you say 25 percent of all seizures from vehicles?

Anthony M. Kennedy  If 85 percent of the people with the gas tanks that were searched have the contraband, what you're asking us to do is to protect the expectation of the other 15 percent.  I... I suppose that's the rule, but it... when the percentages get these high, it... it seems to me to put the exclusionary rule somewhat into question with reference to the border.  Suppose it was 95 percent.  Do we still have to protect the 5 percent of the people?  I mean, I guess that's the law.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

Once... once the homeowner finds that the police have the authority to enter, then don't the cases teach us that the purpose of the warrant is to control the discretion of the officer, not the knowledge of the homeowner, and incidentally, I think you might be able to read Rule 41 as saying that when an officer leaves he has to give a copy of the warrant whether he takes anything or not.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, do we take... do we take the case on the assumption that the trial court erred in not giving a curative instruction and in saying, well, this is a matter for the attorneys to argue?  You... you don't argue about what a statute means.  That's a question of law.  You don't argue that.  You can argue the facts, that it's mitigating or not mitigating or that it's extenuating or not extenuating, which is I think how you can interpret a lot of this.  But it... it seems to me that the trial judge does make a mistake when he says, well, well, this is for the... this is for them to argue when the... the point of the objection was that there was a misinterpretation of the instruction.  That's a legal point.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I... I can see that a... a prosecutor could say, you know, this isn't factor (k) evidence, as a way of saying that this evidence is of little weight.  He did say at... at one... at one time, you have not heard any legal evidence of mitigation, and... and that... that's the troublesome part.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but just on that point, if the prosecutor makes a misstatement, doesn't the trial judge have an obligation to correct it if it's significant?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Or am I wrong?  Or am I wrong about that?  The judge just kind of watches the ship sail over the waterfall?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Did the judge instruct the jury that you are to consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Oh, are you taking the position that as a matter of California procedure, the jury was entitled to consider matters that... matter that was not within (a) through (k)?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Have the California courts said that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Have the California courts said that (a) through (k) are... is not intended to be exhaustive at the pre-Payton... pardon me.  Yes.  Have they said that pre-Payton?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I... I thought the case was being argued to us... correct me if I'm wrong... on... on the theory that this was factor (k) evidence.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Could you help me on that?  I thought it was two steps.  I thought the question is whether there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury was misled, and then you have to ask whether it was unreasonable for the State supreme court to conclude that there was that reasonable likelihood.  Or correct me if I'm wrong.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But you can't overturn it on habeas unless there's a reasonable likelihood.   INTERRUPTING ",03-1039
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Has factor (k) been supplemented with a CALJIC instruction since Payton?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Excuse me.  Do they still call it factor (k) or do they just have a supplemental instruction that follows factor (k)?   Anthony M. Kennedy  And what was the question?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, an equal inference is they just felt that it was entitled to no weight at all given the horrific nature of this... of this crime.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And you have to show there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury might have come to an opposite conclusion.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, on... on that point... and I... I recognize it's... it's not nearly as clean as the hypothetical you present... he did say... this is the prosecutor.  The law in its simplicity is that if the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors, the sentence should be death, and so let's just line these up, and then he talks about the... the conversion.  So there were other parts of his argument that indicated by one interpretation this is not mitigating under special (k)... under factor (k).  But here he does say that you line that up and you weigh one against the other.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, they... they always have to say whether or not we're going to really weigh this or is it just too tangential, and that's one way of saying, well, this really isn't mitigating.  And we know as lawyers that it is mitigating in a sense that is... that is relevant and that it's there for the jury to give it the weight that it chooses.  But jurors say, well, you know, this... this just is not important is what they're saying.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, it's a shorthand for saying it doesn't fall under (k) because it just is of so little weight.  Now, that's I think how the jury might have interpreted it.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I... I see where you're going, and I... I see that there's some parallel.  The problem in Penry was that the jury... the jurors had to actually violate their instructions, and you have to escalate your argument a bit before you get to that point.   ",03-1039
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, under your view, could the three-tier system, itself, be challenged by a New Jersey wholesaler wanting to sell in New York, or a New York wholesaler wanting to sell in New Jersey?   Anthony M. Kennedy  So, under your view, the whole three-tier system has to go down?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, under my hypothetical.  I don't know exactly how... the way it works, you have to be a New York wholesaler to sell to a New York retailer.  Under your view, a New Jersey wholesaler could sell to a New York retailer.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But so far as... the rationale is the same.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It seems to me that, under your rationale, that that in-state licensing system has to fall if there's a New Jersey wholesaler.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, it's not only temperance, but it's control over revenues.  Can you tell me, is the... is there a New York State excise tax on alcohol?   Anthony M. Kennedy  And is it collected by the wholesaler?   Anthony M. Kennedy  All right.  What is it, ten dollars a gallon, or what?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Is it on one--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --It is on one--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --Under our cases, can the California winery be required to remit the tax to the New York State revenue authorities?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Is that consistent with Quill?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But does the federal authority make a routine audit to see that the state tax has been paid?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but I think what's fairly implied in Justice O'Connor's question, you have to look at the language of Bacchus, and the language of Bacchus, in effect, restored the anti-discrimination component of the Commerce Clause to liquor control.  I think that's a fair and necessary reading of the case.  Now--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --And I know it--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --involved pineapple wine and all that.  I know that, but--  [Laughter]  --what we're talking about is the language of the Court in that case.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, then you have to understand Young in the light of its context, where there was no discrimination--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --Well, let me ask, once we accept the proposition... I think this is the necessary reading of Bacchus... that the Commerce Clause applies to liquor and prevents discrimination, it seems to me it's just like any other commodity... food, milk, et cetera... and, in this case, you have a very substantial burden to show that this discriminatory treatment is justified... maybe strict scrutiny, maybe heightened scrutiny.  And this trial has occurred.  You have had that opportunity.  I don't see why you have a right to go back.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you think--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --that Michigan can prohibit the importation of any wine, but still allow its own wine to be produced, sold, and consumed?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, you--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --you say further than that; you say the purpose was to allow that the states discriminate in favor of home industry, if it chooses.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, we've also said that mere protectionism is permitted.   ",03-1116
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, it's very narrow, but the rationale is sweeping, and that's why I asked.  I just don't know if the in-state licensure system, which is the cornerstone of the three-tier distribution system, can survive under your rationale, assuming the hypothetical where a New Jersey wholesaler has all of the... you know, the physical facilities and so forth that the New York wholesaler does.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I know, but what--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --but you're... all you're asking is for a rationale that's sweeping.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --well, they do today, I'm sure, but--  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Ms. Sullivan--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --may I... may I... I just want to clarify one point.  It was just... the question Justice Stevens asked.  It's your position that if Michigan allows Michigan wines to be sold and possessed and consumed, that it must also allow out-of-state wine to be sold, possessed, and consumed.  Would--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --That is your--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --Commerce Clause, in effect, protects consumers in states from entrenched business interests that want to have protectionism, and you're... you object to that and invoke the Commerce Clause to do it.  Under that rationale, aren't all the California reciprocity laws invalid, as well?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you... do you take the position that your colleague on your same side takes, that a state can permit only the sale, consumption, and... of its own wines, and bar all out-of-state wines?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --just for local protectionism.   Anthony M. Kennedy  It's just for local protectionism.  We want to promote our wines, and not anybody else's.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I'm trying to understand what your--  --what your theory is.  And so you are in agreement with your colleague that this could be done, if New York chose.  You can only drink New-York-grown wines in... sell and consume... in the state of New York.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But it also goes to the very core of the Commerce Clause.  And there are really two classifications of dormant Commerce Clause cases.  One is... and I think it's an improper use of the term ""dormant clause""... is where there's discrimination.  Only the Congress can allow discrimination against out-of-state products.  That's one whole classification.  And that's what's... and that's what's involved here.   INTERRUPTING ",03-1116

""  That isn't accurate.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And you're having us save the statute by just putting a label on it that isn't accurate.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It would be... in the union cases, it's hard enough.  It's a... the good-of-the-order exception is the way it works in the union.  And in the bar thing, I think it would be hard to--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --This is a question perhaps more for the Respondent than for you, but I would like your comment on it.  Suppose the statute were changed and there was a dollar-a-head assessment on beef, and it just went into the general funds of the United States Treasury, and then they used part of that money... they had more money for beef advertising, and the government did the advertising.  What would the Respondents say about that?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But why can't--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --why can't you just do that?

INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But we have just pointed out that it... that it... it prohibits lawful, harmless, truthful speech.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Now, let... let me ask you about that.  Let's... let's assume, for the moment, that a majority of the Court would find that some of these provisions are overly broad.  Is there any authority that tells us what to do next?  This is not like a statute where we have to save the statute.  Do we have any obligation to save the injunction?  Send it back and let it be done.  Let it be done all over again.  I mean, why... why should we rewrite it up here?  Do you have any authority that requires us or permits us to do that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, if... if that's so, then maybe Mr. Chemerinsky is right.  We... we shouldn't have injunctions.  If you're saying that injunctions can't be narrowly tailored, it seems to me that you're playing right into the argument that the petitioner is making.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I'm... I'm baffled by that.  What you're saying is that the injunction... we're just all wasting our time?  The injunction doesn't mean anything?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I...

Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, you know, in the First Amendment speech area, we're very, very strict.  A moment's delay in publication is a constitutional crisis.  And I'm not sure that we should carry that over to this area, where there is this obsessive concern with any mention of religion.  That seems to me to show a hostility to religion.  I just don't see a balanced dialogue in our cases or in these kinds of arguments.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  This is a classic avert your eyes.  If an atheist walked by, he can avert his eyes, he can think about something else.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, suppose a non Christian, say a Muslim, comes before a judge who has very strong Christian beliefs, a very religious person.  Does he feel like an outsider?  And to require that we pretend that there is no religious motivation, no deep religious conviction on the part of many of our public officials seems to me to be a hostility toward religion.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I think you're telling us the State cannot accommodate religion.  The only way they can do it is to put the Ten Commandments up and insist that it's always secular, whether it's predominantly for a secular purpose.  It seems to me that's hypocritical and it's asking religious people to surrender their beliefs and that is not accommodation.   Anthony M.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  So in another case, if a government official feels that the Ten Commandments have been very, very important in his or her life as a spiritual or religious matter and wants other people to know how important the Ten Commandments are, he cannot accept on behalf of the city the Ten Commandments. And so you can have no Ten Commandments in city A with the Ten Commandments in city B.  General, that doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

Kennedy  I'm asking you about the tax consequences.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but I... I thought under your view the moment the client gets the check for the full amount, one-third of it is taxable to the attorney.  And I have some problems, incidentally, with respect to tax years if it... if you... if the client receives the check December 30 and is on vacation and doesn't get around to remitting to the attorney until January 5th, I'm...

And if the Court finds that these are so much like an element that they have to be proved, and adheres to its jurisprudence and invalidates the Guidelines to that effect, is there any argument that either the Government makes or that some of the commentators would make, that there are other kinds of sentencing considerations that can be called factual, to be sure, but that should be from the judge: say, lack of remorse as demonstrated after the verdict; the fact that after the verdict, investigation shows that of the two defendants, one was the real ringleader, streetwise, the other was kind of a naive dupe; or that there was a failure to cooperate with the person presenting the... preparing the sentencing report.

Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but... but I take it the State has no duty to adduce mitigating factors.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, you began by saying that there's three different measures, I think... I think was the word you used.  And the State, I take it, must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, (a) that it was an aggravated... or, (a) that it was an aggravated murder, (b) that there was another crime involved--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

If you want to give us this visual metaphor of a scale, or a football field, where you move it beyond the 50 yardline, whatever visual metaphor you want, and you weigh, you balance where the scales of justice balances, it seems to me that that's a stronger case than saying the jurors can establish their aggravation, then they can take any mitigating factor they want, for any reason, and apply it.  And they can't do that, because the defendant hasn't shown it.  It seems to me that that's... that that's a weaker argument than if you had this balancing mechanism that was our controlling metaphor.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I... I suppose that in a purely discretionary system... I... I can't quite think of the hypothetical... the strength of the prosecution's case may bear on the assessment of relevance and materiality as to the evidence the defense wants to introduce.  If... if the evidence of identification is... is quite clear... is quite clear... and then there's some witness of marginal credibility that says he was in another city, I think that may affect the trial court's balance.  I... I take the thrust of your point, that the strength of the case makes it more important to introduce the third party evidence, not... not less.  I... I take that point.  But just as... as an absolute rule, I'm not sure that the strength of the case is always irrelevant.  That's what I'm saying.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I'm... I'm just not sure that's the case.  We're asking about 403.  In order to completely exclude and prescind, in Justice Scalia's word, that the... the nature of the prosecution's case just doesn't seem to me right.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Now... now, if you want to say there's a more wooden rule and a... and a more iron rule here that was prejudicial, I think that's something else.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I... I guess my... my point... maybe it's some of my colleagues' point... is that really the strength of the government's case is subsumed within the general calculus of whether or not this would cause a delay of... of time, whether it would get into extraneous issues, et cetera.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It's a way of phrasing it.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But quite apart from that, it seems to me that the statement is questionable as an empirical matter.  Why is it that forensic evidence somehow should be used to exclude third party guilt evidence as... as a universal proposition?  Maybe in some cases yes, maybe in some... but this is a universal proposition.     It reads certainly like a universal proposition, but I think it is merely an application of what happened in State v. Gregory and State v. Gay when they were presented at that time in those situations with what they determined to be strong evidence of forensic guilt--   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, if I were the trial court, in a subsequent case in South Carolina, I would... I would have to read this instruction of the South Carolina Supreme Court as saying I simply could not admit this evidence when there's forensic evidence.  And that's a very strange proposition.     --I would agree that would be a strange proposition because it suggests that they would ignore the merits of... of the proffered evidence itself.  And I don't think that's what happened in this case, and I don't think that's what the South Carolina Supreme Court--   ",04-1327

Kennedy  --The first part of the analysis is whether or not he initiates.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And you're trying to tell us that the initiation can be involuntarily?  I just don't... I just don't agree with that.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I mean, you have to concede--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --I think we can--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --I think that's a given.  The question is whether or not he agrees... he indicates affirmatively that he wants to begin talking.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That's--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --the issue, it seems to me.   Anthony M. Kennedy  In fact, there was a finding that Johns' testimony was credible.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I'm not so sure, because a voluntary waiver is measured against a Miranda warning.  And, by definition here, you don't have a Miranda warning, because we're asking about ""whether initiation"".  So, it seems to me there's a threshold inquiry of voluntariness to determine whether or not there was a voluntary initiation, and that that... it does not comprehend or require a Miranda warning.  Otherwise, you're double counting.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I agree with that.  But I want... what I think the Court is trying to find is some explanation of the threshold test for determining whether or not there was a voluntary initiation.  Now, I think we agree... or at least I agree... that there shouldn't be any Miranda warnings required.  That doesn't go into the mix.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Any new Miranda warning.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.   INTERRUPTING ",04-373X

""  ""He thought he was going to get the death penalty. ""  ""He knew the other man was turning on him to implicate him in the murder. ""  ""His agony was increasing. ""  I mean, I... it seems to me the question is whether or not the curative measures were adequate.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Of course, you know, we can play the game... 5 minutes, 20 minutes--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --30 minutes.  We know that.  But, it seems to me, when 30 minutes passed here, there were curative measures.  Now, you say, at the outset, there can never be a... curative measures.  That... I don't think you have anything to... any support for that in the case law.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Suppose--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --suppose, again, we do not accept that position.  You need another fallback position in our... in order to argue the case before us.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, Johns--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --Johns, in effect, did that here.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Certainly, one of the best curative devices is immediate correction from a superior.  And that is exactly what happened here.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So, you think you'd have a stronger case if Johns hadn't corrected Reese?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That's--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --But--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --that's a--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --far stretch.  It's--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --The right direction would be to say, ""Please don't talk to us"".   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And what the Chief Justice says was true in Bradshaw and in Edwards and in Elstad.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  All questions, which were mixed questions of law and fact, where this Court took the words, took the facts, and made a rule.  And that's this case.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Can you tell us--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --where you're reading from?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

Kennedy  And that's what we're reviewing here.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But there is no finding to support the suggestion that it was just the death penalty that concerned him.  He was also concerned, I thought, about the fact that his accomplice, Tolbert, had implicated him, and--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --presumably implicated him--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --too far.  So is--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --There's just no finding that it was simply the death penalty that--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --And--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well--   Anthony M.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --I suppose the public might have an interest in knowing about this debate.  I don't know if you can say there's no public interest served.  It might be that there are other counterbalancing first... interests, but I don't think you could say we have no interest in speech.  This was... this is a... on its face, a rather interesting... a rather interesting argument that they're... that they're having.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  They're interested in criminal law, criminal procedure, et cetera, et cetera.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, that... yes, that's something different.  But your statement, that there's just no first amendment interest--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --Well, no, that's not--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --that's not... that's not the hypothetical.  So, suppose that a supervising district attorney tells the deputy district attorney,  ""Go in and make a misrepresentation to the court, or conceal evidence. ""  or whatever--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --and he refuses to do that, or he goes in and he says the opposite, he tells the truth, and he's fired.  What result?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Oh, so--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --so you're saying that there's an exception to your rule, so that if, in this case, he has a... he has a defense if he said,  ""Well, it's my duty to call it as I see it? ""   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Then--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --Well, then, if that's so, you ought to remand this case.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And... and I suppose, in this case, in the hypothetical we propose, that the California courts and the California bar would have disciplinary mechanisms against the senior attorney who hypothetically told the junior attorney to mislead.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Does California have, or have not, disciplinary procedures in the hypothetical case where a senior attorney who tells a junior attorney lie to the court--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --All right.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Pickering balancing, I take it.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And you concede that's Pickering balancing, anyway.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And--   Edwin S.

Kneedler  --Yes, there would be... there would be those sorts of restrictions.  My only point is that the first amendment is not addressed to speech or writing that an employee undertakes in the... in the... in the course of his official duties.  This--   Anthony M. Kennedy  I suppose you have the rule which distinguishes between employment related and outside speech, under the hypothetical... difficult hypothetical posed by the Chief Justice, it would be an... the promise would be an unconstitutional condition, or something like that.

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, their... the interest they claim that of supervising their employees.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I mean, that's the interest that we're concerned with, is of having the Government have the capacity to be able to control the speech of its employees so they could have a consistent policy and so that it can explain to the people what it's doing.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But you're the one that's asking us to adopt a rule.  And I'm suggesting to you that there is an interest that's sacrificed by the rule that you request, and that is the Government's interest in regularity and consistency of its speech.  They don't have to claim it on a case by case basis.  You're the ones that are asking us to make this rule.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Are you saying--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --Are you... are you saying the California courts would tolerate a situation where a member of the bar told one of his employees to misrepresent to the court?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  The California courts--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --The California courts are certainly not tolerating... and, in fact, this case was heard by a California court, and the... and the judge, as I read the record... it's not altogether clear... seemed to agree with the... with the police officers.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I'm not sure that that was clear from the decisions of this Court.  Certainly, that wasn't what was involved in Pickering.  That was outside speech.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And the same... and the same with Connick.  So, I'm... if you're saying that this is what the circuits have understood, fine, but that's not this... that's why we took this case.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, let's assume that--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --I think that that's an open question under Pickering, and that this case presents it.  Do you... do you concede... and maybe you don't... that there is any category of first amendment speech, as a matter of public concern, which an employee cannot direct to the employer?  Are there... are there some matters as to which the employer can protect its own interests and stifle the employee's speech?   Anthony M. Kennedy  So, there's always Pickering balance.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --any comment that an employee makes regarding how the office is working is a matter of public concern.  I would concede that.  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --that has to be.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And the consequence of your view is to have the first amendment being used for courts to monitor the discussions that take place in every public agency... local, State, and Federal... in the United States.  It's... you are advocating a sweeping rule.  Now, you'll say,  ""Oh, well, Pickering balance will protect it. ""   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But I still think the intrusive consequences of your... of your rule are sweeping.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But I don't under--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --I understand the ultimate answer you gave the hypothetical.  I don't understand the principle you're following.  I mean, it's a matter of--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --you would agree this is a matter of public concern.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But we don't have a standard.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So, the Federal--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --Federal courts supervise the constant dialogue that is the everyday routine practice in every governmental agency, local and Federal, in the United States.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, in--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --in this case, the supervisor said,  ""There can't be... can't be tracks on asphalt, so you're probably right. ""  Then he finds out that it's a tire rim, and of course the rim makes a... so we have to find out this at discovery... at the discovery stage of a lawsuit?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  What--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --what you're saying is, is that the first amendment has an office and a function within the confines of a Government agency that it doesn't have outside.  That's a curious calculus.  It seems to me that the first amendment has its most application when you talk to newspapers, when you talk outside.  That's what the first amendment's about.  The first amendment isn't about policing the workplace.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So, we do this--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --so we do this as a... so we do this as a matter of what is sound management principles for a Government agency?  How does that relate to the first amendment?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, that--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --There would... in this case, unlike any other case I've seen in the employment area, there is a hearing in... before a court of general jurisdiction, who goes into this.

You say, well, in almost all the cases, it's because he's been convicted of a crime in prison and so forth.  Well, that... that undercuts, it seems to me, the... the basic argument that you're trying to make that established this line between predictive and nonpredictive judgment.  I...

Kennedy  It... it seems to me that the... the facial attack objection would... would not be... carry much weight if what happened was this.  There was a trial.  The policies were found deficient, and the court said, you devise some new forms.  At that point, it seems to me that the facial attack would... objection would... would not be relevant.  And... and your point would be right.  You say, you know, they... they haven't... this doesn't... is not going to cure the... the deficiency.  But what happened here was that, as I understand it, midway in the litigation there was a new policy, and it... it seems... so we have sort of a moving target that we're working with.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Could you comment on that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Are you... are you saying that what we have before us is this, a trial which showed that the pre-new policy procedures were deficient and the trial judge and you and a court of appeals interpreted the new policies as remedies for past wrongs that were established?  And the question is the adequacy of that remedy.  That's one way to look at the case.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Another way to look at the case is to say that Ohio admitted that there were some improprieties, showed its new policy, and the case turned on the adequacy of the new policies.  Now, those are two different things.  Which is this case?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And as... and as to those prisoners, was there a requirement that the... that the court's procedures be made applicable and so there would have to be a retroactive hearing as to those prisoners?

Kennedy  We've... we've all been... been in court and... and noticed that sometimes witnesses or jurors or parties or even attorneys will make faces and so forth that's not consistent with... with proper demeanor in a courtroom.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Maybe the judge is reading.  A judge doesn't watch... watch the witness 100 percent of the time.  That's not credible.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Now... now, number 19 was excused and was a black person.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And... and a woman.  And if that too had been suspicious and challenged, then you might have had a pattern, a pattern of two people, which could have overcome the demeanor testimony... demeanor claim.  But I... I think on this record that we have to assume that there is nothing wrongful about excusing juror 19 merely because respondent's counsel here... you did not pursue that.  I... I read the record as... as telling us that so far as juror 19 is concerned, there was an adequate reason for excusing that juror.  At least respondent's counsel... you have not said that there wasn't.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but number 6 was a young white... young white male, I believe, and he was excused on the ground of youth.  So it's consistent.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Would you say the same thing about the defense counsel confusing jurors 16 and 19 at page 9, the bottom of page 9?  It seems to me Ms.... Ms. Nachman is confusing juror 19 with 16.  They're talking about 16 and 6, and then Ms. Nachman ends by talking about juror 19.  That seems to me clearly to mean number 16.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I... I don't think it's a necessary reading.   Anthony M. Kennedy  In... in a sense, the standards perhaps ought to be reversed.  When you hear the evidence, which is what you do under (e)(1), that is when you've determined... should determine whether it's unreasonable.

Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, do you think the waiver argument that's made is properly before us?   Anthony M. Kennedy  You may be right about that, but, while I've got you here, let's assume just one State entity, not multiple State entities.  And the State has received a preferential transfer of $2,000.  It still has an outstanding claim... a different claim against the same bankrupt for $1,000.  And it goes in to enforce its claim for $1,000.  Could we hold, consistently with the Eleventh Amendment, that that is a waiver?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No, different claim.  The--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --One, the State received $2,000 worth of taxes, but it... still have its $1,000 contract claim.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I'd like to get away from in rem and back to the waiver aspect that's being argued here.  Let's assume that there is an offset obligation that the State has to comply with, that there's been a preference and it has another claim, and with just one entity.  If that's true, it seems to me somewhat unfair to say that the State can proceed on multiple fronts with different entities and fractionate its immunity so that if there are more than three entities... or if there are three or four entities, each one is judged separately as to the offset obligation.  It seems to me that if one State entity is subject to offset, then all of them are.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Otherwise, the State immunity, it seems to me, can be... can be fractionated.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But I--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --I thought, with respect to Justice Ginsburg's colloquy... and my own, earlier... that we said that there is an offset obligation, even if they're different claims.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And now... and now I want to extrapolate from that to multiple entities, each of which asserts its own immunity.   ",04-885X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Take your time.  We're interested--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --Well, it's the same question.  But let's say that the court thinks there might be merit to the argument of waiver, that the State entity comes in asking to be treated as a creditor, and its preference is then before the bankruptcy court.  How is that issue preserved in the question you raise?  You say, maybe the Congress used Article 1 to abrogate the State's sovereign immunity.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It just seems to... seem to me to be part of the question presented.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, you asked... you framed the question.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Oh, no, you... you're right.

One dealer being discriminated against, vis a vis another dealer.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, of course, if we can go back to the language, it's between different purchases of commodities of ""like grade and quality"".  And that seems to me to indicate that Volvo trucks, generically, must be looked at... the policy, with reference to Volvo trucks, generically.  Suppose one dealer always got a 10 percent discount, the other dealer always got a 20 percent discount over a period of time.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

Kennedy  We're not sure--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --all right.   Anthony M. Kennedy  You want--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --You want us to hold that.

I assume a Governor could take this into account in clemency?   Anthony M. Kennedy  And I suppose the Governors can do more than juries can.  But, still, it seems odd to me that a jury cannot consider that this is a close case.  It's been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, of course.  It goes at least to whether or not the defendant is obdurate in not accepting guilt.  He says, ""I didn't do it"".   Anthony M.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I suppose the reason behind this distinction... and it's, in a sense, artificial, because we made it up... I suppose the reason is that, in the ""weighing"" State, the concern is that if there is an ineligible... or an invalid factor in the eligibility determination, it carries over with the degree of force and weight... it's almost... it's a presumption that the jury is liable to treat it... or, at least the jury is liable to treat it as such.  And I see that same aspect to this case, when the instructions refers... you indicated in your colloquy with Justice Souter that the instructions specifically say  ""any special... any special circumstance which has been found. ""   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Am I right that the special--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --I have one background question.  And maybe I missed something.  Number 14,  ""where it was especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel. ""  --taken alone, that would be vague.  But I thought that in Profitt we said that if it were... if there were a gloss given by the courts in interpreting that standard so that it was made more specific, evidenced in a pitiless attitude, pitiless crime, that then it was valid.  Has a Federal court, or have we said, that this provision is unconstitutional?  Or do we just assume that in this case?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Or am I missing--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --Yes.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Invalid as a matter of Federal law?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Okay.   Anthony M. Kennedy  So, now we have an extra layer of complexity, because something that's been held unconstitutional under State law is said to skew the weighing, if it is weighing, as a matter of Federal law.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  All right.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Was it--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --was it this case in which the Supreme Court of California made the definitive interpretation--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --that this is... what was--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --Engert.  I can find it, thank you.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, of course, this goes to a question, really, for the respondent.  It helps... there is a paradox here.  To the extent that a State attempts to guide and to limit what the jury can consider in the selection phase, it's held to a higher standard.  There is... there is certainly a paradox there.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Maybe--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --so, in this... or, weren't there previous California cases... or, again, correct me if I'm wrong... where California says the reasonable possibility test requires the defendant to establish that the error was prejudicial?  I thought that was the California law.  Or am I wrong?   INTERRUPTING ",04-980X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  But it's not... it's prefaced by circumstances of the crime.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And this State, and other States, can determine,  ""Oh, the victim was in fear for a long time, or was tortured. ""  It seems very odd that a State, which is a so called ""nonweighing"" State, could allow all of this same evidence to come in, but California, which tries to get some structure, is suddenly held to a higher standard.  That's paradoxical.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Of course, it's... it's invalid only because it's too vague for eligibility.  It's not invalid because it's too vague for selection.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you... do you defend that the difference in... our distinction between balancing and nonbalancing... or, pardon me, ""weighing"" and ""nonweighing"" States... your answer to Justice Breyer indicates the... that you would not be disconsolate if we jettisoned the whole... the whole distinction.  And isn't it true that it's paradoxical that a State which tries to structure the selection phase by giving specific factors as held to a higher standard than a State that doesn't?  That seems to me very odd.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But it is within the contours of the Constitution if, in a ""nonweighing"" State, the same evidence could be considered.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  In that--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --analysis, would you use, as one factor, the circumstance that an eligibility determination was made by the jury, was focused on by the prosecutor, and that that was impermissibly vague?

Kennedy  --Well, we have the rule, already, that if there is an invalid eligibility factor and it's a ""weighing"" State, that there's... that the process is defective.

If the, if the employee, he alleges that promotions were based on experience and the employee didn't have the experience because of past discrimination, why is that different than the paycheck rule?  I take it indicates that you would not allow the, a cause of action unless the discrimination was within the statute of limitations period?   Anthony M.

Kennedy  Does he have to know that the present decision to continue the pay structure is discriminatory?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, the question is whether or not there was a discriminatory act and if the employer, let's say it's an employer that has just purchased a business, thinks that it's a neutral criterion to base wages or bonuses or increase on a prior pay scale and he doesn't know about the prior discrimination, why isn't that a defense?

Kennedy  But I thought that was just the answer you gave to Justice Stevens on your point two.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Who mandated this plan?  The State of New York?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But the State of New York can't mandate what happens to interstate commerce.   Anthony M. Kennedy  If you say the Congress of the United States has authorized discrimination against interstate commerce, then of course it can do that.  That has happened.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But Pike doesn't apply to discrimination.  Pike applies to burdens.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It seems you are conflating the two.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Can you tell me... this is just basic bankruptcy.  I should know, but I looked it up and couldn't find it.  A standard promissory note which provides for attorneys' fees, the holder of the note is the creditor, the maker of the note is the bankrupt... the maker of the note goes bankrupt.  The holder of the note gets his attorney and says: File a claim in bankruptcy.  And the attorney sends him a bill.  Is the attorneys' fees, the attorney fee for filing the bankruptcy claim, recoverable as part of the claim?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It's the standard, it's the standard attorneys' fee provision, all attorneys' fees in connection with collection of this note and enforcement of the terms of this note.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Is there something where I can look that up in Collier?  Are there millions of cases?  I mean, this seems to me fairly rudimentary.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No, no.  But in my case, it's a post-petition action.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Just in the hypothetical, I would think that in many cases, there's going to be some payout for the promissory note, and the holder of the note tells his attorneys: Make sure I get that claim in bankruptcy.  The attorney files a claim.  And every attorney that files a claim for a promissory note which is entitled to a fee from the bankruptcy court for filing in the bankruptcy court.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Are they--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --Let me just ask you about the Fobian, and I know Justice Breyer has a question.  Let's assume that you're correct in that the fees are allowable.  Can the bankruptcy court make the determination of the reasonableness of the fees?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  In this case.   Anthony M. Kennedy  So... so if the bankruptcy judge isn't sure of what the amount is, he looks to State law to determine the amount?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But the bankruptcy court does determine reasonableness.   Anthony M. Kennedy  No, no.  But... but we are talking about attorneys' fees for services performed in the bankruptcy proceeding?   Anthony M. Kennedy  The cost of filing the claim, the cost of talking to the bankruptcy judge, et cetera.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  If you prevail, why can't every attorney who represents a creditor who has a credit card or a promissory note providing for attorneys' fees file something in bankruptcy and get attorneys' fees for the filing of the claim?

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, if you say it doesn't go far enough then I infer from that you say that it's valid as far as it goes?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Justice Ginsburg has a question I'm very interested in.  Do you defend the Fobian rule?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That doesn't... and then you have the negative inference or the exclusio unius argument, whatever, which I think is misplaced in this context.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, Timbers cited, as the Chief Justice indicates, the interest section in--  506.  That's all it's about.  I don't... I think Timbers is misleading on this point.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No, attorney for the debtor.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, on that point you disagree with the Collier citation at page 9 of the reply brief then?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, it says if the creditor incurs the attorneys' fees post petition in connection with protecting a pre-petition claim--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --the fees will be pre-petition.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So you disagree with that?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I... I am concerned about your point that there are all kinds of attorneys' fees contracts out there and if everybody can get fees for filing the claim post-petition act, we have a huge amount of claims to pay.  Travelers would tell us, though, that a surety is different, that they somehow stand in the shoes of PG&E or something.   ",05-1429
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well if you're correct and this was a sponsor decision, not a fiduciary decision, let me ask you when you're wearing, when the company is wearing its sponsor hat and says we're going to terminate this plan, does it have a duty to consider the best interests and the security of the employees, number one, when it picks an insurance company?  It can't pick some flaky insurance company if there is a much more solid insurance company, can it?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But if have this duty to consider the interest of the employees in selecting the, the insurance company, in selecting the amount of the annuity, etcetera, if you have that duty it seems to me that that's a fiduciary duty.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I agree with Justice Scalia, that that's one answer.  On the other hand, you have... there are two arguments here.  And what we are exploring now is whether this is a fiduciary obligation or a sponsor obligation.   Anthony M. Kennedy  So we will have to assume for that... if you can't do it by merger, then the whole case goes away anyway.  If merger is not permitted under the statute, then we don't need to worry whether it's a fiduciary response, correct?   Anthony M. Kennedy  So what we're asking in the first part of this argument is whether or not it's a fiduciary response.  And that's what Justice Souter and I are questioning.  And it does seem to me, assume that there is a meeting of the board of directors, we think we are going to terminate this plan.  At that point, choices are made as to how to terminate it.  And it's difficult for me to see why the interests of the employees are not uppermost in... in your duties, i.e. a fiduciary duty, when you decide how you're going to terminate it.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Why can't you say it's a business decision as to which insurance company you're going to select.  Maybe you do say that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but that's the way you characterize it.  I don't know why it's mere execution, when it's an annuity and it's not mere execution when it's a merger, once the determination decision has been made.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But Justice Alito's question, and I have the same question.  Let's assume, A... I know this is not your position... but the merger is a permissible option.  And B... and I know this is not your position... that this is a fiduciary obligation.  I assume then you would lose, because the extra assets must go, the reversion interest, must go to the employees if it's in their benefit.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But then you say that if it's a fiduciary obligation, and the merger is a permitted option, that the administrator, A, can, or B, must still give the money back to you.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  The administrator, as a fiduciary, can consider the interest of the employer as well as the employees?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Could an administrator make that decision in its fiduciary capacity?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Could a plan document provide that upon termination the employer is entitled to a refund of any excess funding?  And would that then be binding on an administrator in a fiduciary capacity?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And I take it the administrator would then have the duty to obey that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Then why couldn't the PBGC say, you know, we are not quite sure how these insurance companies work.  So we'll buy the annuity and then the five million is an extra guarantee to make sure the annuities are paid and that also goes to the insurance company?   ",05-1448
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, if you prevail won't plan documents or shouldn't plan documents be amended to say that merger is not an option and any reversion goes to the employer?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, how could the administrator, how could the administrator negotiate with the employer to give the $5 million back if it's with a fiduciary?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I suppose if it would have been amended.  But what happens, what happens if the employer wants to continue in business, but simply turn the plan over to a multiemployer plan?  Is that a fiduciary... and you have an employer that wears two hats.  The employer is also the administrator.  Is that a fiduciary decision?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So then it's the ongoing significance of the decision to the employer that determines whether there's a fiduciary obligation?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I can't see why it's a fiduciary obligation in case A... a sponsor obligation in case A and a fiduciary obligation in case B.  That just depends on the sequence of timing.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well... excuse me.  Excuse me.  I'm just not sure I understand your answer.  If the employer finds the rock solid insurance company under... pardon me, the administrator finds the rock solid insurance company under Justice Scalia's hypothetical under (i) he must consider all other options under (ii)?

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  The Government does cite the principle that when there's a specific statutory scheme that controls over a more general one.  It doesn't cite a tax case for that, at least as I recall.  Has that principle ever been applied in the tax code, do you know?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I suppose... tell me if I'm wrong, or the Government can tell me if I'm wrong... but there is this difference also that in a refund suit, you have to pay the money.  The Government has the money before you can bring the refund suit.  Am I right about that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Incidentally, I'm just curious, if the underlying assessment... if you wished to have challenged the underlying assessment, it's for a million dollars, can you pay $100,000 and then bring the refund suit in order to test the validity of the tax, or do you have to pay the whole amount?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, your argument is probably based on the statute.  I just question one phrase you mentioned, which was that Williams was not driven by the equities.  It seems to me it was wholly driven by the equities.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Getting back to my earlier question, if there is a million-dollar tax liability, and there is a levy on the bank account for $100,000, do you have to pay the extra 900,000 before can you bring--  the refund suit?   Anthony M. Kennedy  So that's, that's also a difference.   ",05-1541
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you have a citation for that as would apply to the Internal Revenue code?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I don't, I don't see how you can say there's frustration.  Perhaps I'm missing something.  It seems to me that for years the Revenue Code has had two basic schemes.  One is you can contest the liability before you pay the money.  The other is you pay the money and sue for refund.  And one requires you go to the Tax Court and the other district court and so forth.  So these are two different schemes and here you have to... we are advised that even if there was a levy for $100,000 you, couldn't contest it unless you paid the extra 900.  So those are two very different schemes.  Am I wrong about that?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Of course, because the Government doesn't have the money.  But in the refund suit the Government has the money.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Often does, but not necessarily, and doesn't have to have all the amount.   INTERRUPTING ",05-1541
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I don't know if you got to the third point you were going to make.  You were outlining three different points.  But it seems to me that from the very start, what happens is that you and your brother for the respondent are talking past each other.  You want to talk to us about the adequacy of the State court's finding.  The respondent says what we... all we want is a hearing in the district court, and those are two different issues.  We want a hearing in the district court, i.e., so that we can show the findings are insubstantial or incorrect.  Those, it seems to me, are two different issues, and I sense the briefs are talking past each other on this point.  Did you see the same thing?   Anthony M. Kennedy  In your view, what is the standard for when the district court may hold an evidentiary hearing?  I know there's an element of discretion in it.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That's the only time the district court can hold a hearing?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes, but it seems that if he doesn't do that, then that's a bar.  But if he has done that, when can he ask for a further hearing?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, on the waiver point, let's assume that this case had not come in... come here, and you had gone back to the district court pursuant to the order of the Ninth Circuit.  Surely you would have taken the position, or you could have taken the position if the evidence developed that way, that he really knew or should have known about all this mitigating evidence and he waived.  You certainly could continue to take that position in the district court.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And the district court would say I now have a more full, factual record, and I make the finding that there was knowing waiver, or there wasn't.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But doesn't that assume that the defendant know what mitigating evidence is?  I mean, this defendant, I suppose wants to show,  ""I thought mitigating evidence was just going to be what the, these two relatives were going to testify to. ""  ""There was really much more, if my counsel had investigated. ""  And that's not a knowing waiver.   ",05-1575

Kennedy  Part of that discretion is, and you've been careful to say this, that there's a likelihood of a different result?   Anthony M. Kennedy  So it seems to me that that is the difficult part of your case based on this evidence.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, we know what the fetal alcohol testimony is going to be.

If the State court says, we're interested in purposes, we decided, and you must as a matter of State law interpret the statute according to the purpose as we found it, aren't we bound by that?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  What's your authority for that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, that's because the characterization had a Federal consequence.   Anthony M.

Kennedy  Isn't it your position that this statute is constitutional either way you interpret it?   Anthony M.

I was wondering if that's because it's sheerly elective.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Because it's purely elective and not medically necessary.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, it might be related in the sense that the government's argument that there are alternate mechanisms is not a practical alternative.  I was going to ask the government about that.  On the other hand, the fact that any number of hospitals don't allow the procedure is also indicated, indication that there is a medical opinion against it.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

Does that make a difference?  That may come toward the end of your argument rather than now, but I'd like it addressed at some point.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Could you address that?

Kennedy  Was there an attempt by the plaintiff during the discovery phase of the case to show other evidence of pattern and practice, statistical evidence; or was it just these five people?  Was that all that the plaintiff presented?   Anthony M. Kennedy  The inference they are trying to prove is there was somebody upstairs that told everybody what to do.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Does the record show in this 70,000-person company how many supervisors there were?  Do we know that?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  The next step up would be--   Anthony M.

Garre  --Well, I think if you're talking about pattern of practice, maybe doesn't... certainly as a matter of law that's not a... going to prove a pattern of practice, and the employer can make that argument to the district judge, to the jury, and that evidence could be limited or excluded.  If you have got, for example, a... a proffered witness who's complaining that supervisors in the same complex used the same distinctive explanation that my supervisor gave me... for example, in this case, several of the witnesses were going to testify that their supervisors told them they were being... they were removed because their positions were being eliminated, and then they later found out that younger persons assumed their jobs.

As a textual matter, as a logical matter, I just -- I don't understand that.  I think I could design a label that's completely consistent and that meets the requirements that the Respondents wish to urge.  Now, if you want to say that any alteration of the label violates Federal law, that's something else.  But as a textual matter, as a logical matter, as a semantic matter, I don't agree with it.

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  I think those three points are certainly what would help me.  Could I ask just two preliminary questions?  They don't necessarily have to do with this case, just to get something straight.  I take it that you couldn't have claimed this deduction under 162 without getting into an argument that it should be capitalized and that's why 212 is in the Code?   Anthony M. Kennedy  My other question is background only.  Perhaps I should ask the government.  Are 162 expenses subject to the 2 percent ceiling?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, it seems to me that that just simply couldn't have been Congress's purpose in passing this statute because now you have a recipe for avoidance.  In most States... California has a rule that the trustee has to make prudent business investments.  I assume a great number of businessmen outside the trust context think that they have their principal objective of making prudent business investments.  But under your theory all expenses for that objective would fall within this exclusion.  I just don't think that's what the Congress could possibly have intended.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, is that true just in your case?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Universally, there is never a danger of tax avoidance?  You want us to write the decision on the assumption that tax avoidance is never a problem in the creation of a trust?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  What do you have to support that?

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, on that point in some jurisdictions and perhaps you can tell me about New York, I had thought and correct me if I'm wrong, that tax liens have a superior status to other liens in that they are an, an interest or an estate in the property as opposed to an attachment.  Is it not true?  And I don't, and I'm not talking just about order of priority for creditors.  I'm talking about the superiority insofar as being or not being an interest in property.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Is there New York law to that effect?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Because I had... I had thought that it is an estate in land in at least some jurisdictions.  And Justice Breyer was asking about the same thing.  In other words, there are liens... there are liens and liens.  There are different kinds of liens.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Why isn't it commercial activity for New York to say, we provide garbage services, electric services, et cetera.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But they pay fees and New York taxes.  Suppose New York doesn't have fees.  Suppose they say, we'll just do this out of our property tax.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, what about the argument that it was an interest in property.  The brief was very clear that it is an interest in property, and that a tax lien is almost sui generis, in that it is an estate in the property.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It survives bona fide... it survives bona fide purchaser without notice?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you take the position that it's improper even to notice the property with the lien?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I mean, let's assume that you owe the taxes.   ",06-134X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  And under New York law does property, do property tax liens have some superior status?  Are they distinct under New York law from other liens?   Anthony M.

Kennedy  Is this the Vienna Convention?   Anthony M. Kennedy  European Convention.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Now... now I take it you under New York law and the law of most jurisdictions, the tax lien becomes a lien against the property before any judicial proceedings.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Just because they are unpaid.  And this is probably a question more for them than for you, but as you understand their position, if you put a lien on the property for unpaid taxes, are they entitled to demand its removal?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  You mean of course they can under their view?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Excuse me.  Can they demand that that lien be released--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --No, no.  --because it violates the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act?  Is it their position that you have no right at all even to notice a lien against the property?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It would seem to me to follow from what they're saying.   Anthony M. Kennedy  My hypothetical is can they demand that the lien be removed solely because of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.   Anthony M. Kennedy  With reference to the offset of foreign aid, could that offset be made under the controlling statutes just based on your lien, or do you have to have a judgment first?   ",06-134X

INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I see.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Are you saying this is a passive investment?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I don't like to intrude on the white light, but if I could just ask one question.  If the unitary tax argument has been preserved and is met and if there's a finding that they are unitary, does Illinois have the right to tax the sale, or to... to a portion of it?   Anthony M. Kennedy  No, no.  Assume... assume it is unitary.  Can Illinois then, in your view, have a part of... tax part of the gain on the sale?   ",06-1413
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, if you did not proceed on the unitary business there, let's take that off the table.  It seems to me that Lexis's presence in Illinois is quite irrelevant.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It seems to me that, under your theory, you could tax the sale, even if Lexis were not in Illinois at all, just because Mead is.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And if I can just add on to that same question: If you're going to have the unitary tax theory, that's... that's very helpful.  But if we take the unitary tax theory off the table, it seems to me that you are confusing the law by having some midway test.  I don't know what your theory is, that... in relation to this part of Justice Breyer's question.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But Mead didn't receive... pardon me... Lexis didn't receive the money for the sale, Mead did.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Unless, again, if Mead's presence or nonpresence is simply irrelevant to what happened here, absent a unitary theory.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you think that if there had been a separate corporation and that Lexis was a subsidiary corporation and the subsidiary was... it was sold, that, again, absent a finding of unitary, Illinois then could have had a tax?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  All right.  So, then, the asset stock doesn't make any difference?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That gets back to Justice Stevens's initial hypothetical.  If you live in New York and you have an investment in a company that does a lot of business in Illinois and you in New York, a resident individual, sell that stock, under your theory Illinois could tax it.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But it seems to me that those factors are wholly irrelevant to the fact of sale.  It's just whimsical.  It has nothing to do with the sale.  The reason we use apportionment in other cases is, just as in Justice Breyer's railroad example, there is no other way to tell, and so forth.  But here the presence of Lexis in Illinois is wholly accidental with reference to what went on in the sale.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And that is different--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --But the proration, it seems to me... that should have nothing to do with the extent of Lexis in Illinois--   Anthony M.

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you mean Patterson would come out the same under 1981 as amended by the 1991 act.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I think Congress would have been quite amazed at that rule.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And Congress changed that and the case we have is also post formation.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Under your view, would harassment be prohibited by 1981 as amended?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But the term 1981(b).   Anthony M. Kennedy  You practice in this--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --in this area--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --Perhaps you can maybe just tell me based on your experience: After 1981 was amended, did 1981(b) supersede Title VII in run of the mill termination and harassment cases?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No, no, not retaliation.  I mean harassment, discharge, et cetera.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Why not?  There's a longer statute of limitation.  There's no cap on damages.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, then I have to refine the hypothetical.  I don't want to take too much, but in Federal court--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --because it does seem to me that Congress told us: We don't care if there's an overlap between 1981 and Title VII, we don't care if there's a longer statute of limitations, we don't care if there's no cap an damages; we want 1981 to work.  And that's... 1981 does apply in a large number of employment discrimination cases.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And if that's true, then why do we worry about retaliation?  If Congress is not concerned about it, why should we be?   ",06-1431
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, you say it's clear, but neither you or the government seems to tell me any words in this statute.  Your argument is that we should create a cause of action in order to make this effective.  I understand that argument.  I think the Court's cases stand against it, and if you want to... but it seems to me that you're admitting that nothing in the words of the statute as amended help you.  And the government... which as well is an impairment, which I think is quite wrong because that's not what section (c} intended for.  But that's almost an admission on the government's part that it can't find any words in section (b) either.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But that was there before... but that was there as of the time of Patterson.   Anthony M. Kennedy  So then Congress did nothing by the amendment to help your case.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Patterson was not a retaliation case.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Patterson was a discharge and harassment case.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And the words do seem to cover that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But nothing that you argued so far shows that the words of the statute as amended, that is to say new subsection (b), help your case.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I do not read subsection (c) as giving substantive rights.  I mean, you can argue about that.  I think you have to talk about (b), and I think you have a valid point when they say that they're extending the protection for the life of the contract.  But I still want to know what particular words in section (b) you rely on?  ""Benefit""?  ""Privilege""?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Because it's ironic to say all those cases were wrong when Congress agreed with them and disagreed with Patterson.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But that was true in Sullivan because a property owner who wants to sell is in a particularly advantageous position to enforce the rights of the buyer.  It's part of his own contract.  And to extend it to the situation we have here is quite an extension of Sullivan in my view.   Anthony M. Kennedy  What I'm... what I'm taking away from the argument is that if I were to write this opinion in your favor, I would have to say that it's necessary to imply a cause of action prohibiting retaliation in order to make these other words effective.  And that seems to me a very limited argument and a very difficult argument for you to prevail upon, given the authorities and the approach of the Court that we've discussed.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I understand that, and... and there certainly is a cause of action as to all the terms in the contract, but you want to add... for me to add a new term.  You can't use the existing terms to say that there is a cause of action other... that helps your client, other than that there is a general approach that there is protection post contract formation.  I would have to agree with that; and I don't think you can get out of it impairment.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Now you're making enforcement, as with Patterson.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Now you're just talking about make or enforce and that brings us right back to where we started.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Are you asking us to infer, to find implied in the words a cause of action against retaliation?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  What words--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --What words in the statute?  And not ""impairment"" because I don't agree with the government on that.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  A third reason is that the word isn't in the statute.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, that's a benefit, privilege, and term of the contract--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --to me fairly obvious to me to include harassment.  That was the situation in Patterson.  That's what Congress sought to address.  Retaliation is something quite different.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, then why were you--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --talking about impairment in your brief?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, of course, and you in your brief bracketed that and just made that equivalent to retaliation.  I don't think it is because he was arguing that he didn't... he was himself injured because he couldn't sell his own property.  He has an interest in his own property.  And that just isn't true in the standard retaliation case of the type we're discussing.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

If we take it the government has a strong case under the smuggling statute, wouldn't it have an equally strong case under (i) of the statute that we're considering here, which doesn't require concealing or disguising the nature, just to avoid a transportation reporting requirement.  That's the same as the smuggling statute.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I know the government didn't indict under (ii).   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  You mean as the proceeds of an illegal transaction?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Was there a reporting requirement for... for this shipment.  If he had gone to the border, would he... well, then, a lot of what you're arguing about isn't very important because they could just indict under (ii).   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  To avoid a transaction reporting requirement, and you wouldn't have to go through all this ""nature"" thing.   Anthony M. Kennedy  You indicated that there is such a requirement.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Oh, I see.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Suppose the evidence is clear that he knew he was taking it across the border and it was to pay the drug dealer?  Would that suffice?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but... no, no.  He conceals it, in order to pay the drug dealer.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It's concealing who owns and controls.   ",06-1456
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Then what you're saying, I suppose, is that the movement of funds, if they're illegal proceeds, outside of the country is a per se concealment?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Give me an example of when you take money outside of the country that's illegal money--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --that's not a concealment?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well then, let me back up.  Then let me add this.  It seems to me that you're saying, as you have to say, that any movement of illegal funds outside the country which is concealed is per se concealing a relevant attribute?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But if you do.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I think you have to go that far to make the case you're making.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But you're always concealing the control.  You're always concealing the ownership.  You're always concealing the location if it's in your shoe or in the bottom of the car.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, your answer to Justice Scalia's hypothetical is still not clear to me.  It... it seems to me your answer should be yes, because he's concealing the ownership as of the time he goes across the border, which brings me to my earlier question, if once it's concealed, the statute is always... is always valid.  Then you indicated that oh, well, what happens at the destination is very important.  Then we had Justice Scalia's hypothetical.  I'm not sure where you came out on that.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So Concealment, concealment during the transportation is always a concealment of an attribute under the statute.  That has to be your position.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, then your only defense is to go across the border and before you go across you put all the money in your arms so the people can see it?  That's the way you do it?  [Laughter]  Other than that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But you, in response to one of my hypotheticals, said that it would be relevant in some cases to show that it was designed to create the appearance of legitimate wealth.

You reevaluate all the contracts back down the line?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Let me say that, consistent with your theory, that everybody... that this whole unwinding process backs up all the way down to the original seller?   Anthony M.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  I couldn't find the order that the court... in the record it says that the order would be... the court granted a preliminary injunction, the superior court, and then it said, according to an order to be entered by the clerk.  How long was the arbitration stayed for?  There was an enjoined... there was an injunction.  What was the term of the injunction?  Just until further order of the court?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Did the Respondent at any point indicate that after the Labor Commission, Labor Commissioner, made a determination that they would not go to superior court for de novo review?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I must say that the Volt case is written in rather sweeping language that's not particularly helpful to you.  On its facts, I think it's different because there were other parties, independent parties in the litigation.  Don't you think that's the best way to distinguish Volt in your case?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Does the Labor Commissioner have authority to commence proceedings on his own motion or her own motion?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I'm sorry that I asked already.   Anthony M. Kennedy  If you go to the superior court for de novo review, can you ask the superior court for an order enforcing its decision?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, you get de novo review.  So do you ask the court for an order... a declaratory order, declaring that the person is a talent agent or is not a talent agent?   Anthony M. Kennedy  So do you think it would be within the authority of the superior court to say this is a judgment binding on the parties and the arbitration will not proceed, or must proceed consistently with my order?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.  Well, but if the Respondent prevails, don't you think that the superior court has that authority?   Anthony M. Kennedy  If Respondent prevails in this case, don't you think that the superior court can then say that its declaration is final and the arbitration shall not proceed?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But that's always the case.  It's always the case that the arbitration is quiet on this.  It is... the Respondent's position is that it is absolutely quiet, but it is also absolutely clear that it is State law.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I'm not sure that Volt would have been different.  Volt is... Volt is written very broadly, it seems to me, in favor of the Respondent's position.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I suppose if we write the case your way, we have to talk about what happens if this Labor Commissioner had enforcement powers, that they had the sua sponte right to invoke, and that they did?   ",06-1463
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Did you take that position below, was the question.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  The arbitrator already agreed to do that.  You didn't need the injunction for that purpose.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well... but if your position is that we have to preserve the integrity of the State system, the Labor expert and so forth and the State builds in to that procedure, de novo review Superior Court, it seems to me rather difficult for you to now just say oh, well, the Superior Court doesn't make any difference.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I just want to understand your position.  In this case, does the California provision for de novo review in the Superior Court apply to stay the arbitration while that aspect of the proceeding is completed?   Anthony M. Kennedy  My question was: You go to the labor commissioner.  You also have a de novo right to go to the superior court.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Suppose the labor commissioner said something absolutely silly.  Wouldn't you think you would have the right to go to the Superior Court?   Anthony M. Kennedy  And it would make no sense to do that and... and not to also stay the arbitration.   Anthony M. Kennedy  No.  Now, we have this case.  We have an arbitration clause.   Anthony M. Kennedy  The arbitrator is waiting.  You go to the labor commissioner, you go to the superior court to say enjoin the arbitration while I go to the labor commissioner.   Anthony M. Kennedy  The labor commissioner does something silly.  Can you not then go to superior court and get de novo review of that wrong decision of the labor commissioner before the arbitration starts?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Have you taken that position consistently in this litigation?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  You have taken no position on it either way?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Are you telling us that under no circumstance, if you prevail in this case, would you go to the superior court for de novo review and... and, as part of that, stay the arbitration?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  All right.  Let's assume the arbitration clause is valid.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Even though in this case you have assumed that that arbitration has to be stayed for the labor commissioner.  So the case does not have to be stayed, and you would not ask for it to be stayed, in the superior court?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  In this case, the Court of Appeals, the majority said the fact that the losing party will have a right to de novo hearing, involving additional time and money, does not excuse the Defendant from the legal requirement to exhaust his remedy.  And I think you're preserving the option to go to the Superior Court, at least the contestability of the arbitration clause.   Anthony M. Kennedy  So that, it seems to me, makes incorrect your statement in your brief that, oh, this is just for eight months, so that there's very little additional time involved because of the de novo hearing.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Don't you think that your statement at page 34 of the brief has to be qualified in that respect?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But you also have the right to challenge what... the accuracy of the Labor Department's finding.  That's what both... all the judges on the California court agreed with that.  So I'm asking, doesn't that make... require qualification of your statement at page 34 that these procedures are expeditious and informal and do not entail additional expense or delay?  All of--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --That does require some qualification there.   Anthony M. Kennedy  All right.  Does it also require some qualification in you brief where, at page 12, you say Preston clearly and repeatedly sought to procure employment for Ferrer in the television industry?  Our rules say that you cannot raise matters for the first time in this Court.  And you have no evidence on that point.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I know you didn't, and that's why I'm questioning why you put it in your brief.  Doesn't that require some qualification?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Therefore, don't make factual averments here for the first time.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you think, in the briefs to this Court, you can make factual statements that are not in the record?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I think they do say that it is disputed.  They do dispute that he clearly and repeatedly sought to procure employment for Ferrer.  That's the whole issue in the case.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But they said it is... they dispute that it is to procure employment.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That seems to me completely inconsistent with your argument that additional time is minimal.  And if you have repeated statements in your brief that require qualifications, if in your former argument in Marshal, the Court is concerned with the accuracy of one of your citations, shouldn't we view with some skepticism what you tell us?   ",06-1463
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  I also wanted to know whether there is in the record the corporation's balance sheet?  It was frankly hard for me to believe that this was not in excess of basis.  You don't usually capitalize corporations for $10 million.  But I don't have any basis other than just an assumption to make that observation.  Is the corporate balance sheet with the capital structure in the record?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Was it introduced by the Government or by the defendant?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I'm not, I'm not sure if what the Government is maintaining here is so prejudicial to its position in other cases, which was the earlier discussion we were having.  Here there is simply nothing on the corporate records to show that this was a distribution with respect to stock.  I don't care whether this is earnings and profits or in excess of basis.  But there's just no indication of the distribution with respect to stock, and you have two shareholders.  Under Hawaiian law, can you make a disproportionate distribution to shareholders so one person gets capital back and the other doesn't and there's no redemption of shares?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That was, that was the qualification that the Second Circuit made in its D'Agostino case.  It said if there's a violation of corporate law then our rule doesn't apply.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but that's the whole point.  The fact that he doesn't show this as a distribution indicates that he couldn't do this under Federal law, so it must be something... under State law, so it must be something other than a distribution.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, under the Government's intent test, I suppose if you have a calendar year and the distribution is made in June, that the Government could say: What we want to show... we want you to show that there was an intent to make a distribution with respect to stock at that time.  Whether or not it was a dividend, whether or not it was a return of capital, we won't know until the end of the year.  I suppose they could try to argue that.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  You mean to say the Government can't argue that this... the Defendant has to show that it was a distribution with respect to stock and that that was his intent.  Whether or not it was a dividend, whether or not it was a return of capital, we wait.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, at 97, are you saying that the expert would have brought with him financial records to show earnings and profits and basis?  Because I interpret the Government as saying there was nothing for him to testify to because there was no other... the basic value was not in the record.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1509
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Under your response to Justice Stevens, once you show that it was from a likely source of income that he received it, it's unreported, then it's the defendant's burden to go ahead and show this was a 301 distribution, that I had a basis that absorbed it, that there were no earnings and profits.  That's all for the defendant.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Let me get something clear.  They wish to introduce evidence.  And you say, oh, well, the proffer is no good because there is no basis, so there was no evidence.  I don't understand that.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Oh, I see.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

They are more experienced, so they are more dangerous to the State.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I'm not sure the offense is the same.

Or how long would the right-of-way last?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Can I ask you about the Bivens theory here before your time runs out?  Doesn't Davis versus Passman help the Respondent here?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well that's because we assume it's focused just on his property and that the property was ultimately the thing that was in issue.  But if you have all these other retaliatory actions, and wrongful actions taken by the Government tangential to this dispute, I take it Davis versus Passman, broadly read, says we can use Bivens if there is no other way to get a remedy against the Government.

Anthony M. Kennedy  I think it was in the context of a freestanding right, but let's leave that aside.   Anthony M. Kennedy  That's right.  It does seem to me that you are asking us to extend Bivens, this is an extension.  Would you accept that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  It's statutory.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But Professor Tribe, all these cases are cases in which there is... Nollan, you have a cause of action to challenge the permit and this is just a, this is just a constitutional defense.  That's different from a freestanding cause of action.  And I share Justice Scalia's concern.  It seems to me in thinking about this case there is... there could be something very wrong here, going after a person because of what he's done.  Suppose the Government wants somebody to be a witness in a trial and he won't do it, and they go around hurting his business, they go around invading his property and so forth.  That to me is outrageous and you might have an argument that there should be a Bivens cause of action for that.  And Justice Scalia's question... I had the same question... is why do we think it to the property?  The essence here, the essence of what's going on, is that they're being vindictive against this person.  Now again, the cases you're citing, include Hartman, which is a free speech case which is different, really don't support you.  I think this is an extension of Bivens.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

Kennedy  Could you tell us... as you know, AEDPA has the decisions of settled precedents of the Supreme Court and there's the Supreme Court standard, a very general standard that we can get from Darden and Donnelly, although we didn't reverse there.  I take it that the counsel for the Respondent is going to say: Well, this is a Federal standard, but the Eighth Circuit is entitled to apply the specificity and the application that it's given to this, so the Eighth Circuit's entitled to rely on its cases in reversing.  Do you agree with that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I assume that's what they're going to tell us.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Why.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, didn't he seek a COA?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  This is a pro se prisoner.  He gets his... all the claims are exhausted, it's dismissed.  And he seeks a COA on that point.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Why would it be applicable to State prosecutors if it is not a rule.  I don't understand that.  Is it applicable to a State prosecutor or not?  If a state prosecutor asked you for your advice, is this opinion applicable.  And you tell him yes or no.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But they must follow because it's the law, right?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, where did Chief Justice Stone get it from?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Where did Chief Justice Stone get it from?  Just because of our supervisory power?

You overrule... the judge said counsel, you can't argue about sending a message for life?   Anthony M. Kennedy  You... you think the trial court could tell the defense counsel that the defense counsel cannot argue to the jury, ladies and gentlemen there is nothing more precious than life and that's what we're asking you to decide here and we want you to assert the values of this community that we value life?  You can't say that?   Anthony M.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Would you agree that if we grant your position and grant you relief, that it would be something of an extension over Witt and Darden, in that the jurors in Witt and Darden had fixed views, that they were as a matter of conscience opposed to the penalty?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I understand that.  But I do think that the views of this juror, Deal, were somewhat more equivocal than in the cases I've mentioned.   Anthony M. Kennedy  It seems to me on that point that the State is somewhat surprised and whipsawed.  And I understand that the Washington court reached the issue.  It is not independent State ground.  I take it the prosecutor had some peremptories left?   Anthony M. Kennedy  How late in the process was... was Deal considered?  Was he one of the early jurors or one of the late jurors?   Anthony M. Kennedy  This was about a 17 day voir dire?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, that cuts a little bit against the peremptory.  I mean, if it was early in the game the prosecutor might not have exercised the peremptory.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Oh, I see.  So the whole jury is... I see.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But the point stands that the court of appeals was just incorrect in, in, in not noting what's there too late.  It's just not a fair summary of what the Washington Supreme Court did.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, what is... I know, Justice Breyer; just on this point.  The defense actually volunteered ""no objection"".   Michael R. Dreeben  Said ""We have no objection"".  And I think that this is one of the three significant legal errors that the Ninth Circuit made in disposing of this challenge.  This Court made clear in Wainwright versus Witt that the absence of a defense objection is very critical in assessing whether a judge's implied finding of bias is to be upheld on appeal.  And it's for the reason that my colleague mentioned in part: If the judge is not asked to give a fuller explanation, there is no reason--   Anthony M. Kennedy  If there is confusion, is that grounds for excluding him?   Michael R. Dreeben  Confusion alone is not.  If it's confusion it must rise to a level of preventing or impairing the juror's ability to follow the law.   ",06-413X

In fact, the... the... the lawyer doesn't just remain silent.  He's standing and says I have no objection.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

So you're incorrect.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  You think he could have imposed the death penalty in this case?   Anthony M.

So why am I here?  him.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I would like to hear the answer.   Anthony M. Kennedy  There were actually 12, I think.  Weren't there 12 objections by the prosecution?  I was going to ask, we've already destroyed the rebuttal time of your colleagues, but it seems to me that this is a large number of challenges by the prosecutor.  Can you comment on that?  12?  I mean, the defense objected to seven, and five objections were sustained.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Thank you.   Anthony M. Kennedy  No.  I think the prosecution challenged 12 times.  There were seven objections.  Five were sustained.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, let me put it to you this way: There's no demeanor finding here.  Suppose the judge had made a demeanor finding.  That would be different, the case would be a different case, wouldn't it?   Anthony M. Kennedy  And if the objection is what prevents the demeanor finding, then maybe we should be able to consider the fact there was no objection, even though Washington law doesn't require it before we consider the issue.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Does the fact that this is structural error, that there's no harmless error analysis, mean that we should be very careful to give substance to the rule that there's deference to the trial judge?  And in fact, in the Witt case, we said that the determination to excuse a juror is based on determinations of demeanor and credibility that are within the trial judge's province.  We said that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  What presumes that there is that judgment made by the district judge, whether or not it's mentioned?  It was not mentioned in Witt.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

I thought the ""in-connection-with"" argument is actually in addition to or separate from an additional argument you made that there was no deceptive statement made here.

Number one, I want to make sure you completed the quantification point that you made, and you pointed us to someplace in the record, because the Petitioner said, oh, it just costs a penny a package or something like that.  And then the second point, I think probably not related, is the question of knowledge.  I take it you're not contesting if there's actual knowledge that it's a minor that there can be a prosecution.  I'm not sure how that works if the company... because of the imputed knowledge.  Suppose an officer of the company or some shipping clerk knows it.  Wouldn't the company be liable if the company were subject to... those are two different questions.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Just on the knowledge point, I'm still not sure.  I don't want to ask you if you concede that knowing delivery would make you liable.  That's what the First Circuit said.

It's just, if you want attorney's fees, you have to accept a preliminary injunction for what it is.  It's very beneficial, but it is not a resolution on the merits that obligates the defendant to provide a form of final relief, not interim relief, to you.

Kennedy  And I don't think either side can avoid that fact.  He's suggesting that it cuts more in his favor than it does for yours because you are creating artificial barriers to that market.  So that when a person who knows about Kentucky bonds and who knows what the good ones are moves out of state, he all of a sudden loses the advantage to purchase those bonds anymore, or at least he does... he takes a penalty for doing that.  Let me... let me ask you this, the question I asked your co-counsel.  A and D get together and agree on reciprocal advantages for their... for their respective residents.  Is that constitutional?

One is the scienter component here.  Is that overly broad, vague, and so forth?  The other is the content.  And my concern is the same as that indicated by Justice Stevens at the outset.  There are some terrible practices in the child-trafficking area where children are held in brothels for the most debased of acts.  There are abuses in prisons, abuses in schools.  If there are videotapes showing those things, it seems to me that the statute is... that they're clearly covered by the statute, and maybe even a killing of a little girl in public might be sadistic.  Assume that that's covered by the statute.  Is there anything in the ""presents"" and the ""promotes"" language in the scienter component of the statute that gives some protection to these materials?  Is it just as-applied?

Kennedy  Well, if it's your position that the parties are not really injured or affected by this, and the parties' position is that they are, who should we believe?  I mean, it's hard for you to tell the parties that they don't know what's in their best interest.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, there is evidence that, in other States, those who preached racial hatred have tried to associate themselves with a particular party, much to the concern of that party, and I see nothing in your position that would prevent that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And is the remedy for the party, you said, to have more speech for the party, to say that this is not their candidate, etcetera?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

Kennedy  I was going to ask the counsel for the Respondents, and you can answer as well, can you explain to me briefly the existing structure for the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, to say Mr. Smith is our nominee?

INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Or is that just somewhat hyperbolic?  It seems to me he is right based on your... on the position you're now stating.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Suppose there were an empirical study that Washington voters know about this system, and that 80 percent of the Washington voters know that the party has not endorsed any one of these... all of these candidates.

Kennedy  Suppose in this case the President did the opposite... the same facts only the President said to Texas, do not comply with this judgment.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Can this court interpret the meaning of the Avena judgment if it's ambiguous?  For instance, it said that a number of Mexico nationals have not received a hearing.  It didn't say all of them.  And I have a problem, incidentally, because I think Medellin did receive all the hearing that he's entitled to under the judgment anyway.  Can we interpret the judgment in that respect if it's ambiguous, not clear?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Can we interpret the judgment?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  And what you are saying... and this has been the law--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --Go ahead.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Then this is consistent with what you've been explaining to Justice Breyer in your answer, that for 200 years we have had some treaties that are very important, but they're not self-executing; their violation may put us in violation of international law; but it is for us to determine how we are going to comply with the international obligation; and there is no obligation on the part of the State to comply with that law because it's not self-executing.   Anthony M. Kennedy  At some point I think in the course of your argument, we may get back to whether the Vienna Convention itself is or is not self-executing.  I think the Solicitor General was correct in saying that that's a difficult word.  I think it is self-executing in that the State has to comply with it.  I'm not sure that it is self-executing in that the State has to accept whatever procedural framework the foreign national demands.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And the United States apparently accepts the verdict of those--   Anthony M.

And the only question I have that I need your help with is as to the last, and I hope that it doesn't interrupt the train of your argument.  I think the ICJ... pardon me, the Vienna Convention is self-executing, in that it requires the States to conform to the consular notification provision.   Anthony M.

Kennedy  Could I make a distinction between failing to let him see the counsel at all in my hypothetical and a demand that the procedural framework be altered?

INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But you're... you're asking us to interpret the statute; and let us assume that it's a plausible interpretation and interpret the statute as the Petitioner would.  You know, under Section 8, the parties can use the authority of the court to libel a ship.  The court is extending its authority to... to use very intrusive means, and to say that the parties can't ensure, if they choose, to have review for correct errors of law... to correct errors of law when the ship has been seized, it seems to me to promote the whole purposes of the act.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, we're arguing about that textually.  I'm saying that there's nothing inconsistent with the Petitioner's position and the basic policies of the act.

Kennedy  But it does -- but it does in our cause and prejudice jurisprudence.  In habeas, which is also a civil action--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --we say there is an overarching Federal principle that allows -- because of cause and prejudice, we can consider the Federal issue.  We do that all the time.  Those cases weren't raised by the Petitioner, but it seems to me they're quite relevant here, especially when you consider the importance of the constitutional issue, which was not really -- let's face it -- clear to counsel on either side of the aisle or to the trial judge.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But the trial judge didn't have the benefit of -- of the ruling that this Court has subsequently made on that point.  The trial judge in fact here said: Now, if you can give me a case, then I'll give the instruction; you can't give me a case.  And she was right.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but I -- it sounds to me like that you are confirming my concerns.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Oh.  Oh, you're -- you're saying that if our law had been clear at the time, that she still wouldn't have given the instruction?  That's worse.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So your -- your contention is, is that this trial court and the counsel in the case had all the guidance necessary to give the correct instruction--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --before -- before we even announced the rule?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But we do that all the time in cause and prejudice cases.  We do it all the time--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --because of the importance of the constitutional right.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But it -- but it serves very little interest.  Nothing the trial judge would have done, nothing the plaintiffs' counsel would have done below, nothing the intermediate court would have done, would have -- would have been different if they had submitted -- what's it called -- the ""correct in all respects"" rule.  If they had filed the ""correct in all respects"" rule and submitted that, saying, excuse me, judge, I want to type a little piece of paper, everything would have been the same.

Anthony M. Kennedy  Did any -- did any point -- did the State at any point challenge the correctness, the propriety, of holding the Federal evidentiary hearing?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

And he felt that this would be devastating cross-examination material because the jury had already found the opposite.  So they've already disbelieved the expert on this point.  Now, it's true, it's true, that the knowledge of -- of wrongfulness is -- is probably slightly more extensive than premeditation.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, let me ask you this -- this question, and I don't mean to interrupt your answer, but it is based on what Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg have both been asking.  Hypothetical case: The city says, our test is not very good.  We need a new test.  The expert says, don't pay us to have a new one.  There are two great ones out there.  One is in City A.  The other is in City B.  Use either one of those.  They are great.  They check.  They find out that City A has a disparate impact in the statistical sense, not in the legal sense; that it disadvantages minorities, at least if you look at the passage rates.  The other test doesn't.  Are they permitted to take the test that doesn't have that differential?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  My -- my question is -- and you can answer, I guess, both under Title VII and -- and under the Fourteenth Amendment.  The city says, the only reason -- the only reason for our selecting the test from City B -- and both tests are very good tests -- is because minorities are better represented on the passing rate.  Is that permissible?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And do you find -- and do you find any constitutional deficiency in the city's choice in that hypothetical case?  Is there any Fourteenth Amendment problem?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No.  It was--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --It was designed to show, and maybe it's theoretical, but I want to know the answer so that I can understand this case.  It's designed to ask you the question whether or not race consciousness is ever permissible.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, counsel, you know, I've given law school examinations, looked at them, and bar examinations for years.  There's never been one, when I don't look at it after the fact and say, you know, this could be better, this -- this was not quite right.  So shouldn't there be some standard that there has to be a significant, a strong showing after the test has been taken that it's deficient?  Before it can be set aside?   Edwin S. Kneedler  --We -- we don't think so, and for several reasons.  First of all, the action that the employer has taken in response, as I just said, is not a racial classification response.  It is a facially neutral response where the -- where the employer has decided the test will -- perhaps we'll look for another standard which would be given and applied equally to all applicants.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But it looked at the--   Edwin S. Kneedler  --not the individual--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --Counsel, it looked at the results, and it classified the successful and unsuccessful applicants by race.   Edwin S. Kneedler  --It -- it--   Anthony M.

Kneedler  --No, with respect, it did not classify according to race; it looked in general terms.  It did not have the names of individual people.  It looked in general terms at what the racial disparity of the test was.  It just--   Anthony M.

And then we point out that each applicant didn't have his name, but they had his or her race.   Edwin S. Kneedler  --But the employer -- the employer was not making a decision to go forward and appoint individuals or promote individuals because of their race.

Kennedy  --I would like to talk just briefly about this point that the -- some of our hypotheticals where the test hadn't been given yet.  Here the test has been given.  And I had some concerns along the line of Justice Ginsburg's question.  She said, well, it's not a vested interest.  On the other hand, 2000e-(l)( 2) says that test results can't be altered.  There's a statutory interpretation question of whether that means they can't be used altogether.  Two points about the statute.  Number one, doesn't that diminish at least the force of the argument that this is a vested interest?  It means the tests are -- have a -- have a certain presumption in -- in their favor.  Secondly, on -- and maybe this is a question for the -- for the Petitioners rather than you.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  You mean the captain--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --is not a managerial officer for any purpose?  Suppose he decides that he's going to leave despite an adverse weather report?  Is he not a managerial agent at least for that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I'm... I'm asking about the concept of the managerial officer in general.  And I think that we can explore in this argument, whether or not The Amiable Nancy held very squarely about punitive damages, whether we ought to do so in the first instance.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And it seems to me a large part of that inquiry turns on what a managerial officer is and what... was Hazelwood not a managerial officer for any purpose at all?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But I don't think the conductor is on a par with a captain.  The captain has this huge vessel.  He can decide when it leaves.  He decides the course.  And I think that ""managerial officer"" might be a divisible concept.  Obviously, he doesn't bind Exxon for filing its tax returns or to decide whether there's a deduction.  But you are saying he binds Exxon for no purpose at all, ever.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Of course, we are talking about punitive damages but at the concept of a ""managerial officer"".  And I haven't heard why he isn't a managerial officer at least as to some things.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  You're talking about tradition.  It has never been the tradition for criminal statutes to have open ended penalties.  So that... that explains why the CWA has specific limits.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, perhaps that's a segue to point No. 3.  I don't wish to--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --to cut you off.  On point--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --On point No. 3--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --My only question is this: Assume that there will be punitive damages applicable to Exxon under maritime law in in case.  We have read in the briefs about the limits that should be imposed on these punitive damages.  And those are from our due process cases.  If we are deciding this case as a matter of our authority to determine Federal maritime law, are there factors that we should include in a punitive damages framework that do not... that do not appear in our due process cases?  And, if so, what are those factors?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And I take it, under that, you would point to the double... the provision for a fine double the amount of the damages?  That would be a factor?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I mean, if we're looking for guidelines--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --double general damages is a factor that we could... that we could follow in the maritime framework?   Anthony M. Kennedy  What would be the formulation of the rule if the Court thinks that any added amount would not deter, and how do we know that?  How do you formulate this rule?   INTERRUPTING ",07-219X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Do any of those cases say the managerial agent is liable if he violated express instructions from an employer?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Because that's what the last part of your instruction 33 says.  And it does seem to me that this captain may be managerial for some purposes and not others.  I think that's the way it's going to have to come out.  Maybe not.  But certainly he was not entitled to set aside the policy of Exxon that you cannot navigate a vessel while intoxicated.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But they have not conceded the accuracy or correctness of instruction 33.  And that's because he was not entitled to set aside the policy on intoxication.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No.  Your instruction says if he was a managerial agent, his acts are attributable to the corporation.  That's it.   Anthony M. Kennedy  So the corporation's responsibility or complicity or culpability is simply not relevant under your theory of the case, even though that's what you talk about in your brief.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So in your theory of the case, instruction 33, if the superior had told Hazelwood don't pilot the ship today, Exxon would still be liable?  That's your theory of the case under instruction 33?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Or the last part of the instruction 36, I think.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but that... that goes to measures, not to liability.   Anthony M. Kennedy  That was the first phase.  And that's the instruction, it seems to me, that you have to explain.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Correct me if I'm wrong.  You've read the case... our case in Cooper, which says that the appellate court has to examine de novo to determine the adequacy or the excessiveness of the award to deter.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, then, a fortiori, it gives us the right and the duty to do so as... sitting as a common law type court.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But the... the United States Code, the general criminal code, 18 U.S.C. 3571, has exactly that number.  It's... for... it's double the pecuniary loss for a criminal act.  And it seems to me, if when we're looking for guidance, as Justice Souter quite properly indicated we must, and Justice Scalia has indicated with reference to the Water Act, that this is... gives us a very valuable instruction.

You posed a number of questions to Justice Alito, or a number of responses, but to each one of those your own answer in the brief was no, and therefore your question... the answer to Justice Alito's question should be no, there is no system that you know of that can impose a photo ID.

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  One of the concerns, Mr. Dellinger, of the framers, was not to establish a practice of amending the Constitution and its important provisions, and it seems to me that there is an interpretation of the Second Amendment differing from that of the district court and in Miller and not advanced particularly in the red brief, but that conforms the two clauses and in effect delinks them.  The first clause I submit can be read consistently with the purpose I've indicated of simply reaffirming the existence and the importance of the militia clauses.  Those were very important clauses.  As you've indicated, they're in Article I and Article II.  And so in effect the amendment says we reaffirm the right to have a militia, we've established it, but in addition, there is a right to bear arms.  Can you comment on that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  And this makes, it does... I think you're quite right in the brief to say that the preface shouldn't be extraneous.  This means it's not extraneous.  The Constitution reaffirms the rights, reaffirm several principles: The right of the people to peaceably assemble, the right to be secure in their homes, the Tenth Amendment reaffirms the rights, and this is simply a reaffirmation of the militia clause.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well the subject is ""arms"" in both clauses, as I've suggested is the common subject, and they're closely related.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, do you think the clause, the second clause, the operative clause, is related to something other than the militia?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  All right.  Well, then--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --It had nothing to do with the concern of the remote settler to defend himself and his family against hostile Indian tribes and outlaws, wolves and bears and grizzlies and things like that?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But the Second... the Second Amendment doesn't repeal that.  You don't take the position that Congress no longer has the power to organize, arm, and discipline the militia, do you?   Anthony M. Kennedy  So it was supplementing it.  And my question is, the question before us, is how and to what extent did it supplement it.  And in my view it supplemented it by saying there's a general right to bear arms quite without reference to the militia either way.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, there's no question that the English struggled with how to work this.  You couldn't conceal a gun and you also couldn't carry it, but yet you had a right to have it.  Let me ask you this: Do you think the Second Amendment is more restrictive or more expansive of the right than the English Bill of Rights in 1689?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I think that would be more restrictive.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  The purposes of what?   Anthony M. Kennedy  You said there is no showing that rifles and handguns.  I think you meant rifles and other guns.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Is necessary for the purpose of what?  What is the purpose?   Anthony M. Kennedy  If I could just have one follow-on on Justice Ginsburg real quick.  Do those States... Justice Ginsburg asked... that distinguish among weapons, State constitutional provisions do not do so?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Because I did interrupt Justice Breyer.   Anthony M. Kennedy  So in your view this amendment has nothing to do with the right of people living in the wilderness to protect themselves, despite maybe an attempt by the Federal Government, which is what the Second Amendment applies to, to take away their weapons?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I agree that Miller is consistent with what you've just said, but it seems to me Miller, which kind of ends abruptly as an opinion writing anyway, is just insufficient to subscribe... to describe the interests that must have been foremost in the framers' minds when they were concerned about guns being taken away from the people who needed them for their defense.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  You think Madison was guided by the experience and the expressions of the right in English law, including the Bill of Rights of 1689?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Or would you say like protecting yourself against intruders in the home?   ",07-290X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Could it also be simply to reaffirm that the provisions in the main text of the Constitution remain intact?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But you were about to tell us before the course of the questioning began about the other purposes that the amendment served.  I'm... I want to know whether or not, in your view, the operative clause of the amendment protects, or was designed to protect in an earlier time, the settler in the wilderness and his right to have a gun against some conceivable Federal enactment which would prohibit him from having any guns?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That are not appropriate to--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --It seems to me that Miller, as we're discussing it now, and the whole idea that the militia clause has a major effect in interpreting the operative clause is both overinclusive and underinclusive.  I would have to agree with Justice Ginsburg that a machine gun is probably more related to the militia now than a pistol is.  But that... that seems to me to be allowing the militia clause to make no sense out of the operative clause in present-day circumstances.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  My point is: Why is that of any real relevance to the situation that faces the homeowner today?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, you're being faithful to Miller.  I suggest that Miller may be deficient.   Anthony M.

Are there any complexities like that?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But in none of these cases did they have those sorts of problems?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Here there was a payment.   Anthony M. Kennedy  It's different than if you try to enjoin the collection at the outset.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So that argument doesn't work.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but if we... if we accept your view in this case, they can go in a district court and enjoin them.  It's not a tax.  The Tax Injunction Act doesn't apply.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And... which is just what Justice Ginsburg's questions point out.  And earlier I had indicated that in this case they did pay the tax.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So it seems to me there is a distinction.  It may be that you would prevail in your argument.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  If they tried... if they tried... do you think they could enjoin the collection of a tax refund?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

You're saying it isn't a tax for your purposes, and then in my hypothetical case you say you have to go through the tax law.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

Suppose a transaction... there's no bankruptcy.  A transaction is completed.  Stamps are paid.  There is then a suit to rescind the transaction on the ground of fraud or mistake.  Do you get your money back from the stamp tax?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I can understand... just taking a quick look at 365(g), why it serves a different purpose and a different function.

Not Davis... Reynolds?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Reynolds... to receive, is it, unlimited contributions from his own party?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Suppose you had a statute which either explicitly said or has the effect, as this does, that the less wealthy challenger, the challenger in Reynolds' position, has more access and more support from his party than the challenger does from his party?  What is your best case that indicates that that is unconstitutional, and what is your argument that that is unconstitutional?   Anthony M. Kennedy  That concerns me in this.  What is your best argument that differential treatment of the candidates vis-a-vis support from their respective parties is unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  The statute makes that distinction.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And it seems to me that that distinction is somewhat questionable, and I'm asking you for your best statement of the theory as to why it's unconstitutional and your best case to show that it's unconstitutional.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But you make that argument to the statute generally.  Is there any more specific argument that you can make in the context of the less well-funded candidate having more support from the party than the well-funded candidate had?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

You're saying, the government is saying, the statute says, that the underfunded candidate has less access to coordinated expenditures with the party than... than the other party... than the other candidate.  And the cases have acknowledge, the statute acknowledges, that coordinated expenditures have a particularly potent force, and you are saying candidates are treated differently in the access to this kind of speech.  And I know of no precedent of this Court that says one party is entitled to assistance from a certain segment and another party is not, based on the... the content of the speech.  And that's exactly what this is.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But it's in the statute and it's part of the challenge.  I agree that it's been given a relatively minor position, but it's of great concern to me because it puts this Court, it puts this statute, in the position of preferring one kind of speech over another.  And we simply do not do that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Are you saying that argument is not properly before us when we are judging the validity of the statute that's been challenged?

Kennedy  Must always have a reason for the actions it takes.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes, those are all tax cases, or in Olech, 30 feet as opposed to 15 feet, where there was a clear difference that was not... but there was also an allegation of an invidious motive.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It's just hard for me to get that sweeping provision out of Olech.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you think Olech was wrongly decided?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I don't find anything in Olech that says that every action that does not have a reason is constitutionally infirm.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Ma'am, the reason that we didn't say that same thing in Oleck is because in the taxation area or the easement area we simply don't have the great number of cases and also because animus is more easily established.   Lisa S. Blatt  It is similar.  And in the regulatory context a personality conflict is not a legitimate basis for adversely treating citizens.  But a personality conflict between a supervisor and a subordinate is generally, if not always, a legitimate basis for adversely treating an employee.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But a public employee applies for a 30-foot easement that he is entitled to, and doesn't receive it; and the mayor says and by the way I don't like you, so you're fired: A, you don't get the easement, B, you're fired.  Why... why do we treat the cases differently?  Other than the floodgate argument etcetera?   Lisa S. Blatt  Well, if the mayor doesn't give the employee a grievance, in her capacity as a citizen she has a suit under Olech; but in her termination claim, she... unless she can allege membership in an identifiable class, she doesn't have an equal protection right to be free from just pure arbitrariness... 16--   Anthony M. Kennedy  But that just states your conclusion.  I want to know why this is.   Lisa S. Blatt  --Why?  Because personality conflicts have no role in the regulatory context and they generally if not always are the legitimate basis for a personnel decision.  It's just that... they say this example, well, employer doesn't like you; that's sufficient; but the other side never tells you how far they would take that.  Is it because the conflict arose in the workplace; is it because it arose from their neighborhood; is it because it arose from the high school debate team or law review or cheerleading squad and that's why the person wasn't hired?  And we would have courts having just to go, judge by judge and court, and in their case, jury by jury, for these kinds of decisions; and these shouldn't be constitutional cases.  These are more properly resolved under merit service protection laws and collective bargaining agreements.   Anthony M. Kennedy  So we should cite there is no constitutional right to be a policeman?  We can revise that?   Lisa S. Blatt  Well, no.  I mean, there are lots of constitutional limits on public employment.  What we are talking about is where you've reduced at will for a null set, and there is any claim for arbitrary conduct.  I mean, we would allow under our theory any claim that is not just a residual ill will or bad motive states a valid equal protection case.  And this is many, many statutory protections as well.

Kennedy  But we are concerned about the case... let's just assume, just take it as a hypothetical case... where there is an arbitrary and vindictive reason for hiring the employee and it has nothing to do with race, sex, or other recognized suspect or improper categories.

Kennedy  It seems to me that you want us to write an opinion that says there are some instances where the government can act arbitrarily and unreasonably.   Anthony M.

INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  In your answer, you said, well, there would be this stack of affidavits and that's all the State would have to do.  I think, Mr. Fisher, that was not quite responsive because the question here is whether or not there is an exception for business records.  Nobody is talking about affidavits, witnesses, and so forth.  We are talking about business records done in the ordinary course.  It's true that it -- that the core principle is whether that confrontation is required, but the question is whether or not business records should be treated as something that are not testimony because they are done based on other protocols with other procedures where there is substantial insulation from the facts of the particular case because it's a routine scientific exercise.  So I think your answer, I would agree, is responsive based on your theory of the case, but as a matter of practice and as a matter of the issue that's before the Court, I don't think it addresses it.

I thought you said that that suffices.   ",07-591X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  It seems to me -- and tell me if this is not the way you want to argue.  It seems to me to make your case you have to say of course this is hearsay; and the question is whether it's testimonial.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And it's not testimonial because these are laboratory protocols, subject to ongoing, objective, repeated standards; that's different from testimony that it was a blue car, which is specific to the case.  That's the kind of framework of the argument you have to make.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And that as a result of that it is not testimonial because ""testimonial"" is a legal term that's subject to interpretation.  I -- I guess that's the argument you're making and that you have to make.   Anthony M. Kennedy  As I see it.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Of course the problem was in -- I think it was Hammond was the companion case to David.   Anthony M. Kennedy  The -- the 911 call was done for other -- really other purposes.  It wasn't testimonial because it wasn't really directed to trial.  This does seem more directed to trial, so then you have to tell us why even if it is, there are some independent guarantees of -- of reliability that means that we should say it's not testimonial as a legal matter.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, do you have to have a machine?  I mean, what about -- what about ballistics?  ""This bullet came from that gun. ""  Does that involve sufficient discretion, sufficient judgment that the expert has to be there, while the blood -- blood or drug testing doesn't?  It seems to me that's where you have to draw the line.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And to say that that wasn't raised in the case, this is precisely the question we are going to have to decide if you're going to prevail.  I don't think it helps to say it wasn't raised in the case.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  We are raising it.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I do wish you would comment on the argument that the State of California -- a huge state with many, many drug prosecutions -- seems to get along all right under the rule that the Petitioner proposes.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  If the State of California and other populous States have for, I take it, some number of years been able to function quite effectively under the rule that the Petitioner proposes, it seems to me that's something that you have to address.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Why would it be undue for California and not for -- are you accepting the fact that in California it's a workable rule and it's caused no problems?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That's a non-answer.  We are asking what's the rule?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Can you submit it on the affidavit, as the Chief Justice said under your theory of the case?   Anthony M. Kennedy  You'd try to have some different hypothesis?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But you have to have some boundaries, you have to have some framework, you have to have some explanation.  You started talking about a machine.  There is no machine in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, so it seems to me you have two different rationales floating around here and -- and neither are tethered to a specific rule.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --It seems to me you have to do that because there is all sorts of machines that have to be interpreted.  There -- a chromatic spectrum analysis; the person has to say what he saw there, what she saw there.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So just because the machine is involved it seems to me we cannot make a sensible rule based on that.   ",07-591X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, if we don't call it ""insurance"", can we all it ""pooling""?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I did want to understand your position.  Suppose there is a statewide contract for public employees and one union brings a suit to interpret a provision of that collective bargaining agreement having to do with overtime or holidays or something.  And then it notifies the other union, we're going to have to drop this litigation because we can't afford it.  Even though it ultimately may affect you down the line, you're not a party.  I don't see the harm in allowing the other union to subsidize or contribute -- use whatever verb you want -- that litigation -- that litigation.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  What -- what -- what harm are we trying to prevent here?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  The First Amendment can be -- can be a sword or a shield.  This union wants to use it as a sword in order to promote, in order to protect its rights under the collective bargaining agreement.  I don't see the harm.   Anthony M. Kennedy  That's not quite the hypothetical.  Let's say there are two bargaining agreements but they're identical, and that this litigation that's underway will have persuasive force for the union that's thinking about entering, and then the union decides that it is going to enter to help the union involved in the suit, and the members of the, of the contributing union object and you say they have a First Amendment right.  That's your point?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I don't see why the objects of collective bargaining the, objects of union -- of the union, are not being fulfilled.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Could you tell us two hypotheticals.  One is the librarian, two is the public celebration.  Would nonunion, would participating unions be allowed to contribute to either of those activities?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Against nonmembers?  Against members, there has to be a pro-ration, they has to be a pro-ration.  A with the librarian, B with the celebration.   ",07-610X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, one of the difficulties it seems to me is the Petitioner's position with the sort of all or nothing approach.  But you seemed to be taking the mirror position of that.  Your argument is all or nothing on your side.  I don't get much help from either side as to what the standard should be.  I know germane is obviously a malleable word, but we are looking to see if there is some test that we can use that's not all or nothing.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I haven't heard from either side yet what that would be.   ",07-610X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  I was going to ask that question.  In other words, there are cases or at least it is contemplated that there will be cases under the rules, where the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal does determine that there should or should not be an offset.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But going back to the main issue, the only reason that this is at issue before the Iran tribunal is because it might be a setoff in the event of judgment in favor of Iran?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But how is that affected -- how is that affected depending on whether or not the judgment is executed or not.  Would the Iran tribunal have the authority to order Cubic not to satisfy the judgment, but to just hold the funds?     --I -- I don't know.  Cubic is not before the tribunal.  But what we can ask is, can we conceive of -- and I think it's relatively easy to conceive of -- an award of the tribunal that says, the United States owes Iran $2.8 million; if the Cubic judgment is received by Iran, the United States owes Iran nothing.  And clearly, in that circumstance, the Cubic judgment is the subject of the award of the tribunal.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I don't know that it's the subject of the award.  And it's really not at issue; it's just recognizing that there has been some prior transaction.     Well, I guess, Your Honor, you have to think what does it mean for any property -- property to be at issue before the tribunal or the subject of the award?   ",07-615X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  But Iran might say in the tribunal, in responding to the setoff argument, this claim that we brought against you, the United States, implicates a breach of obligations that you have that are un -- somewhat unrelated to what was at issue in the -- in the -- in the Cubic judgment.  And then the United States would say, no, that's not true.  So they would have to examine the Cubic judgment.  So that means it's at issue before the court.   Anthony M. Kennedy  There might be in the setoff proceedings.  There might -- there might be an argument that there are two obligations, and there is a setoff or that there is a setoff.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I think we might get--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --substantial -- a substantial degree of argument on that point.   ",07-615X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  But again as a preliminary matter, am I on the same page with Justice Ginsburg?  Or would it be a different question?  I'm curious to know why the beneficiary designation and change provisions at page 48, number 29c, beneficiaries, couldn't have been invoked here.  Is that the same question Justice Ginsburg was asking?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Because the plan does contain a procedure for designating some other beneficiary, including the spouse.  I just don't understand why anybody doesn't talk about that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, of course, that was the point of my earlier point.  I focused on -- on this whole paragraph.   Anthony M. Kennedy  That just indicates that this would have been a different case if the provision of the plan that said there shall be no assignment, which is quoted in the Fifth Circuit thing, was the only provision in the plan; but when you look through this in retrospect, there are means for participants and beneficiaries to make a change, and they weren't followed here.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And I understand that you say in effect they were.  I understand that argument but it's not as if the plan didn't contain an adequate vehicle if the -- the parties had followed strictly the terms of the plan.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  What do you want me to read here?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, are the provisions of page 49 of the appendix consistent with the statute?   Leondra R. Kruger  Indeed, Your Honor, we think that they are.  The statute directs plan administrators to administer the plan in accordance with the plan documents and further requires administrators to pay benefits to persons who are either participants under the plan or who are beneficiaries within the meaning of the statute.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Did the Court of Appeals give short shrift or overlook that point?   Leondra R. Kruger  Well, the Court of Appeals determined that it need not reach this point because it decided the case on different grounds; namely, the anti-alienation grounds.  But, again, we think that if the Fifth Circuit was incorrect in its reasoning but reached the correct overall conclusion, then its judgment should be affirmed.   ",07-636X

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --And I don't want to interrupt your answer to the Chief Justice because I think it's critical, critical to your argument.  As a procedural matter, I thought that the Establishment Clause issue was raised in the initial complaint.  Are you taking the position it's now waived or something?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It was under the State?   Anthony M. Kennedy  If you prevail, the action should be dismissed, as far as you're concerned?   Anthony M. Kennedy  All right.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Then getting back to the Chief Justice's point, it does seem to me that if you say it's Government speech that in later cases, including the case of the existing monument, you're going to say it's Government speech and you have an Establishment Clause problem.  I don't know if -- I'm not saying it would necessarily be resolved one way or the other, but it certainly raises--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --an Establishment Clause problem.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you have to--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --Did the NEA -- Finley v. NEA, the Court didn't treat that as Government speech.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Or am I -- is that the--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --But, Justice Stevens's question is important, maybe not for your case but for other cases.  We are deciding this for other cases to arise, and why isn't he correct that if you don't like the message then that raises a content-based claim?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I understand that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But it doesn't seem to me that you have to make the Government speech argument for you to make the argument that you just made.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And the same question Justice Stevens had, just to tack onto his question here, your answer was: Oh, well, the Government owns it.  Suppose the Government says: We will accept ownership only if we agree with the message.  That just puts his question.  I think the ownership argument is -- is not an answer to the Justice's question.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, under the Equal Protection Clause would -- if you wrote an Equal Protection Clause opinion, you would end up saying it's content-based.  That's the First Amendment.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I -- I don't think that can you avoid the hard part by saying, oh, other amendments of the Constitution might apply.  The heart of the question is whether the Government may discriminate based on content, and that's a First Amendment question.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Does the law always require us to adopt an all-or-nothing position?  Aren't there some extreme cases indicated by the hypothetical where the First Amendment does enter in?  Do we have to decide this case that it's all or nothing?   INTERRUPTING ",07-665X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Those are time, place, and manner regulations, with which we are all familiar.  But my concern is that this -- this case is an example of the tyrannies -- of the tyranny of labels.  Because it's a public forum, as Justice Scalia indicated, for parades, for protests, which are limited temporally, it -- it -- it just seems wooden and rigid to say to all of a sudden say, well, it's a public forum for something that will last 30 years for which there is only limited space.  It just doesn't make common sense.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  You're saying the last generation had much more freedom than the present one?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, your -- you can stick with it as long as you want; that's what the -- the Tenth Circuit did, but suppose that we were to say that we were unconvinced by the comparison between speeches and parades on the one hand and monuments on the other, so we did not apply the public forum analogy.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  That's what I wanted to know, and it gets back to the merits and not Saucier.  We are going through two different things here.  Assume this is an undercover officer, not an -- not a -- not an informant.  Now, the undercover officer sees a crime being committed, and he is ready to make the arrest.  Can he automatically ask for police assistance and -- and other policemen?  Are the police then entitled to come into the home in your view, or do there have to be some exigent circumstances?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Just -- just to be clear, if -- if I may, I know your red light is on: Your position is if an undercover officer is in the premises and sees a crime being committed, he automatically can invite police in to assist him in making an arrest without exigent circumstances?   Anthony M. Kennedy  What's -- what do I read?  What authority do you cite me for that proposition?   ",07-751X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, you would agree he could make the -- the arrest by himself.  Assuming he was a police officer--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --he could make the arrest by himself.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But -- and -- but you are saying he can't ask for assistance to make that arrest effective in all cases.  There has to be some exigent circumstance.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, it seems to me that in the case that Justice Alito put, that there are exigent circumstances.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, that -- that's a different point and I have some question about that.  It seems to me the police are never quite sure exactly what's going to happen.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It seems to me that this is an area where the police do need guidance, and I need guidance.  I find this -- I find this very difficult.  It seems to me that we could have learned a lot if the -- if the courts of appeals had addressed this question.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Which is what they do in Saucier.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Which is what they would do under Saucier.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So the police say, you know, we made a mistake.  We should have had a warrant, but we have our man in there now, we have got to do something.  The police cannot send assistance?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No.  You say they have created the exigent circumstances.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So -- so my first statement was correct.  It's illegal for the police to send their assistance, the other officers in?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And you say as a practical matter we have to say that under the Constitution we can endanger -- we must endanger the officer?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No, no.  The hypothetical is that they have to send people in to assist him.  But the hypothetical also is they should have anticipated this, and therefore, in your words, they created exigent circumstances.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It seems to me that dilemma and that paradox casts considerable doubt on your proposition that if the police create the exigent circumstances, they cannot rely on it.  I seriously question that proposition.   Anthony M. Kennedy  No, no.  I want to talk about the general rule.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  You want us to write an opinion saying that any time police create the exigent circumstances, they can't rely on them if they had had the time to get a warrant.

Kennedy  Well, but you don't take the position, do you, or do you, that Washington law conforms to the Model Penal Code?  I thought the Model Penal Code was much more defendant-friendly than you're stating.   Anthony M. Kennedy  So you're -- would -- would you say that the trial court in Washington states law correctly if it says that being accomplice you have to have a purpose to facilitate the commission of the crime?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But you agree there is a difference in ""knowing"" and ""purpose""?   Anthony M. Kennedy  It's toward the bottom of page 123.

So the defense bears some responsibility for not -- for -- number one, it didn't have a coherent theory either.   Anthony M. Kennedy  No objection from defense counsel.   Anthony M.

So you define ""look through"" as -- under our hypothetical here as looking through to all people who might potentially be parties under this arbitration agreement.   Anthony M.

You couldn't -- you could decide the case completely in No. 1, the diversity case, but not in No. 2.  So there -- so there is a difference.

1,"Anthony M.

They have to get preclearance in the event that they prevail?  And then the other side has to get preclearance in the event that it doesn't.  I mean, is that the way it would work in your view?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  If I'm in State trial court, how can I make a ruling if... assuming the respondents win in this case, if I know there has to be preclearance?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I suppose States get... State courts get preclearance all the time with district changes, don't they?  Or how does it work?  They just hold the judgment in abeyance until there is preclearance, and couldn't... and if so, couldn't do you that here?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But you said in answer to Justice Souter that this is your case.  There is no law that's precleared.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Even in the hypothetical Justice Souter proposes, I don't know the rules in Alabama, but I can see a Federal court saying: Well, this is premature; it hasn't been precleared; why should I pass on the validity of something that might not be precleared?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  How does that apply to a State statute which is fully enacted and then there's going to be a challenge?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I take it it's your position... and I noticed this in the question put to you by Justice Breyer... tell me if this is wrong, but that it's not just the fact that the court makes a decision, because the court may have discretion to choose plan one, plan two, plan three, but it is if the court makes a decision to show that the prior practice was invalid, was void under State law.

A county council goes to the board of commissioners or the board of supervisors of the local county or legislative branch and says: The legislature has just adjourned; it passed a lot of laws, and one of the laws it passed is that that you now have to set the qualifications locally for certain officials, so we have to act on this right away.  They pass the legislation.  Three weeks go by.  The county council says: You know, I made a mistake; that law was never passed; it was never signed by the governor.  What rule?  What result?

This is somewhat different.  This is -- this is a long-term commitment or a long-term policy that the Respondents are arguing for.  It seems to me somewhat different than the dynamics that inform the Imbler decision.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I -- I suppose that is why the Petitioners seemed to change their theory.  They -- they -- they were -- they were concerned about prosecutorial immunity, so they take it to the higher level of policy.  When -- when they do that, I suppose they might have the stronger argument if they could show deliberate indifference.  Are there cases that help them on the ""deliberate indifference""?

I've been looking for ways to examine this case.  The public forum doesn't really work for me.  Subsidy doesn't really work for me.  It seems to me to be an unconstitutional-condition case.  At least that's the argument.  That doesn't mean you necessarily can't prevail.  But suppose the State told the city: You can't have a parade that you sponsor for this particular cause.  That would raise an unconstitutional-conditions argument; wouldn't it?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Why isn't it?  And I say that because I think that follows on Justice Stevens's line of questioning.  I didn't mean to interrupt him, but it seems to me that is consistent with what he is asking.   Anthony M.

Anthony M. Kennedy  Right.   Anthony M. Kennedy  There is -- there is a case out of the Ninth Circuit, and it was affirmed by this Court on a procedural point, but not on a -- not on the merits -- out of the neighboring State of Washington, where the State says a locality cannot build a dam more than 25 feet high.  The locality then gets a license from the Federal Power Commission, and the State said, well, you still don't have this authority.  And the Ninth Circuit said you do.  The Federal power then supersedes.  Would you agree that that case is valid?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

You had conceded below, and I thought I saw this in your brief as well, that as to the State of Idaho, its determination not to allow the deductibility is permissible.   Anthony M.

Kennedy  And if -- and if a State had a system in which all payroll deductions were -- by local entities -- were routinely controlled by the State, the State did all the pay roles for the local entities, then it -- in that case the nondeductibility would also be permitted, I take it.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Suppose the State at the State level says this is a contentious area, we want to stay out of it.  We are going to be neutral.  We are simply not allowing payroll deduction for right to work clauses, for union clauses.  We don't want this.  If the State can say that, and your concession indicates to me that it can, then why can't it tell its subdivisions you have to be efficient, we don't want arguments from one city to the next city about payroll deduction that's going to consume the time of the city council's, the time of the citizens, we want to take this off the table for you just the way we've taken it off the table for us?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, of course, that's the interest.  This is a very strong Federal interest in allowing the States to organize their governmental systems the way they choose.  Our gun control registration case, where we said the Federal Government cannot tell the counties that it has certain duties for gun control.   Anthony M.

INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, again in the hypothetical context, could Congress enforce by a statute what it requires in the attestation clause?   Anthony M. Kennedy  So you think the attestation clause cannot be the basis for sanctioning an attorney?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I mean, how can that be if it's too vague.   Anthony M. Kennedy  The attestation clause is designed to ensure that the attorney has performed in an ethical and proper way, I take it.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Isn't that one of its purposes?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I won't take up too much more of your argument, but it just seems to me odd that you can enforce an attestation clause, but not a statute that does the same thing.

INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So then the client is not required to -- the creditor is not required to appeal?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  All right.  So I don't think they could have -- and of course, you don't think it's void.  It could come in under 60(b) if it's void, but you don't think it's void.   Anthony M. Kennedy  All right.  So you have to show mistake or surprise, and you doubt that there was a mistake or surprise here.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Let me just ask this and maybe I have bankruptcy law wrong.  My -- my understanding is that if creditors are not listed, they are not discharged, correct?  I think that's right in most cases.  If you don't list the creditor, the creditor is not discharged.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I'm -- if you're having problems with this--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --I'm just wondering, doesn't it happen all the time that creditors are not listed and then they come in later and say the debt is not discharged?  I mean, doesn't that happen all the time?   Anthony M. Kennedy  And is -- is the rationale that that -- that that discharge would be void as to them, or that they are just not covered?  Suppose the bankruptcy judge makes a mistake and lists a creditor by name as being discharged, but that creditor never received notice.  Is it void?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, is this -- is this case all that different, then?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  He got notice of something that was void.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I mean, that -- that -- that assumes that he got notice of something that was legally improper.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I'm not sure there was proper notice.  There was not a notice that there would be a contested hearing.  Or that there would be an adversary hearing.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I'm -- I'm not sure that there was a proper notice.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, of course that's the problem in the case.  Sometimes we decide cases that don't make a lot of difference and that once we decide the rule everybody will know what the rule is.  But in this case, the Petitioners say that if we adopt the rule that the Ninth Circuit adopted, it's going to be extremely burdensome and costly on -- on municipalities, on -- on those who give student loans, et cetera.  And that -- and that you are just creating a tremendous burden on an already overburdened system.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  On the practicality point, you talk about electronic notice.  I suppose that that -- that the creditors for student loans could have the automatic electronic thing where they say, we insist on a hardship hearing.  But that doesn't solve the problem, because they'd then have to go back and see whether or not there was a hardship hearing in the case.  So that -- that means they have -- they have -- they have to -- they have to inquire into every case whether or not the proper hearing has been made.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

Kennedy  Well, except that I think most trial judges would have admitted this evidence with the proper instruction to the jury, that it's background evidence so you -- you can't tell the jury the story and just begin in 2001, or it doesn't make much sense to them.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Now, I agree there was not a proper instruction here, there should have been an objection, and so forth.  But in an ordinary trial, this evidence would have come in with the proper limiting instruction.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Of -- of -- of course, the jury would have to be instructed very carefully.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And this was a long -- a long jury deliberation.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, you can be pleased that I was not the trial judge.  [Laughter]   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I -- I thought what we have said that it's just a violation of due process to convict someone for conduct that was not criminal when the conduct was -- was made.  It's -- it's -- it's just a due process -- it's a due process violation.  It just -- it's a serious due process violation.   INTERRUPTING ",08-1341
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  But -- but I suppose the thrust of Justice Stevens's question was that if you have a very small population that we are concerned with, then the disparity can be very substantial, especially if you use the comparative disparity.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And I think -- at least, I was interested in that aspect of his question.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes, but we have a halfhour.  I'd kind of like to know how to--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --Are you -- are you saying that systematic exclusion -- and we are assuming good faith, no intent to discriminate--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --that systematic exclusion is always proven or disproven by statistics?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --And I'll -- I'll allow you to answer, of course, but--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --If not, how do we show systematic exclusion?  Again, assuming good faith, no intent to discriminate.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Let me get that.  If -- if a procedure routinely results in statistical underrepresentation that is significant, is that not a clear showing of systematic exclusion?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, yes -- no, that's -- it's a hypothetical.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Routinely results in significant underrepresentation, then that is automatically systematic exclusion?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I mean, isn't the -- I'm trying to think about the third prong of -- of--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --of Duren.  Isn't -- if it's routine and it's predictable and it's constant, isn't that always due to systematic exclusion?   INTERRUPTING ",08-1402

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  The government is going to tell us that the standard for waiver with respect to the Federal Government is different from the standard with respect to the State.  Do you -- I think that's what they are going to tell us.  Do you agree with that?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But it seems to me that the States are in need of special protection.  With -- with the Congress, if it's a Federal immunity, the Congress can always -- always change its law.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That just can't happen with the State.   Anthony M. Kennedy  It's the suggestion of the opposite that -- that I am trying -- I am trying to explore.  You have your white light on.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But we are talking about general principles of interpretation and the proposition that we are suggesting is that the State surely should be entitled to the same dignity, the same protection against suits as the Federal Government, and you suggest just the opposite.   Sarah Harrington  --No, Your Honor.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And it seems to me that's contrary to standard principles of the Federal -- of protecting the Federal balance.   Sarah Harrington  If you were construing a State statute that voluntarily waived its own immunity, then you might -- we might say the use of appropriate relief in that statute should be construed the same as the use of appropriate relief in RFRA.  But in this case you are not talking about a State's waiver of its immunity through its -- through statutory language.  The Court said in College Savings Bank that when a -- when a State takes Federal funds that are conditioned on a waiver of immunity, it is the act of accepting the funds that is the waiver and it waives its immunity to suits to the extent that it has noticed that it is doing so.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But it's -- but it's only because they accept the funds at all that the Spending -- that the Spending Clause is even operative.   Sarah Harrington  That's right.  But again, it's -- it's the act of accepting the funds that are clearly conditioned that constitutes the waiver.  So that the waiver--   ",08-1438
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  And I'm -- this one question may be covered, but can you give me any examples where States have turned down money under the Spending Clause, say we don't want it, the restrictions are too great?  Does this happen all the time, or ever?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Where States tell the Federal Government: No, thank you, we don't want the money.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Under programs like this?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I mean other States -- they say, oh, the liabilities are just too great, we don't want it?   Anthony M. Kennedy  You -- you have already addressed this but I think it's their -- the position of your friend on the other side of the case is that with the Spending Clause you have a contract.  The State has some extra protection, and therefore we need not be quite so strict in -- in construing waivers -- waivers of immunity, because you have the contract.  Can you comment on that argument?  And -- and you might want to say that the Spending Clause is potentially so sweeping that the State should have special protection and we should be particularly careful about the clear statement rule.  Or do you think the clear statement rule applies with equal force whether it's a Spending Clause or a direct regulation under say, the Fourteenth Amendment?   ",08-1438
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Let me just make one comment on that point.  It seems to me all or at least the great majority of the questions today are designed to probe whether or not this statute is vague.  And you say the beauty of the statute is that it utilizes the categories that have been used in the obscenity area, and that there's an obvious parallel there.  The problem is, is that for generations there has been a societal consensus about sexual material.  Sex and violence have both been around a long time, but there is a societal consensus about what's offensive for sexual material and there are judicial discussions on it.  Now, those judicial discussions are not precise.  You could have had the same questions today with reference to an obscenity statute, and we have -- we have said that, with reference to obscenity there are certain -- that there are certain materials that are not protected.  Those rules are not precise at the margins and some would say not precise in a more significant degree as well.  But you are asking us to go into an entirely new area where there is no consensus, no judicial opinions.  And this is -- and this indicates to me the statute might be vague, and I just thought you would like to know that -- that reaction.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I can see your white light is on.  But even if we get past what I think are difficult questions about vagueness and how to interpret this law, isn't there a less restrictive alternative with the -- the V-Chip?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.   Anthony M. Kennedy  V-Chips don't work?   ",08-1448
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Why couldn't you make the same arguments with respect to the obscenity statutes?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Why shouldn't violence be treated the same as obscenity?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, the Court -- the Court struggled for many, many years and to some extent is still struggling with obscenity.  They came up with basically what we might call the Miller standards, and -- and the State has said this gives us a category that we can work with, with reference to violence.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  You can make all those arguments with reference to obscenity.   ",08-1448
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, just on this same point before Justice Breyer I think moves to another point.  The statute does use the word ""quorum"" twice and, as Justice Ginsburg has pointed out, except that two members -- in its last phrase it uses the word ""quorum"" twice:  ""Except that two members shall constitute a quorum. ""  It doesn't say two members may act.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It says ""shall constitute a quorum"".   Anthony M. Kennedy  But that brings you back to Justice Breyer's hypothetical.  There's five members on the board.  Clearly they can delegate under the statute.  Now there are only four members.  Something happens to the fifth.  Under your theory, the entity that originally delegated no longer exists and therefore the group, the entity that received the delegation of powers, must cease, must cease to act.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  If the quorum of three that authorized two to act disappears and that means the principal is no longer there, so the agent can't exercise the authority, why isn't it the same when five become four?   ",08-1457
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I don't know how you could write the sentence without the ""ed"" unless you want to say -- to make your point, if the statute had been written the other way, to any group continuously being designated.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Suppose -- suppose our first inquiry were agency law, and we concluded that under agency law when the principal ceases to exist the agent may no longer function.  Let's assume we conclude that under agency law.  Could you then cite us a case or a rationale for saying that agency law should not apply to a government agency, to a problem of this type, and if so, what is your authority?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But that is like the de facto officer doctrine.  It could be that, if the Petitioner prevails here, the de facto officer doctrine would leave in place everything that has been done.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But it seems to me that's quite a different -- different point.   Anthony M. Kennedy  What -- what authority does an ALJ purport and in fact exercise?  He's not acting or she's not acting for the board?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Under the Petitioner's theory, if there is no quorum would those appointments then be invalidated, too?   ",08-1457
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, of course, one of--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --One of the things you're going to say is that, with all due respect, Justice Breyer, this conflates the merits with the jurisdictional problem, which is exactly the mistake that the court of appeals made.  Is that your theory of the case?   INTERRUPTING ",08-146X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, what do you do with third-party beneficiary, assignment, assumption?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, in a way that was where one of the parties, without the other party's consent, say, assigned a third-party beneficiary.  Here in a way it's a fortiori because the party who is objecting, by his or its own actions, caused the agreement to come into play.  That's their theory.   ",08-146X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Is there a clearly established rule that in all of the circumstances of the case, we can find that there is coercion, time being one aspect of those circumstances?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And so that is a clearly established rule, and then it's a question whether 2 and a half, 3 and a half, 4 and a half suffices.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But your -- your position is that if -- same facts, but it's 10 hours instead of 2 and a half, is that a closer case, at least?  For--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --And does that show that -- that the circumstances are coercive, so that even if there were a waiver it would be--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --You're saying there's a difference between a waiver and a failure to assert?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So do you read -- yes.  So do you read Miranda as saying that there cannot be questioning unless there is a waiver?  Then we'll go on to -- or do you--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --Okay, you do not.   Anthony M. Kennedy  So are you going to go on -- because this is right where you are.  Are you going to go on to say that, in the Miranda context, the failure to assert can -- can suffice to allow the questioning to proceed?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But why isn't that language that you quote a negative inference that there must be a waiver?   Anthony M. Kennedy  So there's a difference between waiving at the time of the interrogation and then waiving it at the time of trial?  I don't understand that.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But I just want to make sure where we are.   Anthony M. Kennedy  You're not -- you're conceding, it seems to me, that there must be a waiver?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I just don't understand -- why -- why can't--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --We have to guide the police.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Why don't we tell the police, there must be a waiver before you can continue to interrogate?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I don't know why you didn't answer Justice Stevens's questions by saying, Justice Stevens, I don't care about waiver.  There was no -- there was no assertion of the right.  But you're not saying that.  You are admitting there has to be a waiver.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But there also assumes there has to be a waiver.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I -- I have to say that -- page 475 and 476, particularly, of Miranda do talk in terms of a -- of a waiver.  Did -- are there -- did the subsequent cases indicate an articulation of that view that's closer to your position?     INTERRUPTING ",08-1470

Kennedy  Could they -- could the government prohibit that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Okay.  Let's assume the government could prohibit that.  Then the next question is: Could the government prohibit speech instructing the terrorist organization how to get the tsunami aid?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Brandenburg?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But -- but if you get tsunami money, that frees up your other assets for terrorist money.  So why can't the government forbid teaching how to get that money?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Then what's the test?  Is it -- you say it's not Brandenburg?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, suppose it's a ban just for travel to meet with terrorist organizations, Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But what about the -- what about the hypothetical?   Anthony M. Kennedy  It's what the Chief Justice says: In any context, support ultimately will inure to the benefit of a terrorist organization, and we have a governmental interest in not allowing that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  No, no.  I thought that he was -- he wants to meet with the people.  The New York Times didn't meet with Hamas to tell them how great their editorial was.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But it didn't -- it was not a statute which involves banning financial or other tangible support, and page 17 of your brief made -- this is a difficult case for me.  And the second paragraph, page 17, you say:  ""The narrow focus of plaintiffs' claims in this Court means that the case does not involve the propriety of banning financial or other tangible support. ""   Anthony M. Kennedy  Then you say:  ""Nor does it involve speech advocating or teaching criminal or violent activity. ""  But it does involve speech, let's say arguendo, that is tantamount to material support.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Suppose the speech is tantamount to material support in that it legitimizes, encourages, or strengthens the organization.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And this is support.  It's different.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But there wasn't a statute on the books that prohibited material support--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --And here there is, and this is in aid of that prohibition.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  We have to be conscious of the white light.  I have just one -- one question.  The old equity rule was that you don't enjoin a criminal statute; you wait until something happens.  And the reason is then we have specific facts.  And if we said that here, you would say, oh, you're chilling speech.

Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you stick with the argument made below that it's unlawful to file an amicus brief?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I think I'm right in saying it that that was the argument below.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But Justice Ginsburg's question is: Can you advocate peaceful means?  And let's assume that if they embrace peaceful means, they get more interest in their organization, the organization becomes stronger for all purposes.  Can you do that?  That was Justice Ginsburg's question.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And here's how to do it.  And here's how to go to the U.N., and here's how to apply for aid, and here's how to file an amicus brief.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  No, I understood the Chief Justice's question -- maybe I misunderstood it, but my understanding of the question as important is this: Under incorporation by reference, the States are bound by the rights in all -- with all of the refinements and sophistication with which we interpret them for the Federal Government.  It's the same.  You don't just apply the core of the right.  You apply all of the right as it is elaborated by the cases.  Is -- is that same consequence -- does that same consequence follow if we adopt the privileges and immunities interpretation that you are urging upon us?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Counsel, at the -- at the very outset of your argument, Justice Sotomayor asked the question which, as I understood it, essentially said what are examples of privileges and immunities that are being denied by the States that -- which denial would be remedied by following your proposal to overrule the Slaughter-House case?  And let's leave the Second Amendment out.  Let's assume the Second Amendment is a wash; it's either going to be incorporated or not going to be incorporated the same -- to the same extent under either the Privileges or Immunities Clause or the Due Process Clause.

If you looked at all the cases, you think implicit in the concept of ordered liberty?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But I thought its rationale was that because of its fundamental character, the right to bear arms must be understood as separate from the qualifying phrase of the militia clause, all people, most people in the United States.  The public meaning of the Second Amendment was that there was an individual right to bear arms, and that's because it was fundamental.  If it's not fundamental, then Heller is wrong, it seems to me.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  What is the due process liberty--   Anthony M.

You might want to address it later.  And it's a question that goes to the other counsel, too.  I'm having difficulty seeing how the issues as presented in the brief really resolve very much.  Let's assume -- I know this is not your position.  Let's assume the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act grants immunity to the state for this conduct and for a then-serving official who is its agent and for a former agent.  Let's assume there is -- there is immunity.  Why isn't it just repealed, overridden, by the later enactment of the Torture Victims Protection Act?  I just don't see the issue structured that way in the briefs, and I'm puzzled by it.  But I say that at the outset, and I really didn't mean to interrupt your -- your good introduction.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  What -- what authority do you have for that?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  What case authority do you have for that proposition?   Anthony M.

""  Why isn't that a clear statement?  And then I'll get off this hobby horse, and you can get back to talking about the FSIA.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, and then I -- I had thought -- again, correct me if I am wrong -- that, ultimately, in this case, whether or not within the issues here present -- ultimately, you have two arguments.  One is that it's just implicit, inherent, necessary for the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that agents be covered; otherwise it won't work.  The other -- I take it you have a backup position that even if that's wrong, that under generally accepted principles of international law, that agents still have immunity.  Or am I wrong about that?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I had thought when I read the House of Lords opinion in Jones and they talked about the statute, that they took your position, this first position, that the Act just won't work unless there's an agent -- immunity for the agent.

I would agree that the State Department might have some expertise in telling us what the facts were: Who was the government, who was -- who was in office at the time, what the policies were.  But it's just not clear to me what body of principles the State Department looks to, to make this determination that, as Justice Scalia said, Smith is immune and Jones isn't.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But I take it your answer to Justice Scalia with reference to the indictment against the Secretary of Defense, is that that's not covered by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  And if a state interprets international law to allow the suit, then it goes forward.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But that just goes back to the Tate letter era, where we wait to get an e-mail from the State Department to tell us what to do.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

The underlying felony is the purchase or possession, and the second statute is use of the telephone.  So I don't -- I'll think about it, but I don't think Gebardi works.   Anthony M. Kennedy  If the government were to prevail here, I assume that it would then as a result have a much larger, more expansive discretion in charging and plea bargaining and -- and et cetera.  Other than the rule of lenity, is there anything in our cases that indicates that we should be cautious about giving the government that authority so that that's an aid in our interpretation, or is that just all within the rule of lenity?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Other than--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --No background principles either way on granting the prosecutors vast discretion in charging--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

The district -- the United States Attorney in one State, one district, has a case like this where there are four different phone calls; and he doesn't like the looks of the defendant, or for some reason he can charge him, and in the neighboring jurisdiction the United States Attorney does not.  Are there guidelines?  Does the Department of Justice control this in each case?  Is there some manual where we could see what the rules are for charging?  Is it all at the discretion of the United States Attorney?   INTERRUPTING ",08-192X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  But I -- I guess what -- what Justice Breyer is asking is -- I have the same question.  If we concede -- and at the end of the day you might not concede this, but if we take this as a beginning point, that a short, 30-second, 1-minute campaign ad can be regulated, you want me to write an opinion and say, well, if it's 90 minutes, then that's different.  I -- it seems to me that you can make the argument with 90 -- the 90 minutes is much more powerful in support or in opposition to a candidate.  That's I -- that's the thrust of the questioning.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, suppose it were an advocacy organization that had a book.  Your position is that under the Constitution, the advertising for this book or the sale for the book itself could be prohibited within the 60/90-day period -- the 60/30-day period?   Malcolm L. Stewart  --If the book contained the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  That is, if it was subject to no reasonable interpretation--   Anthony M. Kennedy  And I suppose it could even -- is it the Kindle where you can read a book?  I take it that's from a satellite.  So the existing statute would probably prohibit that under your view?   Malcolm L. Stewart  --Well, the statute applies to cable, satellite, and broadcast communications.  And the Court in McConnell has addressed the--   Anthony M. Kennedy  Just to make it clear, it's the government's position that under the statute, if this Kindle device where you can read a book which is campaign advocacy, within the 60/30-day period, if it comes from a satellite, it's under -- it can be prohibited under the Constitution and perhaps under this statute?   Malcolm L. Stewart  --It -- it can't be prohibited, but a corporation could be barred from using its general treasury funds to publish the book and could be required to use -- to raise funds to publish the book using its PAC.   Anthony M. Kennedy  In -- in this case, Mr. Stewart, I take it -- correct me if I'm wrong -- that you think the distinction the Petitioner draws between the 90-minute film and the -- and the short 30-second or 1-minute ad is a baseless distinction?   Malcolm L. Stewart  --It is of no constitutional significance.  Congress certainly could have drafted the electioneering communication definition--   Anthony M. Kennedy  So if -- if we think that the application of this to a 90-minute film is unconstitutional, then the whole statute should fall under your view--   Malcolm L. Stewart  --Well, I think--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --because there's no distinction between the two?   Malcolm L. Stewart  --Well, I think the Court has twice upheld the statute as applied to communications that are the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  So--   Anthony M. Kennedy  But I'm -- I'm saying that if we -- if we think that this is -- that this film is protected, and you say there's no difference between the film and the ad, then the whole statute must be declared void.   Malcolm L. Stewart  --It would depend on the ground under which you reached the conclusion that the film was protected.  If you disagreed with our submission and said there is a constitutional difference between 90-minute films and 60-second advertisements, then obviously you could draw that constitutional line.  If you concluded that they're all the same but they're all protected, then obviously we would lose both cases.  But, again, you would have to--   Anthony M. Kennedy  But you want us to say they're both the same?  You want -- you argue that they're both the same.   Malcolm L. Stewart  --That -- that's correct.  Now, it may be the case -- it may be rarer to find a 90-minute film that is so unrelenting in its praise or criticism of a particular candidate that it will be subject to no reasonable interpretation other than to vote for or against that person, but when you have that, as I think we do here, there's no constitutional distinction between the 90-minute film and the 60-second advertisement.  And we would stress with respect to the film that what makes this, in our view, an easy case is not simply that the film repeatedly criticizes Hillary Clinton's character and integrity.  The clincher is that the film repeatedly links Senator Clinton's purported character flaws to her qualifications for president.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But just from the standpoint of art and literature, that's very odd.  Suppose you have a film which is quite moving with scenery and music and magnificent acting, and a subtle message.  That may be far more effective in advocating, and everyone knows that.   Malcolm L. Stewart  And that--   Anthony M. Kennedy  Everyone knows that.   Malcolm L. Stewart  --That's essentially the argument that a majority of this Court rejected in Wisconsin Right to Life; that is, that that was part of the basis on which Congress enacted BCRA, part of the reason that it wanted to establish a purely objective test based on naming an identified candidate and airing in proximity to the election.  Congress recognized that in many situations the most effective advocacy is the subtler advocacy.  And the -- the lead opinion in Wisconsin Right to Life said -- I think recognized that it will foreseeably be the case that corporations will craft advertisements that are, in fact, intended to influence Federal elections but that are sufficiently subtle and opaque that they won't constitute the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  And -- and the lead opinion simply said that's the price that we have to pay in order to ensure that an unduly broad range of corporate speech is not restricted.  And we accept that holding, but in this case what we have, people may feel -- is not subtle.  People may feel that because it's not subtle, it's less likely to be effective.  But the Court's decisions have never drawn a constitutional line between advocacy that is likely to be effective and advocacy that is not.  Clearly, if this were express advocacy -- I think clearly, if the -- the narrator had said in the first 30 seconds of the film: A Hillary Clinton presidency would pose a danger to the country, it's important for all citizens to vote against Hillary Clinton, what follows are extended analyses of episodes in her past that reflect Hillary Clinton's unsuitability for that office.  And if then in the last 89 minutes of the film the filmmaker had made no overt reference to the upcoming election but had simply given a negative portrayal of Hillary Clinton, the person, that would be express advocacy that would be proscribable even without regard to BCRA.  So that if--   Anthony M. Kennedy  I -- I agree -- I agree that Buckley made the distinction between contributions and expenditures, and it seems to me that the government's argument necessarily wants to water down that distinction.  But in response or just in furtherance of Justice Breyer's point, you have two cases, one in which an officeholder goes to a corporation and says: Will you please give me money?  They say: We can't do that.  The other is in which a corporation takes out an ad for the -- for the candidate, which relieves that candidate of the responsibility of -- of substantial television coverage.  Isn't that about the same?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And I -- and I think Buckley says no.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But, as a practical matter, is that always true?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, with reference to any incongruities that might flow from our adopting your position, are you aware of any case in this Court which says that we must refrain from addressing an unconstitutional aspect of the statute because the statute is flawed in some other respects as well?   ",08-205X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  But that judgment was validated by Buckley's contribution-expenditure line.  And you're correct if you look at contributions, but this is an expenditure case.  And I think that it doesn't clarify the situation to say that for 100 years -- to suggest that for 100 years we would have allowed expenditure limitations, which in order to work at all have to have a speaker-based distinction, exemption from media, content-based distinction, time-based distinction.  We've never allowed that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But if you -- if you insist on the as-applied challenge, isn't that inconsistent with the whole line of cases that began in Thornhill v. Alabama and Coates v. Cincinnati?  What about the Thornhill doctrine?  It is not cited in the briefs, but that doctrine is that even a litigant without standing to object to a particular form of conduct can raise that if the statute covers it in order that the statute does not have an ongoing chill against speech.  And there is no place where an ongoing chill is more dangerous than in the elections context.   Anthony M. Kennedy  So you are asking us to have an ongoing chill where we have as-applied challenges which are based on, as I indicated before, speaker, content, time, and this is the kind of chilling effect that the Thornhill doctrine stands directly against.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Let me ask you this.  Suppose that we were to rule that nonprofit corporations could not be covered by the statute.  Would that -- would the statute then have substantial overbreadth?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But suppose we were to say that.  Would the statute then not be substantially overbroad?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But I am asking you to assume that we draw the nonprofit/profit distinction.  Then the statute, it seems to me, clearly has to fall because, number one, we couldn't sever it based on the language.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But under your position, if corporations A, B, and C, are called to Washington every Monday morning by a high-ranking administrative official or a high-ranking member of the Congress with a committee chairmanship and told to tow the line and to tell their directors and their shareholders what the policy ought to be, some other corporation can't object to that during the election cycle.  The government silences a corporate objector, and those corporations may have the most knowledge of this on the subject.  Corporations have lots of knowledge about environment, transportation issues, and you are silencing them during the election.   Anthony M. Kennedy  When other corporations, via -- because of the very fact you just point out, have already been used and are being used by the government to express its views; and you say another corporation can't object to that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  In the course of this argument, have you covered point two?  [Laughter]   Anthony M. Kennedy  And I would like to know what it is, so that I -- my notes are complete.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And to undercut Buckley in so doing?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But he was talking about contributions in that context.  That's quite clear.   Anthony M. Kennedy  You say it's been on -- it's been on the books forever.  But, No. 1, the phenomenon of -- of television ads where we get information about scientific discovery and -- and environment and transportation issues from corporations who after all have patents because they know something, that -- that is different.  And the -- the history you applied apply to contributions, not to those kinds of expenditures.   ",08-205X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  But do you read Vaughan v. Atkinson as necessarily implying punitive damages would be inappropriate?  I -- I can't quite find the negative that you want me to find, I think, in Atkinson.  True, they didn't talk about punitive damages.  They said damages are appropriate, and attorneys' fees in this case is what the district court gave, we are going to affirm it.  But there's nothing there that said punitive damages are inappropriate.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but that -- but that was a common law wrongful death action, correct, Miles?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It was not admiralty maintenance and cure.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  As -- as I read your reply brief -- and please correct me if it's a misimpression -- you didn't dispute the fact that punitive damages were available historically for the shipowner's wrongful refusal to provide maintenance and cure, or am I wrong about that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  And what about English admiralty, under the English precedents?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Of course, in Miles -- again, we're coming back -- was wrongful death, not maintenance and cure.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But I just -- and you can go ahead and answer that question without my interrupting.  But my assumption from reading the amicus briefs in this case is that punitive damages were awarded in some maintenance and cure cases, (a) as simply part of the overall award -- they weren't separated out, but it was part of the measure -- and, (b) that some American courts, American judges, including noted admiralty judges, awarded in some cases punitive damages in maintenance and cure before the modern cases, Moragne and so forth that you're -- and Miles -- that you're talking about.  Is that incorrect?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I'm talking pre-Miles.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Is that a separate cause of action?  Or is it just part of the maintenance and cure act?   ",08-214X

INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  For you to tell me, oh, this will just never happen, I mean, that's -- that's not the way the world works.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, of course, there are going to be disputes, and the question is whether or not, just from the standpoint of fulfilling professional responsibility, in almost any maintenance and cure action where the counsel for the plaintiff thinks that -- for the seaman thinks that the employer has been remiss, he doesn't add the punitive damages complaint, if we -- if we agree with your position, which changes completely the settlement and the bargaining aspect.  But you can address -- you can address that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  If I thought that the lack of counsel in maintenance and cure cases was a pivotal point or a relevant point for our decision, other than the representations of counsel, where would I look to verify that?

Kennedy  It seems to me, Mr. Starr, based on this last argument, that it actually is in your favor if the order of the court as to one district automatically requires additional expenditure for every other district, that is simply one more measure that the Court should use in finding an alternate remedy.   INTERRUPTING ",08-289X

You are saying that if the court orders more money spent for that district, it must automatically order money -- additional money for every other district in the State?   Anthony M.

Now, that brings us to the -- the later order, 2004, 2006.  And then the question is whether or not that's just a reiteration of the earlier order or a further expansion of jurisdiction that can be reached.  Why couldn't the counsel for Petitioner have given that answer?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But putting aside questions of notice, if these parties had been represented in the appeal of the 1986 order, maybe the subject matter jurisdiction ruling was correct; maybe it was incorrect; but it's done.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So then it's just a question of personal jurisdiction and notice.  It's not a question of subject matter jurisdiction--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

Kennedy  Well, but it's not that hypothetical when -- there are two prongs.  Number one, the school has to agree first with the diagnosis, which in this case they didn't even do that.  They had a good faith disagreement.  Second, they have to have an adequate IEP.  So there are two conditions.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

And the problem with your position is that it seems in a way formalistic and in some cases to encourage intransigence.  If we adopted a presumption that the school district's diagnosis was correct and a presumption that it's -- if -- if there was a diagnosis of disability, that its individual education program was adequate, that would, it seems to me, not be all you wanted, but would ameliorate the position of the school district.  Would we have authority, do you think, to adopt such a presumption?   Anthony M.

And does the United States take that position today?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, then my point stands.  You say that there is a basis for treating States quite differently as to the (.) this fundamental right that we all agree on with respect to voting.  And what's happened in part is that because of section 5 preclearance, say, a minority opportunity district is protected in covered jurisdictions and not in noncovered jurisdictions.

The question is whether or not it should be continued with this differentiation between the States.  And that is for Congress to show.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

Democracy was a shambles in those (.) that's not true anymore, and to say that the States are willing to yield their sovereign authority and their sovereign responsibilities to govern themselves doesn't work.  We've said in Clinton v. New York that Congress can't surrender its powers to the President, and the same is true with reference to the States.  Wouldn't you agree?   Anthony M.

And you said that's a nonstarter because in this case.  And the hypothetical is that there is a very dangerous drug, meth, that's going to be distributed and consumed that afternoon.  Does that make a difference in the permissibility of the search and the reasonableness of the search and the scope of the search?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

Kennedy  That's the way -- we should -- we should judge this case as though they were searching -- the fact that it was -- is it ibuprofen, have I got that?  The fact that it was ibuprofen is irrelevant; we can consider this case as if it were meth?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I don't think I understand that based on your answer.

Which do you choose?  Would the school administrators be violating their duty if they did that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  They give the student the choice.

INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  What -- what -- what you are doing there, you -- you argue that ambiguities are construed against the person that made the form.  I think that's a little harsh when the trustee is a repeat player and knows -- and knows the rules.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  On the other hand, I think what you have going for you is that the trustee is going to always be at risk that the asset is worth more than what's listed and is going to have to take steps to value it in every -- every case.

I don't put a lot of credence in the fact that she -- the ambiguities are construed against her.  I am concerned that in every case, under your rule, the trustee is at risk unless he makes an objection, and I think that's just going to make bankruptcy proceedings much more protracted and much more complex.

Is the fiduciary standard the same for Jones, for a guardian, for a trustee, for a corporate officer or a corporate director, always the same?   Anthony M. Kennedy  You said that Congress used ""fiduciary"" in a special sense.  Then -- then, I have to conclude that your earlier answer is confusing for me, because I thought you were going to tell us that this investment adviser has the same fiduciary standard that officers and directors of corporations have.  Then you say that Congress used it in this special sense.  So that doesn't quite square.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you think Congress used the term ""fiduciary"" in a very special sense here?  I will just tell you the problem I'm having with the case.  If I look at a standard that the fees must be reasonable and I compare that with what a fiduciary would do, I thought a fiduciary has the highest possible duty.

What does that have to do with custody?   Anthony M. Kennedy  It seems -- excuse me,--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --but I'll just finish my own question.   Anthony M. Kennedy  It seems to me that what you are saying is that, in some countries, there -- there is a presumption that there is always custody in the party -- in both parties.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  As long as you brought that up, I was just going to ask: Should -- if you prevail in this case, should there be a remand to see if that section applies?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, you're saying -- I know the white light's on -- but you are saying that every case that involves the Chilean government, the convention here is applicable, requiring return?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you -- do you agree that every case originating in Chile must come out this way, so that there is a return required?   Ginger D. Anders  I agree that Chile has by law decided that the ne exeat right should arise automatically in any parent who has visitation rights.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But that seems to me remote from the concept of custody that the convention has in mind.   Ginger D. Anders  I don't think so, Justice Kennedy.  I think the convention -- the explanatory report makes clear that the convention is designed to protect all of the ways in which joint custody can arise and be awarded under domestic law.  And I think we have a variety of situations in every country in which joint custodial rights arise automatically.  For instance, in the United States, when two parents are married and separated, and there has been no custody order yet, we would say that both of those parents have automatic joint custody rights in the child.  In civil law countries, there are a variety of automatic joint custodial decision-making--   ",08-645X

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  If we were in, if we were in the contract, civil contract situation, and there was a mistake, the usual rule, Restatement of Contracts, is that the -- the question is whether or not it's reasonable to have the party who made the mistake bear the risk.  Suppose we just had an instruction, Rule 11?  I recognize this is a State case, but we had a Rule 11 instruction, which said the only thing the court is going to inquire about and the only thing that is of relevance to your plea are criminal consequences.  You take the risk of any mis-advice, any misunderstanding, with respect to collateral conduct.  That's your risk, and it's part of the guilty plea.  If we said that, would that foreclose this kind of argument in your case?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, then there is no way the government or the court can protect itself against the -- these consequences, and there are any number of them.  Suppose he doesn't advise that there is going to be civil liability in tort once he pleads guilty, because then that's a fact that's concluded and it's just a question of damages.  And as Justice Scalia indicated, there are many, many instances.  I just see no way for the courts to protect themselves against -- against this.  If the client, the accused, is told that he accepts these risks, he can say, well, you know, there may be some risks I don't know about, I'll go to trial.  He just accepts the risks.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, do you think it would be wrong for a district court to say, I want to be very careful and I'm going to add -- let's take Rule 11 as the standard.  It's a Federal case.  I'm going to add to Rule 11.  I'm going to say, in addition to the Rule 11 questions that you've all answered, I want to make sure: Have you been advised about immigration?  Have you been advised about other collateral -- do you think that would be error or inappropriate for a district judge to do?   Anthony M. Kennedy  The judge would not be exceeding his -- his commission, his authority, to determine just whether this is knowing and voluntary in the sense of knowing -- knowing the criminal consequences in the criminal system itself?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But it seems to me a careful district judge would have to do this if you prevail.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, then you are saying that the more the defense counsel strays from his only professional responsibility, the more at risk the government is.  That seems odd.   Michael R. Dreeben  What we think, Justice Kennedy, is that the defense lawyer has two relevant duties here.  One is to counter the government's case, which means to provide advice to the defendant about his rights, the nature of the charges, the evidence, and the affirmative defenses that may exist.  And that is a task that is somewhat broader than the Court has in conducting a Rule 11 colloquy.  The Court does not go into strategic matters in a criminal case with the defendant.  Defense counsel must.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, why shouldn't we just adopt an amendment to Rule 11 in which the judge says, any collateral consequences with respect to your plea are not the concern of this court and will not be grounds for setting aside this -- this -- this plea?   Michael R. Dreeben  --Well, the former part is certainly something that the Court could in its rulemaking capacity do.  The latter part is a Sixth Amendment question.  And I think it's highly notable that the rules committee for the criminal rules has twice considered whether to amend Rule 11 and is going to consider it again contemporaneously with this case, to require the judge to say to an alien defendant, you may want to take into account removal consequences of a criminal conviction.  In other words, there are rule-based ways to address some of the concerns that Justice Alito raised without constitutionalizing a new area of collateral consequences that would impose new duties that actually would divert the lawyer from his criminal law function, whereas the mis-advice line has not created those problems.  And as I started to say earlier, the fact that ten Federal circuits have said no duty to advise on collateral consequences while seven have recognized that mis-advice on collateral consequences can provide relief, has not led to a series of difficult Strickland hearings that are unmanageable.  Justice Alito--   ",08-651X

Are there -- are there any cases that address this point one way or the other?

But the history and tradition of boards like this is that their investigative powers are independent.  Now, you say that there could be a rule, but that just isn't the way it works.  And if you refer us to history and tradition for other purposes, we ought to look at the operational principles, operational assumptions of this board.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I want to ask -- I want to ask one thing: You want us to imply or find -- or you want us to infer from the statute that there's a power in the President to remove SEC commissioners for cause?  You want us to find that that is implied in the statute?   Anthony M. Kennedy  All right.  What is -- what is the authority for us to find that there is an implication in the statute to remove just for cause?  There's -- wouldn't that be unique in our precedents?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I mean, if there is a removal power implied, why isn't it removal for all purposes?  How -- why can it be limited to just for cause?  What authority do we have to do that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But we are talking -- we are talking about independent or quasi-independent agencies, and I understood Solicitor General Kagan to say that it's quite all right with an independent agency for the President to phone them on an ongoing basis and say, do this, and do that.

Are you encouraging the President, on an ongoing, daily basis, to instruct an independent agency what he wants done?   Anthony M.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  The -- the subchapter 2 does talk about a special rule on reopening for battered spouses, children, and parents.  Is that a statute where the discretion is committed to the Attorney General?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So it -- so, absent the regulation, you would interpret the statute as saying there is no discretion?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No, that wasn't my question.  Let's say there is no regulation.  And the statute says, number one, there shall -- so subchapter 2 of the statute says, number one, there shall be motions to reopen, and then there is a special rule for battered spouses.  Now, you would interpret that statute, absent any regulation, as saying this is not within the discretion of the Attorney General?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, how does an Attorney General decide without -- without using discretion?  He must grant, in any case?  Whether a battered spouse waits for 15 years, he must grant?  Just under the statute, now.   Anthony M. Kennedy  This is hypothetical.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, then there must be a discretionary component implicit.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I just want to return for a moment to the battered spouse provision.  The battered spouse provision specifically says that in the Attorney General's discretion, he may waive the time limit for the one year for the battered spouse.  Now, that surely is discretion specified -- and I think the word 2.  So there should be no judicial review as to that.  You would have to agree with that, wouldn't you?   Anthony M. Kennedy  All right.  So then the thing that Congress cares about most is something the Court can't review.  That is counterintuitive.   ",08-911X

That's right there in subchapter 2: There shall be a motion to reopen.  Now, if you had no regulations on it, wouldn't you say that would be within the discretion of the Attorney General?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No.  No, that's not my question.  Hypothetical; not a real case.  Just a hypothetical.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Just so we can talk about the statute.  The statute says there -- subchapter 2, the one we are most interested in, specifies -- and that's one of the words -- that there shall be a motion to reopen.  Now, don't you think that's within the discretion of the Attorney General absent any regulations.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  All right.  So absent a regulation, there would be jurisdiction stripping under that provision, right?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Why?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  All right.  But you would give me, or would you, the concession that -- or agreement that the Attorney General's discretion to waive the time limit for battered spouses is committed to him?  And that's non-judiciary review, wouldn't you think?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Again, that seems odd, that the thing Congress cares about so much that it makes a specific provision can't be subject to judicial review.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Can you give me an idea of how many motions to reopen are brought to the courts for review each year?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So we are talking about 2 or 3,000 petitions to the court each year?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, because that would be a question of law which is accepted.   Anthony M.

In your view, I think, clearly those would be patentable, the -- the explanation of how to compile an actuarial table and -- and apply it to risk.  That certainly would be patentable under your view, and it's -- it's difficult for me to think that Congress would want to -- would have wanted to give only one person the capacity to issue insurance.

The question which we granted, question one is whether the Federal court may reject a State court adjudication that Petitioner's claim is unreasonable based on a factual predicate for the claim that the Petitioner could have presented in a State court but did not, and that describes what you are talking about in response to Justice Ginsberg.  Now, the Petitioner, unaccountably, has told us a few minutes ago that this is a new claim, which I think changes the whole question.  But it seems to me the claim is whether there is ineffective assistance of counsel by reason of the mitigation evidence.  And in that case, we go back to Justice Scalia's opening question to you: Was that the court relied on different evidence, evidence that was not in the State hearing.  And that's the question, whether or not they can do that, if this evidence could have been presented.  And certainly it could have been presented.   ",09-1088

Kennedy  Oh, that -- if we're looking at Crooker, I just read the words ""would there be circumvention"", and it seemed to me in this case the Navy has plans and they use those plans to store munitions safely, and the risk that they worry about is someone will get ahold of the plans and use the positions of those munitions in order to make them unsafe, for example, blowing them up.

The Court can't -- has to at some point focus on the remedy, and that's what it did, and that it seems to me was a perfectly reasonable decision.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, at some point the State itself said that if it had I think seven years, it could get down to 137.5, and didn't seem to object to that?   Anthony M.

If the problem is bad service in a hotel, well, it's the number of employees per -- per guest.  I mean, that's fairly simple.  Now, I recognize of course that Congress has -- had imposed a special duty on us, but I think it means that overcrowding must not be ordered unless that is the only efficacious remedy in -- in a permissible period of time and it seems to me there is massive expert testimony to support that proposition on the part of the prisoners.

Kennedy  What about the argument that there was evidence that should have been admitted, but that was not with reference to new construction?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I have this question and this goes just to remedy.  I recognize that district court has to be given considerable discretion.  It shows the 137.5 figure because it is halfway between 145 and 130.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I think that certainly the Prison Litigation Reform Act means that you have to, if there is going to be a release order, it must be releasing the minimum amount.   Anthony M. Kennedy  That will affect the purposes of the remedy order.  There was substantial expert opinion that 145 -- 145 percent would be sufficient.  Doesn't the evidence indicate to you that at least 145 ought to be the beginning point, not 137.5?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And I understand -- may I make -- there were more, correct me if I am wrong, there were more experts that testified that 145 would work then there were that 130 was necessary?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But the experts -- the experts who were testifying were quite aware of the fact that overcrowding related to the constitutional violations, that was their whole theory.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And any number of them suggested that 145.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I see no evidence in the record that the State -- pardon me, that your clients said that 145 wouldn't work.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I don't see a finding by the three-judge court that 145, is it, would not be an efficacious remedy.  I know that it would for 137.   Anthony M. Kennedy  If you take the State's concession that it can meet a goal in 5 years and the Federal court order is 2 years, we are talking about 3 years.  Is there any indication of how fast the State's remedy would click in?  Are we talking maybe about a 5 percent differential for the last 3 years, or --   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No, no.

That it seems to me is just an extrapolation of what Reynolds said, and I don't know why we don't have that just as a law of -- of the Federal common law of contracts.

Anthony M. Kennedy  We can -- we can do it as a member -- as a matter of the law of contracts.  And when we look at the law of contracts in Reynolds, Reynolds talked about the moving party, and I'm not -- I'm not sure that that phrase either had or has really definable content in our law.  It seems to me it's just a question of the burden of persuasion.  At one point, the contractor has to proceed.  He makes -- it makes a certain showing, and the government has to go back and forth.  And if at some point, the person with the burden of persuasion invokes the privilege, then we have to ask whether it's fundamentally fair as a matter of the Federal law of contracts.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Did the contract--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --Did the contract contain the term ""moving party""?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, in the whole law of contracts you could say, oh, the contracting parties could have put this down, anticipatory breach, we don't need to have rules on that, the parties could have negotiated.

INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But -- no, but isn't that -- isn't that the reason that the manufacturers, Monsanto, contested the injunction?  They said -- because once the injunction is issued, as the government has told us today, they cannot issue some partial regulatory scheme with -- with safeguards.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Or at least that's their argument.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.   Anthony M. Kennedy  In deciding irreparable harm, what weight if any should be given to the proposition that there was an environmental impact regulation violation, as opposed to just a regular suit between, say, two farmers over a nuisance?  What weight do we give to the fact that -- let's assume -- there's a -- a violation of the rule requiring an environmental impact statement?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That is not alone a sufficient harm to justify an injunction, is it?   ",09-475X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Why is it post-formation?  Arguably, the -- one of the parties has such a strong hand that it forces the other party just to decide.  It's almost like -- duress would certainly be for the court, would it not, if it's a formation issue like Justice Ginsburg indicated?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I'm not sure what procedural unconscionability, but this is -- as Justice Ginsburg indicates, it's not clear to me why this isn't a formation issue.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, do you understand -- and we can ask the Respondent.  But, as you understand Jackson's case, is he saying that part of the clause, part of the arbitration clause, is unconscionable, that the whole clause is unconscionable or that the whole contract is unconscionable?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Because the complaint is a bare-bones complaint, and I don't know if there's anything in the pleadings that reflects what his answer to that question would be.   ",09-497X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  After this--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --After this suit was filed and both parties are going up the steps to the court, could the attorneys and the parties stop and say let's arbitrate this issue of unconscionability and pick an arbitrator?  Could they do that?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No, then -- then the--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --Then the employee loses.  He says: Oh, you have to have an open door; this was -- this was not properly before the arbitrator.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Because, you see, if you say yes, that they can arbitrate this, then the question is why can't they do it when the contract's signed?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Let's assume that the answer to my question is yes, they can put that to an arbitrator.  If that's so, how can you prevail in this case if the agreement clearly comprehends submission of this issue to the arbitrator?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I'm -- I'm asking, assume you do?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But which is the stronger case for arbitration?  Case one, you attack the arbitration clause only, part of the arbitration contract only, as being unconscionable.  Case two, you attack the whole agreement as being unconscionable.  Do those both stand on the same footing, or is one a stronger case for submission to the court than the other?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I find that somewhat paradoxical, but I -- I agree that that -- that that's the law.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So if you do go to the State court, suppose the State court says: I can't really decide this question about the one clause unless I determine the conscionability or the unconscionability of the entire contract, and I now proceed to do that.  Do you have to wait and say: Stop, you can't do that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But suppose the State court judge says that he has to look at the whole contract.  Do you say: Oh, I'm sorry to bother you; we have to go back to the arbitrator now?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  What's your -- no, it's a hypothetical case.   Anthony M.

Kennedy  And what do you think the judge should decide as between those two possibilities?   INTERRUPTING ",09-497X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  But in light of our AFC case, it seems to me that what you are arguing is that the statute -- the effect of your argument is that the statute gives more protection in the case of non-property taxes than property taxes, and that's an -- an odd reading of the statute, which is directed primarily to the -- to the property tax.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But in this case -- correct me if I'm wrong -- off-road users, agricultural users, and construction and timber companies--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --have the same -- have the same tax structure as the railroads.   Anthony M. Kennedy  So there is an objective reference, neutral, and it seems to me that that's just quite rational to put the railroads there and not in the category of road -- road users.  Now, if -- unless you are arguing the discrimination has to have -- has to have a purposive component.  That might give you a different case.  I'm not sure you prevail on that, either.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Suppose a -- suppose a tax were structured so that the same tax applied to railroads and -- and -- and motor transport, but because of the way the tax was assessed, the railroads paid far more per mile than -- than the -- than the road transport.  Could the railroad then come in and say: Oh, we want to be like the farmers; we are off-road?  I mean, I can see you making that argument--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --in case -- in case number two, welcome back.  That's going to be your argument.   Anthony M. Kennedy  You present the case to us as if it's either/or: That we must either in disagreement with your position, to say that it doesn't apply to exemptions; or if it applies to exemptions, it must be remanded.  Can we say that the exemptions are not covered by the act unless the railroad is a target of an -- an isolated target and it's clear that it's discriminatory?  I mean, do we have to have your either/or position?   INTERRUPTING ",09-520X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, it may be because the universe of non-property taxes is -- so infinitely large that there's a much greater room for -- a much great danger of discrimination.  We know all States have property taxes.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Then you need to give us a test, and the test is whether or not the railroad is singled out as a target group for discrimination.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Something like that -- for discrimination, something like that.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  What -- what authority do you have for the proposition that the clear statement rule applies to the exercise of the congressional power under the Commerce Clause?

Can't we discuss this case, must we not discuss this case, on the theory that JCM's scienter, JCM's knowledge of a false statement, is a given in the case?  Now, maybe you'll be able to prove otherwise.  You say that they're not liable anyway.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And it seems to me that's what the argument here is mostly about.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But once again -- once again, if the complainants in the case, the plaintiffs in the case -- hypothetical case, not this case, hypothetical case -- were injured shareholders the Fund, I take it you say still they could not sue JCM?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, let's say that JCM's principal officers and managers wrote the statement.  You still say there's nobody?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.  It's not attributable, at least publicly, to JCM.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Is there an alternate theory that JCM is really the day-to-day managers in day-to-day active control of the Fund, and therefore, it should be chargeable as if it and the Fund are the same for purposes of making the statement?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And we would say that that's different from, say, an outside law firm or an auditor?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Just -- just to clarify Justice Breyer's hypothetical.

Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.   Anthony M.

It seems to me that for a sensitive position, a bank who has people taking care of -- its employees taking care of other people's money, or the medical profession, that the employer could be sued and would be remiss if it did not ask this question.

The -- in California, we call it an initiative and referendum process -- existed and was in place before the Public Records Act added this additional feature of disclosure?   Anthony M.

Are you saying we -- we don't look at this because it's just simply an interpretation, it's not a regulation?  What is -- what is -- in your view, what effect do we give to this language that Justice Scalia quoted?  Nothing at all?   Nicole A.

The brief by the former HHS officials says quite to the contrary.  It -- it says that there are almost $400 billion of HHS expenditures that are supervised by 50 people.

Kennedy  --I think I am having the same problem as Justice Kagan.   Anthony M.

And they said if it's 40 then you have this; if it's 50 you have this.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I'm not so sure.  We're talking about summary judgment.  It seems to me, rough rule, that summary judgment would be much more easy -- much easier under 101 than 102 and 103.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  I think this case is a pretty good illustration, Justice Kennedy, of why that's not true.  Think of, if I may pick up on the question Justice Scalia asked my friend, think of all the trouble we are having in this case figuring out what the standard is: How much preemption is too much?  How do you even figure out the scope of preemption?  What you are actually doing here is multiplying a whole new set of very difficult, complex questions that you don't have to answer.   ",10-1150

Often in trial court evidence problems, the judge says: Well, it goes to its weight; not the admissibility.  And it seems to me that's what Judge -- the en banc majority was saying, that the fact that it was not presented before or that it points in a different direction from what the PTO found goes to its weight, not its admissibility.  In other words, they would give consideration to the fact that it wasn't introduced and asked, and maybe discount it as a result, unless there is a reason.  So it depends on the facts of the case.  Number one, am I reading or am I summarizing the en banc majority correctly?  And number two, why isn't that a sensible way to interpret the statute so, as Justice Ginsburg is suggesting, you give some meaning to 145?  It -- it performs a function that 141 does not.

Why is it that the purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause are implicated when a jury, before it delivers a final verdict, says where -- where it is mid -- mid-deliberations?

How -- how did that come about?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Can you read the cases as indicating that more deference is given to juries in FELA cases than in other cases?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you think that over the last few decades, there's been an increasing emphasis on foreseeability as a component of proximate cause?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Although your proposed instruction didn't use the word ""foreseeable""?   INTERRUPTING ",10-235X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you think that the phrase in the statute ""in whole or in part"" allows juries to impose liability based on but-for causation?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Why -- why not?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  You're in the jury room and a juror says: This wouldn't have happened but for the wide locomotive; therefore, there should be liability.  What -- and assume the jury has all of the Federal reports in there and the judge lets them read.  What -- what is there for another juror to say that this is wrong?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, at -- at -- at least that, it seems to me, is a jury question.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But -- but -- but it was not instructed on foreseeability?   ",10-235X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  In -- in this case, do you think the law is content-neutral within its own universe, which applies just to political speech, so it's not content-neutral in that sense?  But within the scheme that it sets up, is it content-neutral?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Why?   Anthony M. Kennedy  In Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical -- I'm still trying to think about -- suppose there is one candidate for the -- for the pink party, and then three candidates for the orange party, and all three candidates for the orange party received the lump sum Justice Ginsburg was talking about.  But there's only one candidate on the other side, and he has to face, or she has to face, three.  Is that constitutional?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  One person is on one side; three people are on the other side.  And under the Arizona law, if the three people on the other side are all participating candidates, each of them gets a bonus if there's only one person speaking on behalf of the non-participating candidate, right?   Anthony M. Kennedy  All right.  So $10,000 by the non-participating candidate triggers off $30,000 against him?   Anthony M. Kennedy  All right.  In Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, wouldn't you have the same problem in different terms, in that one candidate faces three people, all of whom are funded by the -- by the government?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I'm just asking as a theoretical matter whether there would be a constitutional problem in the case that I put under Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical.   Anthony M. Kennedy  How about under the First Amendment?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you think it would be a fair characterization of this law to say that its purpose and its effect are to produce less speech in political campaigns?   ",10-238X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you think that one reason for people to decline participation in the program is because they do not want to deter independent expenditures?  And let me -- we'll talk about independent expenditures for just a few minutes if you don't mind.  You indicated independent expenditure has gone up.  I thought there was some data in the record that showed the population has gone up and so there's an argument about that.  But just as a common sense matter, if I'm someone with the capacity and the will to make an independent expenditure, why don't I think twice if this is going to generate an equal amount on the other side, which might be better spent.  Sometimes an independent expenditure is not really that effective, it's in a bad market, it's a bad message.  But this results in cash to the participating candidate, who then can use it in the most effective way.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  All of which is designed to probe this idea that this somehow does not deter independent expenditures.  I frankly am tempted to believe the opposite view, so you can tell me about that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Are you saying that anything that has to be disclosed can also be prohibited?  I mean, I just don't see the equivalence here.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It seems to me that this law has a severe criticisms leveled at it, severe legal invalidities alleged, quite without reference to disclosure.   ",10-238X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  The Chief Justice's question reminds me somewhat of our rule in Monell under 1983: A city is not liable for a -- a constitutional violation unless it has a policy.  Would you think that we could use that as an analogue to determine whether or not there is a common question here?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Suppose, following the Monell analogue, there's -- it's a -- there's a showing of deliberate indifference to the violation.  Would that be a policy?   ",10-277X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  It's not clear to me: What is the unlawful policy that Wal-Mart has adopted, under your theory of the case?   Anthony M. Kennedy  It's -- it's hard for me to see that the -- your complaint faces in two directions.  Number one, you said this is a culture where Arkansas knows, the headquarters knows, everything that's going on.  Then in the next breath, you say, well, now these supervisors have too much discretion.  It seems to me there's an inconsistency there, and I'm just not sure what the unlawful policy is.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, is that disparate treatment?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, correct me if I'm wrong, I thought the Teamsters case was an action by the government that wasn't a class action case.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Pattern or practice, that's correct.  Help me, if you can, with this.  Let's -- let's suppose that experts' testimony, sociologists and so forth, establish that in industry generally and in retail industry generally, women still are discriminated against by a mathematical factor of X.  You have a company that has a very specific policy against discrimination, and you look at their -- the way their employees are treatment -- are treated, and you find a disparity by that same mathematical factor X, does that give you a cause of action?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  The -- the -- the disparity with -- that women are subjected to are the same in the company as they are--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --society wide, but the company does have a policy against discrimination.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Would that be true even if you could not show deliberate indifference?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Suppose there's no deliberate indifference and a specific policy prohibiting the discrimination, can you still proceed?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, if it's standardless and -- and recordless, then why is there commonality?  It seems to me that what you -- your answer that you just gave really is a -- shows a flaw in your case on commonality.   ",10-277X

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  I have just one small question on that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Suppose that there are two competitors and each of them wants to connect, but each of them wants to connect at a different point and in a different way.  Must the incumbent accommodate both if they're technically feasible?   Anthony M. Kennedy  You say that this is a link, and your -- the opposition says that it's transport.  Is that correct?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But the -- but the rate says interconnection does not include transport.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I have got it in front of me.  It says  ""This term does not include transport. ""  But you say it does?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No, I'm talking about interconnection.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I don't know why -- why it's so hard.  I mean, I got out my orange cord and I--  [Laughter]  JUSTICE KENNEDY -- but I -- I wasn't sure of -- if it was a transport or link.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Other than the time and expense of going through voluminous records, which is obvious, is there any other harm to the government in being required to show that there's a competing interest that makes disclosure unnecessary or improper?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I hadn't thought about your argument until this -- until you made it this morning, that if there -- if -- if the tribe is correct that it owns these documents and gets -- can get them anytime, but the -- the -- the trial court here divided the documents into five categories.   Anthony M. Kennedy  As to some of those categories it -- it denied -- it denied production.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And I take it did that in the context of recognizing the attorney-client privilege, including work product, which were the accountant's records.   ",10-382X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  What's your best case that you have on that in the private trustee context?  I had thought your answer was going to be that in that case, the fact that the payment is made by the trustee out of the trustee's own funds and not out of the trust funds might be dispositive and might give him the privilege.  But you -- you seem to say, in answer to the questions from the Court, that, other than this distinction you make between what the personal liability is and how he ought to manage the trust, which I think is a murky distinction, that the documents have to be disclosed.  What's your best case for that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Which means you can't get preventative advice, which is one of the most important kinds of advice an attorney can give.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But it also has broader authority, and that's just their point, I take it, for many other areas.  The sovereign can't easily divest itself of its responsibilities.  A trustee can so conform and shape its business that it doesn't have conflicts.  A government just can't do that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Is this true regardless of the fact that the government may have a very powerful interest in seeking neutral, independent advice from an attorney, and that were you to prevail that advice would become watered down?   ",10-382X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  But we take the case on the assumption that he hadn't heard of the earlier better offer.  Am I wrong about that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, regardless, your legal position is that there is no basis for setting aside the plea if an earlier, better offer was not communicated.  That's your legal position, right?   Anthony M. Kennedy  You're saying there's no Sixth Amendment violation when the counsel fails to communicate a favorable offer to the defendant.  That's your position.   Anthony M. Kennedy  That's what we took the case for.  We didn't -- we wouldn't have taken the case if we were concerned about what happened in March and what happened in February.  We took the case because of your position, which is it's not a Sixth Amendment violation in these circumstances.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It's -- it's very odd for you to say that -- to me -- that this is not a critical stage.  If it results in a guilty plea and the -- and the attorney has not done sufficient research to uncover a defense, it can be set aside then.  So it's -- so you are saying it's not a critical stage depending on what the end result is.  That's very difficult.  I thought we were going to tell attorneys, you have an obligation during this plea bargain process to use professional competence.  And you say, well, you do or you don't.  That doesn't make much sense.   Anthony M. Kennedy  If defense counsel gives wrong information to the defendant about witnesses that can testify in his behalf, and so forth, very bad legal advice, that can be grounds for setting aside the plea, correct?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  All right, so -- and that is because counsel pre the entry of the plea did not adequately advise his client.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Why is there no problem when he doesn't adequately advise a client of earlier better offers?   INTERRUPTING ",10-444X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, suppose -- suppose the case in which a plea offer's made, not communicated, and expires.  And then there is a guilty plea here.  And he doesn't -- and the defendant enters a -- a guilty plea but doesn't know about the prior offer.  Is -- is there injury?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Is -- is the plea involuntary?  Pardon me, is it unknowing?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And what would he -- what would he have done had he known?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  You mean, judge, I'm really sorry I didn't accept responsibility three months earlier?   ",10-444X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  But -- but if you had said status or situs, then it seems to me it would have made more sense, given the language of the statute.  We all have hypotheticals.  We have too many, but it -- it's quite common on oil rigs that the employees bring some of the equipment back to the land, clean it, prepare it, and so that they can bring it back to the next -- the next shift on the rig.  And some of this machinery is complicated.  It has springs in it.  And suppose that the worker brings the machine back from the rig to the land, to the base of operations that is land-based, and is injured in repairing that machine?  Under your view no coverage?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I think that's quite difficult to square with the ""as a result"" language, because this is a result of the operation.  Let's just say the machine got broken because of the -- of the operations, and there -- and he's fixing it and he's injured.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well the government -- the government and the Ninth Circuit take care of that by saying that the person has to have -- the injured employee has to have spent substantial amount of time on the -- on the offshore operations, so you could add that.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I agree.  I thought you had a back-up argument--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --in your -- in your reply brief.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Would you call status -- if the test is where you spend a substantial amount of time working, is that what you call status?   Anthony M. Kennedy  You -- but you call that status?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That brings me -- I am looking at petition appendix 96 -- 903(a) that you referred us to.  I wasn't quite sure of your argument with respect to this statute.  This statute is a situs-based statute.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But since Congress didn't follow this model in the -- in subsection (b) that we are looking for and used ""as a result"", why doesn't that show that Congress meant something different?  I didn't hear your argument on that point.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I don't see, in other words, how 903 doesn't hurt you more than it helps you.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But it doesn't; it talks about where the injury occurs, and that's not what -- and that's not what (b) says.   ",10-507X

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  But it -- it seems to -- it seems to me that that was rejected in -- in our most recent and earlier case on copyright.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Can you tell me a little bit about the phrase and the argument about the public domain?  Is in your view that just a synonym for when the time has ended?  Or is there something more substantive to it that -- is it your position that the public somehow owns what's in the public domain?  I'm--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --But -- but how does the phrase -- so the public domain is simply a conclusion to express that, the operation of that principle?  The public domain doesn't have any more substantive meaning other than to just express the conclusion that there is a limited time?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Once again, it's just a conclusion for the argument.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But now you're saying that there is a substantive component to this public domain argument, that the public does own something.  And that's different from what I thought you answered earlier when you said it's just conclusory for a limited time.   INTERRUPTING ",10-545X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, it seems to me what you're saying, and I already gave this answer because originally, I thought I was going to put in my notes, the First Amendment does not apply to the copyright area -- and that just can't be.  What you're saying is, is that this law will pass intermediate scrutiny.  It's an important governmental interest and it's substantially related to that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But -- but -- can you -- can you cite me to some -- some authority which says the First Amendment doesn't apply to a copyright?   Anthony M. Kennedy  The First Amendment test doesn't apply.  There has -- there has to be a -- a test.  Now maybe you say that it isn't immediate scrutiny; it's something else.  But -- but certainly the First Amendment is implicated.   ",10-545X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  But here what we have is a claim of retaliation, so that she can't even get a hearing.  So we can look at the various tests that are proposed here, and I think it's difficult to formulate the tests, but this can't even be -- be litigated because she is discharged.  The allegation is that there is a retaliation for even asking for a hearing where these tests could -- could be applied.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Again, that -- that could be an argument you could make in the -- in the pretext hearing.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But you're asking for an exemption so these issues can't even be tried.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It's almost like a summary -- like a summary judgment argument.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That's the analogy, I think.   Anthony M. Kennedy  No, no, no.  What she is saying is that you basically gave me summary judgment; you didn't allow me to go to the agency to have a proper test applied.  The summary judgment was just an analogy.  Forget that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I'm saying if there are some substantial issues the church has that can be litigated in EEOC hearing.  She was fired simply for asking for a hearing.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Lay people in many--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --But the answer you gave to the Chief Justice seem to me to be this case.  I was interested.  I didn't know about this, this minister capacity in this particular church.  And as the Chief Justice indicates, many churches don't have -- some churches don't have what we think of as professional or full-time ministers at all.  They're all ministers.  And you said, well, that -- that, that can be litigated, that can be investigated.  And I suppose when we do that we say, how many secular functions do you perform?  And that's what this case is.  But you don't -- you don't even want that issue to be tried.  You say that issue can't even be explored.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  While Justice Ginsburg is looking, I had -- I had the same impression, that whether you're commissioned or not commissioned doesn't necessarily mean you can't teach a religious class.

Kennedy  So that is not correct.  Well, correct me if I am wrong.  It would seem to me just from reading the statute, unless we have some gloss on, that if you think it's true but it's false, from the way you were indicating, would be a violation.  That's not the way I read it.  Now, have we said something other than that in later cases?   ",10-577X

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Let me ask -- let me ask it.  There was a second half of the Chief Justice's question that you never got to.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But since we are on--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --the GVR, I have one more question under the GVR, at least.  If you had sought -- if you had been counsel, you're not -- if you had been Greene's counsel and you had sought cert from this Court, you would have sought cert to the supreme -- the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, to the intermediate court, correct?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Which indicates that that is the decision that's -- that's involved here.  And once that decision becomes final, then you have a problem.  If -- if -- if the protocol or the practice or the rules had been that you would seek cert to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, then you might have had an argument about finality, but now you don't.  But you can get to that later, because the -- the Chief Justice had a second part of his question which was collateral.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And just to follow up on that question, the statute says it was ""adjudicated"", past tense, and the decision ""resulted in"", past tense.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  What you said -- you don't contend that -- what's--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --You said you don't contend that, and I didn't hear -- was an unreasonable?  I just didn't hear it.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Now, and of course those are ongoing injuries where the person continues to be confined.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I'm not sure there is an ongoing injury here.

Kennedy  Then is that then a restriction on habeas corpus?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Is there a rule of constitutional avoidance that we should interpret the statute to avoid?  Any inference that there is a restriction on habeas corpus?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No.  That's not argued.  I agree.   Anthony M.

I don't know if -- I don't think the briefs covered it.  It may be in there.  Do you know in Alabama and/or nationwide, in how many capital cases there is no appeal?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, in -- in this case there was a direct appeal, and then there was this proceeding that we're talking about here.  The trial judge waited for 18 months, so you would think there is some merit to the underlying claim.

INTERRUPTING ",10-63XX
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Particularly in a capital case.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I just have two questions going back to the very beginning, when we were talking about the missed address, or the unreceived mail.  When the notices come back  ""no longer at Sullivan & Cromwell. ""  that's just as if it said functionally, don't you think, ""wrong address""?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I mean, it's pretty clear that they didn't get the mail, get the letter, because it's sent back.   Anthony M. Kennedy  One other thing while I'm talking with you, and it's a tangential point, perhaps.  Could the State of Alabama under your laws waive what you allege to be the procedural default?  If you thought there was substantial merit to the underlying claims, even though you take the position that they ultimately should be rejected, could you have simply waived the procedural default and allowed the appeal to proceed?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Has Alabama ever waived lack of timely appeal in a capital case?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, this goes to my earlier question, and continuing Justice Alito's line of questioning, if the State of Alabama had told the State court, you know, under all of the circumstances we think there should be an out-of-time appeal granted.  Are you indicating that the State court said: Well that's a good idea, but we can't do it because it's not appropriate in these circumstances?   Anthony M.

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  No, no.  No, no, that's not the way Miranda works.  Miranda suppresses a statement that is adverse to the person who was questioned.  And the police doesn't know when the adverse statement's going to come.  So you are running away from the hypothetical.  It just doesn't work.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --And what you infer is the rule that incarceration constitutes custody.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That is Shatzer, and Shatzer was careful to say we've never decided that issue.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, it states in broader terms.  It says we've never decided whether incarceration constitutes custody for Miranda purposes.

Do we just accept that?  It -- it seems to me that that whole equal protection rationale is quite doubtful.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  I was going to ask you, along that line, are there any trust cases that -- that Respondents or the government could cite in which a party can go into court alleging that the market has been distorted, even though that person has no damage?  Anything like that in the antitrust?  What would be their closest case?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Right.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  There is not automatic disgorgement in those--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --Well, that -- that leads me to this point.  I thought -- I never thought of title insurance companies as being fungible, and some were very, very good about narrowing the exceptions, about working with the seller of the property, if you represented the buyer, to get rid of the exceptions.  And so I'm not sure that it's just a question of a policy versus no policy.  There's a -- there's a quality to the -- to the research they do.  And the next -- and related to that is this: you -- you put the case as if the price is going to be the same for the insurance.  A, I think there is nothing in the -- in the State law that permits the insurance company to get -- to set a lower rate; and second, don't the title companies charge other fees, title search fees and so forth, other fees in addition to the price of the insurance?  And those other fees, arguably -- I know she didn't allege any damage -- but those other fees arguably are too high because of this fixed market.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Now, she didn't allege that.  I know that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Just following up Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, suppose the Congress works with economists and concludes there is a reasonable probability that if there were no kickbacks there would be a more competitive market, there would be lower prices for some of the escrow fees, some of the collateral fees in addition to the title insurance.

And the court remembers that when this came into evidence, the courtroom was quiet, the jury was transfixed, jurors were weeping.  This was the high point of the trial.

Anthony M.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, we can continue and probably should talk about this broad theory that you want us to adopt.  Really, in this case, the court of appeals in -- in the state system cited Nesler, and Nesler in turn cited, at page 104 of the petition appendix, a Supreme Court case you don't even -- you say citation, you don't even give -- but it -- it's -- it's the Supreme Court case, United States v. Wood, written by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes.  And it seems to me it very clearly ties its state analysis to the Federal Constitution and a Sixth Amendment discussion in Wood.  So it seems to me that you're -- you have a very strong argument that they did adjudicate the Federal claim anyway.  I know you want us to maybe reach the bigger issue, but -- and your brief almost downplays it -- but it seems to me pretty clear that you have the argument, that you don't strongly make, although you don't, by any means, abandon it, that -- that here the state law was tied to the Federal standard, and the Federal standard was the basis for the entire jurisprudence.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, suppose that the--   Anthony M.

I've never seen a procedure like this.  And I looked -- I looked at this -- the Federal cases, Brown and Thomas, that the Cleveland court cited.  Those -- and Wood was voir dire, was not mid-jury.

Wood, and -- and it also cites Cleveland, and Cleveland had three circuit court cases, all of which involved the Sixth Amendment.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  I mean, that just can't be a proposition that we can accept across the board.  Nobody under that view has an interest in contraband in their home.  The question is, can you find out the contraband?  It's just a circular argument.  And if -- and in the -- was it the Caballes case that talked about that, if I have the right name?  That was where the contraband was visible; it was almost like the smoking gun falls out.  Well, of course, there's no interest in the smoking gun when it falls out in front of you.  So I just don't think that works.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I just -- again, as I told Mr. Garre, I just can't accept that as the premise for the case.

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  That's your first reason and I don't want you to be deterred from giving us the second, but if we can concentrate on that for a minute.  That seems to me a proposition that's equally unacceptable to what the Government is saying, that you have no interest in contraband.  The police often, when they have ordinary conversation with people, want to find out the details of what that person is doing, where the person lives, what goes on in the house.  ""Hello, have you had a nice time at the -- at the park today? ""  ""I see you're coming home with your children; is this where you live? ""  This is all routine conversation that we always have in order to try to find out what people are doing, what they are like, where they live.  So I -- I think the statement, and you -- you repeated it quite accurately from what you have at page 16 of your brief -- just goes too far.  Our decisions  ""establish that police action which reveals any detail an individual seeks to keep private is a search. ""  --that is just a sweeping proposition that in my view, at least, cannot be accepted in this case.  I think it's just too sweeping and wrong.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

They're -- they are trying to get information.  That's perfectly legitimate.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, then your broad statement simply does not work.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes, I was going to ask for your second, your second point.   Anthony M. Kennedy  How is that different from what Justice Breyer I think correctly indicated, our inquiry as to whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy?  In a way, that's circular because if we say there is, then there is, if we say there isn't, then there isn't.  But if we're looking at community values in general, isn't it a reasonable expectation of privacy?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Let me ask this.  I think I know what your answer would be.  Suppose the policemen have little microphones on so they can talk into their radio, the microphone on their lapel.  Suppose the policeman goes to the homeowner and he has the microphone in his lapel on so his partner can hear the conversation, and they can -- the two of them talk about it later.  They're talking to the homeowner.  Is that an unlawful search?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It doesn't occur to him that that mike is on.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

I frankly think that might be harder than the dog case or that you can make a stronger case for a reasonable expectation of privacy.  If the -- if the homeowner is making a lot of marijuana with -- with odors coming out, he knows that a dog or a person might smell it.   Anthony M.

Now, the facts are in dispute, and we're not quite clear of the facts, but let's assume that this magnificent structure is -- which was mercifully destroyed -- let's assume that it was attached to the dock by a rope, a garden hose and an extension cord, and that it could leave within 30 minutes notice.

Assume that the court of appeals -- the three judge district court in Columbia in the preclearance proceeding finds some problems with two or three of the districts, say, in the congressional plan.  Does it just say,  ""there are problems with these districts, we therefore deny preclearance.

That's what I'm asking.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But you don't have any problem, if I'm a district judge and I think there is a substantial likelihood that a particular challenge would succeed, you don't have any problem with my drawing an interim plan to avoid that likelihood.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Section 2.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Can you -- can you tell me with reference to the two districts, other than the Senate district, congressional and State house districts, did Judge Smith defer or use these -- the Texas legislature's 2011 plan as a benchmark to some extent?   Anthony M. Kennedy  So you would fault his solution for giving insufficient deference to the State of Texas 2011 plan?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Let me ask you this.  Suppose that this -- all the facts are the same except that this is in a State that is not subject to section 5.  Would there be a problem in your view with what the district, with what the district court did, with Judge Smith -- with what Judge Smith did?   Sri Srinivasan  Well, with what Judge Smith did, I guess in that context, Justice Kennedy, there wouldn't be a section 5 issue at all.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Right.  Alderson Reporting Company--   Sri Srinivasan  All you would be dealing with is section 2 or the Equal Protection Clause.   Anthony M. Kennedy  --And then we could use -- then there would be no problem with using Texas as a benchmark, the Texas 2011 as benchmark, as a starting point, as a starting point?   Sri Srinivasan  Well, I guess what I would say is this, that in the malapportionment context what this Court typically has said the district court should do is to start with a plan that is already in effect and then modify it according to neutral districting principles to remove the malapportionment issue.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Isn't it odd that this is a section 2 suit and yet section 5 seems to be driving that -- driving it.  That's the problem with this litigation, it seems to me.   Sri Srinivasan  I think section 5 can't help but drive--   Anthony M. Kennedy  And section 5 applies only to some States and not others.  Texas is at a tremendous disadvantage here in defending the section 2 suit and in drawing -- and in having -- and the judiciary is at a disadvantage in framing a remedy for a likely, a likely section 2 violation in some of the districts.   Sri Srinivasan  --Of course, Your Honor, Texas is in a different position precisely because it's a covered jurisdiction.  And when you have a section 5 case, section 5 can't help but take precedence in some respects, precisely because a proposed change can't go into effect unless and until the covered jurisdiction shows that it's nondiscriminatory in purpose and effect.  But I do think it's important--   Anthony M. Kennedy  I wonder if it should take precedence in a section 2 suit.  All this -- this is the primary obligation of the Texas district court, is to address section 2 violations.   Sri Srinivasan  --That -- that may be, Your Honor.  But I think then if, if it can't address the section 5 issue at all, then the one thing that shouldn't happen is that the section 2 court gives effect to the unprecleared plan, because that is something that the D.C. district court is supposed to do.   Anthony M. Kennedy  It's not giving effect to an uncleared plan.

That's what seems to me the difficulty with saying oh, you can't look at the plan.   Anthony M.

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  I think you may be right in the way you characterize Monsanto's argument, and I have great difficulties with characterizing it that way, as Justice Scalia's question indicates.  But Monsanto can still prevail if you say that there's a patent infringement if he plants it for seed and uses the seed to replant.  That's not as far as Monsanto goes, but it seems to me it's one way to characterize their argument and to make it sensible.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I have only one question so far, and it's a farming question.  With some crops if you are going to make seeds, you leave the crop in longer.  In -- what about soybeans?  If the farmer has the north 40 and the south 40, the north 40, he's going to plants soybeans to be used for flour, human consumption, and south 40, he wants seeds.  Does he leave the plants in the ground the same amount of time?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  You would not?  Okay.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But that's -- if you're going to use the soybeans for seeds as opposed to flour, do you leave them in the ground any longer?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Okay.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Please correct me if I am wrong.  I thought that's exactly what Bowman did here.  He went to a grain elevator and he -- he used the seeds, and -- and he didn't know exactly the percentage mix, but he used them.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So he did exactly what you said is uneconomical.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But correct me if I am wrong; I thought that is what Bowman did.   Melissa Arbus Sherry  Bowman did, absolutely did it in this circumstance.  But Bowman also said that he is not aware of other farmers who are engaging in this practice.  And again, there is another reason.  Putting aside the labeling laws, there is the Plant Variety Protection Act and, as Pioneer points out in their amicus brief, it is quite likely that a large amount of the commingled grain is not only protected by patent, but is actually protected by a Plant Variety Protection Certificate, and what Petitioner did here would infringe the Plant Variety Protection Certificate.  So even putting patent law to the side, this is not an economically viable source of seed for farmers, regardless.  And Petitioner's argument again isn't limited to the grain elevators.  It would apply to saving your own seed and planting it generation after generation.  It would apply to selling seeds to your neighboring farmer, and it would allow seed companies to essentially compete with Monsanto upon the first sale.  Now to the extent--   ",11-796X

Could -- if there was an evolution of the law of adequate assistance of counsel so that this Court later held, oh, conditions of confinement have to be a part of the attorney's skill and competence in representation, that that would be retroactive?

INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I don't understand how that works with my hypothetical.   Anthony M.

And if the judge admits the evidence and if it turns out that that doesn't meet the standard of reliability, then he can exclude it.

This is just a magic words approach, it seems to me.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I -- I take it there is no argument over whether or not the expert is qualified.   Anthony M.

Kennedy  Well, he does what I said, but then he has 100 pages of findings.   Anthony M. Kennedy  No, I think that's where we disagree.  The judge has to make a determination that in his view the class can be certified.   Anthony M.

The judge has to make that conclusion, make that finding.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, of course there matters for the trier of fact to determine at the merits stage, but under Daubert and under Rule 702 the judge has to say that the evidence is relevant to the task at hand, and it has a reliable foundation.  I can see a judge saying,  ""Well, now, this theory that you're using, this theory works. ""  ""I think it's accepted in academia.

Kennedy  The laws simply do not -- reference to obstruction and blocking entrance, simply do not work.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, am I correct that the Attorney General's regulation with respect to employees of the clinic in a way made this even more content-based because there was a prohibition on discussing the -- the abortion procedure?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Is your concern that, absent this statute, there will be physical obstruction to the entrance?  Is that a major concern?   Ian H. Gershengorn  --So, Your Honor, let me address that.  The answer is -- the answer is yes, but that's not all.  What the legislature had before it, and Justice Breyer--   Anthony M. Kennedy  Let me ask, if that's -- if that's your concern, how many Federal prosecutions were brought in Massachusetts for physical obstruction under the Federal statute?   Ian H. Gershengorn  --Your Honor, I'm not aware of the number.  There are 45 FACE prosecutions nationwide.  But FACE is a very different statute.  The criminal prosecutions in FACE are for -- are for murder, arson, and for chaining yourselves to doorways.  They are not for the kind of quiet counseling and -- and picketing that's at issue here.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But the Federal interest that you're the defending is you don't want this physical obstruction statute to be misinterpreted.   Ian H. Gershengorn  That's right.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But what's wrong with the physical obstruction statute as an answer to many of the problems that Massachusetts is facing?   Ian H. Gershengorn  Your Honor, I don't think it's at all an answer to the problems Massachusetts is facing because, as Justice Scalia has repeatedly pointed out, these are not the type of defendants who are at issue in the FACE Act.  What FACE Act is talking about is murder, arson, and chaining to doorways.  What this statute is getting at is something quite different.  It is congestion in front of doorways.  It is people -- individuals handing out--   Anthony M. Kennedy  That's obstruction under the Federal statute.   Ian H. Gershengorn  --It is not, Your Honor, because those are specific intent crimes in both Massachusetts and in the Federal statute.  The -- for example--   Anthony M. Kennedy  Justice Holmes said even a dog knows the difference in being stumbled over and being kicked.   Ian H. Gershengorn  --So, Your Honor--   Anthony M. Kennedy  Can't -- can't -- you're saying Federal prosecutions can't tell when people are deliberately obstructing--   Ian H. Gershengorn  --I'm saying--   Anthony M. Kennedy  --this is beyond -- this is beyond the realm of the law?   Ian H. Gershengorn  --I'm saying what's at issue here, Your Honor, is not that kind of -- of deliberative obstruction.  What the testimony before the legislature was, was that there was a congregation of people and the massing of people.  That indeed, there were Pro Choice protestors in the zone who have -- certainly are not intending to obstruct.  And it was -- so what they were dealing with was quiet counseling leading to -- counter-counseling leading to congestion in front of the doorways.  There also was testimony that there were people handing literature to moving cars, accidents and near accidents, which are not intentional obstruction in the least.  The kinds of statutes that this Court -- that -- that are at issue in the specific intent crime in Massachusetts and the FACE Act do not get at the kind of peaceful, quiet, yet congesting and disrupting conduct that is at issue here.  And, Justice Breyer, I would urge you to look at the Evans testimony at Joint Appendix 67 to 71.  The Hefernon testimony at 79 to 80.  The Coakley testimony of JA-51, and the Capone testimony at JA-19.  There are specific arguments as to why these did not work.  The argument Petitioners make here, Your Honors, is very, very broad.  The lower courts have upheld buffer zones around political conventions, around circuses, around funerals.  The idea that you could defeat those buffer zones by simply saying, I would like to have a quiet conversation with the delegates as they go into the political convention, would wipe out a number of court of appeals decisions and the kind of buffer zones that this Court, I submit, and that the lower courts have found are -- are needed.

Are you saying that the consequences of what you write are irrelevant to this argument?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It seems to me that you should answer Justice Scalia's question, then.

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, then, you said both are subject to equitable consideration.  We're told by the Petitioner that the equitable rule of laches simply can't apply.  I was going to ask: Estoppel applies; why isn't laches just a first cousin of estoppel.  Estoppel is an affirmative misrepresentation.  Why isn't laches here almost a misrepresentation?  And I don't understand the difference between laches and estoppel in this respect.  Estoppel was an equitable remedy that's been taken into the law.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Right.  They are related, but different.  Laches involves sitting on your rights to the detriment of the defendant, whereas equitable estoppel involves affirmative -- affirmative things but the plaintiff has--   Anthony M. Kennedy  But suppose sitting on your rights amounted really to an affirmative representation.  It seems to me very close, close enough so that I'm not sure that we should distinguish between laches and estoppel as being so that the -- so that the former is unavailable at all.   Nicole A. Saharsky  --Well, you're right that laches can -- is a cousin of equitable estoppel and that it's right that equitable estoppel could bar the claim entirely.  The reason that we are distinguishing between law and equity are two reasons: First of all, there is a very long history that laches is unique to the courts of equity, and this Court has recognized it.  It recognized it in Mack, it recognized in the Oneida case, it recognized it in Merck, it was in the Pomeroy treatise that this was a classic division that was only in equity.  And this Court has continued to recognize it.  But the second reason is that it makes sense to look to laches principles in fashioning equitable relief in this context as opposed to the legal relief, because under the Copyright Act, when a person shows, a plaintiff shows infringement, that person is entitled to actual or statutory damages in a certain amount.  And that is a mechanical calculation that we expect juries to make.  But it's not the--   ",12-1315

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  One of the ways I have been thinking about this case is to think about arbitration and the whole point of arbitration is to have a procedure where you don't have costs, you have as an arbitrator an antitrust expert or the best in the class in the third year antitrust course in law school.  And they cite reports, and, you know, it's classic to have contractors sit in as arbitrators in construction claims; just because it's cheaper and they know -- so I was thinking that that's substantial justification for your position.  But your argument so far seems to say that doesn't make any difference.  Even if they can't bring the suit in an economic way, the arbitration in an economic way, that that's irrelevant.  That's -- that's what I'm getting from your argument.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, do we have a factual record?  Suppose I think, based in substantial part on Justice Breyer's suggestion, that we could have an arbitration that's effective and we could have a trade association prepare a report, and we could do one arbitration and then see if it applies to others.  Suppose I think that.  Do I -- doesn't that bear on this question?  And if it does, I don't have a factual record to support my assumptions.   ",12-133X

We have five years of information to weigh against 2,000 years of history or more.  On the other hand, there is an immediate legal injury or legal -- what could be a legal injury, and that's the voice of these children.  There are some 40,000 children in California, according to the Red Brief, that live with same-sex parents, and they want their parents to have full recognition and full status.

On the other hand, if -- if the State loses, the State can appeal.  So this is a one-way ratchet as it favors the State, and allows governors and other constitutional officers in different States to thwart the initiative process.   Anthony M. Kennedy  That's really -- that's a broad argument that you -- that's in this case if the Court wants to reach it.  The rationale of the Ninth Circuit was much more narrow.  It basically said that California, which has been more generous, more open to protecting same-sex couples than almost any State in the Union, just didn't go far enough, and it's being penalized for not going far enough.  That's a very odd rationale on which to sustain this opinion.   Anthony M. Kennedy  The problem -- the problem with the case is that you're really asking, particularly because of the sociological evidence you cite, for us to go into uncharted waters, and you can play with that metaphor, there's a wonderful destination, it is a cliff.  Whatever that was.  [Laughter]  But you're -- you're doing so in a -- in a case where the opinion is very narrow.

So it's not -- it's -- it's -- I think there is quite a bit to your argument that if the tax deduction case, which is specific, whether or not if Congress has the power it can exercise it for the reason that it wants, that it likes some marriage it does like, I suppose it can do that.  But when it has 1,100 laws, which in our society means that the Federal Government is intertwined with the citizens' day-to-day life, you are at -- at real risk of running in conflict with what has always been thought to be the essence of the State police power, which is to regulate marriage, divorce, custody.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but it's not really uniformity because it regulates only one aspect of marriage.  It doesn't regulate all of marriage.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But I -- I see an illogic in your argument.  I -- I hadn't thought of the relation between Section 2 and Section 3 in the way you just said.  You said, now Section 2 was in order to help the States.  Congress wanted to help the States.  But then Section 3, that Congress doesn't help the States which have come to the conclusion that gay marriage is lawful.  So that's inconsistent.   Anthony M.

And -- and if so, then it -- it seems to me that the airline is under a duty more strict than the one that you have just explained and the Petitioner's counsel has explained.   Anthony M.

Kennedy  So suppose I'm the trial judge and I conclude that if Air Wisconsin had said to the TSA, along the lines of Justice Scalia's earlier question, We have an employee who was terminated today.  He probably knew it.  He lost his temper during a test.  He might think that some of our employees are out to get him and there may even be some truth to that.  He's authorized to carry a gun.  We don't know if he has one or not.  We're giving you that information.  Suppose I'm the trial judge.  I conclude that if that information had been given to TSA, TSA quite properly stopped this plane to examine the pilot.  Do I send the case to the jury?   Anthony M. Kennedy  The Masson reporter for the New Yorker Magazine spent months on this article.  They had proofreaders, they had editors in New York.  And you're saying the same standard applies to the baggage handler who has only 10 minutes to decide what he's going to say?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So under my question I first asked you, I'm the trial judge, I have made the determination that TSA would have acted the same way.  I still have to submit this to the jury?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No, I thought that even if the facts had been reported much more accurately than they were, that the TSA still had a duty to investigate.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Can't I make that determination as a matter of law?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I think you're right.  They seem to rely mostly on the proposition that this all should have been submitted to the judge.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  From what you know and from what the record shows, would the process of tagging the isolated DNA be patentable?  The process of tagging, we just don't know about that or is there a patent on that?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Under our -- our law, is a patent ever divisible so that if it's valid in part but invalid in another part, it can still stand as to the part?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But if you haven't challenged this, then -- then where are we with respect to the tagging?  I don't quite understand.  Because the -- the entire patent which includes tagging would fail under your argument.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I'm not sure the Court can decide the case on -- on that basis.  I'm sure that there are substantial arguments in the amicus brief that this investment is necessary and that -- and that makes sense.  To say, oh, well, the taxpayers will do it, don't worry, is I think an insufficient answer.  As Justice Kagan's follow-up questions indicated, I thought you might say, well, there are process patents that they can have, that this is sufficient.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But I -- I just don't think we can decide the case on the ground, oh, don't worry about investment, it'll come.  I -- I just don't think we can do that.  It may be that the law allows you to prevail on the fact that this is -- occurs in nature and there's nothing new here, but that's quite different.   Anthony M. Kennedy  When I first looked at this case, I -- I thought that maybe the cDNA was kind of an economy class gene, was -- it wasn't.  But my understanding is that it may have a functionality that the -- the DNA isolate does not, easier to tag, et cetera.  That may be incorrect for the record, but that was my present understanding.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Is all the tagging done on recombinant DNA?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, suppose his understanding is correct.  Suppose your misunderstanding -- suppose your understanding is not correct.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --Our position, though, is that cDNA is patent eligible because we think, unlike the isolated DNA which is just taken from your body, cDNA is an artificial creation in the laboratory that doesn't correspond to anything in your body.

Anthony M. Kennedy  Now, if it's -- if it's the process or the additions that make it patentable, fine.  But you're say that the moment it's snipped, it's patentable, and that it seems to me was -- was the point of Justice Kagan's question.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, we could have said that with atomic energy, with electric, but so far the choice -- electricity -- but so far the choice of the patent was that we have a uniform rule for all industries.

Let me ask you this, and it's consistent with my -- my preface.

Kennedy  If the best interest of the child is the uniformly accepted standard in State courts, and if we forget constitutional avoidance problems which I -- I think exist here, is there anything in the statute that allows us to import the best interests of the child into the statutory language, or do we have to just rely on constitutional avoidance and -- and really rewrite the statute?

And you can gear it to just what the -- what the generic would have made.   Anthony M. Kennedy  What -- what do we look at to verify what you say?  Is that -- is that all in the briefs?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Because I had thought, as Justice Kagan's question might indicate, that the 180 days is crucial, it allows you to go to the doctors, to give them the name of your generic equivalent, et cetera, and that that's a big advantage.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And now, you're -- now, you're indicating that it isn't.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, suppose -- suppose that hypothetical is correct.  That's was my concerns, too.  What the brand company can lose is much greater than what the generic can make.  So why don't you just put a cap on what the generic can make and then we won't have a real concern with the restraint of trade, or we'll have a lesser concern.  I think that's the thrust of Justice Ginsburg's question and it's my concern as well.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but it's not hypothetical that if the generic wins everybody -- the brand companies profits are going to go way, way down right away and generic profits are not going to be that great.

In other words, was there sufficient evidence so that if a proper instruction were given, there could have been a conviction?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I guess we can get into later to whether or not if you know a firearm is being carried and if you then facilitate the commission of the underlying felony by driving the car, participating in the transaction, whether that's sufficient.  But let me ask you this: Would the instruction that was given, which was at JA 196, would it be okay if Paragraph 1,  ""The defendant knew his cohort used a firearm. ""  I think there is a real problem with that, because it's retrospective.  Would the instruction have been sufficient if the defendant knew his cohort would use or was carrying?  Would that change it?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Justice Scalia can -- his own question.  But the question is: What -- what does the jury have to find?  I know they can -- I know what they can infer, but the question from Justice Scalia is, you're the -- you drive -- you drive the car, you know firearms are there and might be used, is that sufficient?  And that's his question.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, that's -- that's a conclusion.  The jury, it seems to me, could say you do facilitate it if in these hypotheticals you drive the car--   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  --with knowledge that the gun might be used.

Forget the jury instructions.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I just want to make clear, and we'll get back to the bank robbery hypothetical.  Driving the car, knowing a gun is being carried and might be used, is or is not sufficient facilitation to make you an aider and abetter in the drug -- in the gun aspect of the crime?

I may be wrong about that.  I don't have statistics for it.  That's why we're asking.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

Kneedler  In -- in Nelson -- actually, the pertinent paragraph in Nelson that discusses based-upon, as counsel pointed out, the Court said you start with what is the conduct that -- that the suit is based upon.  And the Court said the conduct there was the conduct that took place in Saudi Arabia.  And then it had a discussion that said, to be sure, there was recruitment that -- that preceded that, and that recruitment put the employee in the position to be in the hospital in Saudi Arabia where the conduct occurred. But the focus was on, as the Court said, those torts in Saudi Arabia, not the -- not the antecedent commercial activity in the United States. That discussion in the Court's opinion preceded its discussion of the distinction between commercial activity and -- and sovereign activity.  It had to do what -- with what is the focus of the claim.  And there the Court was focusing on tort claims that happened outside the United States.  And we think it's very important in this case to distinguish between tort claims and contract claims.   Anthony M. Kennedy  If we want to give based-upon a separate substantive effect in this statute and so that it means something more substantial than mere due -- than what would suffice for due process, what -- what body of law, case law do we look to?   Edwin S. Kneedler  Well, I think in Nelson --   Anthony M. Kennedy  If I want to find out about based-on, what kind of cases am I supposed to read?   Edwin S. Kneedler  Well -- well -- and Nelson itself, I think, is very instructive on this because, first of all, the Court in Nelson did not -- did not describe what it was doing as simply applying due process standards.  It was applying the statutory terms. And it -- again, it -- it focused on the particular conduct -- and this goes to Justice Alito's question as well -- it focused on the conduct that really caused the injury, which in that case was the -- were the intentional torts --   Anthony M.

Kennedy  But your very argument, Mr. Murphy, to the effect that, well, probable cause is a very low standard, seems to me to work against you.  It means that more complaints are more likely.     Well, it depends on what you are talking about the relevant injury is.  If the relevant injury is a criminal prosecution, I think it very much shows that a prosecution is entirely unlikely.  And if your relevant injury is some of these preliminary injuries that they're asserting, I do think that the credible threat test is probably not even the test because, as the Court said in Clapper, injuries in that context had to be certainly impending.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but this is a point brought up by Justice Scalia's question as well.  Don't you think there's a serious First Amendment concern with a state law that requires you to come before a commission to justify what you are going to say and which gives the commission discovery power to find out who's involved in your association, what research you've made, et cetera?     Well, remember that the issue here is standing, so setting aside the -- the First Amendment concern should have no impact into whether an Article III case or controversy exists.  They would--   Anthony M. Kennedy  There's a curious inversion here.  Usually we're concerned about citizen suits, too many people can challenge -- challenge the law.  Here we're concerned that many, many citizens can bring the challenge against the candidate.  So it's somewhat reversed.  In other words, you have tens of thousands of private attorney generals waiting to pounce and get these people before the commission and have to follow discovery orders.     Well, I mean, that's true.  But keep in -- keep in mind that there -- when you -- when you think about the fundamental Article III purposes here, separation of powers and federals and purposes, it seems to me that a finding in -- in this case that they have standing would undermine those.

Did you change your position here, or am I just misinterpreting the way this -- the court of appeals discussed it?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But, again, your argument -- and you're consistent on this, your first argument is that this is not recognition.  Now, suppose the State Department, and I think this is its position, says this is recognition.  If we defer to the State Department's judgment, to the government's executive judgment on that point, and the government said this is recognition, and you say it isn't recognition, why doesn't the government trump?  If the government -- if the Congress really wants to test its power, it can pass a law saying you must recognize Israel as being the legitimate government of Palestine, but it has not done that.  And since it has not done that, it seems to me the government's argument trumps.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But you -- but you say that this isn't recognition.  So the ultimate conflict is not before us and -- and, therefore, the government's policy, which says that this is recognition, should be given deference and it trumps.   Anthony M.

Kennedy  Is it that -- it's true that that would be a step maybe beyond our -- our -- our cases. On the -- on the other hand, if the inquiry is one of flagrancy, then maybe that's necessary.  And it may be particularly necessary here because under the line of questioning that Justice Kagan just concluded with you, it would seem odd for this Court to say the higher crime -- the more it's a high-crime area, the less basis you have to stop.  That's very odd.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

Kennedy  Certainly remand on some on other issues, I understand.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Right.  And it can't -- and it can't, by doing so, immunize itself from -- from review in this Court.  And that's Michigan v. Long, which -- which -- which I don't know if were cited in the brief, but Michigan v. Long, to Justice Alito's point, made it very clear that a -- a State court can't hide behind a -- a Federal law and -- and -- and be immune because there might be a State law to predicate. We have to see what they wrote.  And this -- I assume that Kansas would pride itself on -- on being cited in other jurisdictions.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  The problem --   Anthony M. Kennedy  One -- one of the problems is when you think about these cases you think about words or cases, and -- and the word that keeps coming back to me in this case is -- is millennia, plus time. First of all, there has not been really time, so the Respondents say, for the Federal system to engage in this debate, the separate States.  But on a larger scale, it's been -- it was about -- about the same time between Brown and Loving as between Lawrence and this case.  It's about 10 years. And so there's time for the scholars and the commentators and -- and the bar and the public to -- to engage in it.  But still, 10 years is -- I don't even know how to count the decimals when we talk about millennia.  This definition has been with us for millennia.  And it -- it's very difficult for the Court to say, oh, well, we -- we know better.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But it's -- you -- you said that, well, marriage is different because it's controlled by the government.  But from a historical -- from anthropological standpoint, Justice Scalia was very careful to talk about societies.  Justice Alito talked about cultures.  If you read the -- about the Kalahari people or -- or ancient peoples, they didn't have a government like this.  They made it themselves and it was man and a woman.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, part of wait and see, I suppose, is to ascertain whether the social science, the new studies are accurate.  But that -- it seems to me, then, that we should not consult at all the social science on this, because it's too new.  You think -- you say we don't need to wait for changes.  So it seems to me that if we're not going to wait, then it's only fair for us to say, well, we're not going to consult social science.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, you could have said the same thing 10 years ago or so when we had Lawrence. Haven't we learned a tremendous amount since -- well, since Lawrence, just in the last 10 years?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Let me ask one question. I see your time is going out.  I'm interested in your comments on Glucksberg, which says what we should have to define a fundamental right in its narrowest terms. A lot of the questions that we're -- we're asking your colleague in the earlier part of the argument were -- had -- had that in mind, I think. What -- what do we do with the language of Glucksberg that says we have to define it in a narrow way?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, can you tell me why you didn't make the fundamental argument?   INTERRUPTING ",14-556X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  But that -- that assumes that same-sex couples could not have the more noble purpose, and that's the whole point.  Same-sex couples say, of course, we understand the nobility and the sacredness of the marriage.  We know we can't procreate, but we want the other attributes of it in order to show that we, too, have a dignity that can be fulfilled.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And -- and -- but you argued in your brief, and Justice Kagan was quite correct to -- to say that you're saying that this harms conventional marriage.  That was the argument you made in your brief as I understood it.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  -- how do we get from what I just said --   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

Kennedy  What is your answer to the question?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But -- but you're the one that brought the statistic up, and under --   Anthony M. Kennedy  And -- and under your view, it would be very difficult for same-sex couples to adopt some of these children.  I -- I think the argument cuts quite against you.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And -- and it goes back to the basic point where you began where you had some premise that only opposite-sex couples can have a bonding with the child.  That's -- that was very interesting, but it's just a wrong premise.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Just in -- just in fairness to you, I don't understand it's not dignity-bestowing.  I thought that was the whole purpose of marriage.  It bestows dignity on both man and woman in a traditional marriage.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  It's dignity bestowing, and these parties say they want to have that -- that same ennoblement.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Or am I missing your point?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I think many States would be surprised, with reference to traditional marriages, they are not enhancing the dignity of both the parties.  I'm puzzled by that.  But you have another point to make.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But Justice Alito's question points out, the assumption of his hypothetical is -- and -- and of the way these cases are presented, is that the State does have a sufficient interest so that you need not allow the marriages in those -- in that State. So there is a sufficient interest, under our arguendo assumption here, to -- to say that this is not a fundamental right.  But then suddenly, if you're out of State it's different.  Why -- why should the State have to yield?     Well, at the very least, you would have to analyze differently the interest that the State might assert for not allowing couples to enter marriage versus the -- the interest that they assert as related to a couple who is already married. For example, Kentucky has asserted that its interest in only permitting opposite-sex couples to marry is to increase the birthrate.  Well, now apply that theory to same-sex couples who are already married. They are already married in the States where they were married.  They are already married in half the States in the country. Kentucky would have the Court believe that it is a sufficiently important interest to have that couple disregard their existing marriage vows and obligations to each other to marry someone else in Kentucky in order to procreate biologically even though the couple may already have children together.  That, I would dare say, is not a rational justification, much less a sufficiently important one.   ",14-556X

Catherine M.A. Carroll  I'm not 100 percent sure I followed the question, but let me --   Anthony M. Kennedy  When, under your view, when is there a constructive discharge that itself leads to triggering the statute of limitations?   Catherine M.A. Carroll  I think in a constructive discharge case, and to be clear, that labeled can be applied to a range of different fact patterns it will often be the case that the predicate conduct that precipitates the resignation is itself alleged to be discriminatory.  Take the facts of Suders, for instance, where there was an ongoing pattern of harassing behavior.  Individual acts contributing to that hostile work environment had occurred leading up to and indeed on I believe the very day of the resignation.  There, I think it is, as Your Honor suggests, not going to matter at all which rule the Court were to adopt in this case.   Anthony M. Kennedy  They're almost contemporaneous.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  They would be contemporaneous. But in a case like this, it's much clearer to see the conceptual distinction between Mr. Green's own individual independent decision to resign and his employer's predicate discriminatory conduct.  And in Suders, the Court made very clear that those were two distinct components of a constructive-discharge claim.

You want to us say that under these facts, the result might be different, depending on if it's a pretrial detainee or an inmate, and that's just very difficult for me to understand why that should be.

Kennedy  What is your standard?   John F. Bash  It -- it's exactly what Justice Rehnquist said for this Court in Bell, which is that either an intent to punish, which I take to be shorthand for an intent to achieve objectives that are -- are not reasonable -- reasonable at that point for that person's status in the system, or, objectively, there's no reasonable relation between the use of force and those objectives.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you agree that the pretrial detainee can be deprived of -- of privileges because of bad behavior that's disruptive to the confinement?   John F. Bash  Yes.  And that's what I was getting at when I said the way that I think Justice Rehnquist used the term ""punishment"" in the due process cases is as shorthand for a deprivation of liberty in the prison context that has no reasonable relation to any legitimates objectives.  So if it was --   Anthony M. Kennedy  Can you give us an example of what a guard could do to an inmate and a guard could not do to a pretrial detainee, other than for rehabilitation purposes?   John F. Bash  I don't think the use of force as discipline is ever appropriate.  But, you know, in a -- in a max prison where you only have felony convicts, I think, at the margins, officers are going to be able to use slightly more force than they can with pretrial detainees where people who are held, as this Court said in Salerno, in regulatory detention.

Then there's a pretrial suppression hearing.  The evidence is still fabricated, and he's still held for two more months.  Then there's a trial.  Evidence is still fabricated and he's convicted and he's held for six more months.  Then there's an appeal filed, and then suddenly they find out the evidence was fabricated and -- and the charges are dismissed.

Not later than 20 days after the secretary notifies the applicant that the application has been accepted, the applicant shall provide. Now, this -- this means that the agency gives the notice for 20 days.  And it seems to me, certainly, it would be within its authority, or it would be a sensible thing for it to say -- and they have a regulation -- if you don't do that and we've told you to do that, we're going to delay the review process.   Anthony A. Yang  I actually think it's not so clear.  If you compare this to the Hatch-Waxman Act -- and I believe you had an opinion called Caraco about that not so long ago -- that actually embeds the FDA in the process of identifying patents.  It has the orange book. This is quite a different process.  The FDA is involved with the licensure, but Congress at this point separated FDA.

Since 1988, this Court has not recognized a single Bivens action.  We look for special considerations.  You've indicated that there's a problem all along the border.  Why doesn't that counsel us that this is one of the most sensitive areas of foreign affairs where the political branches should discuss with Mexico what the solution ought to be? It seems to me that this is an extraordinary case for us to say there's a Bivens action in light of what we've done since 1988 where we haven't created a single one.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

And if we assume that the officer was completely at fault and that there's really no defense, we -- we don't know what the facts are, but if we assume the facts most favorably -- favorably to you, there should be some relief.

Feigin  Well, Your Honor, first of all, I wouldn't characterize it as prohibiting Options B and C, but simply requiring an additional disclosure.  It has to finish off the math problem for the consumers and tell them that the credit card price is $10.20. The reason that's permissible constitutionally under Zauderer is that -- I think it's important to keep in mind the legislatures are legislating against a backdrop, whether there isn't necessarily any specific requirement at all to even disclose the existence of the surcharge.  And I think the two --   Anthony M. Kennedy  I thought it was $10 and 2 cents, but I'll think about that while -- (Laughter.)   Eric J.

Feigin  All that's required -- Your Honor, it's not prohibiting them from saying what's in Options B and C.  It's requiring a further disclosure in dollars-and-cents form.  I think there are two reasons why Congress or the New York legislature could permissibly require the disclosure to be made in dollars-and-cents form.

Kennedy  Before your white light goes on, could you address your first argument that the vagueness standard is different here than in -- than in Johnson?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I might say, Jordan v. deGeorge, a case from some years ago, is a little more persuasive than I had thought for the Respondent -- for the Respondent here.  You could say it's dictum because they didn't really need to reach the issue based on their holding.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Something has to be briefed before we say it's the law?   Anthony M. Kennedy  But I thought the point the Chief Justice is underscoring is that if we go -- if we base the decision on the fact that -- that this is civil, then you have to come back here for other cases under --   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, since discovered, but the statute here says ""during the course of committing the offense."" And that's quite different from the statute in Johnson.     Your Honor, it isn't quite different from the statute in Johnson. The statute in Johnson has the same limitation in different language.  Section 16(b) covers risks in the course of committing the crime, ACCA's residual clause covered ""a crime that otherwise involves conduct."" Both are referring back to the crime. But it really -- I -- I -- I'd like to address more concretely this ""in the course of committing the crime"" point because I can't tell you why the government is wrong without knowing what the government thinks those words mean. And the government keeps shifting back and forth between two versions of what ""in the course of committing the crime"" means.  At points, the government says that it means in order to satisfy the elements of the crime. So it reads the sentence to mean you look for substantial risk that physical force may be used in order to satisfy the elements, but that's not how any Court was ever applying this provision.  It's not how the government was telling the courts to apply this provision. The government back then and even now, Mr. Kneedler points to conspiracy and other inchoate offenses, those offenses are completed.  The elements are completed when you say, I want you to kill my wife, here is 100 bucks, they are completed with the utterance of those words. Nevertheless, you look after the utterance, at least the government urged the courts.  But what about attempted burglary in James? As Johnson itself points out, or burglary -- Johnson itself points out burglary was a problem.  Why? Precisely because, under the ordinary case approach, courts were required to look past the elements.  Burglary is committed, the elements are completed the moment you cross the threshold. That's -- if that's the government's reading, then burglary would be out.  What the court said in Johnson is that it's what happens after you cross the threshold that creates the risk. But that's -- so -- so then the government shifts to, okay, but no, no, it's while the crime is under way, that's what ""in the course of committing the crime"" means, but that's not a solution.  That is exactly the problem that Johnson describes. Its concern was that the ordinary case analysis was ""detached from the statutory elements."" And that -- that it leads courts to speculate about what happens after the statutory elements have all been satisfied, but while the crime is under way. That's just as imaginary.  Now let's -- let's look at --   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, that's just a minor point that gets off the basic point of Justice Alito, but it did not incorporate exactly this statute.  The language is different.  But we'll leave that.     Your Honor, no, no, I --   Anthony M. Kennedy  A question is pending.     I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.  Congress literally said, in the INA, that the crime of the -- that the definition of crime of violence is the definition of Section 16(b), Section 16(b) being a criminal statute. It then added all sorts of bells and whistles of other ways to create an aggravated felony, but this Court, in A.B. Small, said, Here is what you do when you have a statute that has both criminal and civil applications --   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I -- I took us -- I took us away from Justice Alito's inquiry. He -- he wants to know the standard for determining vagueness in civil cases.     So the standard for determining vagueness in civil cases was laid out by this Court in Hoffman Estates, and the answer is it depends on how serious the crime is. The -- the seriousness of the crime -- excuse me, how serious the penalty is or how serious the consequence is.  And --   Anthony M. Kennedy  Could -- could the government --   Anthony M. Kennedy  It's a different point.  Could -- could the government pass a statute saying that aliens who commit criminal offenses are deportable if in the discretion of the Attorney General, the presence of the alien is inconsistent with the best interests of the people of the United States?     That is the basis of deportation? No.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Why?     I'm sorry, let me -- let me back up.  If --   Anthony M. Kennedy  In other words, what standards must a statute meet before an administrative officer can make the determination that the -- remaining in the United States is not in the best interests of the United States?     Well --   Anthony M. Kennedy  Would that -- would that suffice? Would that be unconstitutional?     That would be unconstitutional --   Anthony M. Kennedy  Under what rule and under what context?     Under the criminal void-for-vagueness rule.  A reasonable person, whether it is the deportee or an official on the ground or an administrative law judge would have no idea what the content of that prescription is, as a basis for being within the universe of people who can -- who are identified as being deportable. Now, if it's a basis for the Attorney General's exercise of discretion that despite the fact that you are deportable as Congress has defined it, I am not going to deport you, that's another story.  And by the way, that was the Mahler case.   ",15-1498
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, of course -- of course, courts and legislatures always have to imagine consequences when they are classifying crimes.  They have to define what burglary is, because they know that in a significant number of cases certain consequences will happen.  That -- that's the way the law works.   ",15-1498
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, just -- just so I understand the case: If this plaintiff had elected to sue in the tribal court, the rule would have been that there is indemnity from the tribe.  And if there -- if negligence had been shown, then I assume there would be recovery against the tribe?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I mean, we can take the case on that assumption.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I suppose that's correct. And I was going to ask you, you responded to an earlier question and -- and indicated that the State could expand the immunity of the Indian tribe.  And I was going to ask you, is there any authority for that? That's -- that's a troublesome concept for me.  But, again, I don't think that's before us.  That's all going to happen below?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Or am I right about that? We don't need to address it.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I -- I thought your brief was helpful and quite correct on explaining the bases for sovereign immunity and the difference between official immunity.  But then at the very end, you indicate, well, maybe Connecticut can expand this as a matter of State law. Is there -- is there authority for the proposition that a State can expand the immunity of an Indian tribe?   Ann O'Connell Adams  Yes.  I think as a -- as a matter of --   Anthony M. Kennedy  What case do I read to find that?   Ann O'Connell Adams  It would -- it would be a matter of State law.  They would not be --   Anthony M. Kennedy  What case can I read to find that?   Ann O'Connell Adams  I -- I don't know of a case that specifically --   Anthony M. Kennedy  It seems to me a far-reaching proposition to say that this extent of tribal immunity is a matter of State law.   Ann O'Connell Adams  It's -- it is a matter of Federal law.  The State wouldn't be amending the Federal law by -- as a matter of comity expanding a greater protection to an Indian tribe.  And an example might be if in this case Connecticut took a look at the facts and the Court said, well, we offer complete immunity to our employees in this circumstance and so does the tribe, and the tribe has set up its own system.  We're going to defer to that system and give this employee complete immunity in this case, even though the Federal common law would afford him less as a matter of comity.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, I think that's a difficult proposition, but, again, we need not reach it here.   Ann O'Connell Adams  I think that's correct.   ",15-1500

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Let me ask you this question.  It's a hypothetical.  It's not this case. Suppose that three years from now lots such as these two lots in the same ownership become immensely more valuable than the two lots singly.  Each lot singly would be worth a hundred thousand, but these lots where you can build a bigger home are worth $500,000. The county wants a fire -- fire station and it takes Lot E.  What do they pay for it under your theory?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Which is $100,000.  So under your hypothetical, property owners stand to lose $300,000 under my hypothetical and your answer.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  The hypothetical is together, they are worth 500,000; singly, they're worth a hundred thousand each. What is the amount that the -- the county has to pay to take Lot E for the fire station?   Anthony M. Kennedy  And in your view, that's Lot E only.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And they pay $100,000 only.  That's it.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  You indicated there's no severance damages.  You're taking the entire parcel.   Anthony M. Kennedy  That's right.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That's $100,000 that go under your theory, land owners in the hypothetical that I put up would lose money and the State would be -- would be getting the windfall.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But the integrated -- the integrated use is determined by the market.  Your -- your theory completely ignores market factors.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Why isn't the value -- then why isn't that true here? Then why doesn't that defeat your theory here?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Your answer to Justice Ginsburg is that all of those other State regulations are also invalid.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Would it be enough if --   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  -- the husband owned one, wife owned the other? That's different? They're separate?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So why isn't an integrated unit because they had a barbecue? In other words, your hypothetical --   Anthony M. Kennedy  Under your -- well, whatever they have. (Laughter.)   Anthony M. Kennedy  Volleyball court. Under your hypothetical, if the hotel was on Lot F and the parking lot was Lot E, what would be the fair value if the State took Lot E for a firehouse?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Figure out the fair value? Don't you figure out the value of that on the market to a buyer, not the loss to the seller because he's next door? That has to be.   Anthony M. Kennedy  That just can't be if they're separate lots.  That's not the law in any State that I know.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But that's -- that's when there's a single parcel.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, then, under your view, the landowner wins either way.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  If the value is great, he gets the double value.  If the value is smaller, then he can sell the lot.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  In your example --   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, we won't --   Anthony M. Kennedy  But you're the one who's insisting on divisible -- on -- on the lots being treated separately, not --   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  -- not in my question.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I -- but I thought reasonable investment-backed expectations were objective.  You're now making them subjective.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  Oh, no.  To be clear, Justice Kennedy, we do think that it has to be an objective inquiry.  And I understood Justice Alito to be focusing on a fact pattern where the property was acquired before the relevant regulatory restriction was enacted and thereby frustrated the expectations. Here, we think it's actually a critical fact that Petitioners voluntarily brought this land under common ownership and so triggered the application of the merger provision decades after the relevant regulatory restriction was in place.  And that does weaken the idea that there were any objectively reasonable expectations --   ",15-214X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  But are you -- you're talking just about State law.  It seems to me that your position is as wooden and as vulnerable a criticism as -- as the Petitioner's.  You say, whatever State law -- basically you're saying, whatever State law does, that defines the property.  But you have to look at the reasonable investment-backed expectations of the owner.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But the reasonable investment-backed expectation was based on the fact that you had a lot-line rule which you've now changed.  So you say that the State law can change reasonable investment-backed expectations.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Yeah.  Well, isn't that this case?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But it's by voluntary action as defined by State law.  The State law takes that voluntary action.  And it's the State law that makes the consequence, and that's the consequence we're talking about.   Anthony M. Kennedy  -- the same with husband -- husband owns one lot, wife owns the other; they're different?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Would interpret it what way?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  May -- may I have one question? It's a background question. Suppose these people had Lots E and F merged.  Then they bought G and H.  Can they still build one house, just one?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, suppose -- suppose they're just like these lots.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

I mean, the new action is filed six days after the Supreme Court issues its decision in this case.  You could have asked for supplemental briefing?   Anthony M. Kennedy  And what's this key new evidence?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, certainly in the Federal system, and I assume in many States as well, regulations sometimes take years to promulgate.  I don't know of any rule that says we have to wait for regular -- regulations to be promulgated unless it's something unanticipated.  And the key objections you're making were clear in the statute, anyway.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  The -- the State, I think, is going to talk about the capacity of the remaining clinics.  Would it be A, proper, and B, helpful, for this Court to remand for further findings on clinic capacity?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

But there -- suppose there were evidence that there was a -- a capacity and a -- and a capability to -- to build these kinds of clinics, would that be of importance? And then it would show that this law has an effect, and a beneficial effect so far as the legislature is concerned.   Anthony M. Kennedy  About 20 percent.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Do you think the district court would have had discretion -- the district court having substantial equitable powers that appellate courts don't -- to say we're going to stay this requirement for two-and-a-half, three years, to see if the capacity problem can be cured.

Because my reading indicated that medical abortions are up nationwide but down significantly in Texas.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  I take it there will be instances, or there could be instances in which the court finds that there is jurisdiction, that there is no immunity, and then as the case develops in the fact finding stages that, you know, I've made a mistake; there's immunity here.  That could happen.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  In my -- my hypothetical, it is raised; the judge rules against it, and especially in a case like this where there's, I think, a foreign subsidiary that's incorporated in domestic -- domestically in Venezuela, then there might be questions of the extent of overlapping management and so forth. It seems to me that that might -- if there's an initial finding of no immunity, the judge might, in the course of hearing the case on the merits that, you know, really there's immunity here.  That's -- that's possible.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  This is the opposite, where they didn't know.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Is there a difference in expropriation and conversion?   Elaine J. Goldenberg  Well, I do think it's an important point that here, the underlying cause of action could be conversion, if someone brought that kind of cause of auction which wouldn't overlap exactly with the jurisdictional determination here.  You would still have to allege the jurisdictional prerequisites were met, the jurisdictional requirements of the statute. In an expropriation case --   Anthony M. Kennedy  Can you just finish? Expropriation is different because?   Elaine J. Goldenberg  Expropriation is different because this is a public act of a foreign sovereign taken in its own territory with respect to property in its own territory.  And that is something that, in the normal course, is going to be a matter for the courts in that territory to resolve. The very thing that makes it appropriate for the courts of another country to sit in judgment on that kind of act is that there has been a violation of international law.  And then you look at the nexus requirements in the expropriation exception, and those show that the property has some connection to the United States, which makes it appropriate for United States courts to sit in judgment. And there actually have been real problems, real sensitivities, real foreign relations concerns that have been raised in this area, stemming from the D.C. Circuit's 2008 decision in the Chabad case, which is where the D.C. Circuit first announced the rule that we're considering here.  That's an expropriation case against Russia.  The D.C. Circuit decided there was a nonfrivolous allegation that the property had been taken in violation of international law. At that point, Russia, feeling that it was immune and it hadn't gotten a full determination of its immunity, dropped out of the case, and the district court started imposing sanctions of $50,000 a day.  In response, Russia initiated an expropriation action against us in Moscow and started imposing $50,000-a-day sanctions on the United States. So that could happen -- something like that could conceivably happen, even under the standard that we're talking about, that a foreign state could take offense.  But this is a very sensitive issue.

And if the lunch takes place first and there's -- there's no precondition on the lunch, but after the lunch there is wink-wink, nod-nod, and the contact takes place, it's clear in the standard criminal law that there is a conspiracy there.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  We're in agreement.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But then this -- this doesn't answer Justice Breyer's basic question and ours. You're going to tell the Senators, the officials with the lunches, that, don't worry.  The jury has to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, and that's tough. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That was your answer. That was your answer.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Would it be --   Anthony M. Kennedy  -- absolutely stunning to say that the government has given us no workable standard?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Perhaps what you're talking about is how evil the conspiracy is.  It's not evil to -- to fish or to have a bottle of wine, but it is evil if you up the ante.  Is that -- is that what you're saying?   INTERRUPTING ",15-474X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, what -- what is the rule, then, that you're formulating, so that we can answer Justice Alito's questions and similar questions? Recusal is required when, and fill in the blank.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Under that answer, then, why doesn't the Brady violation problem drop out of the case? And that's not an argument for -- for -- an extra argument for recusal.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, he didn't know about the Brady violation.  The Brady violation basically occurred in -- in the course of trial.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I mean after they sought the death penalty.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, then, that doesn't follow with the rule that you gave me at the outset. You should recuse yourself when, and now -- now you're adding -- if there's a question that involves a substantial integrity -- a substantial question involving the integrity of the office? So that's an added --   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That's an added factor in your analysis?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  I -- I still don't see how the Brady violation fits into the formula you want us to adopt, unless you're amending it to say anything that involves the integrity of the office while you were the head of the office.   ",15-5040
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, the number of amicus briefs filed by former prosecutors and attorneys belies and refutes that -- that suggestion, it seems to me. And Section 455 of 28 U.S.C., where we have rather mechanical recusal standards, also refutes that.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  No, but you were arguing, well, this was going to be unworkable.  And we know, both from the briefs and the statutes, that far more rigid recusal standards are in place and are quite workable.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, but here, of course, the essence of the Brady violation has alleged -- as alleged, is that the evidence was concealed for years; they didn't know about it.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  He didn't know about it because subordinates in his -- his office, under his supervision, concealed the facts.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So the fact that he spent 30 years in solitary confinement actually helps the State? (Laughter.)   Anthony M. Kennedy  So I -- I suppose, for purposes of phrasing the question, to reach questions here, we -- we will assume that there is bias; we assume he should have recused.  But then is it your submission that there is harmless error because it was a multimember panel?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Is that a fair statement or not?   Anthony M. Kennedy  The --   Anthony M. Kennedy  Suppose you have a very brilliant trial judge, and the power of his reasoning is -- it's persuasive and -- and forceful but he's biased, end of case.  You have -- he has to be recused.   INTERRUPTING ",15-5040
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Did you seek any sanction of -- for the seal violations other than dismissal?   Anthony M. Kennedy  Why not?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, just under Justice Ginsburg's question, why -- why don't the defendants have a stronger interest in having the seal requirement followed than the government does?   Anthony M. Kennedy  That's the point of the question right now.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But again, you didn't ask for any sanction other than dismissal.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Let's assume for the moment that there is a First Amendment right to discuss the actions that took place.  How, then, do you answer Justice Sotomayor's and Justice Ginsburg's question? The harm here that you're talking about could have been -- occurred with First Amendment protection. Let's assume there is a First Amendment protection.  How then would you answer the question?   Anthony M. Kennedy  And -- and -- and why does the government need that latitude?   John F. Bash  It needs that latitude because defendants could potentially take steps to stymie an investigation if they know that there's an actual government attorney looking at this right now because they have to look at it under the statute.  That was, I think, Congress's thinking in 1986, and I don't even really take Petitioner to disagree with that at this point. In -- in terms of how to write the opinion --   Anthony M. Kennedy  You were going to tell us how to write the ideal platonic opinion?   John F. Bash  I wouldn't presume to say the platonic opinion.  But to the extent the Court seeks our recommendation in how to write the opinion, we think that the overall focus should be courts should remedy these seal orders like they always remedy protective orders and seal orders, with a healthy dose of discretion, but, in light of the purpose of this provision, to protect the government. More specifically, the three factors identified by the courts below: actual harm to the government; severity of the violation, which I think correlates with potential harm; and intent or bad faith are the three key factors in a mine run case.  But we don't think the Court should exclude that in an idiosyncratic case.  Defendant's reputation or other factors could be relevant. We also think -- Justice Alito, I think this responds to your questions about making sure to send a strong message that these violations will not be tolerated.  We think the Court could have dismissed this case here.  We don't say that it would have been an abuse of discretion to dismiss the case here.  And I think if the Court's worried about sending the signal that intentional violations don't matter, it could say the district court would have been perfectly within its discretion to dismiss here.  If State Farm had sought additional sanctions, the Court would have been in its discretion to refer counsel to the bar or to impose other sanctions, but they didn't seek that here. And the abuse of discretion standard, we think, should be particularly robust in this context because the government relies on the relator.  The suit's not dismissed.  The government doesn't intervene. There is a trial of however many days, as Mr. Singh said.  And to unwind that all after the fact, I mean, I think it shows why the abuse of discretion standard should be particularly robust in this context.

0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  I take it from that you would agree that there might be cases where, under Ashe v. Swenson, there's an acquittal on one count, conviction on the other count, conviction set aside, government can retry the count that had been set aside, on the ground that under Ashe v. Swenson the verdict on the other count was just irrelevant.   Anthony M. Kennedy  In this case, could it be argued -- was the argument before the jury on the conspiracy in the travel counts closely intertwined with 666 so that it -- you can't say the jury decided most likely on some issue that's irrelevant to 666?   Anthony M. Kennedy  I don't understand why you're saying we don't know why the jury convicted on 666.  It convicted because the evidence was overwhelming.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  That's why it convicted.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I understand there was an instructional error.  But we know why the jury convicted.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Because under the -- because under the erroneous instruction, they clearly found the facts of a violation.  All of the factual elements the government asserted were found to be true.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Under your argument, the trial court could instruct the jury: If you find guilt on 666 and if you find that there was travel, you must find that there was guilt under the travel section as well.  That's what you're saying.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, you're saying in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question that the jury can't make different decisions with multiple counts.  So based on your theory, the trial court can instruct the jury: If you find guilt on 666, you must find guilt on the others, if you find there was travel.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  But I think that's an improper instruction.   Anthony M. Kennedy  That -- that wasn't Justice --   Anthony M. Kennedy  -- Alito's hypothetical, as I understand it.  His hypothetical is the juror lied -- pardon me -- the witness lies.  Conviction set aside for instructional error.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Can that witness be prosecuted for perjury?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  So then -- and then his point could follow this; the conviction can be used for some things.   Anthony M. Kennedy  You're -- you're saying it is highly doubtful if the government had charged just counts 2 and 3 and got an acquittal, and that they could then have had a second trial under 666.  You're saying that just couldn't happen under Ashe v. Swenson.   ",15-537X

Say, well, you know, the jury obviously found that you did this; there was an instruction on the criminal aspect but didn't -- but you did this act, and that's collateral estoppel, or it's issue preclusion, in a civil case for damages.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Assuming that there's no serious risk of an establishment violation, that's off the table, are there ever instances in which status -- religious status can be used to deny religions or religious believers benefits from the State? Or are you saying that it's -- that absent in Establishment Clause problem, that status can never be the base -- religious status can never be the basis for a governmental action or governmental ordinance, governmental statute?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Are all of these questions really ones that verge onto the Establishment Clause; fire extinguishers, bible lessons on a sunny day, and so forth?

Kovner  No.  We think that this is a really serious issue and that it ought to be addressed through the kinds of safeguards this Court has always applied.  But we think that to the extent the Court has recognized dangers, they are present here, and so to take, for instance, the danger of impeding full and fair jury room deliberations, we think that's a particular risk when you're talking about this kind of very allegation that contains a very high degree of social opprobrium attached to it. So, Your Honor, I mean, there may be cases in which race is discussed in the jury room because it's appropriate, because the claim involves racial bias, because there's allegations surrounding police misconduct in which race is often discussed.  And that's different from, for example, coin flipping or intoxication, where there's really never going to be any reason why those things should go on.

Kovner  We think that capital cases do present Eighth Amendment considerations that are not present here.  The Court has often suggested under the Eighth Amendment different sets of rules apply, and there may be different considerations in that context. But, Your Honor, we think, to the extent the Court regards the rule as problematic or as one that deserves further study, the appropriate way to do that is as a rulemaking body, which is another way in which this Court considers and continually exercises oversight as to the rules of evidence.

Sarah E. Harrington  Well, they often do in plans.  In -- in our -- in our experience, when there is a structured dismissal like the kind at issue here, usually those -- the parties turn to that kind of disposition, because they can't obtain the consent of the parties that they would need to get a plan confirmed.  And so basically what you have is an agreement that is, in essence, an unconfirmable plan. And instead of trying to get that confirmed, they call it a structured dismissal to override the consent of the priority claimholders. And so in those cases, no, but -- but -- but I think priority claimholders all the time agree to an impairment of their rights, and, in fact, the priority claimholders, other than Petitioners who were paid in this case, agreed to take, you know, some cents on the dollar like the tax claimholders and -- and the administrative expenses.

1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  The problem is, is how to instruct the jury on that point.  Both parties, not the government, both parties kind of leave it up and say, oh, give it to the juror.  If I were the juror, I simply wouldn't know what to do under your -- under your test. My preference, if -- if I were just making another sensible rule, is we'd have market studies to see how the -- the extent to which the design affected the consumer, and then the jury would have something to do that.  But that's apportionment, which runs headlong into the statute. You can't really have apportionment, so it seems to me you leave us with no -- one choice is to have a de minimis exception, like the cup-holder example that's in the car -- maybe the boat windshield, which is a little more difficult -- and just follow the -- and just follow the words of the statute.  But it seems to me neither side gives us an instruction to work with.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  One -- I mean, it's one thing to leave it to the jury.  It's the other thing -- if I were the juror, I wouldn't know what to do under your brief.   Anthony M. Kennedy  If I'm the juror, I just don't know what to do.  I'd have the iPhone in the jury room; I'd -- I'd look at it.  I just wouldn't know.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

Suppose the Volkswagen Beetle design was done in three days, and it was a stroke of genius and it identified the car.  Then it seems to me that that's quite unfair to say, well, we give three days' profit, but then it took 100,000 hours to develop the motor.   Anthony M. Kennedy  I mean, that's what -- it seems to me that that's what you would be arguing.   Anthony M. Kennedy  This is Justice -- Justice Ginsburg's question.  Is that -- is your answer to her, adequately summarized, the test that you propose at page 9 of your brief relevant considerations include?   Brian H. Fletcher  So I think the test we propose at page 9 goes to the first of the two questions that I was speaking to, which is what's the article of manufacture to which the design has been applied? Once the fact-finder makes that judgment, that's the test that we proposed, and that's, I think, I took to be Justice Sotomayor's question. I understood Justice Ginsburg to be asking once the fact-finder decides that the relevant article is, say, the windshield on the boat or the cup-holder on the car, how do they separate out the part of the profits that are attributable to that component from the whole. And as to that question, we haven't briefed it in a lot of detail, but I was trying to explain to Justice Ginsburg that there are analogous problems that courts have confronted in other areas of law.

That was a case where the copyright was on a script --   Anthony M. Kennedy  Would expert witnesses be called on in order to show part one or part two or both?   Brian H.

Fletcher  In this case, I think someone familiar with the industry, someone who had worked in the industry, either at -- a manufacture of a smartphone company, or someone who is familiar with the market for smartphones and who could speak to on the first question how smartphones are put together, how they are manufactured, how they're used by the users, the extent to which the components of a smartphone are separable. And then on the second question, the one that Justice Ginsburg was asking, I think they would -- the experts would probably be speaking -- or could be speaking to some of the issues that Your Honor raised in your question in the Sullivan, which is things like consumer surveys, to what extent do the various components of a smartphone drive consumer demand and contribute to the value of the phone.

Kennedy  To sanction someone because they prevailed in a case.   Sarah E. Harrington  I think it's --   Anthony M. Kennedy  That's without any misleading.  All they've done is file a suit.   Sarah E. Harrington  I think it is plausible, but unlikely to happen.  But if -- but if you can think about it more broadly.  If you can imagine a system where a plaintiff was permitted and entitled, in Petitioner's words, to come in and throw up any possible legal argument no matter how frivolous, and the burden was on the defendant to shoot all of those arguments down, that is not the system that we have adopted.  Rule 11, every court of appeals to consider the issue has suggested -- has held that Rule 11 requires a party to certify that it has done a reasonable investigation and has a good faith-basis for believing that its claims are warranted by law.  Every court of appeals that has considered it has said that that includes forebearing from filing a lawsuit when it is obvious that it is -- that there's a landscape of defense.   Anthony M. Kennedy  The Rule applies to every affirmative defense.   Sarah E. Harrington  Every obvious affirmative defense where the creditor or the plaintiff --   Anthony M. Kennedy  Are there any nonobvious affirmative defenses to which it wouldn't apply?   Sarah E. Harrington  I mean, I think something like contributory negligence may be kind of a classic affirmative defense that would be -- it would be hard to -- to say that the plaintiff in the civil litigation had an --   Anthony M. Kennedy  How about a lack -- lack of personal jurisdiction?   Sarah E. Harrington  Lack -- I mean, I guess it depends on the circumstances.  If there's -- if the creditor --   Anthony M. Kennedy  You know -- you know there is no personal jurisdiction, but you filed a -- filed a suit anyway, and the Rule says that -- that it has -- you have to make an objection.   Sarah E. Harrington  I don't think that would arise in a bankruptcy context, but in a civil litigation context --   Anthony M. Kennedy  I'm talking about just -- as ordinary civil litigation.   Sarah E. Harrington  I think if -- what I would say is if the Court could sanction that under Rule 11, then we think --   Anthony M. Kennedy  And he can always consent to the waiving of the statute of limitations by not raising it.   Sarah E. Harrington  But -- but not in bankruptcy because it's -- if it -- the debtor cannot consent to the -- to the payment of a time-barred claim because that takes money away from other creditors --   ",16-348X
0,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well, let -- let me -- let me ask this.  In -- in State courts generally, my understanding is that there is a debt; it is just not enforceable. Forget bankruptcy.  A civil practitioner represents the creditors.  They know the debt is time barred.  Is it unethical to sue because -- on -- on the theory that the defense may not be waived?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  They may -- may not be raised?   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  If the defense isn't raised as an affirmative defense, as a matter of pleading I assume in some jurisdictions, and it goes to trial and you say, oh, judge, this is time barred, the judge will say, too late, you didn't raise the defense.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But if -- if the States were so worried about that, why don't all States do what apparently two States do? They say if the statute of limitation runs, the debt is barred forever.  But, apparently, many States don't say that.  They say you can still sue.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And that's the trouble I'm having in this case.   Anthony M. Kennedy  It's a little hard for -- to imagine how to write a opinion to say that the law is a trap for the unwary.  But that's -- that's in effect what you want us to say.   Anthony M. Kennedy  The uncounseled person gets a notice of -- of demand for payment.  The uncounseled person doesn't know about a statute of limitations.  So it's a trap for the unwary.  But the law makes that trap.  That's my problem.   ",16-348X
1,"Anthony M. Kennedy  Well suppose --   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Suppose this case, police arrest without a warrant a man who's having dinner with his family and friends, white collar crime.  They did not get a warrant.  They did have probable cause.  They could have gotten a warrant.  And he sues -- and later the charges are dismissed, it was a mistake, but there was still probable cause.  And he sues for fright and humiliation.  Under your theory, you'd say, well, even if he got a warrant, he'd have the same fright and humiliation, so there's -- there's no damage.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  Then -- then we simply have no way to enforce the warrant requirement.  So -- so you stand by the proposition that if there is an unlawful entry, an unlawful arrest because of a lack of a warrant, no damage because the arrest would have happened with -- with the warrant anyway.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  You want us -- you want us to write that in the law.   Anthony M. Kennedy  Yeah, let's stick with this -- with this hypothetical.  Under your view, we're saying that you cannot sue for damages and humiliation if there's an entry without a warrant if there had been probable cause otherwise.  That's -- that's the rule you want us to announce.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  And if that's -- and if that's so, I'd like the citation for that case.   INTERRUPTING Anthony M.

Kennedy  -- isn't that a little bit different than the provocation rule at 25(a) where they say there was no warrant and therefore there's -- those are two different things, right.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Right.  We understand those to be the two alternative holdings from the first question presented and the second question presented. So the second question presented isn't talking about whether the use of force is constitutionally excessive, clearly established violation.  It's talking about, was there a violation with the entry and did that proximately cause the damages at issue.  And if I can address that question. We just think there's a fundamental problem --   Anthony M. Kennedy  There -- there is probable cause --   Nicole A. Saharsky  Oh, I'm sorry.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But there was a failure to get a warrant.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Yes.   Anthony M. Kennedy  And there should have been a warrant.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Right.  I think that the question you would ask in that case is the normal proximate cause question about what kind of damages, you know, would there be from a failure to get a warrant in those circumstances, what's natural and foreseeable.  So I'm -- I wouldn't say --   Anthony M. Kennedy  And if the humiliation is the same either way, no damage?   Nicole A. Saharsky  I'd -- I'm not saying that it depends on whether proximate cause and you could have gotten a warrant.  I'm just saying that you look at what actually happened and determine the -- the natural and probable consequences from that. I mean, the Court -- just maybe one more sentence. The Court has not had a lot of opportunities in the 1983 concept -- context to work out these probable cause cases.  I think in some of the Court's other opinions you've said probable cause is a very flexible concept.

Anytime there's an arrest for First Amendment protected speech, there's a violation of the Constitution, something to that effect. It -- it -- it seems to me that one of the difficulties of this case is that there are any number of hypotheticals you have.

In this case, there's a very serious contention that people in -- in elected office deliberately wanted to intimidate this person, and it seems to me that maybe in this case we should cordon off or box off what happened here from the ordinary conduct of police officers.

A thousand plaintiffs diligently bring -- or 100 plaintiffs diligently bring their individual causes of action within the statute. At that point, would your rule say if they can -- there can be a second class action, but there's no further repose --   INTERRUPTING Anthony M. Kennedy  -- or no further tolling?

So you want Congress to act against the background in which this Court has made an incorrect resolution of the law. That's -- that's the assumption you're making. Of course, I know your backup argument is that Quill is correct.  I understand that.   Anthony M. Kennedy  But -- but the assumption of many of these questions is that Quill is incorrect but that that doesn't make any difference.  And I'm suggesting that it does make a difference when -- when Congress acts for it to determine what the constitutional rule is as correctly stated by this Court.
