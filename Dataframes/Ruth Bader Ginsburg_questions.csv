1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It showed what the creditor had been getting before, and that, I thought, was the argument, that in...  out of chapter 17...  13, in chapter 13 our contract rate was 21 percent, and that represents what it would cost this borrower if he were today to take those funds, get the same funds.  It would cost him 21 percent because he's a high-risk borrower.  That's...  that's the theory.  But you're saying that that is a wrong theory, as Judge Rovner said in her opinion, but it's...  it's not because it's more difficult to apply than some other theory.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think you're...  you're saying that that's a wrong approach, and maybe you'll say why.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Let me ask you this...  this piece of it.  The...  Justice Scalia said to give this kind of you-pick-it discretion to the bankruptcy judge is a worrisome thing, but all of the cases that take this approach, the Treasury bill approach or the prime, seem to have a rather narrow range for that risk factor.  They go from 1 percent to 3 percent, and none of them go over 3 percent.  Where did they...  where did that range...  who invented that range that 3 percent would be the ceiling?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  A what payment?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because if this had been foreclosure value, then if we were going through this exercise, well, the creditor would...  would then sell the asset and...  and charge a...  a new borrower with the same rate of interest.  But the asset would be worth much less than the price...   ",02-1016
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Your...  If you take Mr. Salmons' point that now we're in bankruptcy, it's a different world, and we've got one creditor...  let's say $4,000 is the principal for both, but one lent at prime and one lent at subprime.  Once we're in the universe of bankruptcy, why shouldn't those two lenders, both with $4,000 principals, be treated the same?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But once you're in the bankruptcy, the risk of getting back the $4,000 is the same for both creditors, isn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But don't you get certain advantages?  I mean, you do have the wage order.  So there's a court supervising that this wage...  every month that this person, this borrower, is going to have to pay.  And in the...  in...  in that setting you also have...  going back to Rash, the one thing I don't understand about it because it seems you want to take it the high side both ways.  You've already been given the replacement value rather than the foreclosure value.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So if we're going to do it your way and say, well, now, suppose the lender foreclosed on the asset, made a new loan at the 21 percent rate...  but you would have to use not the replacement value, the higher value.  You could only use what you could get on foreclosure if we follow your theory about we should make it just like you sold the asset, got money, and made a new loan.  But the...  but you...  but the amount that you got would be much less than the replacement value which is what you're getting inside the bankruptcy.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But isn't that one of the adjustments that would have to be made?  You couldn't say adjust 20 percent against $4,000.  You'd have to say $4,000 minus because your foreclosure price is going to be much lower than the replacement costs that you've got in the bankruptcy.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, Mr....  Mr....  it is to this extent.  Most of these debtors are very small debtors.  You say take the contract rate as the presumptive rate and then we're going to knock down for all these other things.  The high replacement cost that...  is one thing.  The interest that they got before bankruptcy is another.  The transaction cost that they're saved, another.  And so let the debtor come in and show that.  But the debtor has no money at all and certainly you don't want the debtor's money eaten up hiring an attorney and further depleting the money that could go to the creditors.  So it seems to me wildly unrealistic to expect that if you say the presumptive price is the contract price, you're going to get a debtor who will be able to...  I mean, I was surprised, looking at this record, that this debtor got an expert.  Who...  who paid the expert?  Maybe because the union was involved?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But isn't it typical that these chapter 13 debtors don't have lawyers and don't have experts?   ",02-1016
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Phillips, I hope maybe you make... you're going to make this point later, but it seems to me it's very important which contract controls because the Government has made an argument, as you know, that the COGSA limit, the $500 per package, would not apply under the ICC contract, that the number there would be $450,000.  It's... so I hope you will explain to us why... if you think that the Government is wrong, why they are wrong in saying if it's the ICC contract with Kirby, then the appropriate limit is not COGSA but the $450,000.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If you're right, Mr. Frederick, that it's State law that controls, then why should we decide anything beyond that choice of law question?  Because if State law controls, then Louisiana could do it one way, Mississippi could do it the other way.  Why should we be concerned what the substantive answer would be if State law controls?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if you're wrong about that constructive notice, then you could still say, well, the statute has been extended 10 years because of the assessment.  However, one might conclude that the interest stops running and that you can't use administrative collection procedures.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are you... are you saying that we should maybe flag it but not decide it?

It said, valuable mineral deposits, and there's a significant difference between... a lump of silver might be tremendously valuable, but it wouldn't be a deposit if that's all there was.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why couldn't it be that the... the word valuable doesn't mean at the time of the patent?  It means reserves the mineral rights, and if and when they prove valuable, the Government will assert its right.  I mean, one could imagine a metal that was not considered worth anything.  Let's just suppose that was the view of uranium.  And then years later, one realizes the tremendous value of that metal.  Would one say that, well, because when the patent was granted, no one had any idea how valuable this would be, therefore when it turns out that it is indeed very valuable, the United States hasn't any reserved rights?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Didn't we have a case that involved, was it methane, that was thought not only did it have no value, but it was a positive detriment to have it?  And then years later it turned out to be something very valuable.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So who had the reserve?  Didn't somebody have reserved rights in it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  When... when you say today about... and you cite the opinion of the solicitor from 1956, but the position that the Government is arguing today in this Court is not new.  This is hardly the first time the Government has taken the position that sand and gravel can be valuable minerals.   ",02-1593
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May... may I just interrupt to ask?  I thought that you... we weren't going to talk about dirt because dirt is part animal, part vegetable, so it's not mineral.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then how do you explain the 1956 solicitor letter... opinion... the DOI solicitor who said that... that there's a reservation only if the gravel had a definite economic value because of the proximity of a market at the date of the patent?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's... there's another... there's another piece from the Department of the Interior that Mr. McCrum emphasized in addition to the 1956 opinion letter, and it was a heading or a sentence in the Western Nuclear brief, in the SG's brief, stating that the reservation embraces only gravel deposits that are economically exploitable and would justify an entry under the 1872 Mining Act.  So in Western Nuclear, according to Mr. McCrum, that issue wasn't before the Court and the Government said, indeed, the issue is it has to be economically exploitable at the time of the patent.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But, Mr. Eisenberg, you would concede that those... those questions are... are certainly ambiguous.  The... Pennsylvania made the change just to clarify that it was the individual juror and not the... the group.  You can look at those and conclude that just like you had to find the aggravated unanimously, so you had to find each mitigating unanimously.  The form is certainly susceptible to that reading.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Eisenberg, if you... if you were... if you were a... a defense lawyer and you knew that the... the law was that each juror could individually decide the mitigators and you were confronted with a form like this, would you object?

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That might have been, Mr.... Mr. Flora, the logical extension of Lockett, but to say that Lockett itself compelled or directed that extension I think is quite a stretch.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Does it... does it mean nothing that this Court was so sharply divided and that you really have just an opinion?  The lead opinion is labeled opinion of the Court, but Justice White disassociated himself from the reading.  He... he had a much narrower view of the case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If there's doubt about that, I mean, one might say you would prevail on that argument in a debate, but Teague requires more, doesn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Does it make any difference if it's four Justices, as it was in McKoy, do you think?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Does it make any difference that the dissenters say Lockett didn't remotely support the rule that a mitigator found by only one juror controls?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that is what... what was said in McKoy by the dissenters.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But wouldn't that undercut this Court's remand the first time around?

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Nathan, would you explain to me how this generally operates with adult shops?  In the... in the film context, the film can't be shown.  These were in the old days when they had censure boards.  So there was a great impetus to have quick action.  But here, I take it that the business was up and running and it was the city that said you need a license.  And my question is, do these questions... does the business start first and the city come in and say you need a license, or do... does the entrepreneur wait until... and... and apply for a license before starting up in business?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So this is an atypical case where the business was running and the city came in and said, you need a license?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How serious is the burden?  I mean, there are now a few circuits that have said that prompt judicial resolution, not merely access, is required.  I think it's the Fourth, Sixth, and Ninth.  What has been the resolution there?  What have cities done?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But they say they're not an adult business, and that's the preliminary characterization.  I mean, they... they don't have a license.  They didn't apply for one because they said, we don't need a license.  We're not that kind of business.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This is the Federal district court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is... is there no court, municipal level court, in Colorado as there was in Baltimore?  I mean, the... the reaction of Maryland to the Freedman case was to set up a proceeding in the Baltimore City court, and it had explicit time lines.  And then it provided for an expedited appeal to the Maryland Court of Appeals.  So why... I... I thought that the FW/PBS case said, we're... we're not going to follow... the... the government has to go into court because it isn't like censorship.  But the other two apply.  So why don't you just... why isn't that the solution, the one that was adopted in Freedman for... for the proceedings in court?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But everyone who complains about administrative action, adverse administrative action, has a right to promptly open the door.  So that, if you read it to just to say access, then it essentially does nothing.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's one curious feature in this and maybe you could explain it to me.  Apparently this business was denied a sales tax license and yet they were in business.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can... can a business start up and... a retail business without such a license?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What... what does prompt access mean as opposed to relaxed access?  I... I just don't understand the content of prompt access if... if access is getting into court.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But what... what is the commercial other than if they... if they're going to set it up in a place where you can have businesses... in other words, there isn't the same license requirement for these two businesses.  There's a special licensing requirement for adult bookstores because of their secondary effects.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is this bookstore now operating in a place where it isn't permitted to be under the Littleton ordinance?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Now, what I don't understand is you... you are concerned about the... the efficacy of judicial review.  You picked your forum.  You picked the Federal court rather than the State court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You got a review of that ordinance, every piece of it, for constitutionality.  I don't understand what complaint you have now about judicial review, having had judicial review in the Federal court and having had the Federal court uphold most of this ordinance.  So you've... you've had judicial review.  How... how... how are you a proper complainant about what access you might have had in the State courts if you chose to go there?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you... the... the unconstitutional area left is this prompt judicial review, but you've already had judicial review.  That's why I don't understand what is your current complaint.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If the... if the municipal court was good enough in Freedman, where you had a real censorship problem, why shouldn't it be adequate, entirely adequate, for adult bookstores?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would... would you explain one puzzling thing?  Mr. Nathan told us that the district court said, of course, they're an adult bookstore.  That's so clear.  On that basic characterization whether you are or are not an adult business, the Federal court, according to Mr. Nathan, said you were an adult business.  Is that over and done with now so what you're left with is you are an adult business and you have to get a license?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And yet, you're still operating in a place where you can't be if you are an adult business.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How about the sales tax?  You're still operating without a sales tax license, but you're selling things.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Not enforce the licensing law.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do they have any other sanction?  Because the notion of an administrative remedy ordinarily would be a remedy for the individual who's complaining.  But as I understand it, this administrative process, this detailed administrative process, leads only to one sanction, the one you have described as draconian.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Have funds--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --have funds... Mr. Dellinger, have funds ever been withdrawn from any school because of a violation of--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --title IX?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And I can't imagine anyone who would want such a sanction.  It doesn't help--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --the girls on the team.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr.--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Gornstein, what implication would there be, if we took the view of the circuit here, for Federal employment?  Title VII does have a discrete retaliation provision, but it doesn't with respect to Federal employees, if I understand.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Like the choice it made in 1982, very spare statute.  When Congress got to title IX, it knew about Sullivan and so it... this... this statute in its breadth and its simplicity bears a striking resemblance to the old pattern in 1981 and 1982 and 1983.  So if you say to me, look at the closest model, it would be that and not the more detailed civil rights legislation that came in '64 and '65.   Kevin C. Newsom  Well, if... if I could answer in two parts.  First, to say that I think what was going on in 1964 in the Civil Rights Act, obviously, you have Congress in title VII addressing itself both to discrimination and to retaliation separately; in title VI, passed as part of the same piece of legislation, addressing itself solely to discrimination.  And to use Justice Souter's analogy, in '72 Congress takes the title VI model and not the title VII model.  Now, to get to your question specifically, I think, about Sullivan is at the heart of your question, Sullivan... I think there are a number of problems with the other side's reliance on Sullivan.  First, with all due respect to this Court, Sullivan itself is pretty opaque.  It certainly does not announce with flashing lights a principle that every anti-discrimination provision necessarily entails a subsidiary or corollary--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It says if you're thrown out of the club because you champion the rights of a black man, you have a right to sue under this statute.   Kevin C. Newsom  --Even if I were to grant your assumption of clarity in Sullivan, which Justice Harlan, I presume, would not agree with... he was left sort of scratching his head trying to figure out what the Court was trying to do.  But even granting your assumption, if 1982 can be construed that way, that... that construction does not necessarily carry over to every anti-discrimination provision.  1982, of course, uses different language to begin with and, more importantly, is... is passed under Congress' power under the Thirteenth Amendment, which is the broadest conceivable--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  On account of race is in it.  Right?   Kevin C. Newsom  --I'll have to confess I don't... it does say something like every person shall have the same right as... dot, dot, dot, as white persons.  But so the... the language frankly is pretty different, and the more fundamental point I'm trying to make is that even if that's true for... for that statute passed under that constitutional power, here we are talking, as Justice Kennedy made clear at the very outset of the argument about a Spending Clause statute, where it is required that conditions on the acceptance of Federal funds be express, and it is not clear to me where the Birmingham Board would have gotten its clear notice in this case.  If you can imagine--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It seems to me they would get it when Congress says, and here's the statute, very spare, and agency, you get up guidelines, that any responsible school board would say, well, we've got only one sentence in the statute.  We better look at the regulations to find out what's required.   Kevin C. Newsom  --I agree, and... and if... and if the Birmingham Board, which I trust it did, looked to the regulation here, what it would have found is a regulation not that clarifies the substantive scope of title IX, but instead that... that manages the internal operating procedures for official agency investigations.  So to be sure, the Birmingham Board was on notice that it could not retaliate in... in the business of an official OCR investigation, and if it did, it would be subject to administrative enforcement, but it was... it was not on notice either of the fact that there was a generic anti-retaliation prohibition, much less the fact that if it violated any such nonexistent--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it's... we're not talking about the procedure, I mean, what procedural moves.  What must you do to comply?  And it has in there you don't retaliate.  So you mean that a board could responsibly take the position, well, the... the regulations tell us we don't retaliate, but when we're not faced with any agency breathing down our neck, all we have is a teacher in front of us, then we can retaliate?  I mean, they must have known the statute meant don't retaliate.   Kevin C. Newsom  --And... and with respect, I think there is a difference, particularly given the clear notice requirements that this Court has... has used in Spending Clause cases between retaliation in the context of an OCR investigation and retaliation generally, but... I'm sorry.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I... I really don't get that.  If the rule is don't retaliate and if we investigate, that's one of the things we're going... that's going to be on our checklist.  But the substantive rule is don't retaliate.   Kevin C. Newsom  Justice Stevens, may I respond?   ",02-1672
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How often has OCR come to the school district in question under title IX?  There are many statutes that--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --OCR administers.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How does he differ... how does he differ from the renter in Sullivan who was complaining about the refusal to sell or lease property to African Americans?  He wanted to lease his property, and as a result, he was thrown out of the club.  And this Court said he could maintain that suit.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I ask you with respect to that, is OCR so different from other agencies that have to pick and choose because they simply don't have the resources to enforce?  Now, how often does OCR, in fact, go in and investigate?  How many times do they say, well, it's low priority for us, girls' soccer or girls' basketball, and we have bigger fish to fry?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that wasn't my question.  My question is of the universe of complaints that are made under title IX, how many does OCR actually follow up, or isn't it strapped for resources so that it can't, however much it may want to, come in the way you described?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that was the very reason for recognizing a private right of action because the... the requirement, the anti-discrimination requirement, would be a dead letter if you didn't have people who could enforce it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that's... to say trust me is... is not an answer.  Cannon is one thing, a woman in her 30's.  A sixth-grader who is told she can't play on a team because there's none for girls is hardly similarly situated and the law won't be enforced as to her unless you have someone who is best positioned to know what is going on, who is the coach.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The... the point is if you say to the school, you cannot retaliate against someone because a complaint has been made, that's a powerful incentive for the school not to retaliate against someone and to do something about the discrimination.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why wasn't it in the regulations of the agency spelled out rather clearly... the... the agency that says, Congress has told us to implement this statute, here are our regulations and our regulations are you don't retaliate?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it's the--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --It said in this statute we do, having in mind that title VI would be interpreted in the identical way--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --title VII... VI proscribing race discrimination in all Federal programs.  So it said these statutes aimed at race discrimination, sex discrimination do have a... a private right of action, and that was the holding of this Court.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, it seems to me that if you're talking about the sixth grade soccer team, realistically the only one who is going to know anything... enough and be brave enough to complain will be the teacher.  And if you cut the teacher out, then forget it.  You have nice words on paper and they'll never be enforced.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And OCR says, as it usually does, we're too busy.  Sorry.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I ask you with respect to that?  When you found out that you had this fundamental jurisdictional objection, when did you know that the partnership included partners not only Texas entities but two Mexican citizens?  When did you find that out?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's a curious thing about what Dataflux did.  Dataflux at one point moved to add the Mexicans as individuals as counterdefendants.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And why would it do that if they were members of the partnership.  If... if it was sure that they were members of the partnership, then you wouldn't need to make them defendants as individuals because partners have individual liability.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But at that stage, you called them employees or former employees.  So it seems that the... that you had some inkling.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, you've admitted it.  You... you just admitted it flat out in your answer.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, there was in the constitutional sense.  There wasn't under the statute.  There was diversity, but not complete diversity.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's not what... well, correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought that Atlas is a partnership.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that it... and that there are three players involved... five.  Two are Mexican and three are Texan.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So then you would have on one side Texan and Mexican and the other side Texan.  If you drop out the Mexicans, then you're left, from the plaintiff's side... you're left with a complete diversity case.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it's what happened.  They did go away for a reason unrelated to this lawsuit.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, long before the case was tried.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, so when the case... when this case was tried, there was complete diversity.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought in Mollan v. Torrance exactly what I described happened.  Chief Justice Marshall said you've got one spoiler on the plaintiffs' side.  Take it out and you'll have complete diversity.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, it's not the same.  It isn't the same because a partnership is a citizen of every State in which a partner resides.  Isn't that correct?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you have, just as if you'd have five individuals... that's what they are in fact... in effect, because they're jointly and severally liable.  So you have, as I said before, three Texan and two Mexicans.  You don't have one person that can say, ah, I'm going to defeat diversity by moving where I live, or I'm going to create diversity.  You... none of these people's citizenships has ever changed.  That's quite different from somebody saying, I want to change my citizenship.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it didn't leave Texas behind.  Texas was always there.  The Mexican partners left.  So I just don't see that it's anything like... I mean, this... as I said before, there's the same five people.  Two drop out and so you've got three Texans, and there were always three Texans.  They didn't move to Texas.  They were there from the start.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If Atlas had been a corporation incorporated in Texas, then there would have been complete diversity.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If Atlas... instead of being a partnership composed of five members, it had organized as a corporation, as a Texas corporation.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But would... would... my question is wouldn't the... if these... if this entity had been organized as a corporation, there would have been complete diversity.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I don't want to belabor this any further, but you do see the difference between an individual moving from New York to New Jersey, say, and a... a partnership with five partners, all of whom remain where they are.  They don't move anyplace else.  Those partners, those live human beings, stay exactly what they were.  Their citizenship doesn't change.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Capron against Noorden was one party on one side, one party on the other.  It wasn't a case where at the time of the trial there was complete diversity.  I frankly have a hard time distinguishing this case from Caterpillar which started out non-diverse but before trial, became diverse.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So if the... this would be the same if the... Atlas had come to the court and said, now, court, I want you to dismiss the two Mexicans because they're no longer part of the corporation, and gotten an order to... to do that.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  My question was could they have dismissed and... and as far as removal, I perhaps don't remember Caterpillar that well, but of course, it arose out of a removal.  That's how it happened.  But the Court didn't make the removal dispositive.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  It certainly was a 1441, and the opinion certainly alerts district judges that when a case comes over from the State court, maybe you ought to look at it to make sure that there is Federal jurisdiction.  But I didn't think that there was anything peculiar about 1441 and the obligation of a judge to look into jurisdiction.  I don't know why the same thing wouldn't apply to 1332.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, I don't... I don't follow that because it was wrongfully removed by the defendant, had no right to be in the Federal forum when he got there, and... and the poor plaintiff who wanted to be in the State court got stuck with losing a Federal court case.  So it wasn't protecting the defendant right to remove.  The defendant had no right to remove.  It wasn't a proper Federal case until... who was it... one of the parties got dropped out.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why don't you go back to Caterpillar's description of Caterpillar?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You are correct in that respect.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I take you back a little way?  It is unconstitutional because incomplete diversity is fine.  Minimal diversity is fine under the Constitution.  The statute, 1332, has always been interpreted to require complete diversity.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  When Marshall first mentions that you can't oust jurisdiction by something that happens after, he doesn't talk about the statute.  The cases that you are... are discussing, out of which the timely filing rule arises... it's a kind of a common law that he's spreading out.  He doesn't cite the... the jurisdictional statute for that.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  As I understand the bottom line of what the situation would be, there was a trial between totally diverse parties.  You... you say that has to be undone.  There's no question now that there's complete diversity between these same two parties.  So this isn't a case where there's any federalism interest.  This wouldn't go back to the State court.  This is a proper suit for Atlas to bring in Federal court, and so you'd have the same court, the same parties going over exactly the same case, which does seem a terrible waste.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, no.  It would be up to Atlas, but Atlas at this point, being totally diverse from Dataflux, could walk in... the day that Atlas is thrown out, it can come in the revolving door and say, here's a fresh complaint.  Let's start all over again.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May... may I ask you is there another impediment that you do know about like the statute of limitations?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, I assumed... I assumed you looked into this.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  At what point did they file and refile?  Because the court of appeals held in their favor.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Dismissed after they won on appeal or before?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Only if the court says... only if the court says so because the rule, even the timely filing rule was... was something that John Marshall said and it's been that way ever since, with exceptions and recognizing that a human individual is different from a corporation is different from a partnership.  If... if a court is going to make such a regime, surely it would make a sensible one and not one that's subject to abuse.   INTERRUPTING ",02-1689
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there was something that you overlooked or whoever was representing Atlas.  When did Atlas first become aware that the citizenship of each partner counts for diversity?  I mean, this was set up as a Texas business, but in a partnership, unlike a corporation, each partner's citizenship counts equally.  And when did you first become aware of that rule?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you see any impediment?  Or, first of all, explain to me what that second filing was.  Mr. Boyce told us--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --that you filed a second complaint.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you did that before you knew what the outcome was--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Do you know of any impediment?  Now... now it's for sure that you can go back to the same court with the same parties, do the same thing all over again.  Mr. Boyce said that as far as the Texas statute of limitations is concerned, it's not a problem.  Is... is there anything that... apart from repeating the same thing, that would put you at a disadvantage?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It seems to me that that situation is just what Justice Marshall dealt with when he said you cannot oust a court of jurisdiction once lodged.  So if there is authority, then it doesn't matter whether that plaintiff moves.  I mean, the plaintiff who certainly couldn't move and become non-diverse and hope to escape an adverse judgment... I thought... I thought that rule was firm, that a single plaintiff, if it's just a two-party lawsuit, jurisdiction is not ousted.  And I don't think that Caterpillar in any way suggests that that one party plaintiff situation would be different.  The... the partnership is sort of in between.  It's not like a single individual, but it's not quite like Caterpillar either where there were wholly discrete parties.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  As Caterpillar said, that if at the time of trial--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --you have no spoiler in the picture, which was what Caterpillar was.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And if there's a sentence that says something different, but the facts in Caterpillar was before the trial began, it was complete diversity.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose... suppose--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose you had gone to that trial with the two Mexicans still in the partnership and you had won, and then could you then have said to the court, we don't need those Mexican partners?  They're out of here.  So now, we'd like to make a motion under rule 21 to drop those two people from the party lineup.  Could you have done that?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you're suggesting that a plaintiff could play the same game as a defendant could play, say, oh, I'm going to go in... I'm going to go in and get my trial, and I'm going to have those two spoilers in the case, and if I win, fine, I won't open my mouth.  If I lose, out they go and I start over again.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's a difference between the absence of jurisdiction at the outset, which is what is involved when you have a plaintiff from the same State as the defendant which can't be cured by the plaintiff moving to a diverse State, and imperfect jurisdiction, in other words, that you do have diversity, but you have a spoiler in the picture.  That is... that is very clear in Caterpillar, less clear in the partnership.  Although the partners are five individuals, they are not an entity the way a corporation is.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It wasn't... it was sued.  It... it sued.  It was the plaintiff, wasn't it?  The--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Yes.   ",02-1689
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can we go back to your--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --You gave a Bivens justification for what is extraordinary.  I mean, it's not a violation of article 3 for us to decide it on your basis, but still, this Court deals with concrete cases with actual facts and not with abstract questions.  So is it... is it your notion... is it correct that what the Ninth Circuit says becomes clearly established law so that an officer would genuinely be... be subject to Bivens liability when this Court hasn't addressed the question?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Blatt, you mentioned, you started to give a number, 1,000 searches, fuel tank searches, and then you gave a number earlier about how many gas tanks turned out to have contraband or something.  Do you know what percentage of those gas tanks were... was there disassembly and what percentage were done by a less intrusive means by the dog and the tapping on the fuel tank?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if we... if you prevail in this case and they don't have to do that, they can just say it's good enough to go right to the disassembly and we don't have to bother with dogs and maintaining dogs and anything else?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought... I thought you would, and maybe I'm recalling your brief incorrectly, but I thought you... you made a distinction between the kind of intrusive bodily search like a strip search and said that's the only one where you would need reasonable suspicion.  All others, all that involve only property and not the person, the rule should be at the border, anything goes, no reasonable suspicion required.  Is that the position the Government is taking?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, if that... it can't be that he doesn't... well, expected to be opened up.  If it's... if it's a container where things can be carried, one of the things that the Government said in its brief is that if luggage is free and then this will become the container of choice, and we know that in a very high percentage there have found drugs there.  So it is a container, we know it's been used as a container.  Why should it not be treated like any other container?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you... do you question the... the Government gave an example, I think from fiscal year 2003.  They said 300 fuel tanks were disassembled and put back along the southern border without incident, that is, no explosion and no malfunction in the vehicles for the travels.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Goddard--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Goddard, I thought that in a self-assessment system, such as the one we have, the Federal Government, Arizona, that assessment is associated with assertion of a deficiency.  In Arizona, is every taxpayer assessed by the government?  That would be quite a different system, wouldn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You... you audit everyone in the State?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which the Government does when it wants to assert a deficiency.  And we were told that the assessment just a week ago is nothing more than a bookkeeping entry, and what it does is it triggers certain administrative remedies.  But my understanding was that an assessment is made when the Government wants to assert a deficiency.  Otherwise, there isn't this entry, this bookkeeping entry someplace, that every taxpayer isn't assessed.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's not the assessment that you... I mean, you used the Internal Revenue Code provision.  That is an entry.  We were told it's a bookkeeping entry.  And it's made as a prerequisite to levying liens, to extending the statute of limitations.  But it certainly isn't true that that kind of assessment, which is what your brief suggested you were talking about, is made in the case of every taxpayer.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The technical assessment that's made tied to a deficiency you don't fit.  So you're talking about some other kind of assessment than the one that, for example, the Government was telling us about last Monday in the Galletti case, not that technical... some... if we're talking about property, say, a property tax, then maybe an assessor comes on the land, looks at the house, attributes a value to it.  That wouldn't be a self-assessing system from the taxpayer's point of view.  But... but the income tax is quite different.  You assess yourself.  Sometimes you get audited; sometimes you don't.  And I don't see that anybody here is trying to stop the government from making the assessment that would be a trigger to asserting a deficiency.  No one is trying to stop Arizona from asserting a deficiency against any taxpayer.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Goddard, in that... in that regard, wasn't what Congress had in mind... it was taxpayer suits.  They didn't want taxpayers to avoid going through the whole process.  I mean, most of the cases that come up under the Tax Injunction Act are taxpayers who say please enjoin the tax or don't assess me or don't levy.  But this is not that kind of case.  There's no one here who's trying to stop the State from collecting revenue.  It's an attack by a non-taxpayer, and that at the time of the Tax Injunction Act, I don't think that kind of action was even on the scene.  Do you have any claims where a non-taxpayer was seeking to enjoin the collection of a tax?  What they... what... what Congress was aiming at is that, taxpayer, you've got a prompt, speedy, efficient remedy in your State, you use that, don't rush to the Federal court.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That was a taxpayer's case too, wasn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Wasn't the case you just cited... wasn't it... that also a taxpayer's attempt to--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Yes.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So I'm asking you about cases where we don't have a taxpayer who's not trying to stop any assessment of his tax, any... anything else about--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --It's the only one that I know.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do we have a self-assessment?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  We don't.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is every... every taxpayer is assessed?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Every taxpayer is assessed even when no deficiency is sought?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That every taxpayer is assessed even when there's no deficiency.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But... but nobody... nobody here is contesting, as far as I can tell, what we were told Monday is a mere bookkeeping entry.  Does it... does it... is a notice and demand sent out to everyone who's assessed?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So why is anybody trying to enjoin a bookkeeping entry that nobody knows anything about?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I don't see that there's any effort to stop a bookkeeping entry from being made--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --that nobody gets any notice of and doesn't... is... is, we were told, just a mere bookkeeping entry.  That doesn't... doesn't... it's not necessary in order to collect the tax?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But nobody is seeking to enjoin any assessment.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They... as assessment being a bookkeeping entry that nobody knows anything about.  You just said you don't need any notice and demand.  In the Galletti case, we were told that's what the assessment is.  It's a notation in a book someplace.  It doesn't even have the taxpayer's name on it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose they clarify that they're not trying to stop a bookkeeping entry from being made in Arizona, even though Arizona law doesn't require it, just like the Feds.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Although we were told that there isn't that bookkeeping entry in Arizona, that they don't have it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's not what you described as the assessment.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which we were told they don't have in Arizona.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But those were all taxpayers trying to stop the collection of tax from them.

So it seems a... really an ideal case for the prosecution to say, we missed it, and then as a result of we... what we, the prosecutor missed, the court missed it, defense counsel missed it, but it was our error and we should correct it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, this defendant certainly raised... he raised the point in his pro se petition in the state court and he raised it in the Federal court, the ineffective assistance, but nobody paid any attention to him.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did the prosecutor suggest that maybe the court should have dealt with it, because neither court gave any reason for rejecting that claim?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if the court views this as a preliminary question, a question that the Fifth Circuit and any other Federal court should have reached logically before it reached the question on which it decided the case--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --then we should put the court back in the position that it should have been in if it handled the case correctly.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In one of the proceedings, Texas did take the position that there... this was not ineffective assistance of counsel.  The reply brief I think makes it clear that you're not disputing that the... that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is alive and well.  But there was a time you took a different view.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Roberts, you now say ineffective assistance of counsel claim, I think you answered that that was preserved.

And you say, well, sure, it's only a gateway here, the gateway is Jackson, sufficiency of the evidence.

This is Chavez-Miranda--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --where the court said, Banks appears to be a departure from our prior decisions.  As noted by the trial court, we have found a 10 to 20-second wait to be reasonable in similar circumstances.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But why is... isn't 15 to 20 seconds ample, if the question is reasonable time, in a small apartment to get to the door to open it?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's the time... it is the time in which a telephone would ring at least twice and perhaps three times.  Usually people pick up a phone after the second ring.  If they can manage to do that, why wouldn't one expect the same interval would apply in getting to the door?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, but isn't... isn't the problem that... that Justice Ginsburg is asking you about what is a reasonable time, and your answers always get to the point of saying, well, there are particular facts that might have taken somebody longer than a reasonable time.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --They... they knew they were dealing with drugs, that the warrant was to search for drugs.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You don't get rid of it, but as I suggested to Mr. Salmons, maybe there isn't this dichotomy between exigent and nonexigent, but that it's not exigent enough to avoid knock and announce altogether.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Why not at least a complainant?  I mean, the person who is seeking the discovery here is the complainant, the one who comes to the commission and says investigate.  And I understand your third point.  Your first two points puzzle me because there is no counterpart in European schemes to our out-of-court discovery.  It doesn't exist.  It all takes place under the control of the court and the direction of the court.  And on the other hand, the... the animal that the EC antitrust unit is is nothing like our Antitrust Division where the... we don't have that blending.  You don't have a complainant who has a right before that commission to submit evidence, to be present at their... if they... if they do have a hearing.  We don't have a complaining party before the Antitrust Division that has a statutory right to be present at a hearing.  So you... the... the systems are different and you can't compare them on both points.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But even so, if you take a typical civil law proceeding a... between private litigants, you can't go out and get discovery on your own.  The court has to authorize it, and the order for discovery will come not from a subpoena that you sent as a private party.  It's just... they don't... so if we were to interpret it your way, then you would say, well, that no private party in a civil law system that doesn't know from pretrial discovery, doesn't have anything like pretrial discovery, could never get any documents, could never get any testimony.

Would you take the same position if this had been a litigated judgment and the exact same decree came out at the end of the line?  And then the State says, well, this was an Ex Parte Young suit and even though we litigated and lost, we can still say all bets are off because at the enforcement stage, you have to prove the case all over again.  Now, are you making a distinction between a consent decree and a litigated judgment, or do you accept that this... if this case had been litigated and that decree entered, it could be enforced?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The Fifth Circuit... excuse me.  The Fifth Circuit said you had to... you had to segment this decree into bites, and plaintiff had to prove each one of them as a violation of Federal law.  That's worlds different from saying, here's a decree, time has shown that it's not... that it's too onerous, so court, please modify it.  60(b)(5) accepts the decree as valid and enforceable, but says that it should be modified in light of our experience under it.  Now, that's quite different from saying you can't enforce it.  You have to prove the case all over again at the enforcement stage.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Cruz--  --You have to assume that it's too onerous, that everything that goes... goes a bit beyond what Federal law demands is, quote, too onerous.  Is that... is that your theory of 60(b)?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But beyond that, Rufo said that when you're dealing with a State or a municipality, that the 60(b) is more flexible than it would be if you were dealing with a private party.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but we're talking about 60(b).  And I think the... the... you're saying, well, this is essentially the same thing.  It isn't because what you've confronted us with is you said, yes, the court had jurisdiction to enter this decree, but it had no jurisdiction to enforce it.  That was your plain position, and that's not a 60(b) position.  60(b) is the court can enforce it unless and until you show grounds for modification.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It didn't exercise authority till the plaintiffs came in and said, look, they're violating the decree.  They're not carrying out all their promises.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You could have said, yes, we are.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You didn't say that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I stop you at that point?  Could a State then simply say... every State say our Attorney General has no authority to waive our sovereign immunity, and then you would have the highest legal officer appearing in Federal court on behalf of the State and representations that that person makes count for nothing?  Is that--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Then what was the attorney... then the Attorney General was really deceiving the Federal court when the Attorney General said, this is a consent decree that we worked out, we urge the court to adopt it.  Now, if the Attorney General had no authority to enter that consent decree, he should have told that to the Federal court, but there was no... no such representation.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But nothing required the State to agree to this consent decree.  I know you distinguished the case... Lapides was... you said that they... the State made the move to get the case into the Federal court.  But here, yes, the State is a defendant.  Nothing in the world compelled it to enter the consent decree, to urge the court to accept its consent.  So when a State Attorney General says to the Federal judge, Federal judge, we think this is a sound decree, we want you to enter it, that's hardly being hauled before the court.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Franklin--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --perhaps I misunderstood your brief, but I thought that you were making the distinction in your brief between the substance of a decision and the procedural motions.

I thought your brief conceded that if that were the case, there would be access to the Federal court on the part of EPA.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, why isn't it, going back to Justice O'Connor's question, when the EPA is saying, in essence, you didn't really go through the feasibility analysis because you didn't even ask for the relevant information?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it is.  There's a difference because you're... you said that the review... the reviewing authority would be the State court.  So you aren't talking about whether there would be Federal court review, and I think in response to Justice Scalia, now you are saying that the route is the State court.  You're agreeing with him when he said the route is the State court and this Court on cert.  Do you see any role for the Federal courts?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's in advance of the permit.  The fact that... that Congress specified that for certain pollutions, you must, before you give any permit, go to the EPA doesn't exclude that you could have the review after.  But I would... after the permit issues.  But I would like to ask you.  You seem to be saying, well, this is just a determination.  They applied the statutory factors.  EPA didn't like the way they did it.  There seems to be lurking in this a... a difference on what the statute means to this extent.  EPA seems to be taking a single source approach.  That is, you want a new generator?  That generator has to have BACT for that generator.  Never mind if you tell us voluntarily you're going to put Low NOx on all of them and the result would be lowering the emissions.  In other words, EPA seems to be taking a no-bubble approach to this.  You go at it machine by machine--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --generator by generator, where you're taking the position or Alaska is taking the position that if you can reduce overall emissions by putting the Low NOx on all six generators and in the end have cleaner air, well, then do that and forget about the SCR on one machine.  That seems to be a substantive difference about whether BACT applies to the whole setup or machine... generator by generator.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's... it's either that you go at it machine... source by source, new source by new source, modification by modification, or you can have the bubble concept.  In Chevron, EPA was... was espousing the bubble concept and the Court... this Court said, EPA, that's a reasonable construction of the statute.  Now EPA seems to be saying as to this program there is no bubble.  You have to look at that machine, that generator in isolation.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that seems to be a basic difference on what the statute means, not on... mix it all up and is it arbitrary and capricious.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If I go--  --I still don't... I don't... I don't see where Justice Breyer's question fits with... with the issue, does the statute dictate BACT on an individual generator?  Never mind the rest.  In other words, does the act say, no bubble, and that's how EPA seems to be reading the act, that it's not a matter of discretion, that this calls for a new source, modified source, and you just look at that new source and you don't look at the old generators at all.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What... what other method is there besides the top-down?  I know both briefs have said it's... it's the way it was done here.  That's what EPA recommends, but it isn't inevitable.  What else would they use other than top-down?

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  I asked that question before.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And... and it is a question of interpretation of the text of this statute.  I thought that EPA was taking an anti-bubble approach, that it said, you want to have generator 17.  We look at generator 17 and that's what the statute means by new source.  I thought you were taking that view, but maybe you're not.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's what I thought.  So it isn't a question of just loose, arbitrary, and capricious.  EPA is taking the position that you look at generator 17 because you've already made the determination that adding a generator, modifying another one, is going to add to the pollution.   ",02-658X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Phillips, I'm having the same problem that Justice O'Connor and the Chief expressed.  One thing is if we take this case, there's a no-hire rule.  Can an employer have such a rule and apply it with even hand?  That's a question of law.  But this case seems to be underneath messier.  For example, this no-hire policy was unwritten.  This is a company that had a lot of written rules.  That's an important rule.  Why was it unwritten?  Why does Medina testify we had a right, not that we'd apply it every case, but we had a right not to rehire someone who was discharged for cause?  The... the record is suspicious on, one, whether there was a policy; two, whether it was applied with an even hand.  That one can't tell.  So why should a judge take this as given that there was indeed such a policy and that it... it was applied with an even hand?  Don't those questions remain in the case?  Even if you prevail on if they had such a policy and if they applied it with an even hand, they would not be offending--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, they held it in a footnote, and I'm--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --We don't know from this record, for example, whether someone who had sexually harassed a fellow worker and for that reason was fired, whether such a policy would apply... has, in fact, been applied to such a person, whether someone who assaulted a co-worker would also be barred permanently from re-hire.  If there is the firm policy, then it's unquestionably legal, but... but there isn't in this anything except two employees who gave testimony, no other examples, other than this very case, to show that this has been applied across the board.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought he said that he didn't even know the rule existed.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, Mr. Phillips, one of the things is... doesn't quite fit is in the case of this very employee.  He was given a test despite this firm no-hire... no-rehire rule.  They did give him a test in 1999, and it turned out he flunked it badly.  But everyone recognizes that flunking in 1999, when you're a little rusty, doesn't mean you would have flunked in 1994, which is the critical time here.  But why did the company, if it has this firm... firm, no-exception policy, no rehires, why did it give him the test to see if he was qualified?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You mentioned Medina, Medina's letter, which says, look, we... we refused to hire this person because he didn't show... he didn't show that he was no longer an addict.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But didn't the company designate him to put in the response to EEOC?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What is the relative position in the company?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Montoya, I'd like to go back to the opening statement you made because you... you said this was a legitimate disparate impact case, but looking on that same page in the footnote, the Ninth Circuit is agreeing with the district court that because Hernandez failed to timely raise disparate impact, this has got to be a disparate treatment case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But why do we even get to that?  This is... this case is so puzzling on... for many reasons, but one thing is Medina or Medina said he didn't come up with one shred of proof that he's no longer an addict, and we are permitted... being an addict is not a disability within the ADA, being an addict.  Being a reformed addict is.  So said this employer, look, he sent a letter... he sent a letter from his church pastor.  He sent a letter from Alcohol Anonymous.  Maybe that shows that he's no longer an alcoholic, but there's not one thing here that says he's no longer addicted to cocaine.  And there... and I don't... I didn't find anything either that said that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Even though this is... this is solely from someone who knows him from the alcohol program.  Isn't the most logical assumption if he's got a letter from an AA counselor, that what they're talking about is alcohol addiction?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where is that letter so we can look--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But in the next paragraph, it says, Alcohol Anonymous has been demonstrated the best recovery tool for alcoholics.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And it says he's... he's committed to this program, demonstrates his willingness to accept responsibility for his recovery.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought you were going to say that the... what the plaintiff claimed is a witness.  The plaintiff says, I've had this whatever the... the moment was.  I reached rock bottom or whatever you called it, and I woke up one day and said no more and ever since then I've been clean.  So the... so the... the plaintiff did... that was the only proof.  That might not be very convincing, but it was a statement--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Of course, if he's still addicted, then he's not protected by the act.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Montoya, in your... you say now that you question the existence of such a rule, and yet you've had an opportunity for discovery in the district court and you didn't try to pursue any kind of disparate impact.  I... I don't see that you ever asked any questions about, well, let's look at this rule.  Do you apply it to people who were let go for stealing or whatever other reasons?  You never, never tested the rule.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I still don't understand why you didn't follow up those two depositions with interrogatories, saying what is the origin of this practice.  How long have you had it?  To whom have you applied it?  The company certainly would have records of the people that they've discharged for cause, how many of them had applied to be re-hired.   ",02-749X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How about the trunk?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why a little bit?  I thought this whole case was predicated... your whole case was predicated on those drugs between the armrest and the backseat were accessible to all three people in that car.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Now, if you have something in a locked trunk, it truly is not accessible to the passengers.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, let's stick to the five... these five bags that were stuck in a Ziploc bag.  The Ziploc bag is in the trunk, not a dead body.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the charge was possession with intent to distribute, wasn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How about if it had been a bus?  Now, we've gone from the sedan to the minivan, how about the bus?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And one is--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I... may I clarify whether you are indeed relying on common enterprise?  I thought the view was it may or may not be a common enterprise, but here is a situation, drugs equally accessible, drugs accessible to any one of the three.  We can't say whether all three or which one, so looking at the three, and we say, well, it's not more... not more likely the driver than the front seat passenger, who's there behind the money, or the backseat passenger, because any one of them could have pulled down that armrest.  I thought that was your theory, not a... not necessarily a common enterprise.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the respondent's position that your position means two innocent people may be locked up in jail, because suppose Pringle hadn't fessed up, and he exercised his right to remain silent.  Then you might have a prolonged periods, assuming they couldn't make bail, three people stuck in the brig and two of them are innocent.   ",02-809X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it was at least possession.  So would you concede that a crime... in the officer's presence there was evidence of the commission of a crime?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then... so the officer says, I know that a crime has been committed.  In the whole world there are only three possible people who could do it.  What instruction would you give to the officer on the scene who knows that a crime has been committed, there are three possible people, but he can't say which?  Is it the answer that he can make no arrest?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What arrest can he make?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And no one else?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So maybe... definitely the driver, maybe the backseat passenger--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --but not the one who in fact--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --who in fact committed the crime.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If this were... if this were a bus or a tavern or a theater or some of the examples, then it certainly would unreasonable to assume that the front seat passenger could reach back to the last row of the theater.  But here, this was a small car.  It isn't hard for somebody in the front seat to turn around and push down the armrest.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the driver consented to have the car searched, so one might think, my goodness, if he knew there were drugs there, why did he say yes when he could have said no?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This is not like the... one of the cases that you relied on is the Di Re case.  Your answer to me was, arrest the driver.  There, the informer had fingered the driver, so the police knew that they had the right man when they arrested the driver.  Here, it isn't at all like Di Re because the driver may or may not have been the right person.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there... there's... there's another difference.  The drugs are not locked up in the trunk.  They are at a place where the backseat person could push it down.  There wasn't a serious attempt to hide those drugs securely.   ",02-809X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there's some might not... some might not have been like the officer here, like Officer Groh, might not have even seen the attached affidavit.  On the face of this, this does look like the hated general warrant.  It says, here's a house and there's no bounds at all, so it looks like this is exactly what the Fourth Amendment was getting at.  And with respect to Sheppard, I had a question, maybe you can straighten me out on that.  Sheppard said the good-faith exception applies, but to apply... apply an exception, wouldn't you need to have a Fourth Amendment violation in the first place?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So that... that case doesn't answer the question, was there a Fourth Amendment violation?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Before you do that, just one preliminary question.  Justice Scalia suggested earlier you could go right to qualified immunity to get all the rest, but I thought the... that this Court's precedent said you have to make a ruling, did it violate the Fourth Amendment, before you get to qualified immunity.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Schlick, as far as the rule is concerned, the rule... the heading is receipt, so the rule... rule doesn't address this problem.  It goes to what you do in inventory and then you give a receipt, if you're going to take away property give a receipt, and by the way, give the warrant with it.  So I don't think we can read this rule as saying you don't have to give the warrant if the homeowner requests it.  It just says if you're taking away property then you give a receipt, and part of the receipt is the warrant.   ",02-811X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why, when McGrew didn't issue until 6 months after the conduct in question?  McGrew set the circuit law for the... at least for the Ninth.  It said that the executing officer has to read the warrant, but that wasn't on the books when this search occurred.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But what made the law clear in the Ninth Circuit was not the timing of the McGrew search, but the ruling of the Ninth Circuit.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But he didn't, and that goes back to a question that Justice Scalia raised earlier.  Assuming there is a violation of the Fourth Amendment, you're bringing a Bivens action, and if we recall the facts in Bivens that... the police acted as rough as can be, they manacled the man, they told him they were going to arrest his wife and children, they hauled him off to jail and they strip-searched him.  Nothing like that happened here.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the damages here, nothing happened here that would not have happened if the right portion of the application had been copied into the warrant.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Doesn't say anything at all about warrant when no property is taken.  As far as... I have the text of Rule 41 in front of me.  It talks about leaving the warrant when you've taken property.  There's not one word in this that I can see about leaving the warrant when you haven't taken property.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can we get back to the question I think that you hadn't completed your answer to before?  So, assuming that there is a violation of the Fourth Amendment, what harm to this family... I mean, the contrast with Bivens in that regard is stark, because the... the... what you recited, the same thing would happen if the warrant had copied the right paragraph of the application.  There was no rough stuff.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So--  --Of course, that's really not what the Fourth Amendment says, is it?  It just... it doesn't say you need... you need... I mean, surely there's some play in the joints, isn't there?  It's... it categorically prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are you... you suggesting that maybe it was unreasonable?  Since there were no exigent circumstances this warrant could have been executed the next day for as far as we know from this record, to go back and say, oh my goodness, look at this, it's a general warrant, I better get it particularized.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  With respect to Leon, Mr. Cordray urged that if you would meet the good-faith exception, in any case where the good-faith exception would apply so the evidence isn't suppressed, the officer would have qualified immunity.  Do you agree that that's a... a proper equation?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I thought you did make some kind of enumeration.  You mentioned Mr. Ramirez's drafting table was broken and you said she was frightened, and I think one other thing you alleged.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Oh, yes, the reputation to the... the reputation in the neighborhood, but that would have been affected just the same if the police came there with an entirely proper warrant.   INTERRUPTING ",02-811X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Poor, may I suggest that the question you have raised is not the one that I understood this case to involve.  It's not whether the provision allows for equitable exceptions, it's whether you forfeited that claim, the claim that it does not... whether you forfeited it by letting the thing go past your answer.  You didn't raise it in your answer.  You let the case go off on summary judgment on the merits and remained silent until after there was an adverse judgment against you.  So at least in my thinking, the forfeiture question, whether you forfeited, the argument that you would now like us to treat as the question presented, that is the threshold question.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But in that very pleading you asked the court to strike a number of things in the complaint, and yet you did not ask to strike the family account claim.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you didn't... did you expressly say that you wanted those certain allegations struck?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did you... did you say, court, strike these allegations?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, the answer is yes?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And you did not say, strike with respect to this allegation?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What was your reason for distinguishing the two, for saying strike others, but as to this one all that you did was mention that it wasn't in the original complaint?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, if we're going to get into all of that, then they would say there's a relation back and none of those issues are really before.  We took the issue on the pure question of whether or not, assuming that you were late in objecting that that... that that's a bar.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why do you pin the word jurisdiction on it at all when rules, whether bankruptcy rules or creditor rules, cannot alter or affect the Court's jurisdiction?  That's what both rules' enabling acts say, so whatever it is, it... if it is jurisdiction, then it violates... the rule violates the statute.  The rule isn't passed by Congress.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You're talking about a rigid time limit, a time limit that cannot be extended for good cause.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Could you... could you have, according to your analysis of what this animal is, here you made your motion to reconsider after the summary judgment motion was granted, but before judgment was entered--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --final judgment was entered.  Suppose final judgment had been entered.  Could you then come into the court and say, sorry, court, I forgot to tell you that you couldn't enter any judgment here because an unalterable time bar had passed?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How about initially on appeal?  Suppose you... you suffered the adverse judgment in the bankruptcy court and then you want to raise that, after all, the complaint was untimely, on appeal for the first time?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you have any authority with respect to this kind of rule, a rigid time limit, that it's okay to untimely bring that to the court's attention?  I mean, all the precedent that your brief cites are cases where the party who opposes the time extension timely brings up that the complaint was untimely.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where the defendant was untimely... that--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --where as here?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That was a case where the court made an... an initial ruling without having expended any time in adjudicating the case.  Here, you present the situation where the court grants a motion for summary judgment and then the debtor says, sorry, court, you never should have adjudicated this.  We didn't tell you, but now you have to erase all... everything that you did.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I did... was not aware of such a case.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Raised after the case is adjudicated on the merits?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Who made those decision where the--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Poor, I'm still looking for that case that you cited, because at least the two cases that you relied on principally, Taylor and Carlisle, those were both cases where the untimeliness point was timely raised.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the rule says good faith isn't an excuse, so--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But... but you are arguing that an untimely raising of the lack of timeliness is okay, and neither Carlisle nor Taylor stand for that proposition.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They were both cases where the objection to the untimeliness was timely made, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So then they could not have considered the case such as this one where the objection is untimely made?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I didn't think that forfeiture was an equitable exception.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There is a difference between waiver, which is a conscious act, and forfeiture, which is rule that says, if you don't raise the point, which is the ordinary consequence of not raising a defense, if you don't raise it and the time to amend passes and you have a judgment on the merits, you can't go back to square one and said, oh, sorry, I should have put it in my answer, but--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I didn't think that forfeiture was an equitable doctrine.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Which case?  Because I'm looking for it in your brief.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Cited by another case, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But Mr. Poor, it can't be like Carlisle because the Government timely made that objection.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you think that case stands for the proposition that the Government had said nothing and the court had said, I considered this, I grant the motion to acquit, that the Government could then come in and say, oh sorry, we forgot to tell you that this was one day late and so you couldn't consider it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the... the opinion of this Court certainly doesn't give any basis for that... for such a judgment.   ",02-819X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would you agree... do you agree with the Government that if the statute in question, not the bankruptcy rule, but at 157(b)(2)(J), if that required timely objection as some other statutes in the bankruptcy realm do, then you would lose, if the statute rather than the rule required timely objection?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --that this is simply... the question is essentially, where does one draw the line?  And one might say, even if the objection to the timeliness isn't raised in the initial answer, it could be raised in an amendment to the answer.  It could even be raised in opposition to the summary judgment motion.  But there comes a point where it's too late to make that objection, and that's essentially the question for us: Where do you draw the line when it's too late?  Now, it could be on appeal, it could be after adjudication on the merits in the trial court.  So on that question of where do we draw the line about raising this objection, what is your position?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that's all you have to maintain to prevail here?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There was a timely complaint filed and it is a little odd that it was never argued that, well, this is really within the... within the frame of the original complaint, so it... it should relate back.  Why didn't you argue that?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What would be a cause for tolling if excusable neglect is out of it?  It seems to me that this rule is saying there are no exceptions, period, and to say that even if you can show good cause you don't get it extended, but there's some other equitable.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the rule on amendment, which the pleading rules, the Federal rules would apply, says that it should be... if after you miss the time limit in which you are allowed to amend as a matter of right, then you may or may... and with the court's permission, and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Waxman, will you explain what the consequence is?  It's... this is not a question of disclosure or not because either it will be part of the finance charge and disclosed as such or the... whatever you call OCL.  What difference does it make?  It's not notice.  If it goes... if it's part of the finance charge, how is the consumer benefitted?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Waxman, I don't think you finished the answer to the question I asked, and what I wanted to know is if it's labeled a finance charge, then there won't be interest on it; whereas, if it's treated as a debit like any purchase, then the interest would run on it in the future.  So could... it could be a difference for the consumer, could it not?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it could be... it could be--  --Why isn't it carried over from month to month?  In other words, I... I get a late... this... this special charge, but I just pay the minimum, so I'm really carrying part of the special charge over to the next month.  I pay interest on that too, I take it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Was this an account that carried a finance charge?  Because the regulations describe something called charge card that doesn't have finance charge, but could have an over-the-limit charge.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which did have a finance charge, or you don't know?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would you agree that... that it would be to the consumer's advantage to have this categorized as a finance charge because then she wouldn't have to pay interest on that in... in future charges?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Goldsmith, before you continue, the Sixth Circuit said a portion of Regulation Z is invalid because it's incompatible with the statute.  Are you defending that invalidation?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How about in practice?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you asked... you asked the court to do that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  When you argued the case before the Sixth Circuit, you made it very clear that you were seeking a holding that a portion of Regulation Z was incompatible with the statute.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's an argument you didn't make before the Sixth Circuit.  The Sixth Circuit... you told them that this regulation was incompatible with the statute.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But they clarified it in the Sixth Circuit.  So why didn't you say, oh, Sixth Circuit, we've now seen the light and we... we don't want the regulation declared invalid?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, you used the word review.  We wouldn't be reviewing it.  We would be taking a first view of it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you didn't... you... we would not be reviewing anything that the court below determined.  We would be accepting a new argument that has not been aired below, and that's not review.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Didn't... didn't Ms. Pfennig get a copy?  I mean, the... isn't it on her monthly bill?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought... I thought the terms have to be disclosed monthly in addition to when the credit card is new.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The one thing that the... the board has said is we don't want these individual to make every extension of credit or what... to do this kind of thing on a case-by-case basis.  That's why we're establishing these categories.  And your interpretation was making the credit card company has to know and every one is going to be a knock-down, drag-out, specific facts of the case.  And that's exactly, it seems to me, what the board didn't want to have happen.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Now you're going back to the regulation itself is no good.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose--  --Well, it--  --Oregon had said in prior decisions, as states sometimes do in dealing with constitutional provisions, we interpret inadequate assistance of counsel in our state to be strictly in tune with the way the Supreme Court interprets inadequate or ineffective assistance of counsel.  That is, our state standard is the same, identical, to the Federal, so there isn't any doubt about there being a difference between the state law and the Federal law.  The... the state supreme court has said, we take our lead from the Federal definition.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How does the case decided, the Fitzgerald case, which is cited in page 34 of the red brief, it was just last term, when... when this Court said that the Court would consider a state court decision as relying on Federal grounds sufficient to support this Court's jurisdiction, if under the state's decisional law, the state and the Federal constitutional claim are treated identically, the content of the right is treated identically.  That... that decision from just last term says, you've got a claim out there and it's a constitutional claim and the Federal law and state law are identical, the content of the law is identical, we will treat it as Federal.  That was a decision just from last term.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This was not in the habeas context.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And it... what I read to you is... is from the decision itself.  The Court will consider a state court decision as relying upon Federal grounds sufficient to support the Court's jurisdiction.  That is, when the state courts have in other cases declared that they will apply the same analysis in considering the state constitutional claim as the Federal courts would, I think in that case it was equal protection.  But the... the Court... that was critical to the Court's deciding that case last term.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What was wrong with the Ninth Circuit's position, at least with respect to the intermediate appellate court?  That is, it's reviewing a decision of a court below.  That court below has Federal written all over it.  Why isn't that a... a reasonable assumption that the... that the intermediate appellate court where there is jurisdiction as a matter of right, it's reviewing a decision, it's bound to read that decision?   ",02-964X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, it seems to me that argument that you're making now that inadequate is the buzzword for a state claim, ineffective for a Federal claim, is at least in tension with your argument that... that in... with respect to ineffective assistance of counsel, the state... the content of the state standard and... is identical to the Federal.  So these labels don't mean anything if the content is identical, so how--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, if you... you say that the Ninth Circuit approach to this was wrong, which... which seems to be anchored in, if it's clear that the court of first instance relied on the Federal ground, that stays with the case all the way up.  You... you reject that, or you say, you... you are asking us to affirm the judgment, not that reasoning.  What is your reasoning?  What is enough?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But may I--  --Then I don't see how that differs from the Ninth Circuit--  --That's the Ninth Circuit.  --because you have to start with the court of first instance, and you seem to be saying that the court of first instance relies on a Federal ground that stays with the case.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If there had been an... an objection preserved in the Ninth Circuit that whatever else, this doesn't tell us what the facts were, would not that have been a... a ground for saying you didn't exhaust?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Kneedler, the...

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you didn't... you... the... one difficulty that I have putting a handle on it is... is you're saying, agency, overall you're not enforcing the statute.  We want a court order that say... says enforce it, which looks to a court quite different than I... I'm asking to have this particular area closed, and then the agency would make a discrete ruling on that particular area.  Instead of saying overall on these four... whatever it is... vast parcels of land, they're not doing the job, so court, tell them to do the job, and then the court is supposed to monitor that?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What do we make of the Chief Justice's fear statement, not once but twice, in Boyde?  The prosecutor never suggested that background and character evidence could not be considered.  So mustn't we take Boyde with that qualification when we have a case where the prosecutor, indeed, suggested that this information could not be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Not that... that the jury misunderstood the judge's instruction, that there was no instruction.  I mean, the... the picture that's given here is the defense attorney says, I can use this to mitigate.  The prosecutor says this is not legitimate mitigating evidence, and he said that several times.  And the judge said, well, you could both argue it, and the judge never instructed the jury.  He left it to the prosecutors to argue the law to the jury and for the jury to make that legal determination.  It... it seems to me that that... that is surely an error.  Now, you could still say, well, even so, it was harmless.  But... but I don't think... can there be any doubt when the judge tells the attorneys, you argue the law to the jury and let the jury decide what the law is?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose... suppose I were to take the view that it is a violation of clearly established law for a court to allow a prosecutor repeatedly to misstate the law, misinform the jury about what the law is on a life or death question without correcting that misstatement, without saying to the jury, jury, it's not for the prosecutor to argue what the law is.  I tell you what the law.  If the judge doesn't do that, then that meets any standard of violating clearly established law about which there should be no doubt that when the prosecutor makes a misstatement on a life or death question, it is the judge's obligation to say, jury, he is wrong.  You take your instruction from me and here's my instruction.  Suppose that's my view of this case.  I don't... Boyde and all these other cases... it just strikes me that that's clearly wrong.  What do I do with that?

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What... what admonition was sufficient?  The court said something about evidence and everybody... I mean, there's no question what the prosecutor said isn't evidence.  But he didn't tell them he has misstated the law.  We're not talking about evidence is not at issue all.  Neither side suggests that it is.  It's a question is what is the law that governs this controversy, what is the law that the jury must apply to make a life or death decision.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then... then it... then it has another problem with it because then the judge is saying that's an argument.  Jury, you've heard arguments on both sides.  You decide.  But it isn't for the jury to decide what the law is.   INTERRUPTING ",03-1039
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, why wouldn't the jury conclude... why isn't it the most logical conclusion that, gee, the judge had us sit here through eight witnesses and listen to all that and he didn't exclude any part of it, so of course we must consider it because otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to all of it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The... the prosecutor, at the very end of his closing to the jury, did seem, even if grudgingly with it, to recognize that... that this evidence was mitigating.  I'm looking at page 76 of the joint appendix at the top of the page.  He makes the statement, the law is simple.  It says aggravating factors outweigh mitigating, and then how do those factors line up?  Well, the facts of the case showing the violence, et cetera... that's on the aggravating side.  And then against that, defendant really has nothing except newborn Christianity and the fact that he's 28 years old.  So that... in that final word to the jury, the prosecutor seems to be saying, yes, they have mitigating factors, but they're insubstantial, 28 years old and the claim that he's a newborn Christian.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But why wasn't that broad view appropriate, given the difference between the language of the Wilson Act, which has had the words  ""to the same extent and in the same manner. ""  and the Webb-Kenyon Act, which became the second section of the Twenty-First Amendment, leaves out  ""to the same extent and the same manner. ""  It just says that  ""alcoholic beverage so that the state can bar importation for delivery of, or use therein, in violation of laws thereof. ""  It doesn't say ""nondiscriminatory laws"".   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, maybe that's the Act, but when they put it in the Constitution, why didn't they adopt the language,  ""to the same extent and in the same manner? ""   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I have just one further question.  Justice Kennedy asked you,  ""What about the wholesaler? ""  ""What about the retailer? ""  What about alcoholic beverages other than wine?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Thank you.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, why don't we focus on the Court's rationale, which was stated very concisely by Justice White.  He said, ""Hawaii's discriminatory tax cannot stand"".  And then he said,  ""Whatever you can say about the Twenty-First Amendment, one thing is certain, the central purpose was not to empower the states to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition. ""  That was this Court's explanation for ruling the way it did, even though there was this infant industry of pineapple whatever.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, then you are asking us, I guess, not only to reject Bacchus, but who was the first one that said that the Commerce Clause remains alive and well?  Was it Justice Stewart?  And I forgot which case it was.  It was--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --In the context of alcoholic beverages.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Your answer to Justice Kennedy, I glean from what you said, that if New York took away the direct-sale privilege that in-state wineries get, then out-of-state wineries wouldn't be any better off, but they'd have nothing to complain about.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's a decision for the state to make.  I mean, the... what--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Not for this Court.

""  --I think your brief told us that, well, these small wineries, out-of-state wineries, haven't got all that much to worry about, because, after all, they could join together... a group of them could open an office.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Goldstein, before you do that, before you deal with the EEOC regulation, this statute doesn't... at least on... on the page 1 part you called our attention to, doesn't refer to business necessity.  That's in the EEOC regulation.  If I were just reading this statute cold, I'd say, yes, that looks like an affirmative defense to me, but reasonable factor seems like something quite different than necessity.  It isn't necessary for the business to do this, but it's reasonable.  And if that's... then the business necessity... it seems to me, at least arguably, an improper construction of this act, that the EEOC got it wrong when it referred to business necessity.  They were thinking of Griggs and... and title VII, but this statute says reasonable factors.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, I'm not sure you're right about that, Mr. Goldstein, because if you think of what it was, it was a pen and paper test and it was a high school diploma.  Now, an employer might well think I want to upgrade my work force.  I want this to be a real classy work force.  So I'm going to require a high school diploma.  It isn't necessary, but why is it unreasonable for me to do that?  So I... I don't... I think Griggs spoke about rules that were built in headwinds because a large part of the population didn't have the opportunity to get high school diplomas.  That doesn't exist in the age discrimination area.  So I... I don't think that Griggs is an example of something that was a loose business necessity rule.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There haven't been a whole lot of cases under the impact theory as applied to age, and you just said you're not talking about the cost category but that... you mentioned physical fitness.  And there was a case.  Smith against Des Moines involved that, but it was found the... the physical fitness test was job-related.  Have there been mutual rules with a disparate impact that you can give us as examples?  When you're talking about race and sex, the examples come to mind much more readily than in the age category.

That is, there are many situations in which there is some kind of licensing fee that is imposed on everyone, the same dollar amount, although some people who are licensed will be doing because in other States and have to get licenses there as well.  The example that was featured in the... in the briefs on the other side of the lawyer who is licensed, say, in Massachusetts and also in D.C. does not get any break on his D.C. Bar admission because he is also admitted in Massachusetts, and in fact, does most of his practice out-of-state, out of the District.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the Scheiner case didn't make a distinction based on in-state activity.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Your time is short, so could you tell us how far back you think, under the statute, you can go and not... and be within the safe harbor?   INTERRUPTING ",03-1237
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where is this?  Page 14a--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --What are you quoting from?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why should we say that's the question, when the Federal Circuit, itself, said what I read before from 10a?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Flores, when I asked you about the sentence on page 10, I intended, not the one that you read, but an earlier one that precedes it, and that is,  ""The questioning arising in this case is whether the preclinical research. ""  --that is, the research on animals, as distinguished from humans...  ""conducted under the Scripps-Merck agreement is exempt from liability for infringement of Integra's patents. ""  Now, if you just took that as the question, then you would say it... this Circuit is drawing the line between clinical and preclinical.

The same phrase is used.  So if (2), why wouldn't the same follow for sub (1) and the following clauses?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it is included if it's... once the workday begins, if there's a rotation, you walk from one station to the other.  That walking time, I think it's conceded, would be included.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So, if your date... if the principal activity is donning and doffing, then the walking time thereafter would also be included.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Goldstein, I just wanted to have a clear answer to the question Justice Scalia asked you.  Is it so that collective bargaining could not trade off the compensation for the walking and the donning and doffing for some other benefit that the employees might prefer?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So, you say it's an open question.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --about what gear qualifies?  That is, here we have no dispute that this is protective gear.  But it's not any changing that counts.  So, how do we know whether this is the kind of donning and doffing that's compensated in... or the kind that isn't?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That wasn't decided below, was it?  It was just a question of walking and waiting, and they weren't specific about whether that included waiting or walking, pre donning.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So, perhaps we shouldn't reach a question that hasn't been aired and decided below.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I wasn't questioning that, so much as it is... it is extraordinary for this Court to take a case when the bottom line is going to be the same.  And, since we have the identical issues, with no such preliminary question in Tum, if we decide in your favor in the Tum case, then the other case is taken care of.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Goldstein acknowledged that that issue, the pre donning wait, was not decided below.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it wasn't, obviously, decided in the first circuit, because they ruled against the employee's position.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that doesn't respond to the venue question.  Venue, as written in this statute and in most statutes, is permissive.  It gives you a choice of forum.  It doesn't limit.  In... in the times when venue is exclusive, Congress is explicit in telling you that, but ordinarily a venue provision, as this one, either/or, is permissive.  It would be extraordinary to make a venue provision exclusive.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, this Court has no authority to make a venue provision either exclusive or permissive.  Congress decides that.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the rule provision for venue, which has not been excluded by the statute?  The ordinary provision for venue.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought the crime is the conspiracy.  The overt act may be an additional requirement.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you will... you will concede that there are many Federal crimes, conspiracy crimes, in which an overt act is not required.  The Shabani case requires you to recognize that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you're saying that it doesn't mean very much because an overt act wouldn't be hard to prove.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there are... I mean, the difference between statutes that say overt act is required and those that just say conspiracy... there are many, many such statutes, and we dealt with one in Shabani.  But of all the statutes that include no express overt act requirement, have any of them be read to implicitly include one, which is the argument you're making that we should adopt here?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then you would expect at least a cross reference to 371 for defining the conspiracy, but there's nothing here.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You have given a few examples of a word may mean different things in different contexts, but you haven't given any example... and I don't know if there is one... where the entire string of words is identical in two statutes, both dealing with conspiracies, and you read an overt act requirement into one and not the other.  I mean, you have a much harder argument to make when you're talking about an entire provision where the wording is almost identical than when you're talking about one word used in different contexts.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There are about... there are over 50, I think, in title 18 alone conspiracy provisions with no overt act requirement, no explicit overt act requirement.  The... the argument you're making, I suppose, would require this Court to go by... one by one through those 50-odd statutes, and there would be contests of every one because the absence of those words is not dispositive, as you see it.  So you would be generating a controversy about 50-odd statutes that would be gone, that just wouldn't be there if you agreed with Justice Souter's approach.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Have you looked at all 59, I think--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --and assured yourself on that?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, we've already dealt with venue where I think your argument is exceedingly weak since the statute phrases it as a permissive not a requirement.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It gave... it gave the prosecutor more choices of where to bring suit.

Do I understand correctly that it is only the second one that you're challenging?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But your question is preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, and the first and third provisions of this injunction do not prohibit all future speech.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's another one that is in your brief.  You say that these were statements of opinion not fact.  But that surely is not presented in your question.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Chemerinsky, the district... I mean, the trial court made certain findings and I'm looking at page 42 of the joint appendix.  The first is that these statements were actually made for the purpose of inducing Cochran to pay Tory amounts of money which Tory was not entitled.  That's one finding.  And then finding 24, despite repeated requests, Tory has refused to cease picketing unless he was paid money... a monetary settlement by Cochran.  And then 27 that says this is simply use of false and privacy-invading communications to coerce or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in tribute for desisting from that type of activity.  And those sound like findings.  It's true that the label of extortion has been put on it, but it certainly does sound like the... that the purpose of the speech was to extract money not owed.

It has numbers and in fact that's confusing because one of them, the people think is the Ten Commandments is the Bill of Rights.  [Laughter]   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is it like how many other monuments?  This is not peculiar to Texas.  The Order of the Eagles have given how many monuments just like this one, identical to this one?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  When you said that every court that has considered this case has said it's compatible with the Establishment Clause, did you mean just this Texas case or other cases involving an Eagles Ten Commandments?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you didn't mean this particular depiction of the Ten Commandments?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Kind of an eclectic museum.  One message that you get is that the State is honoring the donor of the various--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  General Clement, there is a question I have about the government's position.

Is it the same or do you make... or every courtroom up to the court to decide for itself?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It looks just like this monument.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If you... if the lower courts were of this view, why did the district court in this case give you three opportunities to have your contract claim transferred to the Claims Court?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it does suggest that the district court had at least some concern whether the case... your claim had been lodged in the right court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Perhaps you can explain.  This was not your suit originally.  You intervened.  Right?  This was started out by the water district.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And then after some, I think, 2 years--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --the water district bows out.  It has settled its case.  It's a mystery what it settled for.  At least, I didn't see it in any of the briefs.  Why did the water district, having brought this case, then say, we're satisfied, we're out?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May... may we just back up to the question... your answer to Justice Stevens?  I thought that this wasn't a suit initially on the part of the water district for money damages.  I thought they were seeking declaratory relief against the United States.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because one could... one could read the words, suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights, as a suit for declaratory relief but not encompassing damages.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, you say under the contract.  I thought there was a provision in the contract that said that the United States will not be responsible for under deliveries, and I think it listed the drought and the last thing was any other cause.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I ask you a question about the practical aspect of it?  And you're asking the Court to choose... well, the plain error is what we're doing and how high a burden the defendant would have to meet.  But this relates to a question Justice Souter asked.  I was surprised, given that this was not a new district judge, that she didn't have a litany that would cover all the rule 11 elements.  And I was also surprised that the Assistant U.S. Attorney didn't say at the end of the colloquy, judge, you forgot to mention that this plea can't be withdrawn.  Is there a manual that judges follow?  Are U.S.... Assistant U.S. Attorneys instructed, when something is left out of rule 11, to remind the judge?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But he didn't do that.  This question wasn't raised until appeal... the appeal.  He didn't say--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Himmelfarb, there's... there's another specific about this case that might have averted what happened.  The... the entire plea agreement was read to the defendant in translation because he didn't speak English.  And that was the day before.  If it had been the practice to give him a copy of the translation, instead of just having him hear it orally, then it would have... might better for him to read and we would have had more security that he knew.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I meant both, that is, that there would be the written... written-out plea agreement, which if he could read English, he could have read, and then the lawyer and the translator go over that written document with him, that that I think would be more effective than just hearing it orally.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I didn't mean this to be legally dispositive.  It's in the same way... how could this be warded off so we don't get a Federal case out of these rule 11 slips.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I... I wasn't suggesting that... that it was a requirement.  May... may I ask just one more puzzling thing about this case, background of it?  The reason that the deal didn't... wasn't possible was that this man had three priors instead of everybody thought... well, at least the judge thought or the prosecutor thought, until the presentence report, there was only one.  But the defendant must have known how many priors he had.   INTERRUPTING ",03-167X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why?  But that's not so.  Has... has--  --I mean--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In... in assessing how weighty this particular lapse is, should we take into account that as far as I know, this defendant has never said in the district court or on appeal that he indeed wants to go to trial.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But he... on... on... the plea vacated is one thing.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because then you have... given that he has three priors, his sentence... he was sentenced at the mandatory minimum.  How much better could he do on a resentencing?  So it's got to be he wants to go to a trial because do you agree that if we... if we just say new sentencing, he couldn't do any better given--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But that's not the question I asked you.  I asked did he ever say at any stage, judge, I'd like to have a trial.  I want to plead not guilty.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's not... one thing not to object to a setting of a trial date, but did this man ever say I want to exercise my right to trial by jury?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought he was stronger than that.  I thought... thought he had said at one point I don't want to go to trial.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But in any case, if he... if... but his concern is that his substantial rights or... have been violated.  And the possible effect on the outcome is relevant.  And my question is how could the outcome be affected if he got the mandatory minimum?  He got the lowest sentence that the law allowed the judge to impose.  So unless he wants to go to trial, he isn't harmed by what happened.  And so I'm asking if there's any stage where he said, I want to go to trial.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you... you have looked at the cases on entrapment.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And if you've got a predisposition, you don't have much of a prayer on a entrapment claim.  And he had three priors.  Were... were the three priors of the same... same line of commerce?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What leverage does he have?  What leverage does he have when he's face with a mandatory minimum that he can't escape from and that's what he's got?  I... I can't... could you describe for this defendant what that better deal would be?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But how could... could he escape from the mandatory minimum in any way other than what they thought might work here, this so-called safety valve?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that's what he got, and that's why I can't understand any better deal that this defendant might have received.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You'd do it all over again with the same bottom line, but he's going to feel better about it the second time?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, I'd like to ask you a question that I asked Mr. Himmelfarb and that it seemed puzzling to me that the safety valve which everyone hoped would allow a sentence below the mandatory minimum could never work from day one because he had two additional prior offenses.  Now, if anyone knew about those priors, which were under a different name, which is why they weren't found immediately, certainly the defendant knew.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So his... his attorney knew that he was disqualified for this plea?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That they were confirmed, but at what--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --at what point in time?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which we don't have or do we have it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And could... could you point to that place where it says that before he made this deal, which invoked the safety valve, he had told his counsel that I have three--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Yes.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I don't see where he said, I told my lawyer that I had three prior convictions.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that's all right.  I don't want to intrude on... on your time.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought one... one of your points was that this was a rather long agreement and this was paragraph 19.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I... I didn't know that you were claiming that this hadn't been an accurate translation.

So it's not a brief reference.  It's a powerful statement of the covenants that the Lord is making with his people.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Have you read the first four commandments and could you say that?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Clement, you placed heavy reliance on Marsh, which was prayer and it was undisguised and it was permitted as it has been since the beginning of our nation.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But do you have a continuing case or controversy?  That was... that... that's a bedrock Article III requirement, and if you've got all the relief that you were seeking... let's put it this way.  Suppose your opponent SABIC says, here's the check for the $417 million and we undertake that we're not going to pursue any further relief.  Would you have a case or controversy left?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if you've got all the relief to which you are entitled, that does make a case moot.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You... you would be stuck anyway because you made a counterclaim and... and it would be... on which you prevailed.  And in that counterclaim you would be precluded if you didn't ask for everything that you could get.  But... but at this stage at least, the... the door... there... there is still conceivably an avenue of further litigation because, SABIC hasn't yet said that it's not going to do anything more, that it isn't going to petition for cert, for example.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it has--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Coleman, would you clarify, I think, in response to Justice Breyer's inquiry?  Rooker-Feldman both involved State court litigation that was over and done with.  Then you come to the Federal court.  You have two parallel cases would be... brought within a month of each other?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And isn't the standard defense of the person who has started the other suit first, well, Your Honor, prior action pending, please hold the case that started second in abeyance till we get done?  And if we win in the first case, then it will be precluded.  Then the second case... the parallel case will be precluded.  That's not Rooker-Feldman territory.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Rooker-Feldman, if I understand it correctly, is a subject matter jurisdiction bar.  Is that--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Yes.  And--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, to... so if the two lawsuits, the State court suit and the Federal suit... they're proceeding concurrently or one is held in abeyance waiting the other, there is certainly subject matter jurisdiction in the Federal court of the Federal action.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  To apply Rooker-Feldman in that context would say you had subject matter jurisdiction at the outset, but then you lost it somewhere down the line.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There were only the two cases, Rooker and Feldman, that established this.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Has this Court ever said anything to suggest that Rooker-Feldman, as apart from preclusion doctrine, applies to parallel litigation instead of you go into Federal court after the State court is over and you're trying to undo what the State court did?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there's no preclusion unless they're also decided.   ",03-1696
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Castanias, was there a proper case in the district court when the complaint was initially filed there some 2 months after you filed in Delaware?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  All right.  So you can bring two cases, identical cases, in two different courts, and that's an everyday thing, and the defense is prior action pending.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Now, you are urging that Rooker-Feldman which this Court never applied when you had parallel litigation be extended into a domain which is ordinarily taken care of by preclusion doctrine.  Why would you want to mix those two things up that now seem to me rather clear, that if you have Rooker-Feldman, when you rush into a Federal court and say, Federal court, undo that State court judgment, I don't like it?  Rooker was just a paradigm case of that.  Why would you want to spread that doctrine?  What is... what is there that preclusion doctrine doesn't accomplish?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, I'm not talking about anything fancy like Colorado River.  Prior action pending is a familiar defense.  You've got two actions.  They could even be in different districts of the same State and one says, Your Honor, this case started second, the other one is going forward, hold it in abeyance because there's a prior action pending.  That's not Colorado River abstention or anything like that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, sometimes district judges rule incorrectly, but... but what happened here is the district court case did not go on because the two of you, both sides, said, okay, the district court... they're all bollixed up with this Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act, so we're going to agree.  You agreed that the case would go forward in Delaware, the trial in Delaware.  Is that not so?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, when you say they pushed in Delaware, you brought them into Delaware and a... in a reverse suit.  You wanted a declaration of nonliability.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They brought their case for liability in the Federal forum.  They were forced by you into the Delaware forum, and now you're saying you were pushed, that Exxon pushed.  You brought the case in Delaware.  They didn't.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it was your preferred forum, not theirs.  When they filed their complaint, they filed it in New Jersey where they had a related case pending.  So you chose the forum.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So perhaps the Court, if it had been more cautious, would have spoken not in terms of Rooker-Feldman or review, but in terms of this matter has been decided.  It is claim precluded.  That's what preclusion doctrine is supposed to do.  So in that context, maybe this Court used the wrong word.  Maybe it should have said, you litigated it, it's over and done with, now it's precluded.  Why do you need to interject the word review?  Isn't that... unless you're going to say every time court A decides a case and then you're in court B and someone is raising the same claim, that is a review of court number one rather than you're precluded in court two because of what is... has been litigated and decided in court one.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It is sometimes.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's why one has preclusion because you are giving respect, full faith and credit, to a decision elsewhere.  That's what preclusion doctrine is all about.  We respect the judgment of the court that rendered it.  We, therefore, give it full faith and credit.  That's what preclusion doctrine is about, is about respect and credit.  Isn't that so?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, you're asking us to extend Rooker-Feldman beyond where this Court has taken it, and if I recall correctly, you really didn't ask for this.  The Third Circuit injected Rooker-Feldman into the case.  Is that not true?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, no, because it's where you walk in the door.  And you started out by saying this case, I think as you must, was a proper Federal case.  It was properly filed in... and it was properly filed in Delaware.  So you can't talk about a case that says, if you've got this kind of case, you go in this door.  If that kind of case, you go in that door.  You have a case here that could go in either door, the Federal, the State.  The usual rule is, is it not, that if Federal jurisdiction attaches, it doesn't get lost because of subsequent events.  For example, if a defendant moves into the plaintiff's State and the only basis for Federal jurisdiction is diversity, subject matter jurisdiction isn't lost, is it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Maybe.  It's not... it's not maybe--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --A case can become moot, but we've already expressed considerable doubt whether that is the fate of this case.  The notion... you used it derisively... the insurance policy.  Lawyers bring protective actions all the time, don't they?  There's nothing wrong with doing that.   ",03-1696
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  At least--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Shapiro, why don't you simply read the text of 183(b)--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --which is in the Government's brief at 4a?  It says, special trial judge's report.  It is the only report to which the Tax Court rules refer.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, not the Government's brief.  The Tax Court rules.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  4a of the Government's brief.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would... would that problem be overcome if the special trial judge simply... if his... the proceedings before him were simply videotaped and then the reviewing judge, Judge Dawson in this case, could look at the trial proceedings and would have as much of a notion of the credibility of the witnesses as the special tax judge?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Shapiro, on credibility, which you have been emphasizing, are you overstating the case for it?  Because credibility is more than just observing the witnesses' demeanor.  I mean, Judge Dawson could have said, yes, they... these witnesses might have looked honest to the special trial judge, but considering this documentary evidence in the record, it's clear to me that what the witness said on the stand was a lie.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do... do I understand that you would be satisfied if the Court simply looked to... what is it... 7482(a)(1), the appellate review section, which says that the Tax Court decisions shall be reviewed in the same manner and to the same extent as district court decisions?  And that--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --And where is it?  It's... it is specified someplace, but when you review a district court decision in... in a court of appeals, the... certainly the magistrate's report would be included, but there's someplace where it lists the contents, some rule that lists--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Would the... the Tax Court rule... now, this 183(c)... says... it describes the special trial judge's report, which is submitted to the chief judge, and then the chief judge assigns a Tax Court judge, and then it says that... that the Tax Court judge may modify it, modify the special trial judge's report, or may reject it in whole or in part.  Does the Tax Court ever modify a special trial judge's report?  Does it ever reject it in whole or in part?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's one thing that they can do.  They can adopt it, but my question is, do they always adopt and never use... never use the term modify it or reject?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Hungar, before you proceed to your legal argument, I was very curious why the Government is defending this practice because the Government, after all, is on the other side of every case.  And aren't there situations where it might be that the special trial judge would call a credibility question in the Government's favor and then the Government loses the case before the Tax Court judge and might like to know, before it goes to the court of appeals, how solid the credibility findings were?  I mean, I... I... the Government being a party to all these proceedings, why is it satisfied with not knowing what the report of the special tax judge... special trial judge was?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, it is not the report.  It is called an opinion.  It isn't even called the report, and if you will read 183(b), that describes the report.  Does anything else describe the report?  And what is this report?  There is a report.  It is submitted to the chief judge.  What would you call that?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Now, what is the 183(b) report?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --So that report, the special trial judge's report, is a document prepared by the special trial judge which he gives to the chief judge.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Hungar, do you--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Do you see somewhat of a problem, that we are not dealing here with the relationship between peers?  Judge Dawson is appointed, what, for a 15-year term.  The special trial judge is appointed by the Tax Court and his job is at the Tax Court's grace.  And if you have compared in your brief that relationship to, say, a discussion among colleagues, I think it's worlds different.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  He has had a special... a... a long term and he is well-known and respected as a Tax Court judge who was appointed, as all other members of the court were appointed.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It seems to me--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --It seems to me that it's very much like, if you have to compare it with something, the relationship between a magistrate and a Federal district court judge.  The magistrate also hears testimony, makes a report, findings, and a recommendation.  What's the difference between those two?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why isn't that explained in the rules, if that's the process?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do they... do they ever?  I mean, this... this says, this decision... it's labeled... the... the court agrees with and adopts the opinion of the special trial judge.  Are there Tax Court cases where the Tax Court says, instead of that, the court modifies the decision of the special trial judge or the court rejects, in whole or in part, the report of the special trial judge?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do Tax Court opinions come out that way?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because if one were just to rule this... read this rule straight: first, the report that goes to the chief judge, and then it says that the Tax Court judge may modify it, reject it in whole... adopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part.  You would expect, if we were having truth in labeling, that whenever, with consultation, without, there's a difference between the two documents, the Tax Court judge, in combination with the special trial judge or without, would say, action on the report... action on the report, which is the special trial judge's report, is it is modified or it is rejected or it is rejected in part.  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --The rule... the rule doesn't say anything about this consultation that you've described.  And if that's the Tax Court's procedure, why isn't it laid out in the rules so everyone can see it instead of being deceived by reading here is the special trial judge's report, and now what the Tax Court will do is either adopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Misleading.  Because when I just read this rule cold, that's what I assumed, that we have the initial report and then it goes to the Tax Court judge, and that judge does something with it, and that something may be adopt, it may be modify, it may be reject in whole or in part.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's like an en banc.  I... I have written decisions for a panel in my years on the court of appeals, and there's been an en banc and my opinion gets vacated.  It's no longer counts for anything.  And isn't that exactly what the Tax Court is?  They have the--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Oh, no.  No, no, no.  How often, when there is a decision reviewed by the court, so that the initial judge's decision is changed, does that judge dissent, so all the world knows what that judge's initial position was?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then he... then he can publish his... he can publish his dissent, just as a Tax Court judge can?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then we still won't know what his report is.  Yes, he can say, I won't sign this.  Tax Court says, fine.  This rule says I can reject your findings in whole or in part.  I don't need your name on this decision of the Tax Court.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm asking you just as the... the judge who disagrees with the... the full court can publish his dissent, can the special trial judge who disagrees with the Tax Court judge publish his dissent?

And here, there's no implication at all that this sentence is in any way invalid, that the sentence itself or any portion of it is invalid because the parole would be a matter of administrative grace, but it doesn't... the determination of parole eligibility or parole suitability does not go to the validity of the sentence in any way, shape, or manner.  Does it?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, couldn't one say the same thing of prison conditions that you can bring in as a 1983 action?  The States know better about how their prisons are operating and what changes would have to be made.  So I... I think that you... you may be right that the State knows more about how its parole system operates, but so does it know more about how its prison system operates.  And that doesn't... that's not what determines whether you have 1983 or habeas.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But aren't... aren't those claims moot or academic now?  Because, as I understand it, he has had another parole hearing.  So he's... with the hearing that he was seeking, he's already had another.  So he's not complaining about the absence of a hearing or... or flaws in the procedure at the hearing.  I thought that this case now reduces to a clean question about the retroactive application of the new guidelines.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Was there... maybe I'm wrong about this, but I thought there no challenge being made to the 2002 hearing.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why can't it simply be that prospectively for this class of prisoner, the old guidelines will apply, prospectively without undoing anything that's happened in the past?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think twice you started something and our questions impeded you.  But I think you were equating the parole board's decision to a criminal sentence, and so you... you were saying just as the... the Federal authority can't come in and nullify the State criminal sentence, neither can it nullify the parole board determination.  And... and I thought that the comparison between a... a sentence... a criminal conviction and sentence and a parole board's discretionary determination... you seemed to be putting those on the same plane.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But... but you raise deprivation of the benefit they would get from the Ohio courts.  If they wanted that benefit, they could have brought a 1983 action in State courts.  State courts have jurisdiction.

And one of them is, is an enemy alien, and another is, was tried and convicted by a military commission sitting outside the United States.  Why would the Court think it necessary to say this is what we confronted in this case which makes it worlds different from our case, where there has been no trial and conviction, where these people are saying, and we must accept for the moment that it's true, that they are innocents.  That they are not combatants of any kind.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Their trial and their punishment.  This is a completed episode.  This is a very difficult decision to understand.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It could have been just a clarifying, General Olson.  As you well know, the fact that a bill was introduced and not passed carries very little weight on what law that exists means.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Wasn't it--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  General Olson, I have looked at the reply brief, which is the last chance to say what they mean.  And they say we are not asking for any of those things, and certainly not asking to have a lawyer there while these people are being interrogated.  They are saying, look, we are claiming that our people are innocents.  And for purposes of this proceeding, we must assume that.  And all we want is some process to determine whether they are indeed innocent, and it doesn't have to be a court process.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If you go back to the jurisdiction, so I understand really what your argument is.  Would this be entirely different, as far as their jurisdiction is concerned, if we were talking about... if the people were prisoners on Ellis Island or in Puerto Rico?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you... you said now you were going on to the prudential factors, and so I asked were you recognizing that there was an injury in fact, and you said no.  And... and why not?

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Didn't... didn't the Michigan Supreme Court already rule on this issue and said that the statute was constitutional, that there was no right to counsel, therefore no possibility of appointing counsel, paid counsel?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So going through the State system, there's no possibility that these lawyers or the defendants could successfully assert a right to paid counsel--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --because that's already been decided by the Michigan Supreme Court.

So, if it's the plaintiff's burden to show likelihood of confusion, how can it be the defendant's burden to show unlikelihood of confusion?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought they did when they outlined to us what it means is you're using it descriptively, and not as a mark.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Brinkmann, am I right that several cases say, the key here is, are you using it as a mark.  Because that suggests you're trying to pawn off your goods as another's.  Are you using it as a mark?  Or, are you using it, merely descriptively?  I thought use as a mark was the key, you're using it as a mark, you're not using it in good faith.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How about if the ruling were a defendant who uses a descriptive term fairly and in good faith to describe its goods or services is not liable for infringement, even if some residual confusion is likely.

They say, for their consumers, the way they regulate antitrust, there are no treble damages.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about a forum non conveniens policy that says, you're a foreign purchaser, you purchased abroad, you have a nice forum abroad to go to, don't burden the U.S. courts.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If you think that the forum non conveniens point would work, let's say, for our trading partners who have told us they don't like treble damages in any case, so are we going to make a distinction then and accept the complaint of customers, purchasers of vitamins in countries that don't have any antitrust laws, but we would reject claims coming from, say, the U.K. or Canada?   INTERRUPTING ",03-724X

It's smuggling by water, not smuggling by--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --vehicles, as is done here, so that we don't have any statute that covers smuggling on land.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if we did... if we did enforce even a tax judgement of another country, there would be no U.S. law that would be violated.  You're talking about a common law, no country enforces the taxes of another.  But, at least in the Restatement of Foreign Relations now, that's put in terms of... there's no requirement that any country enforce the tax claims or judgements of another; but neither is there any prohibition.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --May I ask you, Ms. Brill, something that puzzled me about this case?  It is a rather peculiar use of our wire fraud statute.  Are there any proceedings going on in Canada?  Has there been any attempt to extradite these people?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I ask you, when... now that we're getting into money, one of the things that the sentencing board had to do was to find out how much of a loss there was, and that involved determining what taxes would be due under Canadian law.  And did that increase the sentence?  Did the... did the sentence vary with the amount of taxes that they... we found due?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  A judge making that assessment.   ",03-725X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where?  Using a gun where?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, if we're concerned about offending the foreign country, then isn't the way to go, in fact, the way Congress has gone in this area, we negotiate treaties?  I mean, one of the reasons why we go the treaty route are the kind of problems that Justice Breyer brought up, we want to have reciprocal treaties.  We want two things.  We want to make sure that it's a basically fair system that we're dealing with.  On the other hand, we want to say,  ""If we do anything with respect to your taxes, we want to make sure that we get the same benefit from you with respect to ours. ""  So never mind the revenue rule, isn't it pervasive that... when it comes to enforcing tax claims, that the route that Congress has chosen to go, and the Executive, as well, has been the treaty route?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  One of--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --one of... one of the last interests that you mentioned, about offending foreign governments, well, on the face of this, it would seem, the one that... the country that's been done out of taxes is Canada, not the United States.  So, we should help Canada, if it's interested in collecting revenue from these people or trying them for a criminal offense, to do that.  It... I asked Ms. Brill, Have they been indicted in Canada?  She said yes, but she said it's... they had not... there has not been a request for extradition.  Is that... is that--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --To go to one more aspect of the statute which I don't think you've addressed, Congress said that... with respect to the wire fraud and mail fraud and, I think, other things... that restitution to the victim is mandatory, that it's not left up to the government to decide restitution or not.  Except here restitution sounds very much like enforcing Canada's taxes, so you have conceded no restitution.  But it seems to me that Congress thought of the wire/mail fraud statutes as cases in which there would be restitution, and that suggests that they didn't envision foreign taxes to be the object of the scheme to defraud.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Now, how could that be, because restitution is to the victim?  The victim is Canada.  You collect Congress... or Canada's tax, and you give it to Canada.  Is there any other kind of restitution?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that view is in... somewhat in tension with your view that the common law revenue rule doesn't stand in the way of this prosecution.  Because you have to interpret the statute in light of the general rule that one country doesn't mess with another country's taxes, absent a treaty.   INTERRUPTING ",03-725X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would... would you concede that... that this is at least sloppy drafting?  Because they said any in one place, they said State or Federal in other places.  Shouldn't they be... be consistent in their terminology?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the... the court of appeals here said what it would... it read in a check.  It said it wouldn't read it to really mean any conviction.  It had to be in a system that was fundamentally fair.  Wasn't that what the court of appeals said?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May... may we go back to the... the choice that you were given by Justice Scalia first and then Justice Breyer?  I thought that someone who comes in here illegally and possesses a gun commits an offense.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't it so?  So there's not... Congress would say to that hypothetical, we've got a third choice, much more sensible.  Anybody who sneaks in here without permission and has a gun--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --commits a crime.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Boas, when they combined these two--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --and ones... the 1202 did say Federal or State... they made other changes, harmonizations.  In the explanation of their consolidation of the two sections, to what extent did they discuss changes and the reasons for them?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But they did... they did explain other things--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --other changes, but this one... there's silence--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --as far as I understand.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How... how about--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --And this is one I'm... I'm surprised that you didn't cite, but it... I don't think you did... EEOC against Arabian American Oil Company, where the wording of the statute was anyplace outside the United States, title VII coverage, and this Court held that anyplace outside the United States did not mean that a U.S. employer operating abroad had to abide by the anti-discrimination norms with respect to hiring in some place abroad because Congress was thinking in terms of the inter-State sitting... in the setting and not international.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That... that was a decision by the Chief.  So--  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING ",03-750X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There is... there's an overarching concern and I'll... I'd like to put it to you right from the beginning.  When a legislature legislates, be it the State or Federal Government, it is generally thinking in terms of its own domain, its own bailiwick.  When Congress legislates, it's thinking about the United States.  Sometimes it's thinking about abroad, but most of the time when it is, it says so.  And we have a number of cases, not just the Arabian American Oil Company.  I mean, that... the language of title VII was between a State and anyplace outside thereof, anyplace outside thereof.  And in that very case, the Chief made the point that I'm putting to you now, that Congress thinks about the United States, our country, and if it means to say something that will take in other places in the world, it says so clearly.  And we don't make the assumption that Congress was intending to have any extraterritorial flip to its law unless it tells us that.  That's my overall concern about the Government's position in this case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which was it?  Just... what was the case you just mentioned?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that... that example, what you gave in your brief, gave me this concern.  The problem that you've just been describing, the State convictions that may be invalid but is being used under 922, I regard that as a kind of a venue question because you can go back to the State that rendered the conviction and say, State, I was convicted in violation of the Constitution, give me my good habeas writ that I get... can get from the State.  Then I wipe out that conviction and I don't have it anymore.  But the person who's been convicted, say, in whatever examples... take... Zimbabwe would be another example.  Libya.  To go back to that system and get a conviction expunged.  That's why you can't use a case within the U.S. system where it's a question of where do you go to wipe out your prior conviction.  And for someone abroad, there isn't that option.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's... that's a question of waiver or forfeiture.  Those are the ordinary rules that apply.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But... but there's a basic rule in civil as well as criminal procedure, that if you want to attack a judgment, you go where that judgment was rendered.  And of course, you should abide by the timing rules of that, but that's just a very sensible thing within a federal union.  If you're... if you're attacking what State A does, go to State A, don't tell State C.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that... that doesn't operate internationally.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but you're not building that into your interpretation of the statute at all because you have said in your brief... and correct me if I've got you wrong... you don't like what the Third Circuit did.  You say just the fact of the conviction counts.  Don't investigate, court, whether it was a fair system that comports with fundamental notions of due process.  Just see if there's a conviction anyplace in the world.  And so what... what you're telling me is that it doesn't matter that you didn't appeal because even if he were precluded from appealing for some reason that we would consider totally unfair, it doesn't matter on your view of this statute.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's... that's standard for judgments anyway.  When the judgment is final, it means you've gotten through the first... it has preclusive effect.  Almost always, when a judgment is overturned on appeal, then you go back to State 2 and say, look, it's been overturned on appeal, and at least in the civil side, almost always State 2 will say, okay, we'll give you post-judgment relief because what we were relying on as our sister State judgment is no longer on the books.  I can't imagine that in our criminal system it doesn't work the same way.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm asking if it's alien in our criminal justice system, not in deportation, not in... extradition is somebody who did somebody... something abroad, and we don't send people just to anyplace.  Don't we have to have a treaty?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because the person is going to be tried in that other system, and we have bound... within our international system, we say we're part of a world community and we want Japan to extradite people who have done bad things here to the United States, and so similarly, we will extradite to Japan.  We don't want them to look at our system and judge it.  We're sending somebody to be tried there.  So extradition is... is something entirely different than--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, we have the check already that these are... these places with whom we want to do criminal justice business together.  So--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --And then we have the... we have the document where it's very clear we want to have extradition with the UK, with Japan.  Here, you're relying on the word court, and you don't have it all spelled out like you do in an extradition treaty.  And that's the problem here.  Sure, if Congress had said we mean foreign court, then that would be it, but it hasn't said that and we have to determine does it mean the same thing as it means in the extradition context or the deportation context where you have a clear statement that Congress means a tribunal abroad.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if somebody is coming into the country, somebody is asking to come in, any conviction that you're talking about, of course, refers to someplace abroad.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms.--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Ms. Millett.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Millett, there are many lawyers in Congress and at least the law students of my generation... some of them are of that elder age.  We learned in law school one country doesn't enforce the penal judgments of another.  This is a kind of enforcement of a penal judgment of another, not exactly, but something like it.  Another reason why I would expect a Congress, knowing that background norm, would say, when it meant foreign, foreign.  Unlike the context of the immigration, yes, there are some people who left and came back, but many... and... and we have all this whole line of cases.  Is adultery a crime of moral turpitude, and you know, those go back to the '20's.  But this, which came about only because of the merger of two statutes, one saying Federal and State, the other not, and no explanation at all, in light of all these anomalies that have been brought out.  Shouldn't we say to Congress maybe that's what you meant, but if you did, you have an opportunity to say so before we read in foreign?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you know why?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you know why they stopped funding it?  Why did... because I think that's been reenacted every year.  No money for this.  Why... why did Congress stop funding it?   ",03-750X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there was nobody on it in that trip.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There was nobody... there was no one on it--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --to be injured.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Kaplan?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Kaplan, you said two things and I... I'm wondering these are separate or they're really one concept.  I thought your answer was going to be to the boat that is used as a diner or to the casino that's tied up to the land, that it's not in navigation.  It may satisfy the 1 U.S.C. definition of vessel, but it has to be in navigation to be covered by the Jones Act.  So I thought that's what you would... something is taken out of navigation would not qualify.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is the scow a vessel too?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The scow.  The--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I know the circumstances of the accident.  And you're... you're discussing whether Super Scoop was a vessel.  I'm asking if the scow where the injury occurred is a vessel.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then explain to me why--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --why it wasn't the vessel that counts.  If it's a vessel and it is in fact the place where he was injured and it was moving, it... that would be an easy case, but somehow you have to deal with the Super Scoop, and I'm wondering why.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, why don't you just say the scow was a vessel?  End of case.  The scow was a vessel.  It was moving.  That's where he was injured.   ",03-814X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But as Mr. Kaplan pointed out, all... the fact that something is a vessel doesn't mean there's Jones Act coverage, and I think Mr. Kaplan was getting to the perils of the sea.  Someone who's working on a boat that is not in the water day in and day out is never exposed to the perils of the sea.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  One peril was a collision with another vessel, and that's exactly what happened here.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But how do you... how can you possibly describe as a bright line test anything that says you have to identify the primary function?  Plus, even if it's not its primary function, if it happens to be moving at the time of the accident, then there's coverage.  That doesn't seem to me very bright line.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Even though the identical accident happens to his buddy 10 minutes before when the vessel isn't moving.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's a difference to this extent, would you agree, that something that's just tied up to the dock and never moves is different from something that is actually in the water and whether you call it transportation, it is moving?  It has to move to engage in the construction of this tunnel.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, I'm just... let's focus on what is a vessel because someone... it may be a vessel but the injured person may not be a seaman.  Those are two different things.  This is only the first step.  So when you're bringing in what the worker does, whether it's a croupier or whatever, the only question that we are considering is, is this dredge a vessel?  We're not involved with the question of whether the worker is a seaman unless we pass that basic threshold.   ",03-814X

It's not... one thing clarify while you are not claiming the entire 6 million.  Didn't they have 6 million acres to start with?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Some of that you said was taken up by an approved transfer in 1798?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But something around 275?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the figure, the 250 million is for the rental... what is that... what is that for?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which New York State paid, and that's the end of it.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How would that... how would that apply to someone who hasn't gotten parole, hasn't gotten any permission, who snuck across the border?  That's one of the pieces of this that's incomprehensible, that you are suggesting someone can be detained indefinitely who we allowed in temporarily, but such treatment could not occur with respect to somebody that had no permission at any time to be here.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which can be revoked.  Which can be revoked, and that's the... the distinction that seems to me strange.  When somebody commits a deportable offense, they are stripped of whatever right they had to be here.  They are, it seems to me, in the same boat as someone who is excludable.  They... they do... do not have any right to remain no more than a parolee has.  We have taken away their right to remain.  So it seems to me that they have no status anymore based on a prior admission that we have removed from them.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But is that the current INS--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But it wouldn't... it wouldn't apply to the illegal alien because it's a statute that governs parole and they're not paroled into the United States.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How does that--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --How does that make that person, the illegal entrant, a parolee?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose he says, I don't want to apply for admission.  I just don't want to be locked up.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How do you... how do you answer the Government's argument that this is necessary, that the United States shouldn't effectively be punished for being humanitarian, and if we can't hold these people, if we're forced to let them in, then any rogue nation can dump anyone it wants on the United States and we can't stop it?   John S. Mills  --Yes, Your Honor.  Justice Ginsburg, that's their sole policy argument, and frankly, it doesn't hold water.  Just yesterday in the Jama case, the Government took the position that if Mexico flooded... flooded our borders with illegal aliens who we could not detain, we know under their own regulations, if they snuck in, we couldn't detain them, but if a new Mexican... there was a Mexican dictator and he flooded our borders, could we forcibly repatriate them?  And the Government said absolutely we can.  We can go down and put them back in Mexico.  We could do that with the Cubans.  We could let them out the gate at Guantanamo Bay.  If a... a rogue nation truly invades our country with its bad aliens, that is an infringement on our sovereignty, and I think that's an act of war.  And I think the President has all kinds of options: trade sanctions, go to the United Nations, diplomacy.  If it's really something bad that's going to be a... a threat to our national security, I think--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought... maybe I... I misunderstood you, but I thought that one of your points were even assuming that we couldn't send these people back into Cuba without having a major conflagration, the rogue dictator is not going to be deterred by our tossing even into the sea the people that he doesn't want.   John S. Mills  That... that is my point.  That's the point that I... I intend to make, that indefinitely detaining these people... that does nothing to a dictator.  That does nothing to deter a dictator.  All it means is we're going to be incurring the huge cost of incarcerating a large number of people, and if anything, that may encourage the dictator to do exactly that, or it may encourage the dictator, instead of sending them to Key West on boats... on American boats, to sneak them up on speed boats or take them through Mexico and sneak them across the border that's--   ",03-878X

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Does that imply that your answer is yes to the question?  If we say, as you urge, a dog sniff is not a search, then the police are free to parade up and down every street in the country with dogs sniffing car trunks.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  One could characterize those episodes under the, quote, special needs doctrine.  I mean, we are exposed to searches at airports that we would not put up with walking up and down an ordinary street.  So the dogs at the terminals one expects nowadays.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think there was a reference to my lady's bath in the opinion.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You said there's no disturbance of one's privacy and so that distinguishes the dog sniff from some other governmental intrusions.  But dogs can be frightening, humiliating.  It seems to me that there is some association with the idea that I have a right to be let alone by my government and having a large dog circle my car.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are there... are there any manuals for law enforcement officers with respect to the time and place of using dogs, or it's just open season?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The answer was they are at liberty... the police are at liberty to use dogs to find contraband.  And your... Illinois I think was very candid with the Court in saying we have taken from your decisions that a dog sniff is not a search.  So anything else is a matter of police policy.  It had nothing to do with the Fourth Amendment.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There was something you said in... in your brief that I thought was unclear.  So may I ask you--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --if Officer Gillette, the one who did the arrest for speeding, had a dog in the back of his car, instead of having the second officer come with the dog, would it have been permissible?  I thought you had conceded that it would be a different situation if the dog was already there when the car stopped.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, he didn't, but I'm asking you to imagine that he did.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No.  I would like to take this scenario as it is except that when the officer gets out of the car, his dog comes with him.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This is very... make no other changes except that Gillette has the dog and Gillette with the dog go to Mr. Caballes' car.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you... I'm--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But I'm... I'm trying to understand what you meant in your brief when you said if the dog had been in Gillette's car when Gillette stopped Caballes, the situation would have been different.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So then it really makes no difference whether it was Gillette who had the dog in his car or whether the dispatcher called another officer who had the dog.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It doesn't... so you're retracting that.  You, I think, were asked but I'm... I'm not sure you fully answered.  Suppose the police, as Atwater would allow, arrested, made a full arrest of Caballes, and then they impound his car.  In the place where they put it, couldn't they have a dog go around the car there?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But he could have.  He could have.  I mean--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --is... is--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Could the officer change his mind?  I mean, he... he did say I'm just going to give you a citation, and then he said, mind if I search your car.  This is before the... the dog showed up.  And suppose the person who had been speeding said, yes, I mind.  Don't search my car.  And then the police said, well, in that case I'm going to arrest you.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you had already drawn the line at a different place than Justice Breyer suggested because in response to Justice Scalia, you said if it... if it were going into the bus terminal just to sniff for narcotics, unlike explosives, it would be an impermissible search.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --If there were a plea... if it were a plea of guilt, wouldn't this be an academic question because I assume Florida has some counterpart to the rule 11 colloquy where the judge must confront the defendant and ask him a series of questions to elicit his consent?  So this issue can come up, if you have a counterpart to rule 11, only in the concession of guilt by the attorney but with a trial.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If Florida wanted to adopt that procedure on its own, that wouldn't present a Federal question.  I mean, the prosecutor would have no... the prosecutor would have no right to stop it if the... if Florida said, well, we want that same colloquy to go on whether it's a guilty plea or whether it's a concession of guilt.   ",03-931X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Tillinghast, may I go back to something you said?  Because I don't want to lose sight of it.  You seem to suggest that the defendant's absence from the trial should work in his favor when this was defendant's own choice not to be there.  The judge met with him and said I want to make sure you know what you're doing.  Right?  Why should we count at all in the defendant's favor that he was... he absented himself from trial any more than we would give a fugitive credit for not being there?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Not entirely because both in the opening and in closing, the lawyer said to the jury, he did it, but I want you to know from my very opening that this case is about life or death, and that's the ultimate decision you will have to make.  He said that in his opening and he said it in his closing.  It wasn't simply a case of saying, my client did and now the prosecutor is going to go through the motions.  He told the jury, what I want you to focus on is the decision you're going to have to make whether, in the counsel's words, to spare his life.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, you say without consent.  At least as... the record that we have suggests that the client was told this is what the lawyer planned to do and said nothing.  Justice Scalia asked a question when the prior argument was ongoing.  When a client doesn't say yes and he doesn't say no, to take the words of a familiar song, mustn't the lawyer then do what he thinks is best to do?  Because if he says, okay, I'm going to... I'm going to require a full-stop trial, I'm going to cross examine every witness, he may be damaging his client.  The client didn't tell him not to do that any more than he told him to do it.  So mustn't the lawyer in that situation exercise his best judgment?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why?  When... when his object is to spare this person's life.  He knows the evidence is very strong.  He wants, to the extent that he can, insulate the penalty phase from all that damning evidence that's coming out at the trial.  So he wants the evidence to come out at the trial, but he doesn't want to be in a situation where the jury has heard the defendant resist the determination that he did it and then have to plead for his life after.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, my problem... and I... I'm not sure I understand your answer to it.  In this case, in fact the client didn't say yes and he didn't say no.  So if the... if the lawyer is to assume, well, then since I don't have a positive, explicit yes, I will assume the answer is no, even though that is against the lawyer's best interest... the... the lawyer's best judgment, why is he an effective counsel if he assumes the answer is no?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I ask you a question that I asked the other side?  And that is, if we don't accept your argument, if we think when the client is silent, the lawyer must exercise his best judgment and not assume that the client would give an answer that would jeopardize the client's position, if that's the position that this Court adopts, what would you say is left over for remand?  Is it simply that the Florida Supreme Court then takes the record as it is and determines under Strickland whether there was effective... ineffective performance?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That would be... that would be all.  So what do we do with, in the brief, all this information about things that the lawyer should have done by way of cross examination?  That wasn't put in the record earlier--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Why was it denied in the trial court?  Why was the introduction of what the lawyer might have done--   ",03-931X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And both would be all right because what's the difference between not getting as much appreciation as you would have gotten if the correct information had been out there and getting less than you would have gotten.  I mean, in both cases the shareholder is affected the same way.  It didn't get as much in one case.  So you're not distinguishing between those.  I think you're agreeing that in both cases the... the discovery of platinum is the shares go up, but they would have gone up much higher if there had been gold as well.  That shareholder has a claim under your theory, doesn't she?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but I'm assuming that... that there is, and so the stock goes up but not as much as it would have.  But on the point of disclosure, there is a difference between your position and the Government's, and I really would like you to tell me if that's genuine or it's my misperception.  Your view is there's the disclosure of the bad news, the lie, and the price drops.  In the Government's presentation... and I'm reading from page 19... the fraud can be revealed by means other than a corrective disclosure and a drop in the stock price may not be a necessary condition for establishing loss causation in every fraud on the marketplace.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But, Mr. Hungar, if you look at the forms of what's proper pleading under the Federal rules on causation, the sample pleadings say, for example, for money lent, the defendant owes the plaintiff for money lent.  Period.  Or for goods sold and delivered.  Nothing more.  Just alleged causation.  Defendant... plaintiff alleges I lost X amount and it was caused by defendant.  I thought you pointed to the 9(b) rule because fraud must be pleaded with particularity, but causation does not, not under the rules and not under the statute.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that... that's to the... to the allegation of fraud, but not causation.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It says... no.  It said fraud must be pleaded with particularity, not all the elements of a fraud claim.   INTERRUPTING ",03-932X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there's a... but there... there is a basic difference between, as was pointed out in the colloquy with Mr. Hungar... one thing is the particularity of pleadings.  Yes, you have to tell the details of the fraud.  No, you don't have to tell the details of the loss.  But you do have to have a theory on which you can recover, and if your theory is simply I bought at an inflated price and the law doesn't give you a claim for relief on that theory, then you're out the window.  There's no discovery.  There's nothing.  You have to have, as Justice Souter pointed out, a viable theory of relief, and that's the difference between... you say it's enough that the stock was selling for much more than it should have, and the other side said, no, that's not enough.  You have to show that when the misrepresentation was corrected, the price dropped.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought your theory was, at least as I read your brief, that your loss occurs at the moment of purchase, not at some later time, that when you bought the stock, the price was inflated and that's when you suffered your loss, on the day of the purchase, not at a later time.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there's a problem.  Take the concrete facts of this case.  The bad news about... what is it?  Albuterol?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  That bad news didn't come out until 9 months after the end of the period that you identify for your class.  You say the class is April 15th, '97 until February 24th, '98 purchases.  The bad news doesn't come out until November of '98.  So how could you possibly hook up your loss to the news that comes out later?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I... I thought that you were trying to pick up on the drop that seemed to be attributable to the other--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Yes, and that's what... well, there... there are two frauds going on.  The first one is discovered and the price drops substantially.  And I thought you were trying to attribute that drop to the other product.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, one of the problems for me is the Ninth Circuit seems to think that it has a theory... and it is the theory of your complaint... that's different from, say, the Third Circuit.  The Ninth Circuit says we recognize that the loss is you bought it at an inflated price, and the Ninth Circuit thinks that's different from a circuit that says you don't have any loss until somehow the bad news comes out and there's a drop in price as a result.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that that's what the Government was getting at in the passage I read earlier where they don't make it... there must be a statement by the issuer of the correction.  They have more leeway.  But you... the Ninth Circuit... the litany that it's using, the... the set of cases... for example, plaintiffs were harmed when they paid more for the stock than it was worth.  The... the notion that's repeated, that your loss is established on the day you purchase the price, that's just wrong, and I think we would have to at a minimum say that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You... you seem--   ",03-932X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So where would you... where would... where would you put the line?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then... but you were... you are including at least wetlands that abut--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --navigable water.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about major tributaries?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which ones?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, is your position no tributaries or some tributaries?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  From everything... from everything you said, it sounds like you're... you're taking issue with Riverside Bayview because if a wetland adjacent to the river counts, then why not a stream that goes right into it?  What sense does that distinction make?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You think that's correct about what the Court said in Bayview when it phrased the question as before discharging fill material into wetlands adjacent to navigable bodies of water and their tributaries.  That's what the Court thought it was deciding in Riverside Bayview.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  At any rate, they could not have been making the distinction Justice Scalia suggested if, at least in the Court's thinking, the tributaries rolled right into the navigable body.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then what was the reason they gave for rejecting the permit?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --May I ask one question about your... your not... no hydrological connection?  If this berm were next to a wetland that would otherwise be adjacent to a river, the situation that was presented in Riverside Bayview, is it the berm that prevents there being a hydrological connection?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it could... there could be a situation where the wetlands would be right next to the river, but there's a berm in between, and that would break the hydrological connection?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  We're told that one of them was much closer.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the Pine River?  Are you... that's not 20 miles away, is it?

1,NO QUESTIONS,04-1034
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can we just go back to the point you just made, it's a little different when the judge has discretion and there's no... the judge has discretion to take a whole bunch of things into account, but they're not quantified.  And I think that was dramatically illustrated, the difference, by the decision of Judge Lynch when he said,  ""Well, I'll go back to the old ways of doing it, I'll look at the Guidelines for some advice. ""  he comes out with twenty-four months instead of thirty-three months.  So I think there is a huge difference between a judge taking account of many, many factors, not giving them a specific quantity as the Guidelines require.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose the determination, as is occasionally true of the Guidelines, is made not by the Commission, but by Congress itself?  Or made by the Commission at the direction of Congress?  Then the distinction that you're making between the maximum set by the legislature and the guidance provided, or the guidance to discretion under the Guidelines, really doesn't stand up.  So at least to the extent that Congress directly enacts Guidelines, would you concede that then, the critical finding has to be made by the jury?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is that complexity, is the key or, suppose these Guidelines were proposed by the Commission, just as they are, with all their complexity, but they were proposed as legislation, and then Congress enacted these Guidelines, would you be able to make the argument that you're making, still?  The Federal system, now legislative guidelines is viable after Blakely?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's not so clear anymore, it just happens that there are three members, but they don't have to be any judicial members, under the current legislation.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I ask--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --about practice experience in that regard.  I understand the Department of Justice has told prosecutors that now you allege these sentencing enhancers... like drug quantity, like amount of property stolen... you allege them in the indictment, you prove them beyond a reasonable doubt.  Has that proved intractably difficult in cases where it has been attempted?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And if it were done that way, why would it be that you would try to change the word (b)?  Why not just have Section 3553(a), which does list the guidelines as one of the considerations that judges may take into account in sentencing, one of... among three or four others?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which has the guidelines--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --as one of other factors.   INTERRUPTING ",04-104X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I hope you will go over to the... to the severability problem, because, as I understood it, you and the Government were very much at odds about what should be severed and what shouldn't, and we didn't get to ask Mr. Clement about his severance, which was going to be that to the extent no plus factors are involved, no sentence-enhancing factors are involved, the guidelines remain binding.  He didn't get a chance to say that in his argument, and I hope he'll address it.  And you say,  ""Whatever you do, don't make it half binding and half advisory. ""   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And why would it be so terrible to say,  ""Well, to the extent that there are no sentencing enhancing factors, let's preserve what Congress did, let's make them binding when the jury doesn't have to find anything? ""   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then what about all the factors... Justice Breyer outlined four categories of, of guideline factors that are not easily, if at all, presented to the jury.  The Chief Justice mentioned the one of perjury at the trial itself.  Could never give that to a jury because it hasn't happened until the trial.  And some of the others that become very complicated, like he mentioned, other... other relevant conduct, relevant conduct, yeah.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So that would just be out.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It would have to be prosecuted as separate--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But a special verdict wouldn't do from the point of view of the defendant, I think would resist it very heavily, if what the findings have to be are, say, a much larger drug quantity, the relevant conduct.  These are things that could be damning for a defendant.  So a defendant surely would not want that, all of this to be tried to the jury that's going to try the basic case.  The defendant would much prefer to have the jury not know about that it wasn't five ounces, that it was 500 grams, or that, at the same time, the defendant did a lot of other bad things.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you would have to have, then, essentially two trials.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you know what the Kansas system is?  I mean, right after Apprendi, they transformed their guideline system into one where the jury makes the findings, but are all of their trials bifurcated?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Judge Hornby had some distress in doing that, didn't he, because the difference was quite large?  Based on what the judge found, it would have been fifteen or sixteen years as opposed to five or six years?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  He didn't say it, that that was his discretionary choice.  He said that--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --He made, he made those findings of fact, that... leadership role and the quantity of drugs.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And on the basis of those two he said the guidelines would require me to come up with this higher sentence, not that using the guidelines as advisory he would have gotten--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --And then the other, that's the high range, and the low range is, I'll just stick with the crime that he was indicted for, and that's five or six years.

And Matlock said... it referred to the risk that a joint occupant undertakes, the risk of inability to control access during one's absence.  So, the scene in Matlock is, one occupant is there, the other is absent; and the one who was absent assumes the risk that the one who was there will exercise control.  Matlock doesn't speak to the two people who are in disagreement situation.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So, you would distinguish... in your answer to Justice Souter... this is... this is a lawyer.

So, that's the first information the police have.  Could they get a warrant, just on her say so?  In fact, they got the straw that had the cocaine residue on it.

But then, Congress has passed another statute that says all laws shall be subject to RFRA... shall be subject to RFRA.  So, we can't just look at  ""Is there a compelling State interest for the controlled Substances Act? ""  in a vacuum.  We have to take what was a later statute, RFRA, to which the Controlled Substances Act is made subject by Congress.  And I thought the argument was, is there a compelling State interest in that context?  How can there be, given the situation with peyote and,  ""We're just like the Native American Church in that regard? ""   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I would understand that if the Government had acted uniformly.  But we do have two situations that seem to be like... the peyote and this case.  And if the Government must accommodate to one, why not to the other?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But, Mr. Kneedler, may I--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --may I stop you--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --there?  Because, correct me if I'm wrong, but it was my impression that the DEA was allowing an exemption for peyote use by the Native American Church before Congress passed the law.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if you take it that the Government was right... before Congress passed the law, the Government was right to give the exemption to allow that ceremonial use of peyote, then I don't see how you get mileage from a congressional act that was passed later than Congress's is saying,  ""Executive, we agree with you, you did right. ""  But it's not... you... I don't see how you can rely on the congressional statute when the Government was doing this even without a--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --congressional statute.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Kneedler--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --may Congress, consistent with the Establishment Clause, say that we will create an exception for peyote, but not for this other church, which has far fewer members, less risk of diversion, has been found to be a genuine religion?  The problem of preferring one religious group over another, it seems to me, arises once there is an exception for the Native American Church.  And I heard you say,  ""Well, the Indian tribes are special. ""  but is that... that's it.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, as it was just mentioned, ""multifactor"", in a footnote, it said it would be neutral.  I think the big point in Fogerty was that it was going to apply in both directions, be neutral as between plaintiff and defendant.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You've given us, in your multifactor test, you said, ""objectively reasonable basis to remove"".

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But, your opinion... that's the real problem here for the doctor who is on the line.  And you said the lawyer would say, oh, you've got this defense of... what do you call it harm--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Competing harms, a defense... I think that a lawyer who cares about his client would say, defense is not what we want.  What we want is there is no claim, not that you have to put up a defense and maybe the attorney general will give us a letter saying that we come under that defense.  Wouldn't a careful lawyer say, what you need to be protected is that there is no claim for doing what you're doing?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How would it be as applied?  Look at your reply brief at page 3.  And you've made it very clear, and I think that it is helpful that you did, that there could be this preenforcement action by doctors who would not have to wait until faced with an actual medical emergency to bring the suit.  You've talking about this small category of cases, but I take it from what you have read... what the lines I've just read, that you envision a doctor who says, sooner or later, I'm going to have such a case.  Right now, I don't know and I can't know until it's too late to come to any court, so I'm going to bring this preenforcement which you characterized as applied.  But I don't see how its as applied, if if the physician just says, as you put it, I don't have to wait until faced with an actual medical emergency to bring this suit.  So what is the relief, what is the lawsuit that you envision would be proper?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Could you do that as a class action?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What is the circumstance?  All you said here is there coule be a preenforcement challenge by doctors who would not have to wait until faced with an actual medical emergency.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, exactly.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then I think what you're saying essentially is that the First Circuit was concerned with this category, wanted to give preenforcement relief to the physician, so what they did was write except that they should have said this statute is not enforceable where there is a risk to the woman's health and it cannot be applied in any such cases.  Where there is a risk to the health, then the statute is okay.   ",04-1144

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Frey, in practice, is there, as there often is for a corporation, a divergence between those two places?

In the case of a national bank, is there that similar difference that what you call its main office or where it's chartered is different from where it has its principal place of business?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Frey, remind me of the State bank.  A State bank is, for Federal diversity purposes, a citizen of two... two places or only one?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it would be the--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --its place of incorporation and--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --principal place of business if it's different.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But not with every State with which it has a close nexus.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So, in other words, the partnership... we have a corporation where it's incorporated and Congress said a principal place of business.  We have a partnership where each partner is located.  I don't know of any instance where for subject matter jurisdiction, that is, which court system you go to, as distinguished from personal jurisdiction or venue, you have a notion that someone is a citizen of every place where it does the business.

Is there any other entity that would, for subject matter jurisdiction purposes--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Its members.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but the question that I asked you is, in the realm of subject matter jurisdiction, that is, which court system, Federal or State, as distinguished from where can I grab this person for personal jurisdiction purposes, what are my venue choices, is there any other example in all of title 28 where, for subject matter jurisdiction purposes, this... every place where it's located counts?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In South Carolina.  It's not... it's not as though you're being sent to some other place.  The only question is whether they would have access to the Federal court.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but there was a theory that was put to the jury... and it's right there on the special interrogatories... one category was violent acts that obstruct commerce with no connection at all to extortion.  That was there.  And I have a question about your characterization of what the Seventh Circuit did.  It was puzzled.  It says, ""Extortion, they all go"".  But here are these four that don't involve extortion, and there's no ruling from the Court on those.  Was the Court supposed to assume that the Court made a question... decided a question of statutory interpretation by silence?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The question is whether the Court should rule on it, as in a matter of first decision.  We are a court of review.  There was no determination of whether the Hobbs Act included such a category in the Seventh Circuit.  So, the difficulty, the impediment to addressing your position is that however strong it may be, it wasn't resolved below, so why shouldn't we follow the natural order that first the District Court speaks, and then the Court of Appeals, and then it comes here?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Were you--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I'm concerned about your characterization, not only of suggesting that there was some attempt to force a particular decision, but I'm reading the Seventh Circuit's remand to the District Court.  It went through your argument, which it said was a substantial one, that no change was intended in the codification.  And it said,  ""While these revisions were intended to be formal stylistic changes, it is not beyond the realm of the possible that the revisors may have made certain substantive changes. ""  That doesn't sound like they were ruling on it definitively, but they were tipping their hand.  ""Not beyond the realm of the possible. ""  That was--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --They asked the District Court to resolve it.  They said the District Court should resolve it in the first instance, and then they would review it, presumably.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Even though two U.S. attorneys, years back, did predicate cases on there being a discrete crime of obstructing commerce through violent means.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Blatt, your time is almost over, so, on the injunction part, what remedies are available to the United States under your reading of the provision?  Injunctive relief, yes.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Chemerinsky, if we turn from what this Court did, or did not, think about last time around to what those four counts were, would I look to find out what were those four acts of violence that remain in the case?  I could not find, in any of the papers before us, any specific definition of what those acts of violence were.  I mean, the jury was given... I don't know what... was it a dozen possibilities?  And they found four.  But which four, we have no idea.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But he... but wasn't this tried to a jury?  That was a jury that made those findings.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the jury is no longer sitting.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  He knows that there were four acts.  He knows that he... under his instructions, the jury could pick 12.  How could he know which four the jury homed in on?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But does it... when what turns on that finding is injunctive relief, the judge might very well be influenced by what those particular acts were.  He might say one set of four was not adequate to issue this injunction, but another set of four would be.  And we just don't know... we don't know what those acts were.  The jury is not to be called back.  The Seventh Circuit said ""no more evidence"".  So, if we get down to those four acts, how can we say those are sufficient to uphold an injunction, when we don't even know what the acts were?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the Seventh Circuit in its most recent expression said,  ""It may well be that the judge will decide that those four predicate acts. ""  --as opposed to 121 going in, four...  ""were not sufficient to support certainly a nationwide injunction, but perhaps not any injunction. ""   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Chemerinsky, the problem that I have, and Justice Breyer expressed, is, we have the revisor's notes that suggest,  ""I was just getting rid of extra words. ""  ""I was making this a tighter provision. ""  And there's not anything to indicate that Congress considered any change in the substance of the Act.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But here's a... the revisor telling us,  ""I did this, and I did this to clean up the Act, to make it less wordy.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So, a private party could get an... not only permanent, but preliminary--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --injunction.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Landau--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Landau, maybe this... this is a point your... the respondent makes.  Prima Paint talks about section 4 and it says, with respect to matters within the jurisdiction of the Federal court.  So the answer to everything you said could be, fine, if this were proceeding in, say, the Southern District of Florida, but it's in the State court.  And Prima Paint just spoke about procedure in Federal court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You also run into a problem with the... some States classify a contract as voidable and other States for that same ground make it void.  So at least you would have... you would lose the uniformity if you've made the distinction between those two.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What would be the issues for the arbitrator in this case?  Is there anything other than was it... was this interest usurious?  The dispute between the parties... we' re not told what the issues are that would be subject to arbitration.   INTERRUPTING ",04-1264
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Bland.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Bland, some State may say fraud in the inducement is void.  These... these are classifications that States make.  These are labels that the State puts on them.  And you are introducing vast disuniformity if you say that the line to draw is between void and voidable.  You are forced into that because the Prima Paint case dealt with voidable.  So you... that you... you are drawing a line between void and voidable which shifts from State to State.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if you open the door... if you open the door... public policy has been called an unruly horse.  All you have to do is open the door and you will have litigation in court, and then the court will decide what the arbitrator would other... otherwise decide.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You're giving the end result.  How many cases have the lawyers gone into court and said, court, strike down this contract because it's against public policy?  Courts may reject many of those, but--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --If we take--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --if we take, Mr. Bland, what you said so... the words transaction involving commerce, but a contract... okay.  So you spoke about void contracts.  Well, what about there's not enough consideration, things that go to the formation?  So this contract was never formed.  So--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --So we're going far... far beyond a void subject matter like usury.  But you could say there... there wasn't sufficient consideration.  There was no mutuality or things that go to the formation of a contract.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are you saying then if this case, the case that was brought in Florida, had been brought or removed in... more likely removed because there was diversity, removed to the Federal court, the Federal court should do just what the Florida Supreme Court did?  Or would the Federal court say, well, we've got our instructions from Prima Paint?  It says excise the arbitration clause.  If that's okay, we decide the other questions.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You said this was an issue for the court.  Was there an alternate forum in that case?  Was it an arbitration case?   ",04-1264
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It was a computation error.  This is not a... this is not a case where the State chose to waive the statute of limitations.  It miscalculated.  Isn't that the case?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But we're not... and we didn't take cert to decide if this claim was timely.  We are on the assumption that it was untimely.  But... and what are the consequences of the State's failing to raise that?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --the whole basis was the number of days that they calculated, and the magistrate said,  ""Oh, they miscalculated. ""  ""There were more days involved. ""   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Suppose the magistrate judge had said,  ""I notice this error in accordance with Eleventh Circuit law, so I am going to suggest to the State that they amend their answer. ""  The State certainly could... under Rule 15, if the Federal rules apply, the State could have amended its answer and done just what the magistrate judge did.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Did it say ""an obligation"", or that the court ""could""?  It didn't... I didn't think it said the court ""must"".   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where is... I see... you're referring to page 4(a) and--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Yes.  Which... where is the sentence that says it... that--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I thought that that duty is in connection with Rule 4.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, we could--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --we could... we could agree with you that there is isn't an obligation on the Federal judge to raise it, but the question is, you know, the... it could be a ""must"", it can be ""may not"", or it could be ""may"".   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And why shouldn't we treat this as a ""may""?  The judge noticed the clerical error and called it to the party's attention by an order to show cause.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  We're past Rule 4, because an answer has been ordered.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So... and it's only when the answer comes in that this issue is spotted.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There are very what standards?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, ""leave shall be freely given"".   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, what would be the prejudice that could be claimed by the habeas petitioner?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you couldn't do this under Rule 4, because, as you, I think, recognized, that, just from the petition, from the habeas petition, you couldn't tell.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There wasn't--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Yes, but the civil rules allow for amendment.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's 8(c), and there's 12(b), but there's also 15.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It seems the height of technicality to say that the judge could suggest,  ""Now, State, I will entertain a motion to amend the answer, under Rule 15. ""  instead of saying,  ""I'm issuing an order to show cause why this action is not out of time. ""   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Were those--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --cases... were those cases of a miscalculation on the part of the State?  The judge's view was that the State had miscalculated under eleventh amendment... under Eleventh Circuit precedent.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But here, nothing--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --happened.  Nothing happened.  There was--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --The answer was put in, and then there were no further proceedings.  Nothing else went on in the court.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's quite different... I don't know any judge that would allow a defendant, after the trial is over, to raise the statute of limitations.  But, up front, it's a different situation.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Not generally.  Statute of limitations, like res judicata, they are 8(c) affirmative defenses, and preclusion doctrine is for the party to waive or not, just like the statute of limitations.  I don't think there's any rule that says a judge in the run of the mine case acts properly by interjecting preclusion into a case where no party has raised it.     Well, our point is that it is a matter for the court's discretion.  And there may well be circumstances where it would be an abuse of discretion to interject a timeliness objection.  For example, if the case had gone on for years, and a trial had been held, as Your Honor suggested in the question earlier, that might well be an abuse of discretion, but it would not... for example, take the case where the District Court had dismissed, at the outset, on the merits, and it went up to the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals said,  ""You know, that merits issue is a very difficult one. ""  ""And, in fact, we think we might have to remand for an evidentiary hearing on that issue. ""  ""But, you know, this case was untimely filed. ""  ""We can dispose of it on that basis. ""  ""And we can save all of those judicial and party resources by addressing that issue now. ""  We think that would be an appropriate exercise of the court's discretion.  Here, as Your Honor noted earlier, this was the first thing that happened in the District Court after the filing of the petition, the answer, and the reply.  There was no waste of judicial resources by the fact that it was raised sua sponte by the court in the first thing that the court did after that briefing.  There was no prejudice to the Petitioner, because it was omitted from the State's responsive pleading.  There is... as the Court said in Granberry, the failure to plead it perhaps waives the District... the State's opportunity to insist on the defense.  The State, because it said, in its answer here, erroneously, that the petition was timely filed, or if it had said nothing, would have waived its opportunity to stand on, and insist on, that defense.  But it is not an absolute forfeiture.  It does not bar the party from suggesting at a later time, ""We would like to amend"", or, in this case, the court to note it sua sponte.  The court did, here, of course, give the Petitioner every opportunity--   ",04-1324
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but, Mr. Kise, the... Mr. Busby told us that the reference was in the following paragraph, and it is the sentence,  ""A Federal Court that sits in collateral review of a criminal judgment of a State Court has an obligation to enforce the Federal statute of limitations. ""  That's the sentence that suggests that the Court of Appeals thought that there was an obligation, the District Court, to raise the statute of limitations on its own motion.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would you say it's--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --means it's ""hardly ever""?  I mean, we do follow the principle of party presentation.  And judges are not supposed to be intruding issues on their own, they are supposed to follow the party's presentation.  So, would this be... if it's not ""never"", would it be at least ""hardly ever"", that it's appropriate for a judge to interject an affirmative defense on his own motion?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought in Granberry the Court gave the Court of Appeals that discretion, since it hadn't... the point had been missed in the District Court, been missed by everybody, until the Court of Appeals.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But why would--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --why would you deal with that hypothetical when the Eleventh Circuit, in all fairness, said,  ""We join the Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Circuit, and rule that, even though the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, the District Court may review the timeliness of the 2254.

And that was an FBI officer who testified to that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's a question on which we didn't grant cert.--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Could you use--     --some understanding of that evidence.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Could... could you use the same rule with respect to alibi evidence?  This trial judge would say this evidence for the prosecution is so strong, I'm not going to let any alibi evidence in.  Is there... is there anything special about third party guilt?  Couldn't... couldn't you use... use it for other defenses?     I think there is something special about third party guilt.  Alibi is merely the defendant saying I didn't do it and I wasn't there when the crime was done.  I think in third party guilt evidence you're diverting the case off in another direction that requires some special attention by the courts, and I think most States recognize it requires special attention by the court because it's hitting on a collateral issue requiring the State to prove or, to some extent, disprove that another individual did it, an individual that might not be subject to notice requirements, an individual that might not even be alive.  We look at... you can look at the... this Court's decision in Donnelly v. the United States, a 1911 decision, that recognized there's something different about third party guilt potential evidence because of the inherent unreliability which may exist in the manner and the way it was presented.

There's no finding in this record of what Texas law is other than what you have just told us, and perhaps you're right and perhaps you're not.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think it... it may be that there's another side to that story.  For example, I think the bankruptcy court was heard from first.  Arguably, that's binding on the Texas court.  Whether the bankruptcy court was right or wrong, it would get full faith and credit.  That's one argument.  Another is perhaps you can explain to me how this all started because I thought that there was a claim made against her in the bankruptcy court for defamation.  Then the claim that she asserts is a compulsory counterclaim.  She has to make it there or she'll lose it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I...

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In connection with what's included and what isn't included, the... in that same 3731 provision in (d), (d) is limited to (a) and (b) and so excludes (h).

It said that's what the Libertarians want to expose themselves to.  It's not for a State to be paternalistic to protect them against their own bad choices.  But it said this request is damaging to the majority parties, to the major parties, because it poaches on their members.  But there is not in this litigation any major party that's complaining about that.  So if that is the rationale that the district court went on, can this Court possibly oppose it when there is nobody, as far as we know... they haven't even come into this case at this level, filing a friend of the Court brief.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, when you... would you say that the rationale on which the district court rejected the Libertarian Party's claim was unsatisfactory?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Was there a basis in the record for making that finding?   Gene C. Schaerr  --Yes.  Mr. Darcy's testimony, which I believe appears at... at page 63 of the joint appendix, in that... in that general area, anyway.  Now, poaching... poaching is a concern and... and a legitimate and important concern to the States for three important reasons.  I... I might mention that in Tashjian this Court mentioned in footnote 13 that a... that an open primary could have disorganization effects on the other parties, and poaching is one of those, as the district court found.  And... and it's a concern for three independent reasons.  First of all, the State has an interest in preventing poaching because that helps protect parties from spurned candidate candidacies which was one of the... the Court in Tashjian identified Storer and Rosario as examples of that.  And... and the... the semi-closed primary protects parties against that.  For example, if a candidate for the Democratic nomination felt that she wasn't getting enough support from the party leadership before the primary, she might form or join another party and then try to take... take her supporters with her into that other party.  And although Oklahoma allows the candidate to switch parties in that circumstance, the... the semi-closed primary and the 7-week period or 7 or 8-week period, standoff period, if you will... that period protects the party from having its voters poached as a result of a... of a spurned candidate joining another party.  The second reason that poaching is a significant concern is that... is that it can lead to efforts, strategic efforts by... by other parties to influence the outcome of another party's primary.  For example, suppose we're in California in 2002 a few days before the gubernatorial primaries there.  The Democrats have already decided that their incumbent, Governor Davis, will be nominated, so they're looking ahead to the general election.  And they see two possible Republican candidates, Reardon and Simon, to pull two names out of a hat.  And they conclude that... that they have a better chance of beating Simon than they have of beating Reardon.  Well, what can they do to affect the... the outcome of the Republican race?  One possibility, if the Republican primary is open, is to raid it by having some Democrat switch registration and go vote for Simon.  And of course, the Court has said repeatedly that States have an important interest in... in preventing that kind of behavior.  The other possibility is for the--   ",04-37XX

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought your case was you want to appeal to people who don't want to register as Libertarians and don't even want to be independent.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did the prosecutor... did the prosecutor object when there was a further extension given for the pendency of the petition for rehearing?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Smith, this... unlike the Calderon, which is a... was a... a court has authority to recall a mandate that has already issued, this seemed to be a really idiosyncratic case.  I mean, this was an extraordinary situation where a judge said, my goodness, I wrote an opinion that assumed this person was mentally okay, and now I discovered in the file things I never saw before.  This is a death case.  I have reason to suspect that this person may not have been competent when he committed the crime, may not have been competent when he... when he stood trial, may not be competent at this very moment.  A judge in that situation... he finds something that looks like it's the... it's... it's the key piece of evidence in favor of the defendant.  Somehow it never got submitted.  A judge, knowing that he has written an opinion saying this man, as far as the Federal courts are concerned, goes to the State and they can set their date of execution and all that... that was an... this case is so idiosyncratic that I'm concerned about dealing with 41(b) and mandates for this really unusual situation.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  At two different points in time, wasn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How would it have been presented?  Because it wasn't... it wasn't even in the record in the district court.  I mean, that was what Suhrheinrich was so bewildered about, that here was what seemed to be the strongest evidence of the defendant, and at the end of the proceeding in the district court, it's not even made formally a part of the record.  It was a deposition.  Right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it wasn't... it wasn't in the district court record.  It wasn't in the record that went from the district court to the court of appeals.  It wasn't in the record on appeal.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What you're saying is... essentially is we should regard this as though what wasn't done had been done because it was supposed to have been done.  In other words, you're saying treat this just as if the mandate issued and was being recalled.  That's what I get to be the gist of your argument.   ",04-514X

You said, well, it was rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.  There was no evidence.  There was no evidentiary hearing.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought there was another... another.  Wasn't there another minority woman on the... in the jury panel?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, she might in the future, if she's got a job as a prosecutor in this court.  So she's certainly going to be concerned with her reputation, her integrity before the court.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What's wrong with the explanation, as far as youth is concerned, is that she didn't want to across the board strike young people, but she just wanted to come up with a jury that had dominantly older people.  So that wouldn't mean that she's withdrawing youth.  It's just that she's saying it isn't an absolute with me.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, what's... one... one point could be I don't want too many young people, so I'm going to exercise some peremptories to make sure that the jury is dominantly older people.  What's wrong with that?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, she did.  Number 6 was white.  Right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And youth was a factor there.  There may have been other factors, but youth was certainly a factor in that case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that... that was so obviously a slip, and Judge Hall pointed that out in her dissent.

The... what damages could the corporation JWM have collected under... had it brought a 1981 suit?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But those contracts--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But you'd have to concede at a minimum that now that the corporation has settled the breach of contract claim, that to the extent that the corporation could have recovered under 1981, that's gone too because those two claims were intimately related, and you would be precluded from bringing such a claim.  So to the extent that there's an overlap, you face a res judicata bar.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So they... the Ninth Circuit's view is there are two potential plaintiffs in this situation.  Both can sue and one gets... the damages are not identical.  That's--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --The shareholder can sue.  The sole shareholder can sue.  The corporation can sue.  Both have 1981 claims.  It's not either/or.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They both have 1981 claims, but the damages are different in the case of the individual than in the case of the corporation.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  On the issue that's before us now, I can understand why, if the, what we used to call, JNOV is not requested after the jury verdict, the appellate court could not then enter judgment... direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law.  But I don't see why it couldn't say, just as we would be reluctant to affirm a decision when there was no claim for relief, so, if there's insufficient evidence, we can remand for a new trial.  But you would say that that is not possible either.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --you haven't asked for it, but the appellate court said,  ""We don't want to affirm a judgment when there was insufficient evidence, so we are going to. ""  --there was... the judge was tipped off by the... by the directed verdict motion, that the... who turned out to be... the one who turned out to be the verdict loser thinks the evidence is insufficient.  That's enough at least to say that the Court of Appeals could grant a new trial.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, I'm not--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --talking about ""against the weight"", because a trial judge would rarely be... if it... if a trial judge said,  ""It's against the weight of the evidence. ""  it would go back for a new trial, and you couldn't raise that issue, at least not til you go through the whole second trial.  But why isn't it like... I think there are decisions that said there was a judgment, but the Court of Appeals determines there was never a claim for relief to begin with, even though a motion wasn't made to that effect.  The idea of a court affirming a judgment that is without sufficient legal basis is troubling.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But, it... but it was asked by the... by the pre verdict motion.  What... the only thing that wasn't done is, it... the request wasn't repeated after the verdict.  I can see your point if there had never been a motion for directed verdict at the close of all of the evidence.  But there was that.  And so, all that we're missing is a repetition of the same words after the jury comes in.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that's... the new trial comes in, by the courts that have said this, only... they'd say,  ""We would direct the entry of judgment for the verdict loser, but we're powerless to do that. ""  And that is all wrapped up in the Seventh Amendment.  So, the next best thing is, we grant a new trial.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, couldn't one regard a new trial as, sort of, subsumed under the request for judgment as a matter of law?  That is, that's the larger thing, but at least a new trial.  Don't let... the judgment as a matter of law says, ""Don't let this verdict stand"".  So, one could say,  ""We won't give you a judgment, but we will order a new trial. ""   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I don't understand your response to me about vastly different standards of review.  I would think it would be harder for a verdict loser to get judgment as a matter of law than to get a new trial.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's why--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I'm suggesting--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --that one is kind of a lesser included.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I don't think any appellate court has claimed that authority.  We're talking about a new trial in lieu of J... a judgment as a matter of law.  And the... one of the whole rationales in Cone and Globe and all of the others was... saying you should make the post verdict motion... is that then the trial judge would have the option.  The trial judge might think,  ""Well, technically, you deserve JMOL, but maybe there was a witness who was out to sea, so I want to exercise my discretion to grant a new trial. ""  Those two are closely linked.  I mean, lawyers usually, as a... just a matter of... just automatically ask for JNOV or, in the alternative, a new trial.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --in fact, that's not what the Courts of Appeals have said.  They have all said,  ""We would grant judgment as a matter of law, but we're powerless to do that under this case... Court's case law. ""  ""We think the evidence is insufficient, not that it's against the weight of the evidence. ""  ""We think it's insufficient. ""  ""If we had the power to do it, we would direct the entry of judgment. ""  ""We can't do that, so we do the next best thing. ""  But in all of the... including the Tenth Circuit, whose law is relevant here... the Court of Appeals is saying,  ""We think the judgment... there was insufficient evidence to support that judgment. ""  ""And if we had the power, we would instruct the entry of judgment. ""  ""We don't have that power. ""   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's a... it's a conditional ruling on the new trial motion.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because if it were a ruling on the new trial motion, you would never get up to the Court of Appeals.   ",04-597X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I just stop you with that point?  Because one of the things that Unitherm said about that argument... which, as you prefaced, is not before us... is, the Court of Appeals was looking to a truncated record to see whether there was sufficient evidence that, in fact, the record was much larger than the piece of it that the Federal Circuit examined, so that the Federal Circuit, when it says there was no evidence, was looking to the appendix that was before us, but that was not the whole picture.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But under this Federal Circuit's own law, it could not be, because there had not been the post verdict motion.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The Federal Circuit is borrowing Tenth Circuit's law for this purpose, but the Tenth Circuit's law, as I understand it, has... is the position that was just presented to us by Mr. Stewart.  That is, if you don't make what used to be called the JNOV, even if you made the directed verdict, you can't raise the sufficiency on appeal.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --that the Federal Circuit's own rule?  It... it was, I thought, pretty clear what it told us in that footnote, that if we were ruling... making the ruling... the Federal Circuit law is, if you don't make the 50(b) motion, you cannot get a reversal on appeal for insufficient evidence.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Borrow--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --the Tenth Circuit rule.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  But that's... in respect to the Chief Justice's question, the... Unitherm could have thought,  ""Well, the Federal Circuit is not going to deal with sufficiency; therefore, I don't have to beef up-- ""   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  ""# what I put in the appendix. ""   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm looking at the motion that you made, which was not in the first instance for a new trial; it was for a remittitur.  This is on page 34(a) of the joint appendix.  And you made a motion, in the alternative, for a new trail on antitrust damages, not liability.  So, I was really struck by the statement in your brief that you had, indeed, made a motion for a new trial.  You made it a motion for a remittitur and, in the alternative, a new trial, limited to damages.  You said nothing about a new trial on liability.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  A new trial on damages... that's all you asked for... not a new trial on liability.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --it was... the new trial request had to do with liability--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --whether it was for newly discovered evidence or something else.  But you... your motion was limited to damages.  And I really don't think that you can get where you want to go from a motion that is limited to damages, when you didn't need to.  You could have made a motion for a new trial on the whole case.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The principal point was that the Court of Appeals could not enter... direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law if a 50(b) motion had not been made.  That's what those three cases--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --invoke.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How about a--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, it can't... it can't be... it would be interlocutory at that stage.  It couldn't be raised until final judgment is entered.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but you don't go up on appeal with a final judgment rule, a firm final judgment rule, as there is in the Federal system, from the denial or refusal to act on a 50(a) motion.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The trial isn't over.  There is no judgment.  You can't appeal til you have a final judgment.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, there is, you know... I mean, this truly is a case where a page of history is worth much more than logic.  The reason for that somewhat strange language is, at common law, it was thought, once the jury came in with a verdict, that was it, the judge had no power to overturn it, because of the Seventh Amendment's Reexamination Clause,  ""no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re examined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of common law. ""  And the rule of common law that is embodied in this somewhat strange language in Rule 50 is that there could be a reserved question so that after the jury comes in with the verdict, the judge would be deciding the pre verdict question by this post verdict motion.  I mean, there's... none of this is in doubt, where this language in 50 comes from.  It comes from a need to adjust to the Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment.  Isn't that so?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you don't get it out of that language, because that language is there for the specific purposes of allowing a judge, after their verdict, to enter judgment NOV.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  He doesn't enter judgment to trigger the 50(b) motion.  The 50(b) motion is made in between the verdict and the entry of judgment.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Right.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I don't--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I don't follow that, because you... you know, I'm sure, that it's almost routine that... yes, you have the 10 days, the extra 10 days, under the rules... but isn't it almost routine, at a trial, that the verdict loser will say,  ""Judge, please give me JNOV, or, if not, a new trial? ""  They don't wait til after the judgment is made... entered.  They could.  But it's just... well, in the trials I've seen, it's almost by rote that lawyers who lose, where the jury comes in for the other side, will renew the judgment as a matter of law motion and ask, in the alternative, for a new trial.  Isn't that the common practice?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, it's not a question of what is required or what is permissive, but isn't it to the lawyer's advantage, to the client's advantage, to say to the judge, sooner rather than later,  ""Don't enter judgment. ""  ""Give me... give me judgment NOV or at least a new trial? ""   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Sent back to... for a new trial because the Court of Appeals ordered a new trial, or sent back to the trial court for that court to decide as a matter of that court's discretion, whether to order--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --a new trial?  The latter.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --it was not... but, here, you're asking us to affirm something that a Court of Appeals did.   ",04-597X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But as Justice Souter pointed out, the State law incorporated the Federal standard and made it its own.  Here you have the Federal tax sale and a very strong Federal interest, which was lacking in Merrell Dow.  Justice Stevens said that.  But here I think there can be no doubt that the Government has a very strong interest in seeing that tax sales convey a secure title.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, Justice O'Connor had asked you about the... the quiet title cases, but Kansas City Title & Trust is still good law.  It wasn't overruled.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but the Court didn't make it... the Court's proposition in Kansas City Title & Trust was if it appears from the complaint that the right to relief depends on the construction or application of the Constitution or laws of the United States.  So are you asking us to take out or laws as dictum, or what is your position?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, when does... when does the... when do the words, or laws, in Kansas City Title & Trust have operative effect?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You mean that the... are you saying then in the context of this case that the Federal law would have to create a quiet title action, which is traditionally State law?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it wasn't necessary.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It was... that's the difference.  The State in Merrell Dow chose to adopt those Federal standards.  It was a choice.  I don't think a State has the prerogative to ignore the effect of a Federal tax sale.  This is not a matter of State choice, and that, it seems to me, is the large difference between the two cases: one, where the State chooses to recognize Federal standards when it doesn't have to, and here, there's no question that the Federal law governs the security of this title.  It's not an option for the State to ignore it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you... so you are... you are proposing one way to reconcile Kansas City.  You say, well, that's the constitutional claim.  But why isn't it at least as good a reconciliation to say once you go through... there's... there's a Federal claim... there's a Federal question that's dispositive of this case, and you agree that that's so here.  The whole thing turns on the meaning and effect of that notice provision.  So the Federal question is what determines this case, and you satisfy the well-pleaded complaint standard.  Then at that point, when you satisfy the basic Kansas City Title & Trust provisions, then to see which way to swing, why isn't it appropriate to say is this a case where the State has a large interest and the Federal interest is not significant?  Or, on the other hand, is it a case where there is a large Federal interest in seeing how this comes out?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you're saying that Merrell Dow did take out those words, or laws, from the Kansas City Title & Trust.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Wasn't that in the... in the pleading?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Wasn't that in the complaint?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the... but the well-pleaded complaint doesn't say it has to be a disputed allegation.  It says it must be.  You couldn't state the claim without having the Federal law in the complaint.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Zagrans, there is language in Merrell Dow that makes it sound like it's not as clear and certain as you are urging.  I think that the opinion author said that 1331's domain is shaped by the demands of reason and coherence, dictates of sound judicial policy, and common sense.  And if you just take that last question when the only question is, is mail notice good enough to satisfy the Federal statute, or do you have to have in-hand service?  Doesn't common sense say what that section means should be a Federal question, appropriate for a Federal court to decide?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm simply making the point that you are reading Merrill Lynch... Merrell Dow in a rather rigid way.  And yet, there is this language in it that says in... in... what was before the court in Merrell Dow made perfectly good sense in that tort action to have it going on in State court.  This is quite a different picture.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that there was no State law issue in this case, that the whole thing turned on what kind of notion... notice was sufficient to convey title.   ",04-603X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Suppose the... there was an issue in this case about the plaintiff in the quiet title action having waited too long.  I think here it was 6 years after.  So... so suppose there was a defense of laches under State law.  That could be an issue in an action in this format, quiet title action, which would be governed by State law.  Isn't that so?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So that case wouldn't be removable then if the... if the defense is laches?  The plaintiff--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Yes?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you might never get to the Federal law if the determination of 6 years is too long to wait to bring a suit like this.  Then you would remove and you could have an outcome based solely on State law in the Federal court.  You'd have a State claim.  The issue that divides the parties is how long was too long, and the court decides the case on that basis and never gets to the Federal question.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So if laches is pleaded as a defense, then it's not removable?  But don't you... well--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, at what point do you remove the case?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  A complaint is filed in State court, and you are the defendant and you want to remove that case to Federal court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How much time do you have to remove?  Would it be in advance of your answer?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So that in my case, you would remove on the basis of the complaint before you put in your answer, and I think you're--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --And then you could get into the Federal court, and the answer could be laches and you're in the Federal court and the only question that's decided is the State law question.

That's what it said.  When the State levies a tax directly on the tribe or members inside the reservation, no balancing.  But then it also said that if the incidence rests on non Indians, as here, with the distributor here, then there is no categorical bar, than balancing kicks in.  So, all Chickasaw dealt with, with the categorical rule, is when the State says the incidence of the tax is on the tribe.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Olson, in terms of the text of the statute that is... the incidence is on the distributor of the first receipt, but then there's this language... and it appears in a few places...

This is the picture I have of the case.  And please tell me where it's wrong.  Two jurisdictions, both with authority to impose a tax, the State and the tribe.  So, if the other weren't taxing, there wouldn't be any question, that the tribe can tax and the State can tax.  But the two can't coexist, because the consumer's not going to pay the price.  So, only one can.  And the issue is, which one dominates, and which is one is subordinate?  But you have unquestionable authority to tax in both.  And I thought it was clear that the two taxes did... this is not a case where the tribe can impose a tax, the State can im... oppose.  I read the briefs to accept that the tribe tax... couldn't put its tax on top of the State tax.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But not tax free.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Chickasaw said when the tax was imposed on the tribe, we would take the State at its word.  It said it's taxing the tribe.  If the State put the tax on a nonIndian, then there would be balancing.  And that's what Chickasaw--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --That's my understanding, as well.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I ask you, before you get to your three reasons, to go back to your... something that you said?  I asked you, Are you dividing the burden of production and persuasion?  And you said no, it's all on one side or the other.  But it seems to me your description of this proceeding, you said the school district goes first.  So--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --the school district did come forward.  And is that the usual practice in these administrative hearings... if the first one to go to defend the plan is the school district, not the parents who are attacking it?

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So, you think the ALJ... or the administrative hearing officer in this case told the State to go first... the school district to go first because he thought that maybe they had burden of proof, and would not have asked them to go first if he didn't?

But there is something different about this setup, because the statute does obligate the school district to come up with a plan.  And so, I was thinking, if you have a Title 7 case, and the plaintiff prevails on the merits, and then there's a question of remedy, and the employer said,  ""I propose this... these changes to remedy the violation.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Phillips, before you proceed to going on to (b), the... you have set up a dichotomy between a Federal question case where, as long as you have a Federal question claim in the case, you qualify within those words, of which the district courts have original jurisdiction.  But you say that in a diversity case, that's not so if you have people not of the same citizenship... of the same citizenship on both sides of the party line, so that you have to have a totally qualifying action on the diversity side to come within... to... to be within 1367(a).  But we have had at least two cases where the starting lineup did not satisfy the complete diversity rule.  One was Caterpillar and the other was Newman-Green, and the Court said, yes, on the day one there wasn't complete diversity, but that's curable later on, in the one case before the case was tried, in the other in the court of appeals.  So don't at least those two cases suggest that you can have a diversity case legitimately in the Federal court even though at the outset you don't have... fill all the requirements?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought the Court said that--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I thought the Court didn't say they were ignoring it.  I thought they said it was curable.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They didn't start over in Caterpillar.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The Caterpillar didn't start over and Newman-Green wasn't detected till appeal, but the appeals court didn't say start over.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I don't... I don't follow that entirely, Mr. Phillips, because the... Exxon lost at... at this trial, and preclusion doctrines... that means that Exxon had one full and fair opportunity to defend.  So Exxon is going to be bound by that... by the determination.  Somebody who was not in the litigation and might say, well, I want more, say, somebody who had opted out--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --What you're saying, Mr. Phillips, I think is that 1367 does nothing with regard to what was in the old days at least 1367(a), what was called ancillary jurisdiction.  It changed pendent jurisdiction to overrule the Finley case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So... so you could have appendant parties, but what was once known as ancillary jurisdiction, applicable in diversity cases, was not changed at all by 1367(a).  I think that's what you're saying.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But whether you... whether you call it codify or anything else, there would be no change.  1367, as you read it, made no change.  1367(a) on the Federal question side certainly did.  It overruled Finley.  Before, you could have pendent party jurisdiction.  Now you can.  But Kroger was unchanged.  I think what you're... you're telling us is that except for some difference in (b), 1367(a) leaves ancillary jurisdiction as it found it.  It doesn't make any change.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So what... what is the language in 1367(a) that effects any... any change in diversity jurisdiction, what was once called ancillary jurisdiction?  I don't see that there's any change.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You may... you may say that there's a confirmation of what was, but there's no change.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that's what Kroger was about.  It said, yes, that you could do it... that the plaintiff then couldn't turn around and sue the third party defendant.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that you did not need diversity between the defendant and the third party defendant.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I don't understand the distinction that you're making between diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy since 1332 includes both.  To qualify for diversity from the very beginning, you have to be of the opposite... you have to be from a different State than your opponent and the matter in controversy must be X. And that's always been part of the diversity... diversity jurisdiction.  There were two components.  One was the citizenship of the parties.  Two was the amount in controversy.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr.... Mr. Ayer, may I ask you a question on your interpretation?  I think you were... your position is that Clark against Paul Gray has been overruled, and whatever one may say about the attention that was focused on Zahn, Clark against Paul Gray has been on the books since 1939.  And it seems unlikely that Congress would have overruled that without even making a peep to that effect.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  It's about an amount-in-controversy rule.   ",04-70XX

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Class Action Fairness Act.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But not all.  You couldn't have a... if I remember right, a permissive counterclaim.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The defendant--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --can have a--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --If we descend from the level of parsing the... the statute to what's going on in these cases, in your cases I take it there was an injury to a child.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that qualifies under the amount-in-controversy.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And her mother or sister and, I think, father wanted to come in and... and bring claims that were entirely derivative of the injured child's claim.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And on your reading of 1367, there's the... the... there's no accommodation for that.  So you'd either have to have the whole lawsuit in the courts of Puerto Rico or you'd have... let the child sue in the Federal court and the parents would have to bring a separate suit?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, what a legislature might think, well, now this Finley has... we've been... taken care of that.  And your case looks very much the same in terms of breaking up a lawsuit into two when it makes sense to try it all together.  So we think that... that old case should go just the way Finley went.  And the same thing with Zahn because, after all, Zahn doesn't fit very well with Ben Hur.  If you're saying that the Strawbridge rule... I mean, what really counts is diversity, and... and Ben Hur says the only named representative citizenship counts and yet the amount-in-controversy, the lesser thing in your view... every single member of the class has to meet that amount, but only the named representatives have to be of diverse citizenship.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if you... does it make sense to have a rule that says we're going to ignore the citizenship of the members of the class for diversity purposes, for diversity of citizenship?  Only the named representative counts.  Well, then why shouldn't only the named representative count for amount-in-controversy?  That would have been a rational thing for Congress if they wanted to fix that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are you talking about a claim mover?  I'm not--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Stearns, there's a difference.  It's not just style.  There's a difference between a claim and a civil action.  A civil action can bundle several claims.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, and the whole committee said we do not want to take a position on Zahn.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  He was the chair of the--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Stearns, one of the things that we do know was that Congress intended to make a modest change.  They had their eye on Finley.  They wanted to overrule that.  And if there's an ambiguity, isn't a court well advised to make the least change?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, if... if you have a statute with a clear meaning, I agree with you, but this statute seems to be a bit of a muddle.  And if you could read it in two different ways, then why don't you say, well, I'll pick... if they're both plausible, I'll pick the one that doesn't introduce any radical change, that just makes a minor change?

The plaintiff then says,  ""Oh, but only one of those defendants is the ""real party whatever"", and I can drop the other one, because the other one is not the ""real party in interest""? ""  Now, that's a situation where courts, even if this court has never had that problem, have said,  ""If the second defendant, the non diverse defendant, is a ""real party"", you can't get rid of the case that way, but if it's not... if it's not, you can keep the... just drop it and keep the case going against the ""real party in interest"". ""  There are such cases.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ah, but the plaintiff said,  ""This is a complicated real estate business, and I want to discover whether there is... whether the 'true defendant' is a Virginia citizen, as I am. ""  So, on the face of it, it looks like there's complete diversity, but, in fact, the diverse defendant is hiding the ""real party"".  I think that's the position that the plaintiff was taking.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The plaintiff--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --the plaintiff points to two offices of the defendant, who's... the defendant is described by defendant as a Texas corporation... but there was one witness... Chaney, was it +/?  who said that Lincoln is not a corporation.  It is a partnership.  No corporate board.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, they thought they got closer with a witness named Franzen, who was a Virginia resident, and who also described Lincoln as a partnership, and himself as a partner.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, plaintiff certainly wouldn't want to say there's an indispensable party missing, I take it, because then that would put the plaintiff out of court.  The plaintiff is arguing that there's another defendant who should be in here.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And because you represent the removing defendant, it is true, is it not, that the removing defendant has the burden of showing that proper diversity exists?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Frederick, would you clarify one thing for me?  I don't know how we even get to the second question, about partnership.  If you're right that Lincoln is a corporation... it's a Texas corporation, with its principal place of business in Texas, end of case; it's the only named defendant... so, how do we get to something about a partnership?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, I don't understand it.  We wouldn't vacate the judgment in part.  If we reversed,--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --that's the end of it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but, Mr. Frederick, before that... you know, read back... the court... the fourth circuit has said,  ""It appears that the real and substantial party in interest is this Virginia subsidiary, be it a partnership, be it a corporation.

The court is positing that there is a Virginia corporation or a Virginia partnership in the picture, and then says,  ""And given that, not only is it... is it a Virginia entity, but it's got this close nexus because of... it's operating substantially there, as well.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then you'll be left without... if you've named the wrong defendant, then you have a suit against no defendant.  It seems to me you are automatically dismissed.  You didn't substitute another defendant.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And how about joint appendix 239 and 275, both of which say that Franzen was not a partner in any entity responsible for managing the apartments in question?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then there's no defendant.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you named Lincoln as the defendant.  And I'm looking at your second amended complaint, which says, ""Lincoln"", on information and belief,  ""is a corporation with its headquarters in Dallas, and it is the developer and manager of the property. ""  That's what you alleged in your complaint.  You allege that Lincoln was the manager... Lincoln, whose Texas corporation was the manager of the property in question.  Now, would you... you're saying that that was wrong, and you should have sued somebody else, and the Court should cure that for you?  That's... it's really bizarre.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But they... let me stop you on that 17, and it's talking about plaintiffs, that suits have to be brought in the name of the real party so that the defendant isn't in a situation where he's sued one day by plaintiff A, and is not home free when plaintiff B comes in with the identical complaint.  So, it was originally designed with, Who is the proper party, the assignee or the assignor?  That's what real party... that's what the concept is familiarly about.  Who is the proper plaintiff, not defendant?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Rule 17 is about joinder of parties; it's not about jurisdiction.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So, that's... it's something different.  It's a... it's a whole other animal, because ""real party in interest"", as used in the Federal rules, is a device... is a joinder device, is in the joinder rules.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In... I don't follow that, because I thought the theory of the cases were that you can waive something by conduct.  And so, when you ask a court for relief against a party, then it's reasonable to say,  ""If you're coming in and asking the court to give you something, then it's only fair that your adversary should be able to-- ""   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Let me ask this--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --If you lose on the abrogation notion, and the Court holds that there is no authority in Congress to abrogate sovereign immunity, still the bankruptcy code codifies what is, across the board, the law.

If the determination of guilt is final, then alibi is irrelevant at the penalty stage.  That's why I found that statute so puzzling, that the jury doesn't have a clue.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, I wasn't suggesting anything other than what Justice Scalia said, but I was just curious about this statute that tells the jury, ""You can consider everything"", and gives them no guidance, because some of it might be quite inappropriate for them to consider.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you say... so now it's essentially redundant.  Now that 1331 has no jurisdictional amount, no amount in controversy, the jurisdictional provision in title VII is just going over the same territory.  It doesn't add or detract.  Is that so?

Would you call 15 or more employees an element of your claim that you must prove?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Or there could be an affirmative defense and you're not claiming the latter.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How does it... you... you told us of your extensive experience.  How does the numerosity requirement usually come up?  You've accepted that it's an element of your claim rather than an affirmative defense the defendant must plead and prove.  So how does it ordinarily come up?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do we have the complaint in--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Did it, in fact, come up in that posture in the case?  It has already been mentioned that the word jurisdiction has many, too many uses.  Did it... did the question come up in the Indian tribe cases as it did here after the case was fully tried and after there was a jury verdict for the plaintiff?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  When... if... if it's brought up promptly, it really doesn't matter, does it, whether you label it 12(b)(1) jurisdiction or 12(b)(6), failure to state a claim?  It goes out either way.  When it is consequential is when you bring it up, as you did here, after you lose on... at the trial.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I go back to Zipes?  In Zipes, the Court was faced with the... the word jurisdictional had been appended to the statute of limitations.  I think that was true of the way the EEOC spoke of the rigid time limit, that it was mandatory and jurisdictional.  And then the Court explained in Zipes that a strict time line doesn't mean that it's jurisdictional.  You can have a rule that's rigid, but it doesn't determine subject matter jurisdiction.  And that's what Zipes tried to explain.  The Court in Zipes was faced with a number of cases that had used that term to describe the time in which you must bring the action, mandatory and jurisdictional.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but now we know it's... EEOC has changed.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But why... now that we do have Zipes, why should the number of employees be treated any differently than that rigid time line in... in Zipes?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that was a pendant jurisdiction case.  Wasn't Aldinger--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, you just used an interesting word because there are litigants who can claim complete immunity from liability, but that immunity, whether it's absolute or qualified, doesn't go to the court's subject matter jurisdiction.  It has to be raised in those cases as a defense.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Or leave it to the States that often do cover smaller shops.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It certainly matters for plaintiffs in this situation.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It certainly matters from the defendant's point of view too.  In many of these cases, it's not clear whether the number 15 has been... as in this case, you have delivery drivers.  You have owners whose wives are employed in the business.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  From the... from the point of view of a defendant who thinks I'm going to fight this case on the merits, but if I lose, I still have this ace up my sleeve.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That sounds like a good reason why a court should think long and hard about categorizing this as a question of subject matter jurisdiction.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, it would be simultaneous.  The jury... the jury would have that question.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They're not totally different, because one of them is special circumstances.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And it distinguishes those from circumstances of the crime, and then it... then it says, ""and special circumstances"".  So, it seems to me that ""special circumstances"" is a discrete factor, different from ""circumstances of the crime"".   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In other words, you said that the error was harmless under Chapman, the higher standard--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --and that the California court so ruled.  And if that ruling is correct, then you would never get to any Brecht standard; the Federal court would have to say California applied the proper harmless error analysis, and that's the end of the case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So the... so the second question, once we get past weighing, is whether California, in fact, did do what Chapman said.  Is that right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the problem--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --here is that the California Supreme Court decision is rather skimpy once you get to harmless error.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What was... the argument was that, in California, the burden of proof is on--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --the defendant, instead of on the prosecutor for the harmless error inquiry?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you agree that such residual doubt factors are appropriately considered if the defendant didn't raise them?

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are you saying... because this can get pretty complex... simply, that because special circumstances are a discreet category, that, in effect, what went... what the court is instructing is double counting that factor?

So it is, in effect, counted twice.  Is that the essence of your argument?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But isn't it the California Supreme Court that has to do the harmless error, in the first instance?  And here, this is puzzling about this case.  Defendant said, at trial, to his lawyer,  ""Don't argue any mitigators. ""  ""I'd just as soon die as spend my life in prison. ""  So, no mitigators were argued.  So then, even if you have a wrong aggravator, you have other aggravators that are right, and there's nothing to weigh against those correct aggregators.  So, what mitigation is there to weigh against the valid aggravators?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, what were those?  I see that sentence.  The jury--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Yes, but what were the mitigating factors from the evidence presented at the guilt phase?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But now you're getting into what has sometimes been called ""residual doubt"".  You point out that a juror asked,  ""What if it were not unanimous? ""  And you also pointed out that there was an earlier hung jury in this case.  But you didn't argue, below, that residual doubt counts.  It's one thing to say,  ""If defendant argues it, the court should take it into account. ""  But there was no such argument made in this case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  At any time.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Russell, I thought that your argument was that yes, you know that you haven't got the promotion, you know you haven't got the transfer, but the spread in the pay is an incremental thing.  You may think the first year you didn't get a raise, ""well, so be it"".  But you have, you have no reason to think that there is going to be this inequality.  I mean she started out getting the same pay, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What happened to the Equal Pay Act claim?  You started out with a Title VII claim and an equal pay claim and somewhere along the way the equal pay claim dropped out.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why didn't you ask for the equal pay claim?  As I understand the magistrate judge he said, yes, you had made it across the first hurdle, you had a prima facie case.  You showed that you're a woman, and you're getting this and all the men are getting much higher.  But the employer has come forward with any other factor other than sex and the other factor is that, your inadequate performance.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because in the Title VII case assuming you're right, that you get across the same threshold, you're faced with the same defense.  Right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It didn't have the same defenses because the Bennett amendment makes the defenses under the Equal Pay Act applicable under Title VII, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where does it say--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I thought your answer before was that this is not... if she's going to bring a case I got a 2 percent raise, he got a 3 percent raise, her chances are very slim, but if this builds up year by year to the point where see is saying, I'm being denied equal pay, it's a requirement of the anti-discrimination law that I get equal pay, so today I'm not getting equal pay, I thought... I mean, the chance that she could win when she gets a salary review and she gets a little less than the other person are nil.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The... as I remember the facts of this case, wasn't it in 1995 that she got a substantial raise and the reason, according to her supervisor, was that he noticed that her pay was below the minimum of the appropriate range for her job?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Not under the Equal Pay Act.  You can only equalize up, not down.   ",05-1074
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why is it different if the one further statement was made.  And the employer knew that every woman is being paid less than every man.  Why isn't that sufficient under Title VII, and if you want evidence, your own supervisor said, oh, we saw one year that she was outside the range appropriate for this job.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Evans involved a factor that simply is not present here.  I mean, Evans involved a seniority system.  And if this person who had been off the job were to come back two years later, and bump people who had been there every day, well, certainly that's a different case than this one, where she is saying, I should have been paid equally.  I wasn't.  And I know I can go back only two years.  That's quite a bit different than the Evans situation.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If only the 180 day period counts, and she can complain only about discrimination in that period, then how do you account for her being able to go back not 180 days, but two years for her remedy?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought it was the lid on the amount of compensation you could get in Title VII cases.  You can't go back more than two years for damages.  But it would seem that doesn't fit at all whether you can go back only 180 days.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why is she claiming that in 1995, a supervisor recognized that my pay was way out of line.  Isn't that what the supervisor testified?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Maybe she thought that, well, they are on the right track.  Next year, they are going to raise me up to the equal pay level.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The question that I asked Mr. Nager that I think is really important, and that is, where do you put these pay cases?  Do you put it in the box with the hostile environment that builds up over time, and as long as the environment is hostile at the time you bring your complaint, then it doesn't matter that it started 20 years ago.  This notion of one year, it's 2 percent, and the other person got 3 percent, you really don't have an effective claim unless it builds up to the point where there is a noticeable disparity.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where is that agreement?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that the Morgan decision quotes Bazemore for saying, under Title VII, each week's paycheck that delivered less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong, actionable under Title VII.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Whatever portion it's in, it says each week's paycheck that delivered less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong, actionable--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --How do you describe dealing with a case like Manhart where they were complaining about a pension plan that had been instituted, oh, way longer than 180 days, years and years before?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This would be a good Equal Pay Act case, wouldn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why doesn't it become intentional, at least after 1995, when the supervisor recognizes that he's got an employee that is out of the appropriate range for her job, whether she does it badly or well?     INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why would she bring it then?  They gave her a big raise that year.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Didn't she have every reason to expect, well, they finally noticed it, so next year I'm going to get that same size raise, but that it doesn't happen the next year?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  She is not talking about a decision made 15 or 14 in this case.  She starts out even, and it builds up over time.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you're talking about--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But that's a defense.  And you're talking about, yes, you might draw that inference but that inference would be wrong because I have a defense.  The defense is poor performance explains it, not sex discrimination.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought at least in this area, the defenses were the same as under the Equal Pay Act.     Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So why don't we at least hear from the EEOC?

You say you meet the plus factor because they were acting against their self-interest, that a self-interested player in this league would have gone into the other's territory, and I'm questioning that by saying that they might have seen this whole area as not the best place to invest their money.     J. Douglas Richards  We'd... we would ask for production of documents reflecting their thinking process about entering into one another's territories.  And that would be very enlightening.

Maybe they want to get into the wireless business and think that's a better way to spend their money.     INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Richards, didn't the Second Circuit say you don't need a plus factor?  They said if you did, we think that the plaintiffs could show it, but the second sentence is you don't need a plus factor.

It's quite specific that there was an accident and that defendant, defendant of a certain name at a certain time and place negligently drove.  What it doesn't tell you is the details of the, of what was negligent, but it certainly is specific in time and place and person, which is one of the... one of the concerns, I mean, if you strip away everything, it seems that you have a suspicion that there may have been a conspiracy and you want to use a discovery process to find out whether or not that's true.

Paul D. Clement  --That's right, Justice Ginsburg, and--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What happens when it goes back?   Paul D. Clement  --Well, I think this Court could do one of two things.  I mean, the Petitioners for their part have pointed to in footnote 6 of the blue briefs, to a variety of Second Circuit precedents about the standards for repleading.  Perhaps the easiest course for this Court would be to just vacate and let the Second Circuit apply its own law of repleading.  That would be one option.  The other option would be--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But why, if this is a sprawling complaint and if the problem is that it says too much or too vaguely?  A district court doesn't have to leave the pleader to its own devices.  It can have a pretrial conference and say, now let's get this whole thing in order, and it's not that the pleader is left alone to do what he or she will.  But in complex cases like this, the district judge will often assert control from the beginning and not leave the parties to do what they want.   Paul D. Clement  --We would have no objection to that, Justice Ginsburg.  And I would say, you know, you might say that, particularly based on the guidance this Court gives in this case and the guidance this Court gives perhaps in the Twombley case, that it might be fair to let the plaintiffs have a crack at making a new complaint in this area.  Oh the other hand, as I say, we would have no objection to just allowing the Second Circuit to sort it out based on Second Circuit pleading law.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's the--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --You don't think that would confuse the jury if they are first told that they may consider the extent of harm suffered by others, and then the next instruction seems to say they can't?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where did the Oregon Supreme Court say it was proper to punish for harm to nonparties?  Your brief quotes something to that effect, but... the sentence on page 18(a) of the appendix to the petition.  It says, what the Oregon court said is, Philip Morris asserts that Campbell prohibits the State acting through a civil jury from using punitive damages to punish a defendant for harm to nonparties.  The Oregon Supreme Court on its own, I think, didn't put it in terms of harming particular nonparties, but to exposing Oregon residents to the risk of a deadly disease.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But Mr. Frey, we don't know what Oregon law is on that point.  They do have a law that the Oregon court thought meant that they must adjust in the next case.  And how would you deal... would it be different if Oregon, as many States, said part of that punitive award goes not to the plaintiff, but to some State fund?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if the law in Oregon were, plaintiff number two, you don't get punitive damages or you can get only the difference between what the jury awarded you and what Philip Morris has already paid out in punitive damages?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  We don't know what it is.  We haven't had the second case.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That is... this is certainly not your revenue officer needing help from a citizen or the Federal agent going to close down a still during Prohibition.  But what about the Government contractor cases that are cited, the Agent Orange was one example?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the prison case, there's not any if about it.  A State, municipality, has a contract with a private entrepreneur to run a prison.  One question that I think must have come up in that context comes under the 1983 action in... against a, a prison guard, a privately hired prison guard.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I don't follow that.  The Government is always altering people's conduct when it regulates them.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Has it been done?  I mean, this is... I don't recall any case like this.  Are there other product liability cases that are removed from State court to Federal Court on a similar basis?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Gornstein, was there any Government litigation against the cigarette companies?   Irving L. Gornstein  There has been Government litigation against the cigarette companies for allegations that are very similar to the complaint in this case except that it is being brought under the RICO statute.  That litigation is pending in the D.C. Circuit and the basic allegation, one of the allegations of the complaint, is that the cigarette companies have falsely marketed their products as being lest dangerous than other products when, in fact, they are not.  Now, the final point to be made is, even if there was a delegation of authority here, it would not affect the disposition of this case because this complaint does not challenge the testing itself.  What this complaint says is that these... that the Respondent here engaged in deceptive advertising by essentially designing cigarettes that would cheat the test and then marketing the cigarettes as light when in fact they are not.  If the Court has no further questions--   ",05-1284
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Again, you're talking about an agency that has set certain standards that the entity its regulating must meet.  They must meet all kinds of requirements for certain kinds of tests by OSHA, say, for example.  Think of pesticides, think of hazardous substance... quite precise tests that the Government says you must make this test before you market that dangerous product.  I don't see how cigarettes are any different from hazardous wastes, pesticides, just the vast number of potentially dangerous to health products that are marketed and the Government says: We're not going to let you put those things out on the market unless you go through a certain testing regimen.  That doesn't make the party an agent of the Government for the testing purposes.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there must be many times when an agency prescribes a test that a regulated party must comply with.  It's still a relationship of a regulator, the FTC, sets standards that the regulated party has to meet.  I just don't see... it could be called FTC test> [""], but it's a test for what?  Are you complying with the law when you're manufacturing and marketing this product?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that, Mr. Olson, that the cigarette companies wanted to make a light brand so that they could keep customers who might be tempted to quit if there was only the heavy kind.  But to say that, the light cigarettes were forced on the cigarette companies by the FTC certainly--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, any product that the Government supervises, certainly the Government would want to promote a safer... I mean, think of a jet ski.  Think of... products are marketed because people want them, and off course the Government as supervisor will want to encourage a safer product.  But let me ask you a different question, Mr. Olson.  The removal area has been really closely guarded by Congress.  You know it's not easy to get a case out of State court and move it to the Federal court.  In fact, Congress has said if the Federal court shifts it back, no matter how wrong a that decision was, it stays in the State court.  One can't remove... you may have a wonderful Federal defense, a preemption defense.  You can't remove on that basis.  You may have a counterclaim, so you're really the same as a plaintiff.  You can't remove on the basis of a counterclaim.  Well, Congress has been so careful to let the State courts do State tort litigation.  Then we are supposed to read into a Federal officer removal statute, that kind of, the removal of a State tort case from State court to Federal court?  Because that's quite the fashion.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well there's one different.  If you're doing it for the Government, the Government says we want Agent Orange; we know it's a very dangerous substance.  So they give you an order; we're going to make very precise specifications.  But you're doing it for us.  We, the Government, want that, and so we are going to put tight controls on your manufacturing it for us.  A little was different from a commercial company going out to sell market goods to the public at large?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the company is doing it so it can stay in business and market this product, not as a service to the U.S. Government.   ",05-1284

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Strain--  --Mr. Strain, you... you mentioned--  --in... in your brief, you seem to put considerable stress on something that I haven't heard you say one word about so far, and that is that these... workers' compensation is State mandated.  They're not negotiated or even employer determined benefits.  They are whatever the law prescribes.  And you haven't... haven't mentioned that, so I'm wondering where that fits into your picture.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Verrilli, there's no employer or employee, for that matter, who's doing the planning.  The planning is all done by the Government--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --because what's covered is prescribed by law.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the it is not negotiable.  We think of a health plan, a retirement plan.  That doesn't have to be any set coverage.  It's negotiated or the employer, if it's not a collective bargaining situation, determines what the benefits will be.  Here, the law determines what the benefits will be.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there's one feature of this that is... does make it different, at least one, and that is this is a benefit to the employer in the way that the others are not.  The employer... there's a tradeoff in workers' compensation.  It's not just I'm going to pay benefits when the person is injured, but I'm going to get off the hook for the tort liability that I might otherwise have.

On... on a question of the statutory history, correct me if I'm wrong, but originally, 1934, the kind of claim that you have would be a seventh priority claim.  And then in '38, Congress said no priority at all covering workers' compensation.  And then when Congress restored a priority, it ratcheted it up to four or five, depending upon which version of the statute we use.  Is there any explanation why, when Congress originally assigned first a very low priority and then no priority, suddenly it gets up to be on a par with the fringe benefits?   ",05-128X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If the national bank set up its mortgage operations as a division or as a department, then the sole regulator would be OCC, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But let's... there are two different kinds of regulations.  I think Justice Kennedy was talking about regulations of a chartering State.  This subsidiary was set up under the law of a State.  It wasn't Michigan.  Is there... is anyone contesting that... was it North Carolina?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --that they have to meet all the requirements for setting up a corporation and having meetings and all that that North Carolina requires of corporations that are incorporated in that State?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Blanchard, may I ask you a question, perhaps preliminary to what you are launching into?  My understanding was that you did not question the OCC's regulatory authority over a unit that it says can do what the national bank itself could do in the real estate business, no more, no less.  OCC regulation, visitation, all the rest, OCC's regulations validly applied to this subsidiary that has been set up in North Carolina and is operating in Michigan; is that right?  It is one thing for you to say we have the authority to regulate.  Are you saying at the same time that OCC is out of the picture because its dual regulation conflicts with the inevitable?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ah, you're saying, you started to say they can't have their cake and eat it too, but you're saying they can have the worst of all possible regulatory worlds, so that they've got two equally competent regulators, and they have to meet the requirements of both?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You do have... one thing that seems concrete and clear to me... correct me if I get this wrong... Michigan is kind of deferring to OCC in its primary jurisdiction sense.  It says customers, if you've got complaints about what this operating subsidiary is doing, you go first to the OCC; and then if we think... we, Michigan... thinks OCC has not given you an adequate response to your complaint, we take over.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it's kind of a reverse supremacy.  Where it's usually the feds that have the last word, but here you're saying Michigan has decided that it will let OCC go first and Michigan will be kind of a supervisor for the adequacy of the OCC's handling of the consumer's complaint?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you know another arrangement where the Federal agency goes first but then the state agency has authority to say Federal agency, you didn't deal with this consumer adequately, so we will take over?  I know schemes that work the other way where the state goes first, and then the Federal authority, but do you know another one?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where the primary adjudicator, decision-maker would be the Federal authority, but then the state can override that if it thinks the Federal authority hasn't done an adequate job?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't the action an inadequate action?  Michigan is saying yeah, the Federal authority can do with respect to this unit just what it would do to a national bank itself, but if we think that is inadequate, that is a question of just one act or the other, but if the... it is the state judging the--  adequacy of a particular Federal response.

The trust deposited the money in the bank, and then the Government levied on it, as distinguished from Williams, where Mrs. Williams, in fact, wrote a check to the Internal Revenue Service covering her husband's tax liability.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the whole case was about whether she indeed qualified as a taxpayer, having voluntarily paid the tax.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  It was an involuntary act, whereas in Williams, she stepped forward and paid the tax and claimed on that basis that she was the taxpayer.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you just... you just pointed to situations where one to expect action to be taken promptly.  You don't want to wait to, to get an injunction against a levy because the Government might be there and levy on the property and then you're out of luck.  Where the incompatibility exists is post deprivation, when the nine-month, the interest in having these claims resolved properly is totally defeated if you can get the longer statute of limitations under the general refund statute.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's why the code has that nine-month period instead of the two-year or in fact four-years because you have to go to the administrative process first.  The whole purpose of the nine-months is to get people to act quickly.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the Government... and the opinion points out that if she had gone the quiet title route she would have lost the advantageous... she would have had to make.  She could never complete a quiet title suit within the time that she needed to execute this sale.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the, and the opinion suggests... not merely suggests, determines... that those other remedies, unlike 7426 in cases where it applies, were ineffective.  The Government raised other remedies and the Court said they were ineffective.   ",05-1541

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  On which... on what you were arguing, you were very careful in your brief to say funds lawfully possessed by the union, as distinguished from what's in a corporate treasury or... there is something peculiar about this, and you recognized it by saying we possess them, because if the non-member wants it back, the non-member would be entitled.  So it's not like money in the corporate till.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is this all hypothetical, Mr. West, or is there any empirical evidence about what the people who are non-union members, if they had their druthers, would they say not a penny more goes into the union till than we are forced to put there?

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Himmelfarb, does the government urge that we consider the point that you're now arguing and the other points?  You started out by saying everyone agrees that the rationale of the Ninth Circuit won't wash, but if we go beyond that, then we are deciding the question as a matter of first view instead of review.  Does the government urge that we dispose of those issues anyway, even though they were not disposed of by the Ninth Circuit?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it wasn't discussed by the Ninth Circuit, was it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why would it have to be raised in the Ninth Circuit?  I thought this case was controlled by a prior decision of the Ninth Circuit.  Therefore, there was nothing more that was needed to take care of this case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How do we know that?  I was looking at, what is it, 13-A?  How do we know that that charge is as a principal?  In the appendix to the petition.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Even though that position has been widely criticized, I think.  Is it the ALI Model Penal Code, which thinks it's a bad rule?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Himmelfarb, before your time runs out, there's something curious about this California statute.  This one is in the Motor Vehicle Code, and there's this offense in the Penal Code called car theft.  Do you know what the difference between those two and what would move a prosecutor to charge under the Penal Code as opposed to the Vehicle Code?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's mentioned in what, 487(d)?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It covers joyriding?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Temporarily.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Meade, the Government says that definition holds for penal code offenses, but it's not altogether clear that a definition in the penal code would carry over to the vehicle code.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well how about how... how the defendant was charged in this very case?  Mr. Himelfarb thought that it was plain from that charge, that's on 13(a), that he was charged as a principal.  And you must take the view that this charge, this information was inadequate to identify him as principal.   ",05-1629
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can you go back and because the... the parties seem to have different views about it?  I think you said it was required by OPM to have this reimbursement term, and the other side said that there was no requirement from the Government agency that you include the reimbursement term.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that... all that says is that OPM looked at these terms and it thought they were okay.  It's not... it doesn't show that OPM required these... this as a condition for Empire to serve as the insurer.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there's nothing in the statute that speaks about a Federal forum.  And if you look at this entire picture, you're seeking reimbursement, and you're seeking reimbursement based on a tort recovery.  And why wouldn't the most sensible, the most natural thing for a legislature, if they thought about it, be to say, well, that claim for reimbursement ought to come in on the coattails of the tort claim?  You don't need to make a whole separate Federal case out... out of it.  Why would Congress want these claims to be subject to a separate Federal case?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, it's because there's an anterior lawsuit and everything rides on that State court suit.  There wouldn't be any recovery from which you could claim reimbursement were it not for that State court lawsuit.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you don't have any such problem here.  There's no conflict between the New York law... you certainly could have gone into that lawsuit and--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I could see if this were... what we were talking about everything is... the insurance of a Federal employee and questions about coverage, questions about benefits, all of that between the employee and the carrier.  But this comes up because we have a third party who enters the picture in an estate law claim.  So I don't think you can just say, well, everything is... this whole thing is... is all a Federal contract.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that the... the purpose of the preemption provision in this statute was related to benefits and coverage.  Some States have mandatory coverage for this or that.  The case that was mentioned is the chiropractor.  And the... in the Federal scheme, the Federal administrator didn't want to be saddled with whatever the particular packages that the States had.  So the coverage and the benefits... those were to be determined on the Federal level, and you weren't supposed to be saddled with whatever the State thought would be good to have in the plan.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What... you... you might follow along with that perfectly well if you're talking about the beneficiary, the Federal employee, saying I'm entitled to a certain coverage or I'm entitled to certain benefits.  You would expect that suit to be in Federal court.  But why would you expect what piece of the tort recovery the carrier will get to be in Federal court?   ",05-200X

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But let's get the--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --What about the--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --what about the Seventh Circuit case that posed the question of same job, same character of work, except that the employee had flex time, which enabled her to take care of her disabled child when she could leave at 3:00, and she's just changed to... same job except it's got to be 9:00 to 5:00.  Would that fit within your definition?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Even though the jury has made a finding that the only reason that was done was in retaliation for her having filed a complaint.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Right.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you would say that's outside--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --that would be outside 704 if this is done deliberately in retaliation for filing a complaint.

But--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --So you're changing your answer.  You originally told me that, no, that that wouldn't fit because it's the same job.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it didn't--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --it didn't cure.  I mean, it was 37 days, right, that she went without pay?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Not just 2 weeks.  And she understandably experienced much stress in that time.  She worried about how she would be able to feed her children, could she get them Christmas presents.  That was... there was nothing that she got, when it was determined that she hadn't been insubordinate, that compensated her for that stress and, indeed, for the medical expense that she incurred because she had that stress.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But when... when somebody is suspended, it seems to me that is as tangible as it can get.  It gets registered officially.  This person is suspended, and if she doesn't do something about it, she's out.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --official action is... is different from... the problem with Ellerth was that if there's nothing formally that had been done, the employer... this...

The problem in GreatWest was the money had already been dissipated.  It had been set aside.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you... do you not think that Congress had in mind no compensatory damages, no punitive damages?  Do you really think that Congress had in mind the distinction that you are now drawing in the ring case based on 15th and 16th century English precedent?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but GreatWest also said money.  It said money, identified as belonging in good conscience to the plan.  And why doesn't it belong in good conscience to the plan when the beneficiary has promised that, if it gets a tort recovery, it will reimburse the plan?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr.--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --General Clement, that's not what this case is about, because I think you have recognized, quite appropriately, that we're not talking about whether any fetus will be preserved by this legislation.  The only question that you are raising is whether Congress can ban a certain method of performing an abortion.  So anything about infanticide, babies, all that, is just beside the point because what this bans is a method of abortion.

Judge Easterbrook when he said, the decision for the Federal court is only two things.  It's either remand or dismiss the action.  That is, the Federal court under no circumstances will keep this case for trial.  Either it will dismiss it outright or it will remand.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but that was not... certainly not the Seventh Circuit's understanding.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Frederick, as I understand it, at least the Seventh Circuit's fix on this case was that the Federal courts have adjudicatory authority to do one thing and to do that one thing finally, that is, to decide whether this is a case that cannot be brought in any court or whether it's a case that Congress has left over for the States still to deal with.

You said that our complaint isn't about fraud.  It isn't about deception.  It's about negligence.  But the Seventh Circuit reported and seemed to have no doubt about it that the complaints in this set of cases were based on allegations of deceit and manipulation, not mismanagement.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The... the Seventh Circuit said precisely, in particular, they did not argue in their briefs and did not maintain at oral argument, despite the court's invitation that their suits allege mismanagement rather than deceit or manipulation.  So is that totally wrong, that you did do it... mention it in your briefs?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then how could the Seventh Circuit have gotten it that wrong?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Of course, if the Federal district court says there is preclusion, therefore, case dismissed, that would be reviewable.   ",05-409X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But they can always amend the complaint and pare it down and say now... we... we complained all along about negligence.  Now, Judge, we are complaining about mismanagement on the defendants' part, nothing more.  No manipulation.  Cut out... they could have such a complaint, and would that be precluded if... if they started afresh in the State court and they said, we are complaining about mismanagement?  We're not charging anyone with fraud or deception.  Couldn't... isn't that a viable claim?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then, Mr. Perry, there's a whole case.  See, what's peculiar about this is Congress says it's not really preemption.  I think Justice Stevens pointed that out in Dabit.  It is preclusion.  It says this action shall not exist.  Period.  Not as a State claim, not as a Federal claim.  And it wanted the Federal courts to monitor that determination.  It surely didn't want... if... if the State claim is outside that preclusion, didn't want the Federal courts to sit and have a whole trial on what is a non diverse, no Federal question case.  I mean, it just seems... if you're going to imagine what Congress wouldn't want in the Federal courts, that would be it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But now there you must admit that you are departing from Judge Easterbrook because Judge Easterbrook said this statute gives the Federal court adjudicatory authority to do one thing, to decide whether there's preemption or preclusion or, if not, then to remand.  So they make... they make one determination and bow out he said.  And you're telling us, no, they don't bow out.  They can, if they want to, keep the State law claim and adjudicate it on the merits.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  I'm simply asking about the Seventh Circuit's understanding of the case.  It says, after making the decision that 77p(b) requires, the district court has nothing else to do.  Dismissal and remand are the only options.  So Judge Easterbrook or the Seventh Circuit clearly did not think that there was any adjudication on the merits of a State law claim to be made.  He said it twice.  One is at 14a of the joint appendix, and the other is 11a.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I don't think that any of those cases are comparable, in that the removed case is going to be tried someplace.  Take a diversity case.  The Federal court has to decide... and it's removed... whether the parties are really diverse.  If it decides that they are really diverse, it keeps the case and it's adjudicated in Federal court.  If it decides they're not, the case is adjudicated in the State court.  But here, the determination is, is there a claim to be tried anyplace?  And if there is preclusion under SLUSA, then it's not a question of, as Judge Easterbrook put a menu, where is... it's not a where question.  It's a whether question.  And so that makes... makes SLUSA quite different from other cases where the... the case is going to be tried someplace.  Here, the decision to be made is, is this going to be tried or not?  Is it... is it a claim or is not a claim?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but... but there is also exceptions to the rule of claim and issue preclusion, and when you don't have an opportunity to appeal because the system doesn't let you appeal, then you can say, Judge, don't give this preclusive effect.  I did not have that full and fair opportunity because I was unable to appeal.  And I think that that's solid preclusion law.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But in any case, you said Easterbrook made only one mistake.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But he made another one when he said, it's now or never for appellate review.  That preclusion question could come to this Court if it went... the case went back and the Nassau County said, well, I'm going to follow the Federal court, I'm not going to... at the end of the road, the preclusion question would be open for this Court to review.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's now or never.  The question is not can you... is there an appeal or does 1447(d) bar it.  The question is whether an action under State law is preempted.  And suppose this case had gone along in the Federal... in the State court, and the defense of preclusion is made in the State court.  The State court could certainly decide that question.  Nobody removed it.  So the State court has competence to decide that question, doesn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And in... this Court could decide it on review.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Was that a case where there was no possibility of reviewing the decision of the court of first instance?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And why--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --You're... you're positing a... a State court that's going to, by golly, give that Federal decision preclusive effect even though, say, the Restatement of Judgments says... now if a decision didn't... if there was no opportunity for review, then that's a ground for refusing preclusive effect.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How do you answer the argument, the third argument, that Mr. Frederick stressed that is, that Congress provided specifically in the Class Action Fairness Act, a couple of other acts, and 1447 itself with respect to civil rights actions removable under 1443?  In all those cases, it provided specifically for review of remand decisions, and here the silence is deafening.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I don't know what... what Congress' knowledge about.

It would bring the nonproliferation... it would bring the standard for the nonproliferation program in line with the new source performance standard.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, since the government is now taking the position that another Duke could do just what was done here and there's an enforcement action pending, would you, if you prevailed in that enforcement action, nonetheless enforce, though it's those against the current government policy?

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --talking that... where are these statements?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But Thermtron was such a far cry from this case.  In Thermtron the district judge said yes, I have jurisdiction but I'm just too busy, so I'm going to toss this case back to the State court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I don't think the court said in Thermtron, so therefore, I have no subject matter jurisdiction.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why?  Why was it wrong when with respect to the sovereign parties, the district court said I have... these people are totally immune from suit; therefore, I have no jurisdiction over them.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did you request... when the question of Powerex... authority over Powerex was before the district court, did you request that the district court give you a 1292(b) order before the court remanded the case, so that you could have gotten the case... the question up on appeal?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because that would have taken care of it if the district judge agreed to delay the remand to allow this question of law to be determined by the court of appeals.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did anybody in this case... did any of the Defendants in this case request a trial by jury?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And have they asked for it?  Has any party asked for a jury trial?  If not, that part of the case seems academic.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The case is settled?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that's different than it is in the Federal courts.  You have to... can't wait to the eve of trial to demand a jury.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Osborn made it very clear that was an extraordinary case where Congress had explicitly ordered two conflicting things.  One, it said no remand of a case of this type, and then it said no review of remands.  So the Court was as clear as it could be that only when you have those conflicting signals does that court... does that case have any application.     Your Honor is absolutely correct.  Osborn concerned a particular kind of categorical exception from 1447(c).  Our argument is that as a categorical matter, the basis of remand in this case was not one within the scope of 1447(c).  That although the District Court termed the sovereign immunity of the defendant's jurisdictional, it was not jurisdictional in the relevant sense.  And this Court held precisely that in the Oliver American trading case.  There, a case removed by Mexico was dismissed by the district court on the basis of its immunity and the district court certified that holding as a jurisdictional decision immediately appealable to this Court.  Yet this Court looked beyond that label attached by the district court and held that sovereign immunity is not jurisdictional in the relevant sense because it does not limit the authority of the Federal courts qua Federal courts but rather is a general rule that would preclude suit in State court as well.  Likewise, under 1447(c) it is not a basis to remand that the defendant is immune.  When Congress authorized sovereign defendants to remove cases to Federal court to vindicate their immunity, it did not intend that when the district court upheld that immunity, it would be remanded to State court which would be free to disregard the Federal court's decision.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Under the... under the district court's view, would there have been original jurisdiction against Powerex?     --No, it would not have.  But that's because of the peculiarities of the difference between original jurisdiction under the FSIA, section 1330(a), and removal jurisdiction under the FSIA.  Whereas original jurisdiction depends upon a conclusion that the defendant is not immune, Congress conferred removal jurisdiction whenever a foreign sovereign is defended.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, we don't know--   ",05-85XX
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The immunity question, the immunity question is the same in State or Federal court, because the statute as it's written, any foreign sovereign, China, whatever, is as immune from State court jurisdiction as it is from Federal court jurisdiction because Congress said so.  But with respect to the commercial enterprise, Congress said, we're going to give you a Federal court and we're going to give you a judge trial.  That doesn't apply to State courts.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There was a sovereign party who said: I'm out of this; I have suit immunity.  And that was the B.C.--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --What happened to B.C. Hydro?  Because as I understand the district court sent that party back, too.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but it couldn't... if you are right, then the Ninth Circuit never should have touched this case.  So what happens to the three parties, two U.S. parties, one British Columbia, who are entitled to suit immunity?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Immunity, suit immunity, is you can't be sued anyplace, not in State court, not in Federal court; you can't be sued, period.  But now it is admitted that you can be sued.  That's not in dispute in this case, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So the only question is where.

I think that that's the question that Justice Kennedy is asking you, and I don't get a clear answer.  You say you can't use a racial means.  But can you have a racial objective?  That is, you want to achieve balance in the schools.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you have to agree that those cases left someone out of the picture entirely so we were talking about a selection of one person or another?  The word ""sorting"" has been used in this context because everybody gets to go to school.  Indeed, they are required to go to school.  So no one gets left out of the system, and I think there have been Court of Appeals judges who have noted.  We have never had that case before, it's not like the affirmative action cases.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Korrell, before your time runs out, I did want to clarify something about the standing of the plaintiffs here.  Do I understand correctly that none of the parents who originally brought this lawsuit have children who are now preninth grade, but that newcomers, people who recently joined, do have children of preninth grade age?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you don't dispute that membership, for standing purposes, the membership is what counts, not the association but the members?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, if it is a member, jurisdictional questions generally, don't we go by what the membership was when the complaint was filed and not what it has become in the course of the litigation?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but the transaction case situation is different.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose it was faculty, and the school district makes a deliberate effort to have members of the white race and members of other races represented in... on the faculty of every school, so you won't have one school with all white teachers, so that you'll have a mix, and that's quite explicit.  That's their objective and they're using a racial criterion to get there.  Would that be impermissible, to have a mix of teachers in all the schools?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, what would be okay?  How would you get there other than having... the point I'm trying to make has been made by others.  Let me read from Judge Boudin's decision.  He says  ""The choice is between openly using race as a criterion or concealing it through some clumsy or proxy device. ""  If you want to have an integrated school and you site the schools deliberately to achieve that objective, it's very hard for me to see how you can have a racial objective but a nonracial means to get there.

What is your response to that?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You're saying that individual treatment makes no sense in terms of the objective here.  I thought that's what you were saying.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the question of integration, whether there was any use of a racial criterion, whether integration, using racial integration is the same as segregation, it seems to me is pretty far from the kind of headlines that attended the Brown decision.  They were, at last, white and black children together on the same school bench.  That seems to be worlds apart from saying we'll separate them.   ",05-908X

And one of the... one of the points made by the other side is that there is an express provision for proceeding without counsel at the administrative level, and there's no provision for proceeding without counsel in court.  So doesn't that suggest that the right to proceed pro se is limited to the administrative process?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then you would be establishing a right for the least needy.  I mean, if they're seeking reimbursement, they're able to pay the private school tuition.  It's the people who can't... who have no alternative, they have to take what the school district gives them because they don't have the wherewithal to enroll their child in a private school.  And your argument, concentrating on the reimbursement right, would leave out those people, would it not?

He didn't incur additional debts between the time of the proceeding one and proceeding two?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Or he didn't reduce the debt.  If we have a finding from the bankruptcy court that he is ineligible, that is number one condition to convert into Chapter 13.  If you don't meet that condition, that's the end of the matter.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But now there has been a finding, and it's an essential finding, that there be eligibility.  And wouldn't the bankruptcy court's findings in the later case have preclusive effect?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's a question you can argue on appeal in... from the recent decisions, but for the moment you have a bankruptcy court making that determination, which I think would be preclusive on another bankruptcy court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If the decision is affirmed on appeal to the First Circuit, do you think you could still argue that there's qualification for Chapter 13, after the court of appeals has affirmed a determination that there isn't?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  We have now a judgment that this debtor is ineligible for Chapter 13.  If that judgment is affirmed on appeal to the court of appeals, can you nonetheless argue that somehow there is no preclusive effect?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What is the status of the Chapter 7 case?  I was under the impression it had been dismissed and a determination of no discharge had been made.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there's a determination that you're not entitled to a discharge?  That has been made.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Baker, couldn't the... let's say the conversion goes through.  The first thing that the bankruptcy court does in the Chapter 7 converted to Chapter 13 is say: I'm going to dismiss this suit, the... the bad faith taint stays with the case, it doesn't get... you can't erase it; and so back you go to the Chapter 7.  Why couldn't the bankruptcy court now sitting as a Chapter 13 court say: We're not going to let a debtor who has conducted himself in bad faith proceed in this court?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But here there was a hearing on the motion to convert, right?  There was a hearing?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And as I understand it, there was no objection to the character of that hearing?  There was no request for an evidentiary hearing?  So there was a hearing.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It is hard to see this... that, just in the sense of laundering, nothing is being concealed.  They're not... the money that's being paid to the runners and the collectors, it is an ordinary and necessary expense of the illegal business.  So I think Justice Scalia was emphasizing that this is, for the very same conduct two discrete statutes, one with much heavier penalties.  That makes it odd, too, that the basic gambling statute has a lower penalty than this money laundering statute, and yet it's the same conduct that's violating both.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the qualification that Judge Easterbrook made when he said, at least where the crime is a business-like operation?  He gave the example of gambling, he gave the example of selling contraband.  And it seems to me that he was narrowing his definition of proceeds to cases where the crime is not robbery or a one-time event, but a business-like operation.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Wouldn't it be--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Roberts, the Seventh Circuit in this case was following a precedent in another case and it thought that the defendant would prevail under its theory.  If this Court should say that that theory, that it's profits and not proceeds that matter, wouldn't it be appropriate for us, if we don't decide the question ourselves, to remand and say, Seventh Circuit, your precedent was wrong; but you could consider a question that was not necessary for you to reach because you had your precedent on the profits issue?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Robert, may I go back to something you said about... of the options that Justice Breyer mentioned.  You said the way to handle it is in sentencing.  Santos was sentenced to 60 months on the gambling counts and 210 months on the laundering.  You said the statute has been changed.  So what would be the sentence under the statute as it now exists?  And this is vastly disproportionate.  60 months for gambling, and 210 for money laundering.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1005

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you know any case, Mr. Castanias, where there has been a forum non conveniens dismissal in favor of a foreign forum where the plaintiff has then attempted to go into a different--  U.S. court to get a different resolution?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Either one.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You... you were urging that this is a threshold issue and it has nothing to do with the merits; but there is an argument that the existence of personal jurisdiction or not might have some bearing on the forum non conveniens evaluation.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Uh-huh.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  One question that doesn't even have to do with the issue before us.  I'm curious about why we're speaking of fora, judicial fora, there was in this picture an agreement to arbitrate.  What happened to that?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There was an agreement to arbitrate.  And we're talking about a suit brought by one party in the United States, by the other party in China, and no arbitration occurred apparently, although I thought the contract called for it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Thank you.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the Gulf Oil case does say that a forum non conveniens dismissal presupposes that the forum is one in which there's personal jurisdiction and one of proper venue.  It's just another forum is more appropriate.     That's, that's right, Your Honor.  And the Court said so in the course of rejecting an argument that because it was conceded that jurisdiction and venue were proper in the Southern District of New York, that the doctrine of forum non conveniens could not apply.  The Court said that couldn't be so, because the doctrine of forum non conveniens presupposes the availability of two fora.  But the Court did not address the entirely separate question of whether the Court could assume that even I it had jurisdiction, it would not exercise it.  And--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, because your time is running out, there is a question about a court without personal jurisdiction dismissing on forum non conveniens ground, and that is, it's common, as you know, to condition forum non conveniens dismissals on the defendant's undertaking that the defendant will not raise the statute of limitations and other conditions.  If the Court has no personal jurisdiction over the defendant, it would be unable to impose such conditions; isn't that so?     Our understanding of a conditional dismissal in this circumstance is that the dismissing court is explaining its understanding of the world, and that... and facts as they bear upon its analysis, such as is the defendant subject to jurisdiction in a foreign forum.  Oftentimes, the plaintiff... if I could answer... oftentime the plaintiff objects to dismissal because they can't sue the defendant in the foreign forum.  The defendant agrees to waive any objection to jurisdiction.  That understanding of fact is a condition of the dismissal.  If it later proves to be untrue because the defendant objects to jurisdiction of the foreign court, it would be open to the plaintiff to seek to reopen the first suit on that ground.  Thank you very much.   ",06-102X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There couldn't be any question about the alternate forum taking jurisdiction here, because it, in fact, had.  A proceeding was ongoing in China.  So you brought up the question about the Court gives up... if the Court dismisses on forum non conveniens and then the supposedly more convenient forum doesn't take the case.  But that can't be a factor in this case, where the other forum was in China and was indeed litigating the case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm sorry.  I'm not following you, so please straighten me out.  I thought that the claim was that a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Your claim was that a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court in connection with the arrest of this vessel and the ensuing proceedings?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Now, why in the world should a court in the United States get involved in determining whether a fraud was committed on a Chinese court?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  American law to determine whether a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court?  It seems just stating it that it might be offensive to the Chinese court to have another court determine whether it had been defrauded.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that was a very polite way of the Chinese court saying: We don't care what the United States court is doing; we've got this case, we've got the ship, and we're going to adjudicate it; and it doesn't matter.  We don't have to say anything to the United States to chastise it for even thinking it could become involved in this matter.  It was polite.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why would a defendant that has moved to dismiss for forum non conveniens waive jurisdiction?  It seems to me that there is something in this picture that is to your advantage and that is if you can get the Court to say, well, we have to do personal jurisdiction first, you ask for discovery on that issue and it goes out on forum non conveniens without deciding personal jurisdiction, you are not going to get that discovery.

But the Age Discrimination Act doesn't apply to younger workers.  It doesn't say that you can't discriminate on the basis of age, so you can't prefer the older person over the younger person.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There is one little piece of it that seems, that clearly does favor the younger retiree.

She is going to get a very low disability.  And you say that's one thing that's all right.  On a prospective basis, what could Kentucky do?  One is give the younger workers only their actual years of service, which Mr. Klausner said is what is happening, and therefore, these people are getting a lot less than they used to get.  And then you say, oh, but there's another way, and that is to impute additional years of service on an age-neutral basis.  And you're not specific about what would the age-neutral basis be.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think in Contracts it was used as an example of a so-called built-in statute of limitations, one that is thought to bar the right as well as the remedy.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It said determining when and under what conditions Federal courts can hear cases falls within the court's adjudicatory authority -- or that are within the adjudicatory authority are jurisdictional, when and under what conditions Federal courts hear cases. That would be very broad, but it did say that.  Could not interfere with the plain-text reading of 2501 once you assume --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then there would be a built-in limitation, and usually that's not considered jurisdictional. It would be under the heading of failure to state a claim; that is, your claim has been extinguished, so you have no claim to state, as opposed to the ordinary operation of the statute of limitations which bars only the remedy, not the right.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Bowles said that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Bowles said if it's equitably tolled, it's not jurisdictional. If it -- a provision that is jurisdictional cannot be equitably tolled.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  One member of the court did think that Irvin -- Irwin overruled Soriano, but only one member.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is it just Irwin or a whole line of cases? There was a time when the jurisdictional label was used rather frequently. There is a more recent case that says ""jurisdiction"" is a word of many meanings, too many meanings. And I think the Court has been trying to cut down on the too many meanings.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It did say statutory time limits -- this is Irwin -- applicable to lawsuits -- well, the sentence about the suits: The rule of equitable tolling applicable to suits against the government. It says the rule that was announced is applicable to the government, the same as with respect to private parties.  So it's hard to think of what territory Irwin would cover if it doesn't -- because in all suits, at least for money against the government, there has to be a waiver of sovereign immunity.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Even if -- even if you're right, couldn't the Federal Circuit say: Well, that's all very interesting but Day v. McDonough told us that if we want to raise it on our own -- we don't have to if it's not jurisdictional; but if we want to, we can.   ",06-1164
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you certainly would be mixing categories terribly if you suggested that something that goes to the court's authority to proceed in the case can be waived if it's equitable to waive it.  I mean, those two notions are at odds with each other.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, what would, what would Irwin and Franconia that made statements -- when it's a question of a time limit, they operate against the government just like they operate against private parties, to what kind of case would that apply? I mean, it's been pointed out that 2501 covers a whole slew of cases, not just takings cases.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about -- what about the rules of the Court of Federal Claims? Rule 8(c) states that the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense. And that's in suits against the Government because that's all the Court of Federal Claims deals with. So to what would that Rule 8(c) apply?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But all those statutes of limitations would be statutes of limitations operating against the government.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would you say that Franconia did use loose language, because although it dealt with accrual -- when does the claim accrue, and not when is it cut off -- but it did say, it called 2501 specifically ""an unexceptional statute of limitations.""   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And if we looked at the Court of Federal Claims decisions now, I think they're spelled out in the opinion. They go both directions.  That is, some say 2501 is jurisdictional, some say it's not.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did Congress think that Rule 8(c) has no range of application? And -- we have two recent statements saying statutes of limitations against the government are like statutes against private parties. But if 2501, which covers all of the cases over which the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction -- if, if it's for jurisdictional, then I don't know what cases there would be in which there's a time limit in a suit against the government that isn't jurisdictional.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But we do know the CFC is at least confused because they have some cases going one way and some cases going the other way. And from the government's point of view, the government can be relied on to raise the statute of limitations, I suppose, but aren't there cases where the government would really like to get the substantive issue settled? So it says, well, the statute of limitations is arguable, but we'll concede that the action was timely.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But, of course, Bowles -- I mean the Court did miss something. Everyone on the Court did, and that is that the period to file your notice of appeal was originally not in any statute. It was in the rule, the FRAP rule. The opinions, both sides, assumed that the statute came first, and the rule was adopted to conform to the statute, but in fact it was just the opposite. It was a rule, a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, which can't affect jurisdiction. We know that. As Congress says rules of procedure don't affect jurisdiction. So there was the rule, and then the U.S. Judicial Conference said to Congress, when it referred the rule to Congress, you might consider a conforming amendment. And then the statute, after the rule came into effect, conformed to the rule. So what the Court, both sides, thought in Bowles -- we just had it in reverse.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, Congress didn't think about it at all until the U.S. Judicial Conference said do this --   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  -- and the U.S. Judicial Conference wasn't thinking that thereby it became jurisdictional.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It was addressed specifically. It was addressed that the rule -- that the -- that all of this was statute driven. But the rule before -- before there was a conforming statute, you would say, well, then it wasn't jurisdictional, right?   ",06-1164
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Waxman, going back to what you just said, isn't a third possibility, the most likely possibility, that this Court would simply hold the petition if there were... if the attorney general filed a cert petition here while the Ninth Circuit had not yet disposed of the case, this Court could have just held it because the Ninth Circuit was likely soon to dispose of it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But isn't it just the case... you've made several arguments, but you have a case that's lodged in the court of appeals.  It's not simply a petition there.  They have accepted it for review.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So in the normal course when you have a district court decision, a trial court decision, then you're on appeal and the case is fully lodged in the court of appeals, it's like the judgment is suspended until the appellate court is done.  So you have no final judgment that is properly taken anyplace else until that judgment is entered.  I think that's the essence of your argument, isn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Perhaps you should go on to the merits.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And on that I have a preliminary question, because we have a new attorney general and the question is whether the new attorney general continues to oppose the legislature and the governor on this bond issue.  Do... in other words, do we still have a case or controversy?   ",06-116X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Brinkmann, Congress sometimes withdraws jurisdictions from courts, but while the case is spending it isn't until the court issues the order... there's no automatic dismissal of the case when Congress passes an act.  There is a case lodged in the court, and that court will follow Congress's directions and dismiss it.  But until it does, its hold final judgment.  The judgment of the Guam Supreme Court is suspended while it's sub judicata before the Ninth Circuit, and then when the Ninth Circuit acts, then there is a trigger.  But until there isn't.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The Ninth Circuit would have been without authority to issue the orders in Santos under your reasoning.  The Ninth Circuit is powerless because the authority had been transferred by virtue of the statute to this Court, so the Ninth Circuit was wrong in any orders it issued.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And then when they decide they didn't have jurisdiction, then it's retroactive?  That's what your position is?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction this whole time.  But the day that it issues its decision dismissing this case, then it is retroactive back to the date that Congress passed the statute?  That's what you seem to be saying.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But those cases really are not on point.  Because there was a vast confusion in the days when there was a three-judge court, do I file a jurisdictional statement, do I file a cert petition?  Sometimes this Court said we'll treat the jurisdictional statement as a cert petition.  But those existed from the beginning.  Here there's a case lodged in the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals had every basis of jurisdiction.  This was no big shakes about it.  It wasn't, did they file the right paper?  And then Congress does something.  And the Court would follow suit.  It just seems to me very strange to say the court has jurisdiction to decide whether it has jurisdiction, but if it decides it doesn't, then the date of that order is not the critical date, but you go back to the date that Congress passed the law.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do they tax on the basis of the--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --This is a fractional, this 35 percent.  In the other places, do they use as--  the... the value taxed 100 percent of the property--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --and then just have a lower tax rate?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did this value issue... I mean, was the borrowing effective given the controversy between, the attorney general refused to sign, did that have any consequences for whether this bond issue went through?   ",06-116X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can we consider that in your case, given that the application to reopen was made when there were only two days left to run for the termination of the voluntary departure time... in other words, it was your delay, not the Government's, that made it impossible to decide this in the requisite time?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why isn't... why isn't it fair to say: You have the short time frame by statute to leave the country if you've left in voluntary departure.  Yet, the Government has provided reopening for all aliens.  Okay.  Why isn't it reasonable to say that, by asking for reopening when you've gotten permission to voluntarily depart within ""x"" days, you are relinquishing your voluntary departure status?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't that a perfect reconciliation of the two?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you raised the question, as I remember, when you put it in the cert petition.  The Government advised against granting on that question and limiting it to the question of having it... having it both ways, keeping your voluntary departure and moving to reopen.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it existed?  You're not saying something that came up later?  What was the ground that the, in this case, that wasn't brought up by the first counsel?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Going back to the question that Justice Alito put to you, that he would then be, and you agree this is what you asked for first, like any other removable alien.  And Justice Alito asked you: Well, then he could be removed immediately, is that not so?  My understanding was, yes, that's so, but you can move for a stay of removal when you have a reopening pending.  Is that true?   INTERRUPTING ",06-1181
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Kneedler, why did the Government advise this Court not to grant cert on question number 1, which was: I want to apply to reopen and simultaneously, I want to withdraw my voluntary departure and be just like any other removable alien, take my chances just like anyone else?  The Government said don't present that... Court, don't consider that question.  Why?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And it seems that this litigant said, number one, I don't want to take advantage of the status of I have to get out, but I can do so voluntarily.  The first thing I want to do is to move to reopen, withdraw my voluntary departure.  And then the second thing was, if I can't do that, please extend my voluntary departure time while I move to reopen.  It seems that this litigant is being put in a bind by not allowing this Court to consider what was the alien's first preference, that is, to withdraw the voluntary departure.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why isn't the solution to withdraw, relinquish the voluntary departure?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  With the provision that he can get a stay.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then because he would then be back... if he stays here after the period is run, then he has relinquished the voluntary departure.  He is like any removable--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But not to stay... but he would not be hanging on to his voluntary departure.  That's gone.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which you say... you say that under the current regime, the voluntary departure application, granted, is irrevocable.  That's--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --The regulations don't say that.  The regulations are just blank.  It doesn't say and if you do this it's irrevocable.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the order didn't say he couldn't withdraw?   ",06-1181
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's been pending how long?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it's from 2004 to 2008?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Rothfeld, will you explain then how it was that the Philippine Government supported the litigation against Marcos that led to the, what was it, the $2 billion judgment?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Said that it had no objection to that suit.  In fact, he thought it was a good thing for the Philippines that that litigation go forward.  But if the government's position is the judgment would be uncollectible because all of those assets belonged to the Philippine Government and not to Marcos's estate, so the... that whole litigation would have been an exercise in futility.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's one other point of Philippine law that's unclear from the briefs.  The Respondents say they have no right to intervene in the proceeding that's going on before the corruption court and your brief suggests that there is a right to intervene.  What is it?  Can they become part of that litigation or will they not be heard by the corruption court?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Seek to intervene, but no right to intervene?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In privity with the estate?  You're suggesting that the plaintiffs would be connected to the Marcos family that wants to get these assets?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  When you say Mr. Kneedler, then you are not agreeing with Mr. Rothfeld, who says it's automatic?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Doesn't that depend on there being a foreign judgment, which we don't have in this case?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't it also a requirement that in that proceeding in the foreign nation that all claimants would have an opportunity to be heard, which is not true here?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there any explanation why the freeze that was imposed by a U.S. court in 1987 was simply allowed to lapse?   INTERRUPTING ",06-1204
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I would like you to address... you seem to put heavy weight on this in rem characterization.  That is a judgment there's a thing.  But our law over the years has come to appreciate that things do not have rights; people have rights in things.  So we have modified the once rigid notion that the suit is against a thing, to recognize that it's people's rights in the thing that count.  And your use of that label seems to forget about all the more recent understanding.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did... did the district court in Hawaii or the Ninth Circuit ever decide what the Petitioners tell us is the basic question, that is do these assets belong to the Philippine Government under that 1955 statute, or do they belong to the Marcos estate?  It seemed to me that our courts were just assuming that the assets belonged to the Marcos estate and that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit were creditors of the Marcos estate.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it didn't say, find, that: And they belong to the Marcos estate and not the Philippine Government.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But isn't that what... that's what sovereign immunity means.  I mean, they do have the right to pick their forum.  You say I can only be sued when I consent, so I can consent where I will.  The problem with what you're presenting is it sounds like, yes, you have sovereign immunity, you don't have to be part of this lawsuit and it can't affect your rights, but then when it seems to be eventual judgment, it's a default judgment effectively against the Philippines, because they can never get those assets once they're disbursed.  So, it's a... it's kind of a deceptive immunity, because by asserting the immunity they are going to lose their opportunity to claim these assets.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Not necessarily.  I'm focusing on this situation.  There could be others.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that the Ninth Circuit went on a statute of limitations in New York.  It didn't give the sovereign immunity claim, it seems, in the end of the day any weight, because it says we don't have to worry about the Philippines being out of this case because they would have no claim on the merits.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where is that?  Then why were they bothering with the statute of limitations?  Both courts said that the action would be time barred in New York.  But if they made a definitive ruling that the assets belonged to the Marcos estate and not the Philippine Government, then that would be preclusive.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I just did not find in either the district court or the court of appeals an answer to that basic question: Whose assets are they?  It seemed to me they were assuming the assets belonged to the estate and not to the Philippine Government, but they made no specific finding on that issue.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then you're ignoring a 1955 law that says anything that belongs to Marcos that he didn't get legitimately belongs to the government.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't that... I mean it sounds shocking, but I thought that in the Philippines, as in many countries, the filing fee is determined by what you're asking for.  So it would be a percentage of $2 billion.  And if they just did that automatically, then you say, oh, but, but this... the filing fee of that size would mean that the Plaintiffs can't sue.  But that's... but it wasn't they picked whatever figure, filing fee, out of a hat; it was a percentage of what was sought in the litigation right?   ",06-1204
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What do you mean by that?  You repeated several times there must be... must lay a foundation.  You do recognize, I think in your reply brief, that some other supervisor evidence would be relevant and admissible, but you refer to the foundation.  Tell us what you think a proper foundation would be.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What do you mean by ""nexus""?  If they both work in the same physical facility, is that a nexus?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And didn't the Tenth Circuit read it to be an absolute prohibition?  That it must be the same supervisor?  """"Similarly situated"" requires proof that Paul Reddick was the decisionmaker. ""  That seems as though that the district court thought there... it must be the same supervisor, and I thought that's how the Tenth Circuit read--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --the district court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that didn't present the other supervisor, which I think is more... a better way to comprehend this, because 10 witnesses working under the same supervisor.  But these two people, as I understand it, were in the direct chain of supervisory command.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's not ""other supervisor"".  They are both supervisors of this employee.  She's in a unit that includes both superior officers.  I thought that the issue here was simply other supervisors, witnesses who had worked for other supervisors, people for whom the... with whom the plaintiff had no connection.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you say... I thought you said in your reply brief that other-supervisor evidence could be relevant.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think you said in your brief that the plaintiff does not have to lay a foundation.  And that's the difference between you, I thought... with respect to Justice Kennedy's question.  Your brief takes the position that it is not necessary to lay a foundation in order to introduce other-supervisor evidence.   Gregory G. Garre  That's correct, and that's why as I said the plaintiff has to show that the evidence is relevant, that it has some tendency to make a fact or consequence more likely.  This Court in the Huddlestone case confronted--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Garre, do I understand correctly that the reason the Tenth Circuit thought that the district court was ruling under 401, making a relevance determination, was that the court of appeals had a precedent in the area of employee discipline, and the Tenth Circuit said well, the district court was following that precedent, but that precedent doesn't apply in this situation.  So that's why the court of appeals, as I understand it, read the district court as just applying an absolute ban.   Gregory G. Garre  That's correct, and that's the way this case was litigated all the way until to the reply brief in this case.  If there are no further questions?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the... how can we make that assumption when the Tenth Circuit says we know why this district judge ruled as he or she did?  We had a precedent.  It... it dealt with employee discipline.  We said, categorically, it's got to be the same supervisor; otherwise it's not relevant.  The district judge was simply applying that case to this case.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it wasn't any 403 question.  It was this doesn't some in.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's not... the point is that the Tenth Circuit said this judge made an absolute rule: It doesn't come in.  We know why he made an absolute rule; that was our precedent.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you not think that there is an important value that the Tenth Circuit recognized in making it clear that there is no absolute bar?  If we just assume in favor of the district court, when we don't know that the district court didn't take it as an absolute rule, that... this is a point of law that should be clarified for the benefit of district courts.  Either there's a categorical bar or there's not.   ",06-1221

But did it ever, ever discreetly consider IV push versus IV administered the usual way by a drip bag?

No matter what benefit there was, how could the benefit outweigh that substantial risk?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Kneedler, at the outset, would you clarify something that is central, I think, to this case?  Some of the briefs tell us that this represents a change of policy on the part of the FDA, that in fact the FDA once approved and said torts were -- tort suits were a helpful adjunct to the FDA's own efforts to protect consumers.  They helped because they prodded manufacturers to -- to disclose risks that were either unknown or under-evaluated.  Was that once the FDA's policy; and, if so, when did it change?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But why is that -- why is that likely, considering the huge number of drugs?  I mean, one figure said that there are 11,000 drugs that have this approval.  Is the FDA really monitoring every one of those to see if there is some new information that should change the label?   ",06-1249

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Rubin, you were not willing to agree with the Chief when he said: Well, maybe there are some investment expenses that are special because this is a trust.  But there must be some that any investor would incur.  But you say it's got to be all one way.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is that true?  And I'm looking at testimony given by J. Roger Mintz in 1986 when this measure was before Congress, and in that written testimony is the statement:  ""First, the treatment of trusts as separate taxpayers with a separate, graduated rate schedule can cause income to be taxed at a rate lower than if the grantor had retained direct ownership of the trust assets or given the assets outright to the beneficiaries. ""  So apparently the Treasury was telling the Congress that there is a problem.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  A grantor trust would be one of those pass-throughs.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why is it not administerable?  Whether you think it's a faithful rendition of the statute is one thing, but this is exactly what Justice Breyer was talking about.  It says these are the things that are special to the trust, and then these are the things that are not.  That's what the proposed reg does, right?   ",06-1286
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It wasn't narrow in the beginning, right?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This is somewhat of a mystery, the wording of that clause.  And since it came in at the very last minute, isn't it appropriate to give it a limited reading, rather than, in your suggestion, that this provision that up until the very end read just administration,  ""costs paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the estate or trust. ""  period?  And then there was this add-on.  Why should we give that an expansive meaning?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why that limitation?  Why wouldn't it say just ""investment advice"", but it's... investing for total return is more limited?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It doesn't say it's one or the other.  So it's not so sure, right?  It's sure about advice on investing for total return.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In other words, the regulation, the proposed regulation, doesn't answer this case of investment advice in general as opposed to advice on investing for total return.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They certainly weren't sure about it when they drafted this regulation, proposed regulation.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But in other categories, they express no such limitation.  Custody or management of property, not qualified.  And they... but when you get to investing, it has that total return.  Everything else has got maintenance, repair, insurance.

If it isn't a question of proof, it isn't a question of evidence?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And this must be one.  The Service must think this is one because it was certain about the tax return.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why?  This Court hasn't so held.  We haven't had that issue before us.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did the government... well, we'll ask the government, but I thought they kind of qualified that in their brief.  The brief says that the case... this case presents no occasion to consider whether Title VII's ban on discrimination against Federal sector employees incorporates that Act's private sector retaliation ban.  So they haven't made a concession.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  She could complain; it's just that she couldn't go very far with the complaint.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why is that so clear, because section 2000e, 16(d) says section, whatever it is, f through k of this title, as applicable, shall govern civil actions brought hereunder.  And if there is no right against retaliation, then the remedy wouldn't be applicable.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It isn't that simple because the government hasn't conceded that, with respect to Title VII, Federal employees are covered for retaliation.  If the Government... we'll ask them... will make that concession, then the argument is very strong.  The words are identical.   ",06-1321
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why not, given the Jackson precedent, where there was a similarly general ban on discrimination and we defined discrimination to include retaliation for complaining about discrimination?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's... Mr. Garre, that's traditionally when you're suing the government, you don't get a jury.  And so that's on one side.  Here, as I think you would recognize, retaliation claims go hand in hand with discrimination claims.  A person who is discriminated against will quite commonly say: I was not promoted because that was discrimination and then because I complained about it all these bad things happened to me.  It's very common that those two go together.  And yet, without any indication that Congress meant to send a Federal employee off to one forum to argue discrimination and another forum to argue retaliation, without any hint that that's what Congress had in mind, it would be rather strange.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you... I recognize it's not absurd.  But if there is ambiguity and one interpretation is, well, that in every other context retaliation goes together with discrimination, why would Congress leave out this one category of persons, especially when it might have said, well, the Supreme Court says discrimination includes retaliation?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What is the government's position?  What does, for example, EEOC or whoever passes on these complaints, what is the government's position in practice with respect to a Federal employee who complains, A, I was discriminated against because of my race and then they retaliated against me for complaining?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Has any Federal court found otherwise?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you agree... then you agree with Mr. Garre about the meaning of those words ""as applicable""?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do we know what Congress had in mind when it said don't incorporate private sector?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There must be an explanation for that section.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What could she get... what could she get by way of remedy?  And you recognize that this employee is not covered by the Civil Service Act, but does have collective bargaining rights.  Suppose there is a finding of reprisal in that forum.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't the typical retaliations claim, though, like the one in this case, whether it's under Title VII or the Age Discrimination Act?  That is, I think I have a solid claim of discrimination, but maybe not.  Nevertheless, once I filed that complaint, this unit doesn't like people who complain about sex discrimination, age discrimination.  Therefore, I was retaliated against.  In this case, isn't it the fact that the age discrimination claim, the claim of direct discrimination, was rejected and the question is but nonetheless, was there a retaliation claim?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Garre, I just want to make sure I understood something you said before, rather pleadingly.  One is if one could imagine a claim just for reprisal, but you called something a ""mixed claim"" if you're suing, as she started out to sue, for both.  So if you're suing for both, on your theory you still must split them up?  You cannot bring the reprisal claim together with the discrimination claim?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there's a different administrative mechanism.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Oh, oh, but how about court?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then you... you would be putting everything under the civil service umbrella and nothing under the--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But if it didn't amount to an adverse action under the Civil Service Act--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --And you wouldn't get to court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but it would not be within your control.  It would not be up to the--   ",06-1321
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, why don't we do exactly that here?  I mean, you say that the proper thing to do, now a charge labelled Form 5 has been filed, is to dismiss this lawsuit; and then we wait 60 days; and the identical lawsuit is reinstated.  Why shouldn't the court simply toll the case and say, now we have a proper Form 5.  The employer didn't get a chance to engage in settlement.  So we hold on to the case and allow the 60 days to elapse, and then the complaint is there.  Why isn't that the appropriate solution for this case?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you said the same complaint could be filed at the end of the conciliation.  What difference does it make that you have a piece of paper there?  What I don't understand is the only effect of your position... dismiss the whole thing, 60 days, start over... is you're making the plaintiff file an additional filing fee.  The complaint has already been filed.  The filing fee has been paid.  Now, everything would work out just the same except the plaintiff has to pay a second filing fee.  In the court there are certain inefficiencies if it's first dismissed and then they have to docket it again.  So I don't see any... it doesn't seem to make any sense to me.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  After she had a lawyer.  But is it... is it not the practice at the EEOC when you're dealing with an unrepresented person who files the intake questionnaire and if the SEC reviewer thinks that it fits within the statute, that the Form 5 will be filled out, not by the layperson, but by the EEOC officer herself?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's not the question.  The question I asked is if they decide that the, what the intake... the information on the intake questionnaire fits within the statute so that the claim can go forward, isn't it the practice not to ask the layperson to fill out the Form 5, but for the EEOC to do it itself?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, it has to be signed.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, she filled out hers after she was already in court and had a lawyer.  But I thought that this statute, as all the statutes EEOC administers, are designed for claims that are put forth initially largely by unrepresented people.  And the notion is that the agency should make it as easy as possible for them to get through the legal process.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What happens... what happens if... in this case it's not a problem, but I can imagine it would be in many cases... if you have a 300-day or a 180-day problem, you withdraw the complaint, and then you're out there and the clock keeps ticking, and you get past the 300 days and you are totally out.  That's why it's important not to follow... to say, well, it's, it doesn't make any difference, if we dismiss this complaint, she comes back in 60 days.  Well, but 60 days may be 360 days.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Wasn't she appealing?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Wasn't she appealing the dismissal?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, I don't understand that, because EEOC is a responsible agency.  Congress has told it: You weed out the people complaining about something that happened in Paris, and then you give notice.  But the notice obligation... and I understand it is EEOC's, not the complainant's.  So we would not expect this agency... yes, it messed up in this case... routinely not to give notice, routinely not to engage the employer in conciliation efforts.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the new form, the EEOC's new form... I suppose responsive to this case and others like it... that says if you don't file any other administrative complaint, we'll count the intake questionnaire as the charge?

So if it's novel, but it supports the judgment, then at least shouldn't the Illinois courts have a chance to look at it and say, oh, that's what we really meant, we just got... explained it the wrong way?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It was a sale of stock in that case, wasn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It was the sale of a subsidiary.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You told me that there was no case that the tax... taxing authority lost that involved divisions of a single company and sale of assets, rather than the sale of stock.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, we're talking about what Due Process permits States to do, and you're asking us to declare a restriction that, as far as I know, has never been declared in any case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's not just that it's an investment, it's not just that it's holding on to the shares in another company.  It's both of these are ongoing businesses, Lexis/Nexis and Mead, and they are both generating income, and all along Illinois has been taxing the income of both of them, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Weren't those foreign corporations?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So running them as... as a single company would have been a little harder.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, there is, Ms. Brinkmann.  The Illinois appellate court never got to that question.  Illinois argued all along this is a unitary business.  The only one who said it wasn't was this trial court, and the Illinois intermediate appellate court says, well, we don't have to deal with that because if you use the other label, operational function, that comes out all right, too.  But this argument was certainly the number one argument that Illinois was making.  It lost only in the trial court on... on it.  And the appellate court said we don't have to get to it.

Each year when they're making income, when they are a going concern, Illinois can get a piece of it.  But when the assets are sold, assets that would have generated income for Illinois year after year, but when those assets are sold, Illinois can get nothing to represent... to substitute for that stream of income that it would have gotten.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And... and I'm not following your argument, because I thought that the argument that this was a unitary enterprise was made in the Illinois appellate court, and the appellate court recognizes that it was made, and said we are not going to reach it because we have this operational function test?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Was there any sort of stipulation between the parties to say what each, what Lexis/Nexis was doing in Illinois, what Mead was doing in Illinois?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Let me ask you about the theory that both the trial court and the intermediate appellate court went on, this operational function test, which has been brought up in a few of our cases, but I don't know any that was decided.  Did we ever have any case that turned on the operational function test to hold for the State taxing authority?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  But one of the problems with applying it as you urge here is that that would just override... why would anyone go to the trouble of making a case under the so called unitary business test, because the operational function test would be much easier to meet?

Because we're not talking about retaliation in a vacuum; we're talking about retaliation for complaining about race discrimination.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What kind of... what kind of right to be free from discrimination would there be if once one complains one can be fired, demoted?  That would not be a very effective right, would it be?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But one can say the same thing for Title VII and, say, the Equal Pay Act.  There are a lot of overlapping antidiscrimination laws.  That doesn't mean that we shrink one because another exists.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that's... that's often the case, isn't it?  I mean, the argument you just made could go as well to somebody who uses 1981 to complain about a racially based demotion wasn't able to use Title VII because he filed too late.  That's a typical use of 1981; is it not?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So what is the difference between this case... you say, well, there's Title VII and this would erode Title VII.  Doesn't it erode Title VII when I'm complaining about, say, a demotion?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And you say--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Of course, it's just for race claims, and Title VII covers sex, national origin.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  My point is that 1981 would not be available to other categories.  It's only race, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it's a statute that has the same derivation.  They're both from the 1866 Civil Rights Act, and they're both set up the same way.  1982 also says 1981 does.  So wouldn't it be odd to take these twin measures and say one includes retaliation and the other doesn't?  Wouldn't Congress, when it revised 1981 in 1991 been aware of Sullivan and expect this Court to interpret those twin statutes the same way?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Wouldn't you look at what Congress was trying to do in the 1991 amendments?  That is, Congress changed the law that this Court had declared; and the message, the essential message, was this Court has been too stingy in its interpretation of Title... of 1981, so we're going to change it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And it seems to me that we wouldn't be hearing... we wouldn't be grasping that message.

One of them was when they asked, well, why didn't you make a complaint, use whatever internal remedies are there are?  She said, because the person in this outfit who is charged with receiving complaints is the harasser.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But we have to -- everything -- for you to prevail, since there has been no trial on the facts, we have to take the facts as she alleges them.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And how about taking our decisions in the Faragher and Ellerth case which in a sense made the employer's internal investigation part of the EEO process because it says to the employer, if you don't have that find of effective internal complaint and investigation procedure, then you're going to be stuck on respondeat superior liability.  If you do, then you will be shielded.  So this Court's decision in those two cases seemed to me to say to every employer, as part of your EEO compliance you had better have this internal complaint procedure and investigation.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What are the other arguments on summary judgment.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  When you say it's not that the employer is stuck because there's a potential retaliation claim, if the employer is certain of its grounds, that this discharge had nothing to do with her testimony, then go ahead and discharge her.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  On the other side, that attorney, there's a large disincentive.  He hasn't got a good case.  He's not going to be paid any retainer as you might be.  And he's not going to get any counsel fees.  Why should such -- why should it -- counsel be available to a person who obviously was discharged for having her hand in the till and not because she was harassed?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No.  I meant that as a hypothetical.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What was the reason that she was -- what was the employer's reason for discharging her?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I said if you have a really strong case of having discharged this person for cause that has nothing at all to do with harassment, you are going to win the lawsuit and it would be hard for the plaintiff to get a decent lawyer to represent her side of the case because she's going to lose.

That is, suppose it is a second offense, but the prosecutor chooses not to charge as a second offender and so, although it is in fact the second offense, he is sentenced in the State court as a first offender.  Would it count under your reading of the Federal statute that it was a second offense?

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Wolfman, what about the cap that's not present in 1988 and is present in EAJA?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Wolfman, if there's any discretion in the district judge in setting the amount of the fee, then why wouldn't it be appropriate to say, now there's a cap for the lawyer is $125 an hour, but we know the true market rate for that lawyer is $200?  Does it do the same thing with the paralegal?  The true market rate is X, and we're going to knock it down so that it will match the knock-down for the lawyer?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But isn't it likely that when Congress said that, it was not thinking of paralegals.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1717

Could you... one could say I'm going to look at the Internet and come up with $35 dollars an hour, or you could say in the case of a paralegal there is a part of the overhead, there is the fringe benefits... so just giving the hourly rate is deceptive of what the actual cost is to the law firm, because the law firm has to add on to determine what in fact it's paying for the paralegal, the fringe benefits and part of the overhead.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I know you said that a few times and you have authority for it, but it seems to me odd if you look at 1988 and if the attorney's fees and costs... and costs is very limited in the statute in 1920... and if you have attorney's fees and other expenses, other expenses is a much larger category than costs within 1988.  So I... I would think that, well, EAJA is the more compensatory because it allows for more items.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Am I right that when this language first came in... this is in relation to Justice Breyer's question... there was no cap?  When did the... when was the cap put on?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It was.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It would be a lot of weight to be put on three little words: ""Billed at cost"".

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'd like to go back to a question that Justice Kennedy asked of Mr. Wolfman.  Isn't there... doesn't it make sense to take a word like ""attorney's fees"" and like the word ""discrimination"", we have many different anti-discrimination statutes, but there has been an attempt to give that word ""discrimination"" the same meaning in all those statutes.  And here the term attorney's fees, if it means that includes all of them, in terms of 1988, why not say every time attorney's fees comes up, that's what it's going to mean?   INTERRUPTING ",06-1717
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And how does it... how does it compare with another process that the FDA looks at very closely, I think even more closely than new devices... new drugs.  New drugs also go through a very long testing period.  Is there... and the FDA gives its approval, and the drug is marketed, and it turns out it has risks people didn't understand and there's a tort suit.  Is there... is there a defense to the manufacturer,  ""I followed to the letter the permission that the FDA gave me? ""   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it would certainly be at least the same here, right?  That compliance with the Federal law would be a defense on the merits.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there a reason... as I understand it, tort suits are not preempted with respect to new drugs.  Is there a reason to treat the two differently?  For new medical devices and the new drugs?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So that's the difference.  So the question... what does the express preemption provision mean?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Take a--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Take a concrete situation where the FDA is asked: We'd like to make this improvement.  And the FDA says no, we don't think that enhances safety.  And then there's a tort suit based on the failure to make that improvement.  Wouldn't the FDA rejection of permission to make that improvement... wouldn't that at least be preemptive?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought your response was it wouldn't go to the jury if the FDA had said no, you cannot make this, and the plaintiff's point is you must make it in order to make this device safe.  I thought your answer to me was that the FDA regulation... the FDA's action in refusing to allow the change to be made would be preemptive and you wouldn't give it to a jury to second-guess that determination by the FDA.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I was asking you, if it was... as a matter of Federal law, if the FDA says... rejects.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --a proposed change, can a State court say, well, we think the FDA was wrong in rejecting that, so we're going to let it go to the jury.  I thought the question I was posing to you is, isn't Federal law preemptive in that situation, when the FDA says you can't do it and the personal injury lawyer wants it to convince the jury that they had to do it?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How about the--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Another variation... the FDA says you must include X in this device or we won't give you the pre-market approval.  And so the manufacturer puts X in, and then there's a lawsuit that wants to charge that putting X in made the device dangerous.  Would the FDA's insistence that X be put in take X out of any State court's tort litigation?  That is, wouldn't... if the FDA says you must have it, a State court couldn't put to a jury whether you should have eliminated it?

I would think that if everything that you said about new devices would apply in bold letters to new drugs, because the testing procedures are much longer, are they not?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, there's an argument that what it was intended to do was to cut out State pre-market approval, where States like California came in when there was a Federal void and said we shouldn't let the manufacturers put out whatever they'd like.  Let's have a pre-market approval.  And the argument is, as you well know, which was presented in Senator Kennedy's brief, that's what we meant to do with the preemption provision.  Nothing more.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why isn't there... to... to take care of that kind of hypothetical where the FDA says this isn't it, to say that kind of suit can't be brought.  But it is, indeed, mentioned that there's a category of suits that is simply saying: Manufacturer, you didn't do what's in that pre-marketing approval?  So we're kind of a backup to not doing anything in conflict with the FDA's approval.  We're simply saying you didn't follow the labeling requirement, or you didn't follow the design submission that you--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --You would say the same thing for... for design and labeling if the manufacturer did not do what the FDA approved?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Olson, what about the argument that once you've got this very valuable pre-market approval, even though you could make that device safer, you have no incentive to do that.  You have permission to market this product as is.  Even if you know that there's a better way to do it, there's a disincentive to try to go through the process and make the change.  Why should you, when you have carte blanche to continue without making the change?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that you conceded that there would be conflict preemption, that the States could not... either through a State agency or through a jury... come up with a requirement that would conflict with an FDA requirement.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Everybody agrees that far, that the States were not to be in the business of issuing PMA's.  The question is does the preemption clause mean any more than that?

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it was not so long ago that the Department of Justice took a different view.  And of all of the vertical restraints, this is the only one where Congress has been a player.  I mean, Congress allowed the fair trade laws to operate.  And then it withdrew that.  There's no other restraint where they are has been congressional action, where the argument could be made, well, Congress is well aware of this, the Court should allow them to make the change, if they so will.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But in those cases you didn't have the counterpart to Miller-Tydings and McGuire.  That's what makes this... this one different in terms of congressional intention.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Olson, before you sit down, there's just one thing that wasn't covered in your argument or in the brief, but the complaint alleged in this case that Leegin allowed certain favored dealers to discount; not this plaintiff, but others were allowed to discount.  And if that were true, as a matter of fact, then that would be a... a plain violation of antitrust law, wouldn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --in the complaint,.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If the rule of reason is the one that applies, I gathered, perhaps incorrectly, from Mr. Olson's remarks that this would be... this case would be thrown out on summary judgment, it would never get to trial.  How do you think the rule of reason would operate if it were the rubric under which this case were to be decided?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that's the formula, but I take it from what you said and Mr. Olson said that the plaintiff could never get across the first threshold?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But in this case, this case has none of those features.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Leegin loses under the rule of reason, right?   ",06-480X

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Coykendall, the... on the question... you alleged in the complaint that there was some discounting allowed by, how do you pronounce it, Leegin?

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Phillips, the Seventh Amendment or not, the question in 12(b)(6) is has the plaintiff stated a claim, and at the end of the line it's has the plaintiff proved a claim.  But you're stating two different claims.  The claim that must be stated is a stronger claim than the claim that must be proved, and I don't know of any other instance where that is so.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I wasn't asking it as a matter of constitutional law but I'm thinking, how do you construe these words, what is it, ""strong inference""?  And the words come out of, as I understand it, a Second Circuit decision.  So I would think the most logical thing is that you'd look at the Second Circuit decision and say ah, Congress picked up those words from the Second Circuit decision, then we should pick up the standards that the Second Circuit applied.  But your definition of strong inference is quite different from what the Second Circuit's was.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is it fair to say at the pleading stage it's the equivalent of a clear and convincing standard, whereas at the end of the road it would only be more probable than not?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you do--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --there was a pleading stage, I would like your clear view on how much that changes.  It has been the understanding that when there is a 12(b)(6) motion, you look only to the face of the complaint and you construe the allegations in that complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Is that rule not applied under the interpretation you are giving us of strong inference?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You said the Court of Appeals to apply it.  Could the Court of Appeals applying the standard that you say is correct come to the same decision that it came to using a different verbal formula.   ",06-484X

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought this court said, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you wanted to put on a demonstration that would be like the plays, that would be hidden from public view because you have a curtain or whatever around it.  And then the judge said, oh no, that's not what they wanted, they didn't want it to be hidden from you view, they wanted people to see their demonstration, so if that's what they want to do, they don't have any First Amendment protection.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That parsing, is there any doubt that if you won on the main, in the main bout, that you would get your fees for your entire representation?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Not that.  But would you not get... would the judge say you don't get a penny for the effort you made to achieve the preliminary injunction because you lost, you lost it, even though in hindsight I could see that that was the wrong decision, you should have had it?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They're obviously related.  It's the same thing.  I need... I have a short time to answer the preliminary injunction.  The judge said: You haven't shown probability of success on the merits, or denies it.  You win.  I thought that there wasn't any doubt that you could get your fees for the successful result from the time you filed the complaint until the final judgment.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where... can you... I thought what he said was... I thought they wanted a demonstration that was going to be secure from public view, and instead I understand now that's not... that wasn't what they wanted from the start.  So on the premise on which I was operating, I was right, that they were going to do it just like the plays.  But what they really planned to do, and did do, I was wrong because those facts were not before me.  Had those facts been before me, they would have lost on the preliminary injunction.

""   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you think that when the Court says this, it didn't contemplate that PRPs would be included among private parties?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How does it work with ""or a State"" because I thought that there was some suggestion that States, they don't want to bother with the Federal legislation, so they'll say you're okay under the State legislation.  You can't force a State to... to take on that responsibility.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The States, we have a brief from the States telling us look, we don't want to put our money on that kind of thing.  We've got very high-risk sites and we want to spend our resources making sure those are cleaned up.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, they... they can.  Of course they can but the States are telling us that this puts a burden on them that they don't want.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, let's just go back to Justice Breyer's question, because it was I think a major point of the Eighth Circuit.  That is, they said the United States, the United States is a big polluter, could avoid its own responsibility by not bringing any enforcement action and by not settling, and you... you said there would be a disincentive for the PRP... a disincentive to settlement, but you didn't answer the question of why wouldn't the United States when it is a polluter and it would be responsible on this site, to say well, we are going to, we are not going to settle?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then why this case... there's a point that was made by the Eighth Circuit, and also in the States' brief on page 24, and that is that the EPA was engaged in settlement negotiations with Atlantic Research, and then after this Court decided Cooper Industries that negotiation terminated.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The person who settled, wouldn't that person be protected?  Wouldn't the court say, this person has made a bargain with the EPA and we're not going to extract any more from them?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but to make the statute work in harmony, to harmonize 107 with 113, it seems to me that would be an altogether reasonable position for a court to take.  If someone has settled and is protected by virtue of that settlement, then when someone else tries to go after that same person the court could say: We have to make the statute work and we're going to honor the settlement.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the Government's concern that prenups shouldn't go on unsupervised.  That's when EPA brings an enforcement action, there's a monitor there.  When there's a settlement, then the Government is there.  But if you just go off on your own and do this, you're doing it unsupervised by any State authority, any Federal authority, and that could--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --What about the disincentive to settlement?  You just said how important settlement was, or what a good thing it is to encourage it.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought the words were home of the person who employs, not who receives the services but who employs.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  By... reading out the words ""of the person who employs"" her?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that the Department of Labor's first take on this was that the exemption did not apply to third-party employers.  That was the original Department of Labor position, wasn't it?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm referring to the notice and comment rulemaking in which you place great stock.  I thought the original notice and comment rulemaking said the exemption does not apply to third-party employers.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And... and there was no further discussion of it after... after it sent out the notice of proposed ruling that said third party employees will not be exempt, and then it said they will be exempt, did it give reasons for the change?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Some would be the ones that qualified as... what is the phrase, enterprises engaged in commerce?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Were they covered before, before there was any provision that dealt with household workers?  If state and localities were considered enterprises engaged in commerce, then presumably they were... they had no exemption before, their companion care people, just as household workers, would be covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The statute treats together babysitters and elder care people, but I take it the babysitters if they were working for an agency rather than for the householders, there wouldn't be any exemption?  Is that right?   David B. Salmons  That's correct, and that's tied to a specific term that only applies to the exemption as to babysitters.  The only thing that's exempt with regard to babysitters is babysitting on a casual basis.  Congress certainly could have included a casual basis requirement with regard to the exemption for companionship services.  We think it's very notable that it did not and we read from that that Congress wanted all domestic service employees providing companionship services to be exempt, and we think that's most consistent with the goal of ensuring that those individuals who most need this type of care have the opportunity to receive them at a reasonable cost.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't it odd that this... the basic thing about the '74 legislation, it was going to add to the Fair Labor Standards Act people who were not covered before.  So it added household workers.  And yet you say that, while Congress had its mind trained on adding people, it also subtracted people who were covered before, took them out, removed them from the coverage of the Act.   David B. Salmons  Well, we think that that is the consequence of the companionship services exemption, but we don't think that's odd based on the Department of Labor's view of what the purpose of that exemption is and based on the textual difference between, for example, the exemption for baby sitting services and the exemption for companionship services.  The exemption here expresses no limitation based on the identity of the employer and we think it was well within the agency's discretion to conclude that what Congress had in mind here was a categorical exemption based on the type of services that are being provided; and while that may mean that there are certain workers who are now exempt who were not previously exempt, that's because Congress for the first time in 1974 focused on this problem of companionship services being provided to those who cannot care for themselves; and we think that follows from the text, and for the reasons Congress adopted that.

Mr. Becker, if there is room for the Agency to read this statute either way, one way that the third party employee would come under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the other that they would not, would be treated the same way as the person employed by the elderly person himself or herself, but if the concern of Congress in making this exemption was for the householder with limited funds, if the Agency is subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, it's going to end up being the householder paying for it anyway.  So why isn't the most reasonable interpretation of what Congress meant by the exemption that the exemption would apply across the board, so that all workers in this category would be exempt?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And rewrite... and essentially rewriting the law, and that's my question about this technique that Justice Breyer has proposed.  This Court is not generally in the business of writing appendices that say well, the statute couldn't apply in this situation, and it couldn't apply and as long as we put those contours around it.  Certainly the Court could write an opinion that would inform Congress why this particular statute as written is overbroad, and explain what kind of statute wouldn't be overbroad.

I thought (a)(1)(B) is a claim for benefits, current or future.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I know, because in making this, hitching your wagon to the (a)(1)(B)... I thought you were arguing... what did you say the remedy for this person would be?  Assuming it's true that he put in his slip and he said invest in X set of mutual funds and the trustee missed it, lost it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What is his remedy?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is that what you argue in your brief?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So what did you argue is his remedy, in your brief?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What would that be?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  He didn't know until he got the report.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it's much too late.  It's over and done.  It wasn't made.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Let's take, because this case was tossed out on the pleadings, the... there are forms to fill out and says I want this set of investments as opposed to that set of investments.  The contributor fills out that form, gives it to the fiduciary.  A careless employee for the fiduciary loses it, and that's the story.  So what's the remedy for the contributor who gave his instruction that weren't followed, not out of anything deliberate but just carelessness?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Enjoining him to be careless?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Let me follow up on Justice Scalia's question because I think your brief really goes astray on that.  Think of the many situations like the remainderman who is the trustee.  He has to look out for the interests of the live tenant, but he's going to keep all the rest, so maybe he wants to be economical.  That's not saying that he is.  So I've always understood that the term ""conflicting interests"" means just that; you have conflicting interests.  It doesn't mean that you necessarily slide over into misconduct.  And I think that if you would keep that separation in mind, is there a conflicting interest?  Yes, there is.  Has the trustee in fact slipped and taken unfair advantage because of the conflicting interests?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then you come to the end of the line.  You have to prove that the authority was misused.  And as I understand the Sixth Circuit's decision, what those judges were doing, they say we're going to look at this with some skepticism because of the conflict.  And let me give you a concrete example.  This woman got Social Security disability benefits and she did it at the suggestion of Metlife is; that so?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But she got a lawyer that they recommended that she have.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the point is they came to her and said: Get Social Security disability benefits.  Now, to get those she would have to show that she is totally and permanently disabled.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So here is a company that says: Tell the U.S. government that you are totally and permanently disabled, but... and then we'll recoup all that money that we paid out to you; but then when we get a chance to look, look it over, we'll say you're not disabled.  Why isn't it appropriate to regard just that set of circumstances with suspicion?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, I'm not questioning that at all.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That sounds fine.  It's a question of why, after helping her tell the government that she was totally disabled, they, after the initial two-year period, turned around and said she's not.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, let's take these facts.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  As the trier... I mean ERISA, yes, it certainly says you can be both the plan administrator and the payor, but all it says is that that's permissible.  But it also provides for review of those decisions, judicial review in court.  And here is, say, a district court is looking at it and says: I don't understand why the company didn't look at the doctor's explanation and put such heavy weight on a checkmark.  And I also don't understand the suggestion that she is totally disabled to the government and then saying, well, she's really not, in this very close time frame.  So it might be okay and it might not.  I am in equipoise about this case, not the terms of the plan but the decision that was made to deny her benefits.  So which way do I call it?  That's the question that Justice Souter posed, and you seem not to want to face up to it and answer it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How does that bear on making a determination that the--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --employee... that the plan administrator has to make: Is this person disabled and is she not?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where, where is this decision from that you're--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --There's one feature of this that I don't understand.  It was referred to very swiftly in Judge Merritt's separate opinion.  He said at one point there was a proposal by Metlife that they give this woman a trial run at a sedentary job to see if she could do it.  And he said that that made a lot of sense to him, and it was Metlife's proposal, but then it got withdrawn.  Could you clarify what that was?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then why did Metlife withdraw that proposal?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  My question was not what Dr. Patel said, but how did that proposal get dropped?   ",06-923X

It's just says... it says, ordinarily, if you don't have this discretionary authority, it's de novo review.  And then... this is on page 115.

In several statutes, the Congress has said this Federal money will go to the grantee, if the grantee says it will not use any money that we give them to assist, promote, or deter union organizing.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Does the ICJ ever issue a judgment of that character?  It issues a judgment between two nations, two or more nations, and it is instructs the United States to do something.  I'm not aware of any... any decision of the ICJ that says what a sentence should be for a particular individual.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If you had a--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --If you had a treaty on the recognition and enforcement of judgments, mutual recognition and enforcement, then we would enforce the judgment that we agreed to enforce by treaty.  We wouldn't look behind it to see if we agreed with it on the merits.  Are you saying that this undertaking, this agreement to submit to the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ gives the judgment in the particular case, although not precedential effect, the counterpart to full faith and credit?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then it becomes--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Then it becomes a penal judgment, and I thought the rule was that no country forces... enforces another country's penal judgment.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if we say--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --this man goes to jail for 5 years, it seems to me that's a penal judgment.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You didn't mention the--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --You didn't mention the Optional Protocol which is... is where the United States gave its promise.  It voluntarily accepted this jurisdiction.  It didn't have to.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that would take an action by somebody in the country.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Here that hasn't... that hasn't happened.  94 would never be triggered because we haven't said we're breaking our promise, we're not going to comply.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If you don't... if you don't comply, you don't comply.  But we... certainly not... in that situation here, the President said the United States agreed that it would submit to the binding jurisdiction for one case only, and we are bound by that judgment and I'm going to enforce it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  General, can we just clarify something which I think is important?  Justice Scalia suggested that this wasn't self-executing.  The State Department with respect to the Vienna Convention itself told Congress very clearly: You don't have to do anything; this is self-executing.  And then the protocol says: We the United States agree to accept the jurisdiction of the ICJ in a certain class of cases.  And Congress ratified that, too.  So I don't think that self-executing has anything to do with this case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But in Nicaragua the United States took the position from day 1 that the ICJ had no jurisdiction over the case.  So the absence of jurisdiction is always an exception to the obligation, even within the United States, to give full faith and credit.  If the court had no jurisdiction, another State doesn't have to give full faith and credit.  But if it does have jurisdiction, then the obligation kicks in.   INTERRUPTING ",06-984X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's after there's a breach, but we... let's stick to the protocol, the Optional Protocol... optional.  The protocol says: We accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ.  ""Jurisdiction"" means power.  We agree that in cases of this character, Vienna Convention violation cases, we submit to the jurisdiction of X tribunal, the ICJ.  What is there that needs execution about that?  Congress said yes, the United States, the Executive Branch of the United States decides that it's a good idea to submit to the... to the jurisdiction of the ICJ.  We ratify that.  And I don't see anything left for Congress to do.  It said the United States can submit to the jurisdiction of the ICJ.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, I still... I would like to get back to that Optional Protocol.  It... was it submission to jurisdiction?  My understanding is that any two parties that can agree, can have a formed selection clause, can agree that we accept the authority of this tribunal, and then it follows from that that if you accept their authority to adjudicate, you are bound to follow its decisions.  And that that seems to be understood in the world community because, is it not so that even though there are cases like Nicaragua and Iran, most ICJ judgments are indeed complied with by the nations that agree to submit to the jurisdiction of that tribunal?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you have a case that says that?  A Mexican case that says that?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Maybe it hasn't come up.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Cruz--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Are you saying that even--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Then we couldn't have a treaty with another country on the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgment, because the other country might get it wrong, we might disagree with its interpretation of the law, and, therefore, unlike the rest of the world, the United States can't get the advantage of a reciprocal guarantee that our judgments will be respected, and in turn we will respect your judgment.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It may be that if the case turns on a question of U.S. law, and we may think, as many think about the ICJ, that they got that question wrong.  Still, it's always been if you don't look behind the judgment.  You say in the next case I'm certainly not going to apply that wrong interpretation.  But here I'm bound by a judgment.  And that's why I questioned your use... your heavy use of Sanchez-Llamas.  I agreed with the court in that case because it was a question of interpretation.  We don't have to agree with the ICJ.  We were not faced with a decision, a binding adjudication, which we accept for that case only.  So there's a difference between Sanchez-Llamas and this case that you appear not to recognize in your brief.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought you said that... oh, you said that this is a matter of goodwill or that most ICJ judgments... ICJ judgments, they're not binding but people comply... nations comply with them as a matter of goodwill?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What could... other than... I mean, the most logical place to have this go on is the court that rendered the judgment.  It's always better for the court that rendered the judgment than some foreign court or another State court.  So what else could the President do?  The ICJ did say U.S., as a matter of your own choosing.  And the President chose the most logical forum, but what else could he have done?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Let's start with the first one.  Why should this case be in Federal court?  It's a state judgment that's in question.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you can have the Federal court overseeing the State court and telling the State what to do?  That seems to me practically much more of an encroachment on State authority than to say, State courts, you do it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --or to say Federal courts, you do it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Who would be doing the review?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  A law passed by Congress saying Texas dispense with your procedural bar rules?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So what's absent in your view is Congress.  You say that all of this could have been done--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --and Texas could have been ordered, but the President doesn't have the authority to do it just on the basis of the ICJ,--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --The not self-executing in the position of the State Department, wasn't there... in the parallel proceedings in Oklahoma, wasn't there a letter from the current... the then current legal adviser telling Oklahoma that this is a judgment that's binding on all courts in the United States, State and Federal, and that the President has directed Oklahoma to comply?  I think that was sent both to the governor and the other officials.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which... which letter are you quoting?  Are you quoting--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Yes, there is.  We have interpreted the law, and we have said as far as what Article 36 means, we disagree with the ICJ.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And Oklahoma has taken the opposite position, and they... they did give the review and reconsideration?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And has any other State acted?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought the ICJ flatly refused Mexican... Mexico said ICJ annulled the judgment.  The ICJ said no, and it didn't vacate it, either.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about public policy?  That was the other one Mr. Phillips brought up.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Miss Brinkmann, can we back up a bit, because this agreement had an usual genesis.  This was a big case, and the judge kept right in the court a piece of it.  And then he and the parties agreed that another piece of it would best be resolved in arbitration.  So the judge was in equal participation in that effort.  All three parties wanted to get a particular issue resolved through an arbitrator rather than the court, itself.  And I doubt very much whether the judge would have been at all interested in that scheme if he thought he were doing an idle thing.  That the parties, having agreed to just what the judge thought was a nice way to resolve this issue, would then find themselves out of Federal court and have to bring some kind of suit in State court.  It doesn't seem to fit this scenario.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why not use... why not use Rule 16, pretrial procedure, and the parties and the judge can work out what they think is the most efficient way to resolve this controversy?  So they decide at the pretrial conference that they are going to build into this arrangement one issue that they are going to peel off to go to an arbitrator, but the judge is going to retain control through the legal error.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's a strange argument in this respect.  You are arguing that this non-Article III person has more control rather than less control; that if the judge controlled this arbitrator, somehow that would violate Article III.  But if the judge has no control and is essentially little more than a rubber stamp on what the non-Article III person does, then that's all right.  And the sense of that doesn't come across to me.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are there any--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Are there any... are there any such States left today that are using the Illinois model?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there a possibility that the reason the language in the statute is as it is... when was the Federal Arbitration Act; what year was it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And there was still abroad in the land considerable distrust of arbitrators.  Judges said arbitrators are stepping on our turf, and so they would be naturally resistant to let the arbitrator go ahead and have the most minimal review in court.  Maybe the act was written the way it was to say, if the parties want to go to arbitration, courts, you stay out of it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is that what--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, let's take this statute and let's take the circuits that have the rule, the opposite rule.  In fact, the Ninth Circuit had the opposite rule until rather recently.  What has been the experience... I think the Fifth Circuit is on the other side?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What has been the experience there?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think a lot of those horribles, Mr. Phillips would agree with you because he hesitated even on de novo, and I think he thought that trying to control an appeal from the district court, that would be out of the ballpark.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But one problem that I have with your position is you say that the... you should continue to prevail, although that would be in violation of the parties' agreement.  Under the Ninth Circuit decision, you win, what the arbitrator says goes, and there isn't the review that the parties bargained for.   ",06-989X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  General Garre, will you clarify one point?  You said ""fails to state"" enough to overcome qualified immunity.  But, usually, these -- the pleading is analyzed discretely.  This is a 12(b)(6) motion, is it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And so that tests just the pleading.  Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense which hasn't even been stated formally.  So isn't it entirely conceivable that you could have a good complaint judged from the 12(b)(6) point of view, but when the qualified immunity defense is asserted, the plaintiff isn't able to come up with enough to stave off a summary judgment motion?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  General Garre, I think that the Bell Atlantic case -- and -- and I'm sure that Justice Souter will correct me if I'm wrong about this, but most of it is about what it takes -- what are the essential elements of a Sherman section 1 charge.  And there's a big mistake that the pleaders are making; that is, there has to be an agreement, and they haven't alleged an agreement.  This case seems to be quite different.  And I think you have taken Bell Atlantic, frankly, for more than is there.  That is, twice -- at least twice in the opinion, the Court says, we are not developing any heightened pleading rules.  Form 11 is as good today as it was yesterday.  What we are talking about is a missing -- is an essential element to a substantive claim for relief.  I thought that's what--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --How about--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --How about Rule 11 to take care of Justice Breyer's problem?

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Franklin, even if you are right about that, the legislation was an emergency measure with a sunset.  It was revived for 1 year, but then no more.  So, didn't this suspension of Iraq's lack of immunity -- didn't the immunity come back?  Didn't the bar to immunity come back again once the emergency law sunsetted?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Including -- including the provision that repealed 1605(a)(7).  So that would be revived?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do we have any other instance in which a jurisdictional provision is withdrawn applicable to pending cases without Congress having mentioned the jurisdictional provision at all?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Were there judgments, outstanding judgments that had become final -- judgments outstanding against Iraq, that were not challenged on appeal?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And you're not claiming that those could be reopened?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought we were just told that because there -- of the limitations on enforcement, the -- there would be no realistic threat to the Iraqi assets in the United States because the judgment creditor wouldn't have access to them.     That is because of the authorities that the President exercised under the second proviso of 1503.  There are exceptions to the immunity of foreign states with respect to attachment.  There is one that specifically applies to countries that have been designated as having sponsored terrorism, and that exception as well was rendered inapplicable to Iraq pursuant to this same authority.  And so, again, it is essential to the government's foreign policy interests in Iraq that these judgments, the ability to attach Iraqi assets -- in fact, at the time, in the summer of 2003, there were plaintiffs that were running around trying to attach the very assets, the very bundles of cash, that the United States Government was attempting to shift to Iraq in order to pay immediate needs in -- in Iraq in the immediate aftermath of having removed the Hussein regime.  These critical foreign policy goals would have been frustrated had the President not been able to make our Foreign Sovereign Immunity Law conform to our foreign policy.  And, of course, the Court in Altmann recognized that foreign sovereign immunity is an expression of our present foreign policy interests.  That has always been the case.  And although Congress can establish the general rule, and did in the FSIA, section 1503 recognizes that there had perhaps never been as dramatic a transformation in our foreign policy with respect to a country as happened in the spring of 2003, whereas there had been a whole panoply of sanctions and other provisions of law that had applied to Iraq because of the Hussein regime's sponsorship of terrorism.  On a -- on a dime, our policy shifted 180 degrees, and we became intensely concerned in the success of the new Iraqi regime.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is -- is all of this -- I won't say academic, but it ultimately doesn't matter if the D.C. Circuit was right in the Acree case in saying, well, 1605(a)(7) allowed suit against Iraq, but there's no cause of action.     No, Your Honor.  The judgment in the Acree case dismissing the claims for failure to state a claim was because counsel in that particular suit was unable to identify a source of law for their claim.  The D.C. Circuit has correctly held that Federal law did not at that time provide a cause of action under 1605(a)(7), and counsel was unable when pressed at oral argument to identify the source of law.  But numerous district court judgments exist where the courts have upheld the availability of transitory tort under the law of the forum State, under the law of the residence of the plaintiff, or under the law of the -- of the place where the wrong occurred to provide a cause of action.  So--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where the wrong occurred would have been Iraq.     --That's right.  And -- and, of course, the courts have to apply a choice of law analysis.  As I said, a number of these judgments apply the law of the forum State where the plaintiff resided.  The United States has expressed its view that there are constitutional limitations on the ability of a State to project its substantive law to a tort that occurs abroad, but -- but those issues have not yet I don't think have been resolved by the D.C. Circuit, at least.  So plaintiffs have successfully obtained judgments in suits brought under 1605(a)(7).  And there were billions of dollars in claims that were asserted against Iraq.  And -- and, as I said, plaintiffs were actively going and trying to seek the actual money that the United States was trying to transfer over to Iraq to pay immediate costs of the reconstruction.  But this does not mean -- and I think Justice Scalia's question was critical here.  It does not mean that the plaintiffs are left without any remedy, rather that these plaintiffs have been put on the same footing as any other claimant against a foreign state that is not on the very small list of designated state sponsors of terrorism.  Their claims are subject to state-to-state diplomatic resolution.  And, in fact, there have been discussions -- there are ongoing discussions -- to establish a framework for resolving the claims against the Hussein regime.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Wouldn't any such settlement have to take into account that Iraqi -- the Iraqi people themselves were the most numerous and probably the worst victims of the terror?     Well, Your Honor, I think that -- that that is one consideration.  The United Nations has established a mechanism for funding many of the victims of the Hussein regime.  And -- and -- but the United States would have the obligation to represent the interests of the United States citizens that were injured.  But, as -- as Your Honor's question points out, there are a lot of considerations that go into the diplomatic or state-to-state resolution of the claim beyond those that would be available to a court to consider in just adjudicating the particular plaintiff's claims.  And that is why these have historically been reserved for diplomatic resolution.  So--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You said that there should be deference to what the executive did because of his role in foreign affairs.  But in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, Congress deliberately withdrew what had been the executive's traditional authority and said: President, no more; we are going to set rules of how sovereign immunity will operate.     That is true.  And in 1503, Congress restored to the President in a sense a very small portion of the authority he had previously exercised before the FSIA's adoption.  1605(a)(7) on its own terms turns on determinations by the executive.  It's a statute that can be turned on and turned off by designating or de-designating a country.  It has a particular temporal consequence, the rule that -- that the Chief Justice alluded to.  In 1503, the Congress gave the President a different authority to turn that statute off, the authority to make it inapplicable only with respect to one country, Iraq, and in the context of the most dramatic transformation of foreign relations that -- that could transpire.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Congress could pass a law.  [Laughter]   ",07-1090
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But this statute specifically short-circuits that process.  It says the President may at once make inapplicable.  The very purpose of it is that the normal process is going to take time, and therefore it's being replaced with an emergency measure that becomes effective immediately.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But why -- why shouldn't we treat this -- yes, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act said Congress is setting the rules.  But why doesn't this emergency measure effectively restore to the President under these special circumstances the power that he once had?  Congress ceding back to the President back to the President for the purposes of dealing with Iraq, the authority -- the control authority he once had?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But, Mr. Goldstein, before you finish your argument, I'd like to know what you think about the claim for relief.  The D.C. Circuit said this is a mere jurisdictional provision, and it doesn't provide a private right of action; the new statute does, but that doesn't apply to Iraq.  So, what was the source of the claim -- what is the source of these plaintiffs' claim for relief?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which -- which State law?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So that -- by that reasoning, people all over the world could sue the United States in their courts alleging that the United States has engaged in cruel and inhuman treatment with respect to their nationals.  The same theory would apply -- use the law of the state where the national comes from.  So, it could be Iraq, could be Belgium, could be Yemen -- any place.  So -- but the claim you are saying exists would be a kind of universal one, if it's -- the United States could use it, any other place in the world could, too.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No.  Looking to their own law.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I did, and you can--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --You can go back to your jurisdiction argument.   INTERRUPTING ",07-1090
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it was -- it was decided.  It was decided -- wasn't it decided the first time around?  I mean, what the -- the Chief Justice calls your attention to page 25a.  The reason the court said they're not Brady material is we said it before; we said it the last time the case was before the court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  52.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If it is--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But your -- but your proposal would be that they would never do it because you want to send it back to the Federal district court, and -- and if the State was laboring under misapprehension, it thought that, because he brought up the issue twice, he had somehow been defaulted, everyone can agree that that didn't make sense.  But now you're proposing that the State court will not be the one to look at these materials; instead it will be the Federal court.  I think there was something that Judge Merritt said in his dissent that indicated he thought that the State court ought to be the one to do this close examination.  Didn't -- didn't he propose a stay of the Brady claim in the Federal court pending exhaustion of that claim in the State court?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where was that colloquy?  I remember witnesses saying he looked weird, he looked wild-eyed.  Where was the answer that he looked -- that--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --You recognize that a -- a defense like this, that the defendant was high on drugs, that's -- isn't it ambivalent?  I mean, a jury, just like it might react adversely to the defendant if he says I was drunk on alcohol, that they might say: This is a person who put himself in the condition where his will could be overpowered.  This was a voluntary act.  Why should we consider it?  Why should we consider it mitigating?  We -- we could just as well consider it aggravating.   ",07-1114
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But what about the prosecutor who said ""baloney""?  He said -- the prosecutor -- the prosecutor says: The defendant tells you he was a drug user.  Baloney, he was a drug dealer.  The prosecutor deliberately tried to paint this man as somebody who had a huge quantity of drugs, which he did, and he was dealing in them.  I mean the -- the prosecutor tried to portray a man who was a coldblooded killer, who didn't have any blurred vision.  And that line to the jury -- ""baloney"" he says he was a drug user -- that, it seems to me, is exactly what the prosecutor wanted to do, is to tell this jury this guy's a dealer; he's not a drug abuser.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Spell out the waiver in light of what he said.  The first time he learns that these -- the cases, other cases cited and he has access to the district attorney's file, he then files a habeas, State habeas petition in which he says that the facts on which his Brady claim rests have been revealed through disclosure of the State's file which occurred after the first conviction proceeding.  Those words are in the affidavit, right, that came with the second petition?  So how could he possibly have waived it when he has explained it wasn't available to him?   ",07-1114
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then you're doing away with the first Terry factor altogether.  You're saying all you need is a reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous.  What happened to the reasonable suspicion that a crime has just been committed or is in the course of being committed?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then you are doing away with the first Terry factor.  There are two factors, you recognize: one, reasonable, articulable suspicion that a crime is afoot; and, two, this person is reasonably suspected of being armed and dangerous.  Your answer to Justice Souter suggests that you don't need the first one.  You don't need to have any suspicion that a crime is afoot; it's enough for you to reasonably suspect that the person is armed and dangerous.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But Officer Trevizo herself testified that she thought the seizure part was over.  She asked him would he get out of the car, and then she said -- I think she used the word ""consensual"" herself, that it was a consensual encounter.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That after the initial seizure was over, and then she wanted to question him about gang -- his gang affiliations -- and didn't she testify?  I seem to remember she did, and she said it -- it was voluntary.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  When -- when did this end?  You said -- you said when the car is stopped everyone is seized, the driver and the passengers as well.  The seizure ends at some point.  Is that when the driver is ticketed and the police cruise off or--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Then how did the -- how did the officer come up with the marijuana as well as the gun?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you say -- your brief goes much, much further.  And I'm looking at page 9 where you say, police have to be able to protect  ""the officer's safety from a person reasonably believed to be armed and dangerous whenever the officer encounters that person in a place where the officer has a lawful right to be. ""  I read that to mean if the law officer is on the street, in a pub, any place where he has a lawful right to be, that officer can, on the basis of a suspicion of armed and dangerous, pat down.  And you don't need the first Terry.  It's only -- it's only the armed and dangerous.   INTERRUPTING ",07-1122
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's not what Mr. -- Mr. Parkhurst said in his opening that the traffic stop is the equivalent of the articulable suspicion that a crime was afoot.  It justifies this stop, and then you have to have something further to justify the pat down, but this -- the car, the seizure of the car and its passengers, that is the equivalent of the first Terry.  And why isn't that so?  It's a stop.  It's a legitimate stop.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And then don't you lose under that line of cases, Bostick and -- this is the picture that the officer was painting, or I thought it was, to bring this within the  ""Mind if I search your luggage. ""  category of cases.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So he says yes.  So she's got to have consent.  She doesn't have to -- she said, he said okay, he would get out and talk to me; he said okay when I began to pat him down; it's only in the middle of it he began to wriggle a little bit.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How could he not be dangerous?  I mean, first, she said: I suspected him because he was looking behind.  But then she said he was wearing the clothes of a gang.  And then he admits to having been convicted of a burglary.  Why isn't it very normal for a person to be apprehensive?   ",07-1122
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Maybe you could lift the podium?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But we can hear you.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Rothfeld, I follow your argument entirely, and then in the civil rights area there are a lot of overlapping statutes.  You can sue under title VII.  It doesn't take away your right under 1981.  But in this case, if we get down to what this case is about, we have a determination by a court that the school district acted reasonably in relation to these complaints.  And then you say: But we have constitutional claim.  A constitutional claim requires you to show deliberate, intentional conduct if it's an individual; if you are talking about an institution, some kind of not just one incident, but a custom, a pattern.  What, when you get down to the merits, is different about those?  In other words, is it on the wrong track to talk about precluding a statute instead of talking about just plain old issue preclusion?  What is different about 1983?  Yes, you have two claims, but if you lose under IX, you are going to lose under 1983 as well.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What more?  What more is alleged in the complaint?  I thought the complaint just spoke about deliberate indifference.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Spell that out -- spell that out practically.  I know you used the disparate--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But there was no allegation at all of that kind in this complaint.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I still don't follow.  What disparate treatment?  Did you have to have that they treated girl's complaints one way and boy's complaints another way?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And as far as this record shows, there has just been this one incident of harassment--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But we find that out on remand.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What you're saying is they made a basic legal error.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You may have a losing case under 1983, but let the First Circuit decide that?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, because they were relying on cases where we did say that a very detailed scheme was pre-emptive.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And it did that because if you could use 1983, then the very elaborate mechanism that Congress had set up, who would use it?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Just on that one issue on attorneys' fees.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Have there been any decisions on title VI and 1983?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And those constitutional rights have -- I think it might be -- it's at least arguable that it would be harder to win a 1983 case, given that, as to the individual, you have qualified immunity, and, as to the institution, you have to show a custom or practice.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It would be a different claim, but there would be issue preclusion.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the official -- it's the plaintiff who would be precluded.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the plaintiff has had a full and fair opportunity to argue those issues.   INTERRUPTING ",07-1125
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Go over -- go over that again.  I didn't understand it.  You said title IX provides--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --against sex discrimination than the Constitution does.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Explain that to me.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Give me an example.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And what would the standard be under 1983?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But they didn't go on issue preclusion.  If they had done that, it would be a different case.  They said that title IX is pre-emptive of 1983.  And they cited the cases where -- like Smith against Robinson where that is what the Court held.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --You -- you must, I think, recognize that the elaborate scheme that Congress set up under the Education of the Handicapped Act is quite different from what this Court did.  It just said there's a private right -- right of action.  There's an implied private right of action.  It didn't set up any administrative mechanism.  It didn't set up any regime for going to an agency first and then coming to the court, none of that.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you have any case in all of title IX where -- that fits that abstract picture that you have just described?  I mean, you have to have a pattern and practice of what?  A pattern and practice of discrimination to get -- to get under the Constitution or under 1983.  You have to have deliberate indifference to what?  To the gender harassment, to the gender discrimination.  So can you describe to me anything, any title IX case that has a disparate impact?  We really didn't want to -- a Feeney type of case.  We really didn't want this to happen but we had a test, and it came out that way.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can you describe a title IX case that's like Feeney in that respect where we didn't want this diverse impact to occur; we really didn't want it at all, but it happened?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  On the basis of gender.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And Feeney says it wasn't on the basis of gender.  It was on the basis that she wasn't a veteran.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there is -- there is -- you are leaving out something quite glaring in that respect.  For example, single-sex schools, military academies, admissions to elementary and high schools are not covered by title IX.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Wouldn't your reasoning apply to, say, a race discrimination case in employment?  You've got title VII and you have 1981.  Title VII has a lot of accoutrements, a lot of text to go through; 1981 is plain and simple.  So therefore, title VII ought to pre-empt 1981, right?  So you -- in the area of race discrimination and employment, title VII would end any access to 1981.  It would be the same kind of argument, wouldn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What has that got to do with what you were arguing?  That is, you've got an elaborate mechanism, which you said you have under title IX.  I think that is debatable.  But that was certainly the picture in Smith, and it's the picture in title VII, title VII versus 1981.  That -- that fits your -- the -- your description, title VII and 1981, much better than title IX and 1983, I think.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There was no constitutional claim in -- what was it -- Palos Verdes.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought you just said deliberate indifference under both statutes, under 1983 and title IX.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then you wouldn't have gender discrimination.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Responds to what?  In response to--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --So you wouldn't have -- if you work for a municipality and your boss has been harassing you, you would not have a case under 1983?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, you were saying the constitutional standard is different, so I was just giving you a case.  It could be a school; it could be another -- another municipal employment.   ",07-1125
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, can we go back to the question that was first posed?  We have never held that every agency -- you know, agencies come in many sizes and shapes -- that in all cases, the APA places the burden on the appellant or the petitioner.  But this Court has never held that across the board, no matter what agency we are talking about, that's the rule.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if the government has the obligation at the very first to tell the veteran what the veteran must produce to substantiate the claim and the government doesn't do that, why shouldn't it be the responsibility of the government to say to the court: This is what -- if we had done what we were supposed to do, this is what we would have included in our notice.  And looking at that, the court can tell whether there's anything the veteran might have done.  But why shouldn't the government at least have the obligation to say what it would have done had it complied with the statute, what it would have said specifically in this case?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What is the experience?  When -- when a case is remanded, it goes back to the -- does it go back to the regional?  Suppose the -- the veteran is now given an opportunity to present whatever additional substantiation.   ",07-1209
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Does the -- notice can be given -- skipped entirely, as it was in Simmons' case, or notice could be given but it's defective.  It can be defective in a major way.  It can leave out -- you said Congress recently required a more detailed notice.  Do we treat all those like -- as long as the notice doesn't measure up fully to the statutory requirement, then the veteran goes back to square one?  And so, you wouldn't make any distinction between whether the notice was not given at all, and the case where the notice was given, but it was incomplete?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Your case is one where the veteran did get what they call the first-level notice?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So if Justice -- the implication of Justice Breyer's question is that your client would lose because your client did get the first-level notice.  And you say, but that's not good enough.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you know where this first level, second level -- I'm looking at the statute on page 98a of the petition.  And it seems to me all part of one -- it is one notice.  It doesn't seem to specify a second and a third.  It's describing the contents.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  ""As part of that notice, the Secretary shall indicate which portion of the information and evidence is to be provided by the claimant and which portion by the Secretary. ""  The statute seems to be talking about one notice, not ""first level"", ""second level"".   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that was taken out, the fourth one.  No?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Shapiro, we are dealing with a State supreme court, and our bottom line always reads  ""for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. ""  And it was my understanding that a State court can resolve a case on an alternate State law ground, if there is such a ground in the case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Didn't -- did the Court -- I mean, that's -- suppose the -- what is it called -- ""correct in all respects"" had been raised and decided by the Oregon Supreme Court in the first instance.  Suppose it had said, well, we don't have to deal with whether Instruction 34 was right or wrong in this particular, because it was wrong in other respects.  Suppose that had been the first time around what the Oregon Supreme Court said.  Would that have offended any Federal due process?  Would that have been an appropriate disposition for the Oregon Supreme Court to make?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How could we have determined it when the Oregon Supreme Court itself hadn't made any determination?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But we don't decide questions, particularly questions of State law, that may have a Federal check.  But we don't decide them in the first instance.  And there's one point, Mr. Shapiro, that I think is -- affects this concern of fairness to the party who raised this ""correct in all respects"" from the beginning.  This Court had not clarified, had it, until the Williams case itself, the rule about harm to others?  In State Farm, we were talking about harm to nonresidents.  So if I recall correctly, Williams was the first time we ever clarified that harm to others included people within the same State; is that correct?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought the notion was one issue, one charge.  And it wasn't in just one practice manual.  There were a few cited in the brief that the charge should be limited to one issue, one point of law.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I thought that the whole thing about -- this is the NAACP case you that you're discussing?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --that this was something that the Alabama Supreme Court really sprung at the last minute, that it was not like this rule.  There were not 28 cases in the Alabama Supreme Court applying the rule.  It seemed to be quite a novel rule.

And I don't think that -- that the -- the incorrect portions of the charge that have now -- are now before us were -- were even reached then.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And where is this colloquy?  I mean, we went through the parts, she said I think it's covered and it was okay.  You seem to be saying more than was included in that colloquy.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You've made it much clearer than it was.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I don't get the diligence part because the whole ineffective assistance of counsel is the client isn't expected to do any of this; it's counsel that's been ineffective.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So, it doesn't translate into ineffective assistance of counsel because the client is not the one -- the lawyer has been -- has not been diligent, but there is nothing that the client could do.  I just don't see how--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --how you could talk about the diligent -- the diligent client bringing up the ineffectiveness of his lawyer.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you use the -- to say that it's a new claim, because that's what it has to be, right, but it's such an extraordinary use of ""claim"".  I mean, we have exhibit cases, the notion is a claim, is a tort claim or a contract claim, but not additional evidence in support of the basic claim.  The basic claim is ineffective assistance of counsel.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I that what it was saying is there is legitimate -- this is a Strickland question.  Strickland has two parts.  Part A is were counsel inadequate; and Part B is did it make any difference?  It seemed to me the district court was just making a straight out Strickland determination and not deferring to anything else.  It was just saying no, I've looked at all the evidence, and yes -- they certainly were -- they were not effective.  On the other hand, there is no prejudice because using the strict Strickland test, there was no reasonable likelihood that a jury would have come out differently.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think she said--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --she answered -- the answer that I wrote is the same thing that you could have on the Brady claim you could also have for ineffective assistance of counsel.

So the -- the whole thing about clearly erroneous in the district court, that -- that should be out of the -- the case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Wasn't there also something about the revocations?  There were three revocations involved, I thought, and he got 2 years on each.   ",07-1315
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't there something on the other side?  You seem to present this as a case where counsel did a careful job, and then he lost faith.  He lost hope, and so he acted irrationally.  But wasn't there on the other side consideration of the sentence that he was going to get, and might not a lawyer perfectly rationally think, if I give up this defense, it's just going to waste everybody's time?  The judge is going to give me the benefit of -- of having done that in the sentence, in giving a lower sentence, in giving -- making the sentences on the multiple offenses concurrent rather than consecutive.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Had Wager ever represented a defendant who pled NGI?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is that the special -- he made a request for a particular prison.  Is that the one?   ",07-1315
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It would make no difference, I take it, General McAllister, if this had been a police officer who was pretending to be a cellmate.  In this case it was a snitch, but it could be the police officer doing inside the cell what he couldn't do outside.  That is, the police officer outside who wants to interrogate must inform the arrestee of his Miranda rights, but inside the cell, the police could pretend to be a jailbird and they can -- can get the information that way.  Is that--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --So the police know that they -- they can get around the clear prohibition on their questioning without Miranda warnings by pretending to be a jailbird.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, I'm -- I'm assuming we're not in the area where the jail mate is -- is simply passive.  In -- in this case, the -- the jail mate made a statement that encouraged the defendant.  He wasn't just passive.  He was encouraging the defendant to speak.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Anyway, your answer is that a police officer could affirmatively elicit testimony?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you're -- you're talking about impeachment only.  We're not talking about the case-in-chief.  So if the police -- he can't -- outside, when he questions the defendant and gives no Miranda warnings, that's inadmissible.  Right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you're -- you're making no distinction, then, between the Fifth and Sixth Amendment.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the argument that essentially this is like taking a pretrial deposition, only one side isn't represented?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is that really verifiable?  Do police officers who engage snitches, do they get disciplined, especially if they are then able to accomplish what was accomplished here?  That is, the -- the testimony -- the snitch is then able to testify after the defendant testifies.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  At the Federal level, is there anything one way or another, any manual that instructs a U.S. attorney about the use of snitches to extract confessions?   ",07-1356
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But we do know that unlike the police giving Miranda warnings, there's no warning here at all.  I mean, he thinks he's talking to a cellmate.  Nobody tells him, remember, you've got a right to be represented by counsel, and he's essentially giving a statement without the Miranda warnings.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the other side says well, practically the defendant is much more likely to say something that's really involuntary when he's confronting police officers -- that the reason that we exclude in the case of a police officer is the intimidating setting when the defendant is in the police station or in the cell and there are these police officers.  Now he thinks he's just with a cellmate, so there isn't -- there isn't the coercive atmosphere that there is when the police do the questioning.   ",07-1356
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But, General Bennett, if I understand correctly, looking to your question presented, the only thing before us is the effect of the Apology Resolution.  The question presented doesn't say anything about the Admissions Act or the Newlands Resolution.  So shouldn't we just stick to the question as you presented it?  Whatever the picture is, does the Apology Resolution have any substantive effect?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why is it necessary?  Why isn't it sufficient just to say that this resolution has no substantive effect, period, and then remand to the Hawaii Supreme Court?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There -- there may well be, but then the Hawaii Supreme Court chose its grounds, and it said at one point the resolution dictates the preservation of the ceded lands.  At another place it said that Federal law provides the basis for its decision and that State trust law is interwoven with that Federal law.  It also said that Federal law grounds the decision and provides the governing legal standard.  Now, they could not have been clearer.  They repeated at least five times that their decision rested on the resolution, that everything turned on that resolution having substantive effect.  That's why they said their decision was driven by Federal law.  And I don't know why we shouldn't take the Hawaii Supreme Court at its word repeated so many times.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  We don't -- we don't know that for sure.  It may well be, but there is a large -- large difference, and if they're relying on the Federal ground that insulates them from any check by the Hawaii polity, but if they are forced to rely on State law, then it's up to the people of Hawaii whether they like it or not.  They could change the State statutory law, equitable notions, constitutional law.  But by doing what the Hawaii Supreme Court did, they have taken the case out of the realm of State law, subject to the political check, put it on Federal grounds.  So I think that that's what -- the issue properly before this Court, and not anything about the interpretation of the Admissions Act, which -- if it's implicit in your question, it's a little hard to see.  Ordinarily, if a party wants us to address the effect of a piece of legislation, they will mention that in the question presented.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the legislature, if it wanted to -- as I understand the Admission Act, it lists five purposes; it says any one purpose.  And the legislature, if it so chose, could say, we want this property -- the proceeds from this property to be for the exclusive betterment of the conditions of the Native Hawaiians.  They could -- it would be up to the legislature to give it all to the Native Hawaiians, wouldn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  More than--   William M. Jay  --dictated the injunction.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --More than significance.  I am reading the sentence that immediately follows the one that General Bennett brought to our attention on page 85a.  It says,  ""Accordingly, the Apology Resolution dictates that the ceded lands should be preserved pending a reconciliation between the United States and the native Hawaiian people. ""  It is very clear language -- ""dictates"".  And that's why I am really puzzled how this Court has any business wading into any other question other than telling the Hawaii Supreme Court either their right about what the resolution dictates or they are wrong, and that they are wrong because it's a nice apology, but it's without substantive effect.   William M. Jay  Well, I certainly agree, Justice Ginsburg, that the State supreme court thought the Apology Resolution dictated the entry of the injunction, and the -- also on page 85a, the State supreme court says that the Apology Resolution gives rise to the -- to a fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiians.  And it is -- it is that principle that the State supreme court was able to find a fiduciary duty and impose it on the State's trusteeship obligation, even though that -- that fiduciary duty arises outside the section 5(f) trust.  And that is why we think that the scope of the State -- of the State's obligation as trustee is within the Court's review at this stage.   ",07-1372
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then how to you explain the language, just over and over again -- I won't repeat it -- but they said this resolution of ours is dictated by, compelled by, the Apology Resolution?  Without the Apology Resolution, it would be an entirely different case.  And now you seem to be taking what the Hawaii Supreme Court put as the necessary link, the Apology Resolution -- before that this would have been impossible -- and you are treating it now as sort of window dressing, icing on the cake, really didn't matter.  But we would disrespect the Hawaii Supreme Court if we didn't take them at their word and say -- using words such as ""dictated"", ""compelled"".  You -- you are treating this as sort of just part of the atmosphere.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's what you relied on--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --but it's not what the Hawaii Supreme Court relied on, and I would repeat the point I made in the prior argument: What's worrisome about this is they are fastening on a piece of Federal legislation and say, we are compelled to do this because of Federal law.  What that does is it removes it from the Hawaii political process.  If they left Federal law out of it, and they said truly this decision rests on State law, we think that the title belongs with the Native Hawaiians, then they have to answer to the polity.  And here the Hawaii Supreme Court insulates themselves by using the Federal law as a crutch.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If -- if you took Federal law, the Apology Resolution, out of the picture, the Hawaii Supreme Court could reach the result that it reached, and then we might have questions about its consistency with the Admissions Act and the Newlands Resolution.  But, as Justice Breyer said, if we disabuse them of the notion that there is any Federal compulsion here, then the rest is to be sorted out.  We wouldn't have to say that they have a good claim under State law, just not address it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the political process question I think is really bothersome, that the Hawaii Supreme Court chose to use this Federal crutch.  It seems a very weak reed.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And do you think--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Do you think that that resolution is distinguishable in any way from the apology that the United States made to the people of Japanese ancestry who were interned after World War II?  The United States did say -- what was -- I think it was an executive order by President Ford, but it was in no uncertain terms, stated that the United States made a dreadful error, there was never basis for rounding those people up and putting them in interment camps.  Did -- is there any difference?  And that, as I understand it, had no substantive effect until Congress passed legislation providing for compensation.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The Native Hawaiians--  --The Native Hawaiians -- they do get 20 percent of the proceeds, correct?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And what -- that comes out of Hawaii legislation?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The -- the $5.5 million figure, is that the subject of litigation?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can I--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Can I go back to your -- your suggestion that this is a moot case because the government -- because the -- the governor agrees with your position.  But wasn't a lot of money already sunk into developing this area of Maui for desperately needed housing?   ",07-1372
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the question--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But the question presented, General Kneedler, was limited to IMLA, to the Mineral Leasing Act.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --That was the government's question presented.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  General Kneedler, the last time -- the last time around, we remanded for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.  Would you advocate a different bottom line this time?   ",07-1410
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But, Mr. Phillips, I'm looking at the last paragraph in the opinion.  It said:  ""We have no warrant from any relevant statute or regulation. ""  et cetera.  So it wasn't limited to IMLA.  Do you think that was just carelessness on the Court's part?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  With respect to that--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --the opinion in the last time around not only contained the statement that I read before, that is, ""any relevant statute"", but in the very beginning it says,  ""We hold the tribe's claim for compensation from the Federal Government fails. ""  and there is a well-known distinction between a claim and an issue and attributing to the Court that kind of carelessness for saying that the claim is barred as distinguished from an issue, the issue being IMLA -- I think the Court was conscious of that distinction when it used the words that the ""claim"" fails, not just the issue.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So did you, Mr. Phillips.  Last time around you acknowledged that the Peabody lease was governed only by IMLA.  That -- those words were from your brief last time around.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, you are really saying that you were wrong in make that concession.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In -- IMLA--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But it is the statute that seems most closely on point, because it's the only one that talks about mineral leases exclusively.   ",07-1410
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That was pursuant to -- to an affirmative action plan, and here we're dealing with this concept under Title VII of disparate impact.  And let's take for one example a test that's given by a police department, a fire department, and it -- it's a physical fitness test, and it disproportionately excludes female applicants.  And when the results come in and there are no women on the eligibility list, the department reconsiders.  It thinks there is something wrong with this test.  It can probably test for the necessary skills in a way that will not achieve those results.  Would it be similarly impermissible, similarly based on an impermissible criterion, if the department said: We're not going to -- we have got the results of that test.  We're going to throw it out and substitute another that will not have those skewed results.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Not more women on the force, but this test that we're giving has the effect of excluding most women, just as the high school diploma had the effect, a disproportionate effect, on one race.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So they would have to go -- I take it from what you said they would have to go as far as proving a Title VII disparate impact case against themselves.  They couldn't do anything short of that to prevail when it is the majority race that is complaining about discrimination.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It wasn't my--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, that can't be right if they -- if what you just answered to Justice Kennedy is -- is right.  Suppose they had very strong evidence that the test that they had given that had these results, just as my physical fitness test that excluded all women -- that had it those results, it wasn't job-related, and there was a better test available, they wouldn't have any vested right in getting the promotions under those circumstances, would they?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then why did they have the testimony before the Civil Service Board, about -- somebody from another testing company said this is a multiple choice test; it tests rote memory; we could have come up with a test that would better test the skills needed to be -- nothing about the localization, but something about command presence.  There was a term used, assessment centers; that this test didn't effectively test the skills that you needed on the job, and others did.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I thought the whole idea of disparate impact is it's unintentional, that's the assumption, disparate treatment, intentional discrimination, disparate impact, unintentional, but it has askewed racial results.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How do we know whether something is discriminatory or just that it will have a certain effect?  Because it's in spite of.  For example, the Greek standard, the employer wants everybody to have a high school diploma, he wants an upgraded working staff, was told by this Court you can't do that because you would disproportionately exclude one race.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How does that--   Edwin S. Kneedler  --more than simply a disparate--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I know you said that in your brief when you made a distinction between mere good faith and reasonable belief.  So how does one determine whether the concern that the employer is expressing is really in good faith or is reasonable?  What are the indicia of reasonableness?   Edwin S. Kneedler  --I -- for example, a -- a gross statistical disparity.  A statistical disparity makes out a prima facie case under Title VII.  We're not saying that in all cases simply a statistical disparity would be sufficient.  A gross statistical disparity could lead the -- the employer to believe that something was wrong with the test.  So I think -- but in addition if the employer has concerns about the validity of the test -- as you pointed out, concerns were expressed to the Civil Service Board in this case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can you be--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Can you be specific about what facts you think should be tried on remand?  Because you do distance yourself from the Respondents.  You are not urging affirmance of the summary judgment.  You say there are or may be genuine issues of fact.  So what are they?   Edwin S. Kneedler  --Well, I think they go primarily to the district court's identification of diversity and -- and role models as possible motivations for what the -- what the employer was doing.  The plaintiffs have also alleged that the -- that there was influence on the Civil Service Board external to the -- to the board's own decision.  By the way, I should point out in this regard, at pages 166 and 167 of the Joint Appendix, the two board members who voted not to certify expressed concerns about the validity of the test based on what they had heard at the hearing.  We don't think realistically a board in this situation should be required to do more, because it's important to recognize that the -- what the employer did here was not what concerned the Court in Wygant and cases like this.  The Court -- the employer did not adopt racial classifications with all the potential for adverse consequences for individuals who are labeled by race and promote on the basis of race.  That's not what the employer did here.  The employer paused and decided that there might be another nondiscriminatory or less discriminatory means.  In other words--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  When -- when I asked that you question, you said that one issue of fact was whether the board was acting in response to improper influence, to racial politics.   Edwin S. Kneedler  Yes.  That -- the district court rejected that argument and whether or not that should be revisited on remand is -- is another matter.  We're--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if it were shown that, in fact, this test was not job-related and, in fact, the majority of fire departments scotched this test years ago and substituted what most agree is a better test, even so you would say it would violate the rights of the plaintiffs you represent, even--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Even if there's strong evidence that it's not job-related and that there's a better test that doesn't produce these skewed results?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But what -- what would that do to the civil service merit system that says if you pass the test you should be certified?   INTERRUPTING ",07-1428

What has New Haven done in order to get lieutenants and captains in the fire department?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  When you say ""take away barriers"", one thing is not a hundred percent clear.  Your position is we have to do this in order to avoid Title VII disparate impact liability.  Are you not reciting as a justification either the diversity in police -- policing firefighting or still overcoming a legacy of the past where fire departments were among the most notorious excluders on the basis of race?  You are not -- you are not saying rectification of past discrimination?  You are not saying diversity?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What do you mean by--   ",07-1428
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't there something odd about saying if it's really fundamental like the presence or absence of subject matter jurisdiction, that is not reviewable?  It's not disputed, right?  That if the district court says, I lack subject matter jurisdiction over, let's say, the RICO claim, as wrong as that might be, that would not be reviewable, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Though that could be a very grave error and yet, on a matter of discretion, that that would be reviewable.  And I appreciate your statutory argument, but it just seems odd to think that Congress would want to be firm that if the -- if the remand is for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, wrong or right, no review; but if it's a discretionary exercise -- I could keep this, but I choose not to -- that that is reviewable.  That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to say the judge who could keep it or remand it, that that action is reviewable, but the action of saying I don't have jurisdiction, when indeed the court did have jurisdiction, is just totally immune from review.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But wouldn't it be -- I mean, here the district judge said: I got rid of the RICO claim; all that's left are State law claims, and there's no Federal interest in this case anymore.  They're all State law claims, they belong in State court, good-bye.  I could keep it, I choose not to, because it isn't a sound use of the resources of the Federal court.  Now, even if you're right that this is a discretionary decision, so you can't say no jurisdiction because the discretion implies that there is power, isn't it 99 cases out of 100 that the court of appeals, assuming reviewability, will say, we should defer to the district judges on questions of this nature, the district judge's decision that this isn't worth the time of the Federal court?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But wouldn't you -- as a practical judgment, the Federal claim is gone, there is pendent jurisdiction -- or it's now supplemental jurisdiction -- over the State claim, but the district court is told by Congress: It's your call; it's a matter of discretion.  And the judge gives one of the reasons that's enumerated, that reason being that the State claims are overwhelming in this case, the RICO claim is dismissed, thinking it was worthless, so it's a State case.  Why would a court of appeals overturn such a judgment?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that -- because you'd would have to retread the same ground in the State court that had already been covered in the Federal court, but that's not the kind of case that was presented here.  I know the case has lingered for a long time, but there was no processing of those State law claims.  The judge concentrated on RICO, threw it out, and said, the rest of the claims I'm not interested in.  So it's not a case like the Fifth Circuit where there was a large investment of Federal court energy and time, and sending it back would mean going over once again what had already transpired in the Federal court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Could you explain why that is a Federal question?  It's a dispute over the ownership of this invention, right?  So it's not a question of the validity of a patent or infringement of a patent?  It's just the invention is like any res, and two parties are disputing about ownership.  Why is -- why does that become a Federal case?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --How could we do that in light of Thermtron?  Thermtron went against the clear text of the statute that says remands are not reviewable, period; and in Thermtron the Court said, yes, they are sometimes, if we think it's so outrageous for a district judge to say: Yes, I've got jurisdiction over this case, but my docket is so crowded, and this is a -- this is a small-change case; it belongs in State court.  The Court, I think, was outraged by a district court thinking that it could dump a case simply because it was too busy with more important things.  That was -- that was the setting of Thermtron, and to reach the result that the Court reached, the Court had to go against the language of the statute which -- which read in absolute terms.  But anyway, the Court did that, and then they gave a rationale for what the new test was going to be.  It was no longer going to be remands are no longer -- remands are not reviewable; it's going to be -- that applies only to the cases where -- what was it, subsections (c) and (d) of 1447?  That -- it -- the Court read the statute to say less than it in fact did.  That's what Thermtron did.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the only -- one clear way to do it would be to overrule Thermtron, but neither party has asked for that.  You haven't asked for it, and the other side hasn't asked for it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But your concern is what was the Court's reasoning, and you could apply the Court's reasoning, its interpretation of 1447.   ",07-1437
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that was a dissenting opinion, and that was how many years ago?  How many years?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you have a majority rationale that says, although 1447(d) reads in absolute terms, in fact the only remands that it -- that it covers are those based on a defect in the removal or lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  So you can't -- you can't say, well, Thermtron had a result that we can limit to Thermtron's own unusual facts, because the Court gave a rationale.  I mean, courts give reasons for what they do.  And the Court drastically limited 1447(d) when it said 1447(d) has to be read consonant with 1447(c), and 1447(c) deals with only two kinds of remands, one for defective removal and the other for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What in addition to the civil rights provision?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then that's a specific statute that would prevail over the general provision.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But Things Remembered, I think, was raised very carefully, just to say that the question that's before the Court now has not been decided before, the precise question here--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --of discretionary remand?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So I think -- I looked again at Things Remembered, and it turned out to be just as I remembered it ----  [Laughter]  --that it was neutral, colorless.  It just said we haven't been confronted with this issue.  And I think Powerex said the same thing, although it said it in more definite terms -- it is far from clear.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where did the -- maybe the district judge didn't say that.  Maybe you can point me to the place where it did.  But if it did say it, it's flatly wrong, because there is -- that's what supplemental jurisdiction is.  It's says you have jurisdiction.  It's a huge difference between you have no jurisdiction, you are powerless--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --and you have power, but it's up to you to exercise it or not.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It -- it wasn't a discretionary decision about RICO.  RICO -- there was no Federal claim stated.  That's out of it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What the district court has jurisdiction over are the supplemental claims, which it can choose not to exercise, but it can say, ""I don't have jurisdiction"", because Congress has given supplemental jurisdiction but then left it to the court to remand on stated conditions.  But you -- you seem to conflate the absence of subject matter jurisdiction with a discretionary decision not to exercise subject matter jurisdiction that the court undoubtedly has.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then -- then what you are doing is that you are using the label ""subject matter jurisdiction"" in a way that seems to me, that is, there are many categories that could be ambiguous at the edges, but not subject matter jurisdiction.  Subject matter jurisdiction means, court, you have no power, period.  There's no diversity, there's no Federal question, there's no other basis for the Federal court to exercise jurisdiction.  And to say, well, we can extend the label ""subject matter jurisdiction"" to include a case where the district court chooses not to hear certain claims, even though it has jurisdiction over them, I think is a -- is a -- a misapplication of the notion subject matter jurisdiction.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but not subject matter jurisdiction.  Jurisdiction is personal jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction.  What I did in Arbaugh was to explain that all kinds of things, like time limits on when you can sue, have been labeled jurisdictional and mandatory when in fact they are not.  They are simply statutes of limitation.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why is it only technical?  It says, court, you can exercise power.  Subject matter jurisdiction is the power that the court has to hear a given controversy, and under supplemental jurisdiction, there is undoubted power in the district court to hear those claims.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You -- you put it in terms in your brief -- if I understood your position correctly -- yes, there is subject matter jurisdiction over supplemental claims, but once the district court chooses not to exercise that jurisdiction, it -- and these were the words you used -- ""it divests itself of jurisdiction"".   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The discretionary--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --The discretionary decision is that it chooses not to hear the case.  It's not -- there's no discretion there.  There's nothing discretionary about saying we have no jurisdiction.  ""We have no jurisdiction"" means we have no power.  So the -- the two are just at odds with each other.  No power, yes power, but we choose not to exercise it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that would argue for a highly deferential standard of review, respecting the district judge's determination that it's not what -- it hasn't invested any time in these questions, and it shouldn't because they are purely State-law questions.  That's -- but that's something quite different from -- from a -- the -- the terminology that you used is troublesome because a court doesn't have power to divest itself of jurisdiction.  If Congress gives it jurisdiction, it has it, and the court can't divest itself of that.  It can, if Congress permits it, decline to exercise jurisdiction, but a court is not capable of divesting itself of jurisdiction.   ",07-1437

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Verrilli, do I understand correctly that the scenario here was the defendant, uncounseled, was taken before a judicial officer who read him rather standard information, one piece of information was, I'm appointing a lawyer for you?  Was there any opportunity for the defendant to say anything at that hearing?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  He didn't get -- he didn't in fact get a lawyer.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And is that standard operating procedure at these 72-hour hearings: That the -- the defendant, who is there uncounseled is -- is just standing there, and the judicial officer says: I'm appointing counsel for you, and he goes on to the next thing he's telling him?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is that how it operates?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did anybody ever tell him he needed to request?  I mean, he had just been told by a judicial officer: I'm appointing counsel for you.  He's not counseled at that point.  How does he know that, in order to protect his right to counsel, he has to make some kind of an affirmative assertion?  He's just been told he's got one.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I would have no problem at all with the argument you are making if someone had told him that he needed to do that.  But he didn't have a judge to tell him that; he didn't have a lawyer to tell him that; and the police certainly didn't tell him that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's very puzzling.  This is an experienced police officer.  The 72-hour hearing is required in every case where defendant is in State custody.  So how could an experienced police officer not know?  Somebody, by the way, who knew this man had been kept until -- even more than 72 hours.  And he testifies -- it's true that Detective Hall testified: I didn't know that he appointed -- had been appointed a lawyer.  The very same day that he got to the 72-hour hearing a day late, how could he not have known?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Louisiana.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did the Louisiana Supreme Court say there has to be a request?  I thought they said there had to be some action, affirmative act of acceptance.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's just that everything after -- as far as I understand, the only piece of evidence we're talking about is his condolence letter to the widow which amounted to a confession of guilt.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There is no other.  Because all of the Mirandized pre 72-hour hearing, all that is not in contest; all of that came in.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Landry, you're trying to explain your position, let's assume, to an intelligent layperson, and the first example is, in many States at the equivalent of the 72-hour hearing, the defendant is told: The court is prepared to appoint a lawyer for you.  Would you like us to appoint a lawyer?  And the defendant will say yes.  So he will have made the request for a lawyer.  And then there are States like Louisiana where this is a rapid-fire proceeding, and the defendant isn't asked any questions, he isn't asked to agree or disagree, and he doesn't have any lawyer there to assist him.  So you are essentially asking the Court to make a distinction between defendants in the same position, both uncounseled, both not knowledgeable in the law, but the one who has the good fortune to be in a State where the judge tells the defendant,  ""You have a right to have a lawyer. ""  ""Would you like me to appoint one? ""  And then this procedure.  Shouldn't defendant's rights turn on that distinction in the State law?   ",07-1529

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The problem I have with that line you're pursuing is the FOB destination> [""] term is an eminently fixable connection, and CERCLA is -- can be a punishing statute, but the one thing that was not intended was for the party to arrange themselves out of arranger liability by providing neatly that the moment the product reaches a destination there's no continuing responsibility on the part of the seller.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, one -- one benefit would be avoiding CERCLA liability through a means other than what I call a fixable connection.  Is this the first occasion on which Shell, because of its sales of D-D, has been charged with CERCLA liability?  Is this a case of first impression, or have there been other instances in which Shell did very much the same thing, delivered the D-D FOB destination?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought there was as part of this picture that Shell had a manual which told its purchasers how to handle this material, and that Shell was well aware that B&B was not following the precautions laid out in the manual.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This court -- this court, Ms. Mahoney, didn't deny apportionment.  Apportionment was never requested.  The court said:  ""I'm going to have to figure this out on my own. ""  In fact, the court deplored the parties for following what he called a ""scorched-earth tactic"".  So the apportionment is not something that has been denied to the PRPs in this case.  It's something that the court thought was proper and fair, but it didn't deny any request made by parties, isn't that so?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can you point to me the part of the district court opinion that conflicts with the part that I remember so well?  He is saying, this is a really tough assignment; I have to figure it out.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is it -- is it a judge's responsibility, no matter what evidence may be in the record from which one could make a finding, when a finding hasn't been sought?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that hasn't been -- that hasn't been the position of most courts under CERCLA.  I thought they -- I thought that there had been relatively few cases where apportionment, when requested, was even allowed because the theory is the act provides for contribution.  One PRP can go after another, but the party who shouldn't be left holding the bag is the public, the innocent victims of the pollution.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought -- I thought -- and tell me if my recollection of the facts is incorrect -- that the -- the newer parcel that enabled B&B to expand its operation, the waste went into a pond, what was called South, that was on the other side, that was on the original B&B parcel.  So you had the waste flowing from one part to the other.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's not normally how -- when -- when someone has a burden of proof, it's a burden of coming forward.  And the one thing that we do know from this district judge is he's saying, I was left largely to make it up.  What he -- the components of his allocation did not come from -- yes, there is some evidence in the record.  But ordinarily when you talk about a party who has a burden of proof, we don't mean they put in a piece here and a piece there and left it to the district judge to figure out.

That is, I thought your position is competency is a unitary notion and your opponent's position is, no, there are shades of competency.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But this is a trial judge who has a very practical, immediate concern.  And he's not looking at Dusky, not looking at Peretz.  He says: I have found that Mr. Edwards is able to stand trial with the assistance of an attorney.  I never made any finding that he was... that he was competent if he didn't have that aid.  I never found that he was competent to defend himself.  He's competent, but only if he has a lawyer who is running the show.  That was the finding that the trial judge made: That's my finding.  Are you telling me to make that finding I have to say that he's not competent to stand trial?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well... suppose the judge, the trial judge, says: Mr. Stancil, please turn to page 15 of the blue brief.  I have had considerable communication with this defendant.  Read what it says there.  Do I have to wait for this to be repeated in the courtroom?  ""Listen to this case, the foundations of my cause. ""  ""The Criminal Rule 4.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You have to stop.  I mean, you have given a reason that this might make sense.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the judge says: Does that means I have to sit here and every time he makes a statement like that explain to the jury what he meant?  Then I'm becoming involved myself in a... in a consulting role, not as an impartial judge of this case anymore, but as a kind of a facilitator of the defendant.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Stancil, you do agree that the basic precedent on which you rely, Faretta, you would be... you are asking for an extension of it because that case starts out with a defendant who is described as literate, competent, understanding.

So there was no... there is no misrepresentation made to the plaintiff but to the plaintiff's customers and suppliers.  So on your theory, is there no RICO claim because the misrepresentation was made to someone other than the plaintiff?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But no civil case in that... in that situation?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, why--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Why isn't it... there is reliance on their allegations by the county.  The county thinks that each bidder is putting in only one bid.  So the county has been deceived, and the plaintiff suffers the effect of that deception.  Why doesn't that qualify?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but that's a different point, the point that you made in your reply brief, that maybe there isn't this rotational system, and maybe they can't prove that they were... that they were injured; that they would have gotten a greater share.  But your case is about... it doesn't matter even if you... you have to accept the allegations of their complaint as true, even if everything they say in the complaint is true, they have no claim.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Becker says they were interference with a business relationship, not fraud.

So my question is whether in this procedure for dealing with subcontractors there is any kind of audit where the Navy can say, we want to see the certificates of conformance for those engines or other documents relating to them.

Otherwise they would have no claim.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the government certainly has that in its brief.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, perhaps we should ask the government to explain what its position is.  But one of the points that has been raised in opposition to your argument is that your interpretation would cut out claims that today are regarded as properly presented under the False Claims Act.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Dellinger, how was that rule settled?  You go in that story and The Amiable Nancy, but no one even raised the question of punitive or exemplary damages in those cases.  So what is the long settled line of decisions of this Court in maritime law that you are relying on?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That was on land on the railroad.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You are talking about maritime law, and relying on The Amiable Nancy.  And my only point is that was not raised, argued, or decided.  So it's rather, I think, an exaggeration to call it a long line of settled decisions in maritime law.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the Lake Shore case, if I remember right, did not involve a managerial employee.  It involved a conductor on a train.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I thought that you're talking about a different level.  I think we ought to be clear on this.  I thought it was conceded that Hazelwood was, indeed, a ""managerial agent"" as that term is used in the Restatement of Torts, right?  So you are talking about it's not good enough that you are managerial agent; you have to be in a higher echelon in the company.  That's your position?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there aren't many States that follow the Restatement position.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Am I right, Mr. Dellinger, that in the railroad case the court was dealing with the concept of respondeat superior?  It didn't make any distinction between regular employees and managerial employees, and, indeed, it was not dealing with a managerial employee.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I don't recall that they made anything about managerial.  They were just talking about respondeat superior at large, I thought.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are you--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --There was... there was sufficient evidence of that.  I mean--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --The jury could have found that Exxon knew that this captain had a severe alcohol problem; and, yet, they let him stay on voyage after voyage and did nothing about it.  So the jury could have found: Never mind the captain.  Exxon, itself, is a grave wrongdoer because it allowed the tanker to be operated by a captain who was certainly not fit.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It was a jury question.  There was evidence both ways.  So, on this issue, am I right in thinking that if you succeed, all you can get is a new trial?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And, I take it, next time around the jury would get a special verdict and be asked: Was Exxon, itself, reckless in allowing this captain to stay on the ship?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr.... Mr. Dellinger, before we get into the merits of that issue, the Clean Water Act did not enter this case until 13 months after the jury verdict.  And the trial court, who had very carefully managed this case... and it was a humongous case... would never list it as an issue in the case.  And so he said: I won't hear it 13 months after the verdict.  Why shouldn't we instruct the court of appeals that when a district judge does a diligent job like that one did to try to get at all the issues... says you're too late; you can't come in 13 months after the verdict and argue a point of law that would have overtaken the verdict, because essentially you're asking for judgment as a matter of law on this issue.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No.  Well, what did you make... you made a motion to bring up the Clean Water Act as dispositive on punitive damages, and you made that motion 13 months after the jury verdict.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And what is the basis in the Federal rules for that motion?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  13 months after the verdict.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I... that's not my question.  My question is: Under what Federal rules did you move to bring up this issue 13 months after the verdict?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  49 is on special verdicts.  What did this have to do with special verdicts?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Rule 50 is pretty strict, isn't it?  I mean, rule 50... if you want to use rule 50, you have to first move before the case goes to the jury.  And if the judge says no, I'll reserve it.  Then you move again after the jury.  And if you don't, it's got very tight timelines.  And you are arguing to a court that has held that these limitations in the Federal rules must be strictly observed.  And I don't know of any time limit in the Federal rules that's stricter than the rules that involve 50(b).   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And you didn't appeal on that.  You raised it properly, you lost on it, and you didn't appeal on TAPAA.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Statutory.  But the statute was TAPAA, and it was not the Clean Water Act.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about looking at what this Court said in TXO was proper in a punitive damages case?  That is, this spill was horrendous, but it could have been far worse.  And so, under TXO, you look at what was the... could be the maximum damage that could have been caused by this occurrence, and that could be many times--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But it wasn't--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --a factor here.

So you don't have any problem with Kolstad on that issue, if you're using it here for a managerial--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --There was a statute that was raised in the district court.  And the district court raised this TAPA Act, and they thought that that was the statutory guide, and that was the reason why there should not be punitive damages, but... so that was one of the things the court of appeals said under the head of waiver.

Now, there is something in the briefs that happened after this case was instituted, but we know from Marion County that there were 34 people who were not able to have a vote counted.

So, we know that in that one particular county, most of the people who were unable to satisfy the requirement initially ended up not satisfying it.  Is that... I mean that's not hypothetical.

That burden is on every indigent person who doesn't have a photo ID, so we are not speculating about numbers.  That would be true for every indigent person who doesn't have photo ID, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, they can go home and get the identification and go back to their precinct; that's what the indigent can't do.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Before you do that, General Clement, I'd like to you to concentrate on the one group of people where I think you can make a facial challenge and may not all speculating, and that's the indigent people who can't get... don't have the photo ID.  They don't drive, and they can't get up the money to get the birth certificate or whatever else.  They do have a burden that, it seems to me, the State could easily eliminate if they want those people to vote, and that is to say okay, do the affidavit, the whole thing in your local precinct; we'll make it easy for you and not send you away, send you off to the county courthouse to get it validated.

And my only question is, why couldn't the system make it easy for them if we really want to help America to vote, all Americans, and say we'll do it in the local precinct, somebody will be there to help you fill out the affidavit, instead of doing it in a way that's really going to discourage people from voting?

If it said the refund procedure applies to any Internal Revenue tax including one imposed in alleged violation of the Export Clause?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Nothing different from what it is now, but just Congress makes clear that a tax and alleged violation of the Export Clause falls within the term ""any Internal Revenue tax""?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought you didn't have to pay--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, what about the deficiency procedure?  And I don't know if that applies with excise taxes, but suppose they didn't pay this tax and they get a notice of deficiency.  Where would they go?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why not?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you're saying it's both.  You're not saying it's ""either/or"" because for three years you did use the refund procedure.  So you used the refund procedure for the years that were within the three-year period, and then for the years that were outside the three-year period, you have this other theory.  So you're not saying this is not for refund.  That route is closed.  The only route is this constitutional... this claim directly under the Export Clause.  But your own conduct seems to have been it's our option.  We can treat it as a refund claim or we can treat it as a constitutional claim.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In other words, what were you just telling us is that this is not a refund claim; this is a constitutional claim.  But you are now saying, I think, that it's both; it's whatever the taxpayer or the plaintiff wants it to be.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You're saying you get interest too in either way.  You're saying... I thought you said for the three years that are within the three-year refund limit, you get interest and then you're also saying, going back six years, you also get interest.  You're not saying that if you... if you're outside the refund procedure you don't get interest.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  2411... 2411 is what you use in the court when you have a straight tax refund claim.  It's not as though 2411 is there for some other claim.  It's what you get when you go to court and you're suing for a refund.  That's 2411.  That's applicable if you get a judgment for an overpayment in respect of any Internal Revenue tax.  That's what... it's in Title 28, but that's what it's for.  It's for an overpayment in respect of any Internal Revenue tax.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But... the use of any Internal Revenue tax, and your whole argument is this isn't an Internal Revenue tax.  So it's clearly not an Internal Revenue tax that you have a constitutional claim directly under the Constitution, so how does it become for purposes of 2411 an Internal Revenue tax?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you don't agree in your basic claim that if the government is treating it as an Internal Revenue tax, which it certainly didn't, you'd say that works only for the interest, not--   ",07-308X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's another assumption then that was in Justice Breyer's question about, well, you have to have the petition, the bankruptcy petition.  But in this very case wasn't the sale... wasn't the basic arrangement made the day before the petition was filed?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But are you not... are you questioning... what I understand to be the case, it's not at all uncommon for a Chapter 11 these days to have the 363(b) sale of property, then have some kind of global settlement, and then distribute all the assets, never have any kind of reorganization.  And I didn't understand that it was necessary to kick the case over into Chapter 7.  Aren't there many cases filed under Chapter 11 that end up with no reorganization?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What I don't understand about the... how the Florida system works, I thought you don't get... you don't get the transfer recorded until you pay the tax.  I thought that's what Florida law was.   INTERRUPTING ",07-312X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought, Mr. Brunstad, that the question was asked: So the State is not going to get its tax at the time of the asset transfer, because the cash is needed to eventually have a plan that works.  So the State doesn't get its tax.  And then it turns out that there is no plan; that the case is dismissed.  What happens then?  Florida has to get back... at that point gets the tax that it wanted up front?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They are all paid up front, but they are put into escrow.  Is that what you are telling me?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Brunstad, there's an aspect of the way this looks that I don't understand, and you're an expert in this area.  Perhaps you can explain it to me.  You have one of these 363(b) sales of property, and then you have a global settlement with the creditors.  What function does the plan serve after you have all that?  The assets have been sold.  The creditors have made a settlement.  There's going to be no reorganization; whatever there is, is going to be distributed.  What is the function of having a plan after all that confirmed?  I know one purpose of it is that you avoid paying the stamp tax.  But is there any other purpose once you have already settled that the sale is made, the creditors agree on how it's going to be divided up?  What is the function that the plan serves?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why shouldn't we look to see how it was in the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the Federal State tax exemption?  That I think leaves no room for argument.  This case might be argued either way about does it apply to preconfirmed plan asset transfers?  But as I understand it, this section 4382(b) was limited to post-confirmation transfers, that is transfers made within five years after confirmation of the plan.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, what was... what did section... I'm not talking about... you mentioned 267.  42... 4382(b), what did that say?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Section... 26 U.S.C. 4382(b).   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That was in the 1954 Code.  I'm not talking about 1898.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that said that the tax exemption was limited to transfers post-confirmation.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Maybe you can straighten me out, because where I get this from is the brief for the State, and it's at page 17, mentions the now-repealed 4382(b).   INTERRUPTING ",07-312X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How is the government speaking?  You have already acknowledged that the wealthy candidate can spend as much as he or she wants and the end result of this scheme is that there will be more, not less, speech because the non-affluent opponent will now have money to spend that he didn't have before.  So I think you have to concede that overall the scheme will produce more political speech, not less.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Has it done it?  I mean, we do have some experience under the statute now.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it was a four-year record and the numbers are rather startling that... is it 110 senators or representatives qualified for the enhanced contributions and only 6 of them were incumbents?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, if that's so, one of the reasons that has been given for this statute is that it encourages the parties to favor the wealthier candidates; it deters people who are non-affluent but highly meritorious.  So... and it gives the public the perception that the seats in our Congress are there to be bought by the wealthiest bidder.  And if there's anything to that... well, do you reject that out of hand as what the statute is all about?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I thought... I thought your brief... and correct me if I'm wrong... said at one stage that there is... what Congress was driving at is a valid concern, but there are less restrictive alternatives.  And I was trying to find what those less restrictive alternatives were.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But isn't there something different between what the statute was at the time of Buckley, that a lid on, you can't spend more than X amount of money, and a statute that says we're going to let you spend, the sky is the limit for you, but we're going to give a boost to your opponent?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm talking about the statute as it was originally enacted by Congress did have expenditure limits and this Court said that was no good.  This statute doesn't have that problem because it doesn't put a lid on the candidates self-financing.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Could you clarify with respect to that question two things: The party is not at liberty to give anything it wants.  You explained that it would be... it's tied to that formula.  So the wealthy person could still have a lot more to spend.  But the party also is... there's no obligation of the party to give one cent to anybody that it doesn't choose to give money to; is that right?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where did the money come from?  Was it a war chest left over from prior campaigns?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, because he didn't... his opponent did not take advantage of the relaxed contribution limits.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because he was just a good fundraiser?  That--   ",07-320X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The problem is it's every $10,000.  As you pointed out, it doesn't require more disclosure.  All of this information would be disclosed under the system without this 24-hour, and that I think is the complaint, the burden of having every time you spend $10,000 to file something.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But I thought that--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --that Justice Breyer's question, General Clement, was he asked you to assume that that was unconstitutional, and you were answering if it was unconstitutional.  But there is one person whose speech is being discouraged in the picture, and that's the contributor to the self-financed candidate.  You have to recognize that that one can't speak as much vis-a-vis the contributors to the other candidate.   ",07-320X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can you go over that, Mr. Fisher?  Because the... there was a plurality opinion, right, in Coker?  And Justice Powell wrote separately, and I thought he left open an outrageous rape resulting in serious, lasting harm to the victim.  He said that the Coker jury was not asked and could not have found from the facts in that case that the offense was outrageous or want only violent in that it involved a aggravated battery.  So you don't have an opinion of five Justices saying that, in any and all circumstances, rape that leaves the victim alive cannot be punished by the death penalty.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm questioning... you're saying it's off the chart because the Court held that you cannot have a death penalty for rape.  And I suggested that that's not so clear.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  At any rate--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --There were four justices on the plurality opinion.  That was the only point I wanted to make.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's a brief in this case on behalf of several States, and the argument that's made in that brief on the point that the Chief Justice has raised is we can never know whether there is a consensus one way or another so long as Coker seems to cover the waterfront, so long as Coker admits of the interpretation that you cannot have the death penalty for rape, period.  So the argument is on this question... not talking about the universe of crimes, but as to rape... we cannot know if there is a consensus one way or another until this Court clarifies what Coker stands for.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There was, at least in the amici briefs in Coker... may not have been explicit in the Court's decision... but the argument was made that the rape law in question, the Georgia law, came from an earlier tradition when a woman was regarded as as good as dead once she was raped; and the crime was thought to be an offense against her husband or her father as much as it was to her.  And that was the background of Coker, plus the racial element in it was very strong.  I imagine that that... if the question were... the Coker question were to come up again, those would still be factors.  I mean, the notion was that making rape equivalent to murder was no kindness to women, because it said once you've been raped, you're spoiled.  That's not... there's no parallel with child rape.  So I think that what was going on under the surface in Coker is quite different.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it isn't... it isn't the notion that she's somebody else's property; and... which was the history of the rape statutes.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It was 25 years, right?   ",07-343X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In one respect is broader, and perhaps whether it assists your position, Coker is a crime that could have only a female victim and a male perpetrator, but this child rape statute as I understand it could be the... the victim could, male or female; the perpetrator could be male or female.   INTERRUPTING ",07-343X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --The claim that Justice Souter has posited is not one that the second person would have been... he was soliciting.  He was solicited to be a plaintiff in that second case.  That is not the case that is involved here.  As far as we know--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --As far as we know, Taylor didn't even know about the first case.  He brings the second case.  There is no indication that it was solicited by Herrick.  So I don't know why you're even reaching the case where someone... someone is... you say has to be controlled, but why are we getting into the details of such a situation when we have no solicitation?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And it does cover idle curiosity.  I mean, I suppose if anyone in the courtroom were to file a request for the same information, there could be no argument that there would be any kind of preclusion just because it's been heard before.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the judge's obligation to look out for the trial to see, for example, any settlement has to be approved by the judge to make sure it is fair to the absent class members.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The word that we use is privity.  If you are in privity with somebody else, you can... that's a pre-existing legal relationship.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  As the beneficiary and the trustee.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which is the case here.  It is the same lawyer that's involved?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But in the case of the Chief's hypothetical, of course, it would never come up, if the client sends another lawyer to bring this.  But there's no automatic preclusion in that relationship as there is in the traditional relationship.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why isn't that not like Montana, where the government was not a party to the case but it was in control of what the contractor was doing?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You don't think that somebody who finances... who solicits a litigation, recruits someone to bring the case, pays for it, and then says,  ""I recruited a very good law firm, so I can stay out of it. ""  ""I'm not going to try to... I don't know anything about the law, I'm not going to try to manage this case. ""  But someone who recruits the firm and pays for it wouldn't be bound.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would you explain to me how that could possibly work?  I can understand that you're making an argument that the second case, there was a recruitment, there was collusion or whatever.  But for all we know from this record, how could Taylor possibly be bound when Herrick's suit is over?  Because as far as we know, Taylor never heard of that first case.  How can somebody be bound by a litigation in which they had no notice, no opportunity to be heard?  So if we freeze the situation at the end of case one, how could Taylor possibly be bound?     Well, I think it's important to start by recognizing that even Petitioner acknowledges that there can be circumstances in which Taylor would be bound, even though at the time, at the end of Herrick's litigation, he had no notice, he had not participated.  And that is, on their view and ours as well, that if Herrick had thereafter created an agency relationship with Taylor, and Taylor then as agent went and brought the second FOIA suit--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because he's asking for Herrick who is bound by the first case.     --That's right.  And... but all of that can exist or be created after the first litigation is over.  And so the absence of notice in the first case--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because what you're saying is the person who is really in the second case is the same person who was in the first case, and Taylor is simply acting as an agent to give Herrick another chance?     --That's... that's right.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But we're talking about binding Taylor.     Well... but Taylor in the second suit that he brings as agent to advance the interests of Herrick would be bound.  Taylor would be barred.  His suit would be--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There was no finding of that.  There was no finding here of agency relationship.  There was no finding of collusion.  That would be a different case.     --Well, I don't... the court certainly did not find that there was no collusion.  I agree that the court didn't reach--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No.  It said it wasn't reaching that question.     --It didn't reach the question of what they called ""tactical maneuvering"".  I think that there is a... a strong argument could be made that Taylor was Herrick's agent; but I don't think that it's critical to find that he was his agent in the very technical sense of the Restatement of Agency.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There is in the... in the Restatement of Judgment, as far as I know, all of the examples involve a representational relationship that existed at the time of the first litigation.  There's nothing in the Restatement that suggests that preclusion would be proper here.     Well, Your Honor, I agree that the Restatement (Second) does not, for example, state the law which we all know and which Petitioner concedes is the case, and that is that the agent who brings the second lawsuit is bound, even if the agency relationship arose--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but here--     --after the first relation was concluded.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Do you agree with me about the facts that we're dealing with here?  As far as the first case is concerned, no evidence that Taylor even knew that Herrick was... Herrick was bringing that suit?     What the evidence shows is that Herrick made Taylor aware of the... of the outcome of the litigation, but we don't have--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But... and while the litigation is ongoing, Taylor doesn't know about it, right?     --There's no evidence of that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Okay.  And is there any evidence that Herrick asked Taylor to file a FOIA request--     Well, the--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --after Herrick lost his case?     --The evidence is that Herrick asked Taylor to help him fix the plane, the plane and its restoration being the object of Herrick's own FOIA case.  Taylor, in order to get those documents, which were essential--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that wasn't my question.     --to the restoration of the plane--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  My question, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, is: Did Herrick ask Taylor to file that FOIA suit?  And I think your answer is no.  There's no evidence of that.     --There is no evidence that Herrick asked Taylor specifically to file the--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there any evidence that Herrick financed the litigation?     --The... there is no specific evidence of that.  The counsel on the other side--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there any evidence that Herrick called any of the shots in that litigation?     --Well, counsel on the other side filed an affidavit that said... it was very carefully crafted, I think... that there was no attorney-client relationship with Herrick with respect to this--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In any case, the decision that we're reviewing didn't find any of those things.     --No, that's right.  What the court of appeals relied on was the fact that Taylor had made Herrick's interest his own and brought the suit in order to vindicate the exact same interests that Herrick, himself, had already litigated and lost.  And that was to get the documents to restore Herrick's plane.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So if another member of the club, let's say another member of the aviation association who's interested in antique planes, just files a FOIA request, would that person be precluded who is... who knows that Herrick brought a suit and lost?  He's just a member of the club.  He doesn't want to help Herrick restore the plane.     No, that person is not barred.  And--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But my question was just a member of the association, whether--     --No, the court of appeals was clear that just a common membership in an association or just a common interest would not be enough.  They... they distinguished the situation of a common interest in a... in the same objective--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But why does there have to be any interest?  Going back to a question I think Justice Scalia asked, we're dealing with a most unusual statute.  You don't have to have any reason for a FOIA request.     --That... that's true.  We think that that, in fact, makes FOIA even more susceptible to this kind of vexatious litigation that Petitioner seems to think is entirely permissible.  And the courts have held that the--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm not sure what the hypothetical is.  I mean it is certainly not the case that... let's say you have a whole busload of people who get injured in the same accident.  Plaintiff one sues and loses.  Two sues and loses.  Three is not precluded.  Four is not precluded.     --But it recognizes there could be a close-enough relationship between the two such that the purposes of the rule would be satisfied, but there is no legal, familial relationship.  And--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And if all that has been proved, the problem is that the D.C. Circuit said: We're not going to look into what they call strategic whatever.  We're going to take it just as it is, with none of... no showing that these two are in cahoots.     --They didn't need to because of the fact that Taylor had voluntarily taken up Herrick's interests to get a second bite at the litigatory apple, as the First Circuit put it.  And it is not the fact, as Petitioner would argue, that every time another person has an individual, standing right to sue under a statute, that it means that that person necessarily gets to relitigate where a person with whom they have a close relationship such as this has already litigated and lost.  And so, getting back to Your Honor's question--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Stetson said that the district court unlike the court of appeals, did find collusion, and she referred to a page that I didn't check.   ",07-371X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There was no showing that Herrick ever asked Taylor... well, there is a showing that they're interested in rebuilding this plane or restoring the plane.  But we don't have... and the D.C. Circuit said it was not relevant to its analysis.  Yes, I would totally agree with you if we have a recruiting situation, if we have a financing situation.  But the D.C. Circuit said: Well, that's irrelevant.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's out of the case because the court of appeals said: We do not need to determine whether they count as tactical maneuvering.  We do not do so.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It could be remanded.  It could be remanded with instructions that the collusion question is still open.  Prove it.  It hasn't been proved.   INTERRUPTING ",07-371X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can you give any example of that?  I mean, I found that rather surprising in your brief.  The Montana... a clear case that Montana talks about is tax, the imposition of a tax.  Well, if a jurisdiction has authority to tax, then surely it has authority to sue to collect that tax.  So I am not aware of a case where a State or tribe or nation has authority to regulate, to legislate, but lacks authority to enforce that regulation.  And if you have an example of that, I would appreciate being enlightened.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What was the regulation that was authorized but unenforceable in the courts?  I don't recall... Montana... Hicks having said anything on that subject.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Who would consent to be taxed?  I mean the tax is...--  [Laughter]  It's being imposed.  But, say, at the gas station, they don't ask you when you drive up: Now do you consent to the tax?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's different from consent.  You can say I don't consent as loudly as you like and as often as you like, and you still have to pay the tax.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, do you recognize that the bank was on notice, at least that it was a Federal requirement that when you deal with individual Indians or what this loan company was, it was an organization of Indians... that's what the Federal law calls it... there is a duty of fair dealing?  The Federal law requires that.  Isn't that so?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it's not... it's not uncommon that a State would adopt a Federal standard as its... as its own on a question of civil rights.  A State might stay, well, we choose to construe our human rights law in accord with the Federal... Federal law?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it is an organization of Indians?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did they--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I thought that the bank... I thought that the Long Company was a plaintiff in the tribal court?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And as I understand it, the Long Company asserted, along with the individuals, contract claims?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the Long Company did not make a tort claim?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So why isn't this judgment, even if you're right about the individuals in the tort claim, why isn't this judgment good at least as to the contract claim, which are not challenging and which runs to the benefit of the Long Company which has nothing to do with the tort claim that you are challenging?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So the consensual relationship is what you just said, contracts, leases or other commercial.  So the consent is to the commercial relationship.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Certainly not in Strate, which you quoted before as saying if you have jurisdiction to regulate, then have you jurisdiction to enforce the regulation.   ",07-411X

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Frederick, before you finish, I would like for to you give your best answer to a lurking, underlying concern, and that is the the Chief Justice brought up the outsider subjected to courts where the outsider has no vote.  That happens when you sued in a State that's not your own, but there is the right to remove and also at the end of the line is this Court.  And I think in the case of the tribal courts, neither of those exist.  There's no... you can't remove to a State or Federal court, and this Court has no review authority over a tribal court's judgment.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Not the same faith and credit that it would give to a sister State judgment?

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Spinelli, there's something confusing about your presentation of this, because you say that at this initial appearance that's called a magistration, you are not contending that there was a right to counsel at that very proceeding.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What was filed by the police?  What was filed by the police--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --to justify holding this person?  You can't just say the police brought someone in and they get locked up in jail.  The police had to present something--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --to show probable cause and it was the burden of the State in the presence of the police officer to prove probable cause.  So that had to be based on something.  What was it based on?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And then... and then the defendant was told or was given Miranda warnings.  What was said to him precisely about right to counsel in the warnings that the magistrate gave him?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  But if he is told... the defendant is listening to this.  And, magistrate, you just told me I have a right to counsel.  Okay, I would like counsel.  And then the magistrate says, no you're not entitled to counsel?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought you... I thought you recognized that if he had opted to have this examining trial to determine whether there really was probable cause, that he would be entitled to counsel at that examining trial.  And, yet, that's detached from the fair trial.  The whole purpose of it is that they will never get to trial.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose that he is out on bail, but he has a suspicion that this alleged felony... that that wasn't cricket because it was expunged.  So he says to the judge: Judge, I want to contest my being held to some kind of criminal process because there is no basis for the charge.  So he is out on bail.  He has no lawyer, but he wants to contest the State's right to hold him at all, and he asks for a lawyer to help him do that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is it then episodic?  That is, if the right is turned on when there is a critical event, and then the critical event is over, and no more right to counsel until the next critical event?  It's not... you have no right to counsel in between those critical events?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Kneedler, why -- why -- why is that so?  I am reading this ARA statute, and it seems to give people a right to notice, an opportunity to comment, and to undertake an administrative appeal.  Why isn't this statute that says, interested public, you have those rights, you have essentially a right to a seat at the table, why isn't this statute like FOIA, like the statute that the Court considered in the Atkins case, in the FEC case involving information about APAC?  These were people who said: We are concerned about saving our forests.  That's why Congress said that before these actions occur, there should be notice to the interested public, comment, and we are being cut out from that seat at the table.  It doesn't do us any good after the project has been authorized.  We want to be there when the decision is made to take action.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But this statute says says before there is a specific action you have a right to notice, comment, and administrative procedures.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Maybe he has no--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Why is that different from FOIA?  I mean there anybody can request anything.  You don't have to show anything beyond -- well, you only have to show curiosity.  You say: The statute gives me a right to ask for this information.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then you are saying that this statute is just unenforceable, because the statute is supposed to operate before the project?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The question is where do you draw the line?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that you said the government's position is that the line is to be drawn for cases that don't require either an EIS or an EA.  Those -- in those cases you don't have to do this notice, comment, appeal thing.  And I thought the other side is saying, no, that's the wrong place to draw the line.  It would be the same thing in every case, from the government's point of view, no environmental impact statement, no environmental assessment required, no notice and comment.  And they are saying you put the line in the wrong place.   ",07-463X

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you are seeking a different line.  And, by the way, I don't know what the line is that you are seeking.  But the government says if you don't need an EA, then you don't have to give notice, comment, et cetera.  What would be your standard for when you need notice and comment?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you want to say a word about the Ninth Circuit making a law for the entire nation, on a controversial question that normally the court would just rule for its own area?

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about on the Federal level?  Could a Federal employee who says just what was alleged here come right into Court to bring a Bivens action and says, I was discriminated against and similarly situated people were not, and it was irrational?  Could a Federal employee come to court with such a complaint?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And it doesn't matter that the State has civil service remedies that were not used--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --or there were union grievance procedures that aren't used?  You can go right into Federal court and say, I don't have to use those State remedies?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Let's take this case.  You say there were 30 similarly situated people with regard to this employee being let go.  Wouldn't that be a contested matter?  The employer will say they are not similarly situated; each of them is differently situated.  How does that get resolved on summary judgment?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought they withdrew from saying that it was a budgetary matter.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought you did not agree with that in your brief.  I thought--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --you said no hypothetical justification is there.  Not like legislation where any conceivable basis, even if the legislature didn't conceive it.  I thought you were quite clear in saying no, that's not what rational basis means in this context.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  All of those involved a group characteristic.  One involved people... Beazer, wasn't it was methadone users?  But none of them involved a situation like this, where she is not claiming anything about being a member of any identifiable class.  She is just saying, they discriminated against me... not because of sex, race or anything else.  They were out to get me.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you brought up... you said this is 1983.  It's a cause of action provided by Congress.  So that's why this is something State and municipal employees can do, but no Federal employee could do.  1985 also uses the word 1985(3), that claim, it has to be some group-based animus, not malice directed toward a particular individual.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, maybe because 1985(3) is in a discrimination context, The Court could say 1983... we know the classification to which Justice Breyer was referring, tax classifications, zoning classifications, but this group of claims we're cutting out.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it's a... it's a general statute.  It's not a precise statute like Title VII or the Age Discrimination Act.  So it's the kind of legislation that seems much more amenable to court interpretation.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, it certainly opens a can of worms to say that you take every claim against the government, every claim of wrongdoing by the government, and make it an equal protection claim because you say other people were treated properly and I was treated improperly; therefore, I have an equal protection claim.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  When you do that with the two cases that I raised with Miss Metcalf?  That is, the bribe case and the scapegoat case, they are out, too.  If public employment is taken out from this class-of-one, those two cases would go as well.   Lisa S. Blatt  Right, well, one is criminal conduct, and on the scapegoat case I actually don't think that's such a bad thing.  One can recharacterize scapegoating as public accountability, and their side would allow Federal courts and State courts to second-guess a local employment's response to a public crisis.  So if there is a school board or some tragic accident in the city, and a group of employees are fired, their side would give constitutional claim for punitive and compensatory damages based on a finding of ill will; and although the other side comes up here and tells a story about traditional rational basis, in this case it was submitted to the jury, about whether there was a rational basis or whether whatever articulated basis was a mere pretext; it was treated basically like a sex, or gender, a race claim, and not a rational basis claim.  This should have never gone to the jury.  It's not a fact question whether there is a rational basis.   ",07-474X

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How do we -- in this -- how do we know what the jury found?  They just came in with a guilty verdict; is that right?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The district court didn't say that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So if we were to say, Ninth Circuit, you were wrong, but the district court was right--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's what the district judge did, right?     --Yes, Your Honor.  The district court did apply harmless error review under Brecht.  The court of appeals, of course, did not.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It could just review the district court's decision using the standards that the district court used?     This Court could do that, but the longstanding and customary practice of this Court is that when the court of appeals does not address the harmless error question, that it remands to that court.  It did that in Rose V. Clark, in Pope V. Illinois and California V. Roy, and more recently in Recuenco.  And in several of those cases the intermediate court or the district court, in the habeas context, did address it and the court of appeals didn't in all of those cases that the Court did remand for application of harmless error.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I wasn't questioning that.  The issue, is the United States position say structural error was wrong, harmless error was right, and then just have the Ninth Circuit review the district court's decision that held that there was harmless error the way it would ordinarily review a district court decision?     Yes, Your Honor, but I would add that this Court should also clarify the scope of that harmless error inquiry.  I think there are two important principles.  There is no logical reason to apply a narrower form of harmless error review in this case than the Court did in Neder.  So I think that this Court should clarify that the principles of harmlessness articulated in Neder should apply on remand to the Ninth Circuit.  I think those of those principles bear mention.  First, the question is not what the jury actually or necessarily found, but rather, it encompasses what a rationale jury would have found absent the error.  And I think the second important point for this Court to clarify is that harmlessness review is not limited to cases, is not limited to cases where the relevant elements are undisputed, but rather even when disputed, a reviewing court should consider the entire record and determine whether, in light of the jury finding, there is sufficient evidence to support a contrary verdict.  And then it should remand, Your Honor, to the court of appeals to apply those principles.   ",07-544X

So you would have the same problems that you're complaining about with regard to discovery from the individual PSPs, the same problem with respect to counterclaim.  That's... so it seems to me that, as Justice Scalia suggested, this isn't about a whole lot if just by the device of giving the aggregator part of the, a piece of the action, this suit would be okay because the prudential objections that you are making here would apply just as well.

I thought that Vermont Agency... and Justice Scalia will correct me if I'm wrong... was envisioning the kind of assignment that Judge Sentelle was talking about when he said there are assignments and then there are assignments.

The networks wanted more hours for adult viewing.  They said the only hours that the Commission gave them were hours when most everybody is asleep.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I just ask one question?  It's about the bottom line of your brief.  This whole argument has an air of really futility, because the Second Circuit more than tipped its hand when it said: And even as they gave a reasoned explanation, we have grave doubts whether this would be constitutional.  You suggested in your brief a remand for briefing and a hearing in the Second Circuit on the constitutional issue.  So, is there a way that we can say, well, really, this issue that's before us now is ignoring the big elephant in the rule, room; we have to get to that anyway?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Could that be -- could that be done without deciding this APA or are we forced to decide that?   ",07-582X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Phillips, this -- this is similar to the question that I asked General Garre.  The Commission asked for a remand so it could provide a reasoned explanation.  But you had or your clients had -- in their complaint they made an APA claim as well as a First Amendment claim, didn't they?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Correct.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You could have just done the First Amendment, but you -- you did put the APA into it.   ",07-582X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The Second Circuit recognized that latter kind of taking account of costs disproportionate, more than the industry would bear, and they also recognized a cost comparison.  If you have a cheaper method that is almost as good, you can use that and you don't have to use the one that will capture the extra fish.  So everybody agrees that there is some consideration of cost.  The question is how much, and the concern is, as Justice Souter said, that you are comparing things that aren't comparable.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Does it make any difference--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --You have the two labels: BPT, ""best practical"", and then ""best available"".  And isn't it so that the best available technology, thinking of the Clean Air Act, what they call BAT> [""], is considered the most technology-forcing standard, and then there are lesser standards?  But you seem to think that these can be synonyms.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it would have said--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --So it would have said ""available to reduce""?  If ""for minimizing"" is no stronger than if it had said ""available"" -- if it meant what you suggest, why didn't it read ""available to reduce""?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Young, I thought that in Ellis the litigation -- the Ellis Court said that that litigation did not have as its subject matter negotiation or administration of a collective bargaining contract.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm quoting from -- I'm quoting from that decision at page 453.  The case involved litigation  ""not involving negotiation or administration of a collective bargaining contract. ""   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, are you saying the Court got it wrong?  I mean, the words that I'm quoting are from the opinion:  ""Not involving negotiation or administration of a collective bargaining contract.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But why isn't litigation -- what I don't understand is how you draw a line between the -- the negotiation of an agreement, where Lehnert said this kind of pooling is okay, and the enforcement of the agreement.  I mean, we're not talking about litigation unrelated to collective bargaining.  It is only litigation that deals with the meaning of a term in the contract, whether what the employer has done was an unfair labor practice, whether there has been a contractual violation.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I don't understand why enforcing, one thing is making the agreement and there you agree as you must because of our Lehnert decision you can't have these pooling arrangements.  What's the difference between negotiating an agreement and litigation to enforce it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Begins begins that's, that's my point.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The United States at some stage told the tribunal in The Hague that the Cubic judgment -- and now I'm quoting --  ""has nothing to do with matters before the international tribunal. ""  ""Nothing to do with"".   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There is no counterclaim stated before the tribunal as of this moment.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There is no counterclaim in the case before the tribunal.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Explain to me why it would effect the relief?  Because suppose Iran doesn't get the proceeds of the Cubic judgment, but instead a creditor of Iran, in this case Elahi, a creditor gets it.  It should still be -- you've paid the -- Iran's bill.  Iran owes money to X.  Why shouldn't the United States equally get the credit whether the Cubic judgment in the end is pocketed by Iran or by Iran's creditor, Elahi?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would you -- something that I would just like clarification on.  You mentioned that the Cubic judgment is on appeal to the Ninth Circuit.  It has been on appeal since June of '98?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And there are cross appeals.  What are the positions taken about that judgment by the respective sides, and why is it pending for ten years?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Could -- let's assume that the -- that Iran is able to execute on the Cubic judgment.  Could it take the proceeds out of the United States, given the 2007 blocking order?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You mentioned -- you mentioned that there were other claimants or others -- others who would like to execute--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --other lienors -- other attachments.  And so, you said in the end -- well -- well, what would be the effect of those other liens?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's not saying that.  Isn't that -- that issue is moot?     --Well, Your Honor, there is now a new and independent reason why the asset is blocked.  And, in fact, Respondent no longer defends the holding of the court of appeals on that basis.  It is, we wish to emphasize, essential that this Court vacate that holding and indicate that it is no longer legally valid so that it is not -- that erroneous holding is not used against us in support of Iran's two-million-dollar claim.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if we -- if we took the position that you are expressing about what is at issue, we would never reach the second question.     Well, we -- we think that the Court would not.  It would vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals.  It would be helpful certainly to the United States if the Court emphasized the natural fact that that would mean that the court of appeals' erroneous holding was not any longer legally--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do I understand correctly that that means that because it's a blocked asset, then Dr. Elahi can get it, but Iran itself couldn't get it?     Elahi, Respondent Elahi, could get it if he had not relinquished his rights to attach--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.     --assets at issue before the tribunal.  As of right now, the asset is blocked and Iran could not repatriate it, as of right now.  Of course, blocking orders can be amended, but as of right now it is frozen and Petitioner cannot repatriate it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So why wouldn't the United States get credit for that, too, on the theory that I suggested before?     Well, you are right, Your Honor, that is the position of the United States.  And earlier Your Honor quoted language from the oral argument of the United States that the -- or maybe it was one of our briefs -- that the Cubic judgment is -- that the tribunal doesn't have to--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It has nothing to do with matters before the--     --That is in the context of our saying that, whether or not -- in the view of the United States, whether or not Petitioner ever collects that money, the United States is entitled to an offset, and in fact, we believe it's a complete defense to Iran's claim.  Of course, Petitioner's argument -- or Iran's argument before the tribunal is that it is -- that the United States is entitled to a reduction of liability only if Iran actual receives the assets.  And that's why the language of the statute is written more broadly when the litigation before the tribunal is ongoing.  At that point any property that is at issue before the tribunal is not subject to attachment by one who has relinquished, and that's because this Court nor any other lower court in the United States is supposed to pre-judge the merits of those respective positions.  Iran's position -- and it's on page 85a of the United States' appendix -- is that the awarded amount, unless received by Iran, cannot be offset against any relief which the United States may be found to owe Iran.  So that is Iran's position.  That is at issue before the tribunal.  The Respondent would have the Court believe that the proceedings in the tribunal are in the nature of an in rem proceeding, that it's a property dispute.  They use that term repeatedly in the brief, ""a property dispute"".  But that is not the nature of the proceedings in the tribunal.  Iran has asserted a claim that the United States violated its obligations under the Algiers Accords.  The remedy it seeks is, and I quote -- this is from -- excuse me -- from the -- let's see -- the remedy they seek -- they seek is the value of the Cubic sale to Canada.  They have said that in the state -- in Iran's reply in statement -- claim 16 that Respondent relies upon, they say that the remedy they seek is not the asset itself.  Of course, the asset had been dissipated before Iran ever filed a statement of claim against the United States.  The remedy is the proceeds of that sale to Canada.  The proceeds of the sale to Canada, which are the subject of Iran's claim against the United States in the tribunal, have been reduced to judgment in the Cubic judgment.  That--   ",07-615X

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Or he might have -- he might have decided that he didn't want to revoke that one.  We -- we just have no way of knowing.  It's odd that he revoked as to one plan but not the 501(k) plan, as I understand.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, because he could -- he could have -- despite her waiver, he could have named her as the beneficiary of that plan and that would have controlled.   INTERRUPTING ",07-636X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think there is a question of the way it was phrased.  And perhaps the court just didn't get it, what that question on which we didn't grant cert was driving at.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Before you do, leaving the plan -- the beneficiary designation, you say that the plan administrator is not required to give effect to a waiver that conflicts with the beneficiary designation.  Is it just not required?  Does the administrator have discretion to give effect to the waiver, or it -- must it disregard the waiver and strictly follow the beneficiary designation?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You made the contention now -- and I think you have it in your brief -- that if you get something in return for a disclaimer, then the disclaimer is not effective.  That it's effective only if you receive nothing in return.  And what -- what is the source of that contention that you can't disclaim if you get something in return?   INTERRUPTING ",07-636X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that -- that has been stipulated here, right, that you meet the third Gingles factor?  So it's not at issue in this case, but the point was made that, in one of the cases that you rely on, in Metts, that reliance on crossovers to prove the ability to elect the candidate of a racial minority's choosing undercuts the argument that the majority votes as a bloc against the minority preferred candidates.  So there's tension between the crossovers on the one hand and showing that the dominant race votes as a bloc.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you're opening yourself to this line of questioning about the third factor, which is conceded by both sides, so it's not in issue.  But you are opening it by having a test that looks to the second and third factor and leaves the first factor out of it.  I mean, whether you agree with it or not, the 50 percent line is bright if you know what's in and what's out.  You don't have any test for the first factor that's comparable, that would give district courts and attorneys some degree of security about how you determine the first factor.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Browning, I thought there was something in the record that said never in North Carolina's history have you had African Americans able to choose the -- able to elect the candidate of their choice where the minority population was less than 38.37 percent.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, does that mean a proposal if you succeed, we should remand on that question?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But this -- but yours is below?  Just slightly below.   ",07-689X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you stipulated.  You didn't want to argue the third factor.  You wanted -- you just started out by saying you were tired of this litigation, we wanted to concentrate on one issue and one issue only, and that was the 50 percent rule.  And now you are suggesting that, well, no, the stipulation really didn't stipulate away the third factor.  I thought you were giving in on that issue so that you could get the first issue decided.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What was wrong with the clear rule that Justice Souter suggested in the LULAC case?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Justice Souter, in his opinion in the LULAC case--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --he suggested what he called a hard-edged -- a clear, hard-edged rule which is not going to be an exclusive rule, but, anyway, if you met that standard, you're okay.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What -- what Justice Breyer proposed a rule at the end of his question.  He said: Suppose you make it, the threshold, instead of 50 percent, it would be twice as many in the African-American population as in the crossover group.  That would be the threshold.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought you were conceding that it isn't a rigid rule, and that the North Carolina Supreme Court should have to be -- I mean they could be 48 percent, I think you said.   ",07-689X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Oh, but there is an enormous difference between the training and the character of a police officer and, as this very case illustrates, the confidential informants are often very shady characters who can't be counted on to be truth-tellers, and have a powerful incentive to get someone for the police, because in most cases they are seeking to have their own case dealt with sympathetically.  So, how can you equate a police officer with a confidential informer, who is usually someone who knows where the drug house is because he's a dealer himself?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How about this one?  Wasn't this one that fits my description, the one in this case?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's one feature of this is that I think is really puzzling: What this case is about is the Fourth Amendment, that requires, with certain exceptions, the main rule is to get a warrant.  And here you have a confidential informer going to the place to make sure that they really do have the goods.  Then he goes back to the police.  He spends two hours.  He's being wired and whatever else.  Why didn't somebody pick up the phone and get a warrant at that point?  The confidential informer could say:  ""I was there and I saw the drugs. ""  What -- the whole purpose of these rules is to have the police get a warrant when they can.  And how do you explain that two hours lapse between when they had probable cause and when the -- when the informant returns for the second time?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought it was established not only that there were drugs, but that he actually tasted some.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --May I just establish one thing?  Tell me if I am wrong.  That this argument about consent once removed was not presented in the lower courts.  That is, in the trial court you argued exigent circumstances, and then on appeal the inevitable discovery rule.  So there was -- in the courts below, this was not given as the reason, the consent once removed was not alleged as the basis, as the justification for this search?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's -- it's not just this case.  Maybe you can tell me.  I thought because they were dealing with a confidential informant rather than a police officer, they sent him in to do the dry run.  I mean the -- in the police officer cases usually the -- the undercover police officer goes in.  The other police officers are there ready to come in when he gives them the signal.  But the police officers don't ordinarily go through this dry run that they had here with the confidential informer.   INTERRUPTING ",07-751X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You are talking about the main role of police is get a warrant, except -- and I think the Court has said a number of times to make this search reasonable, the police have to get a warrant if you want to interject the judicial between police and the person in jeopardy.  So the main rule is warrant unless -- and then you have exceptions, but I think your point is that there is a main rule.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This Court has gotten from the Constitution?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Get a warrant if you can.   ",07-751X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the question is knowledge of what.  And I thought it is now recognized that in this State you have to know not just that a crime -- you have to know in this case of the potential for a homicide.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This is -- the prosecutor's charge -- the prosecutor's charge was just filled with the suggestion that as long as it was a crime, that was sufficient.  I don't find that what you've said is an accurate description of the charge--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --of the prosecutor's summation.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the instruction that follows the hypothetical, first the statement that the person gets assaulted, gets killed, in for a dime, in for a dollar?  The law in the State of Washington says if you're in for a dime you're in for a dollar; if you're there or even if you're not there and you're helping in some fashion to bring about this crime, you are just as guilty, in some fashion.  And that was tied in to the person who thought he was assisting in assault and it turns out that the victim got killed.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But what about the statement I just read, that the law of the State is you don't even have to be there if you're helping in some fashion.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  It's in the same paragraph, the paragraph with the example of the accomplice who is--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --No.  This is in the summation.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the appellate court?  I mean, the first time around the appellate court was as mixed up, more so perhaps, than the prosecutor.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because the appellate court the first time got it wrong and it thought it was enough that the defendant knew that a crime was likely to be committed, not the crime, crime specified in the indictment, not -- not murder one, attempted murder, et cetera, just a crime.  And the second time around that appellate court said, yeah, we got it wrong, now we know we got it wrong because there has been an intervening decision of the State's supreme court clarifying it.  But what the prosecutor said, at least as I read it, more than once is exactly what the intermediate appellate court said the first time around: Said he didn't have to know that there was going to be a shooting.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They say, the court itself said: We got it wrong.  We said go away appellant because you knew that a crime was likely to be committed.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Maybe so.  Let's go to the third question, when the jury asks:  ""When a person willingly participates in a group activity, is that person an accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in the group? ""   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How could the jury better express its puzzlement?  It wanted to know, if someone participates in a group, but did not -- that that person is -- is an accomplice to any crime by anyone?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the -- the counsel for the defense says, tell them no.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It says ""a group activity"".  When a person willingly participates in ""a group activity"", is that person an accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in the group?  I don't think there is any ambiguity in that question.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They didn't get an answer.  They were told to read an instruction that they had been told three times to read and obviously didn't understand.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But we already know that many people, prosecutors, justices, misunderstood this ""a crime"".  Was it ""a crime"", or ""any crime"".  Or ""the crime""?  So I think you can't avoid the confusing nature of the statute and the charge, which repeated the statute.  It doesn't get clarified until the Washington Supreme Court says it means ""the crime"", not ""a crime"", and not ""any crime"".   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They didn't say anything at all about Mr. Reyes.  They asked the question about an accomplice, a crime.   ",07-772X

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Ortiz, why isn't section 2 of the Arbitration Act sufficient to take care of the ouster doctrine, whatever may have been left of it?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm not sure that I follow that, because it seems to me -- where did this doctrine of ouster come from?  It came from the courts.  The courts said, no, we won't enforce arbitration agreements if it would oust us of jurisdiction.  Why would a court reading section 2 not say, well, that rule never made any sense in the first place, so we're not going to follow it?  It's not any rule that Congress has imposed on the courts.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That may have been the historic model.  This was never a notion that Congress enforced on the courts.  They imposed it on themselves.  So my question remains why shouldn't the Court then say this agreement has been declared enforceable, the ouster doctrine didn't have much to recommend it in the beginning, but certainly not any more; we can change it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You just -- you just used the words ""arising out of the controversy"".  ""The controversy"" is used in several sections of the Arbitration Act, and ""the controversy"" in other contexts means the underlying dispute between the parties.  ""The controversy"" is not over the enforcement of the arbitration agreement.   ",07-773X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's the question that I have, Mr. Phillips.  What is the underlying dispute between the parties?  It seems to me that your look-through argument is look-through only halfway.  That is, if you look -- if you consider the controversy, the suit that was brought in the State court, the controversy is here we have a customer who hasn't paid the amount charged.  So we have a suit on a debt.  Why isn't that the controversy?  You have to make the counterclaim the controversy, which comes up only defensively.  It wasn't brought as a lawsuit.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But -- but she chose to assert it only defensively; and it's not a complaint -- the counterclaim if it had been brought as an independent action, everybody agrees qualifies for Federal jurisdiction.  But the litigant who has this claim is asserting it only as a defense to a claim that you admit does not qualify for Federal jurisdiction.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But in the practical effect, what happens?  Now you have asserted that you can enforce because of the counterclaim that asserts -- that arises under Federal law.  But you say it's is not the same as removal because the underlying claim, your suit on the debt owed, remains in Federal -- State court; but what happens to that claim once you have this arbitration?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I meant -- I didn't mean to say you couldn't get affirmative relief on a counterclaim.  Of course you could.  But this--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Chose not to--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --chose not to litigate the case, chose to -- well, I'm being sued, so I'm going to bring up this claim.  It wasn't as an original matter.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The controversy between the parties is the credit card company says, customer, you're in default $10,000; and the customer said, if that's so, then I have certain offsets because they charged me too much interest.  How do you--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --how do you -- it's all part of the same controversy, isn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There would be nothing inappropriate about a State court entertaining that excessive interest claim, but applying Federal law to it.  I mean the -- 1831(d) says that Federal law governs the interest--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Not state usury law.  So you could have this case going on in State court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the State court would be perfectly competent to apply the Federal law.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That claim doesn't--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But there could be nothing left for the State court to do after you have the arbitration.  I mean, not that you arbitrate about interest due on a nonexistent debt.  I mean, you have to have the two things together.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I just can't envision a case where what you haven't effected is taking a case, a debt, simple debt, no diversity a State court case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And you remove the State court from the picture and gotten it over into Federal court to order the arbitration and any follow-up to the arbitration.  It just seems to me you have effected -- accomplished what you could not have accomplished by the -- by removal, which you admit that you can't remove on the basis of a counterclaim.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you could have asked for that in the State court as well, and--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Why isn't it proper to look to see -- the party who wants arbitration has a dispute; the dispute is we are owed money by the debtor.  Why shouldn't the court say, well, we'll see what your case is about; if your case would qualify for Federal jurisdiction, fine.  But we are not going to look to see what the defendants cases is or might be.  We'll just look at your case and that's how we will define the controversy.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then you'll have not only a hypothetical claim, because nothing has been brought, but an hypothetical answer by way of counterclaim to that claim.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you would come into the court and say there is no suit going on anywhere, but if we were to bring this suit in State court, the defendant could have brought this Federal counterclaim?  That's a lot of hypothesis.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Excuse me--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --What do you do with the assertion that sections 9 through 11 are not in sync with your view, because they would not give you -- you could go in and -- to compel arbitration but once the arbitration was award -- an award was made, you would not have access to the Federal courts to enforce the award?

The law becomes operative because an Alabama intermediate court or trial court made a wrong decision about Alabama law; and then when the supreme court corrects it, that doesn't count.  That's essentially your position, that they're locked, Alabama is locked into a mistake that was made about Alabama law by that circuit court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's a review of a lower court by a higher court.  That's what higher courts do.  They review for correctness, and the Alabama Supreme Court said the circuit court got it wrong.  It misconstrued the law, and we are correcting that.  And that's... that's correct.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The Federal court told the Alabama--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --It told Alabama.  I thought... I thought that one of the reasons was adjudication wasn't complete when the district court made its first ruling, so the district court said, now, go off and get those two Alabama Supreme Court decisions precleared.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What did they say?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the State's position was it shouldn't have to preclear a decision of the State's highest court--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --saying that the State lower court got it wrong.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That all depends on there having been a change.  What there was was gubernatorial appointment.  Then the legislature passes a law.  Suppose that the circuit court had said, sorry, legislature, you got it wrong, general prevails, you can't do it this way, the law is invalid.  Suppose the circuit court had said that.  Then there would not have been an election, right.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So there becomes... there becomes a change only because the circuit court has made the mistake about what the State law is.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And back in 1979 we did not have the information-gathering electronic capability that we now have.  So what are we talking about?  What kind of database?  How would it operate?  Would you--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Rosenkranz, you have, it seems to me, a theory of this case that is not the theory that the Ninth Circuit went on.  I mean, the Ninth Circuit talks about training and supervising deputy district attorneys.  And why do we train them?  Because we want to ensure that they share information.  Now you are cutting out the training and supervision, and you are saying the obligation of the supervising attorney is to have this information bank, which the deputy attorneys can then -- then consult, which, may be a very sound policy.  But is it an element of due process that the supervising attorney has to devise a system to share information?  Where is there anything -- anything that the Court has held that suggests that there is a data collection function required by due process?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And there is nothing in the Ninth Circuit -- there was nothing that was presented to the Ninth Circuit by Mr. Goldstein that had to do with this talk about training?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the bottom line would be, if you are right, that every district attorney in the country, large or small office, would have to have a data bank that can be shared by all prosecutors, informants that are used.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Lannet, there -- there is one significant difference, I think, between -- the -- in Apprendi it doesn't matter whether the State labels something a ""sentencing factor"" or an ""element"".  Every one of those questions that goes into determining the maximum length of a sentence has to go to a jury under Apprendi.  But when it comes to consecutive versus concurrent, it's perfectly okay if a State says, our main rule is consecutive, but the judge, if there are certain mitigating factors, can make it concurrent.  Or it leaves the total things to the discretion of the judge.  And if we are looking at it from the point of view of a defendant, the State says, well, we are not going to make it totally discretionary because we want to be more defendant-friendly; that is, we are putting certain restraints on the judge.  So it seems -- what seems odd to me about this case is the Sixth Amendment is supposed to protect the defendant's right.  And here the State is saying, we want to give the defendant more of a right.  And he can say, that's unconstitutional, but if you give me less of a right, it would be perfectly constitutional.  It's that enigma that I think is very disturbing about this case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Lannet, if we agree with your position and let's say you are engaged by the Oregon legislature and they say to you: We don't want to make this just be the judge's discretion alone, what can we do to achieve Constitution of what we were trying to achieve, that is to say encourage as the main rule but -- that is, if we have to leave it to the judge's discretion but we want to rein in that discretion so that you don't have arbitrary differences going from one judge to another?  They want -- they want to say, yeah, we wanted this to be discretionary with the judge, but we want to install certain controls so that the trial judges will be operating more or less uniformly.  How could they do that constitutionally?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The juries are find -- that's what is going on now, the juries are part of this trial of guilt?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which is it?  Do they do it in the guilt trial or leave that up to the judge?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where -- where a defense attorney might not want all of that stuff to come out.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It held as far as the State constitution went, this is fine.  It's only the Federal Constitution that stops the legislature from doing this.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  One way of -- if you are right about the application of Apprendi -- the Oregon legislature could say as a main rule is we leave it to the judge's discretion.  However, before the judge makes a sentence consecutive, the judge should take account of the following factors.  That would be okay?   ",07-901X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How could it be settled, because isn't it -- isn't it a fact that, before 2002, if the primary purpose was disposing of waste, that the 402 permit applies?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it's not any 30 years' experience, and when it was disposing of waste, it was under 402 until 2002.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But in fact, was -- was there ever a permit by the Corps of Engineers when the purpose was disposal of waste?  Was there ever a 404 permit, rather than a 402, for disposal of what they call process wastewater or wastewater?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But weren't they then thinking of fill material as material that was used either to fill in, to reclaim land, or in a construction project?  I mean, to call filling the lake, to call that a fill, when what it's doing is providing a disposal place for a mining operation, is not what one ordinarily thinks of as a filling operation.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's one question that -- that Justice Souter raised and, before you sit down, I would like to get your answer, and that is, can anything, any water of the United States that the Corps of Engineers decides is appropriate to be used as a disposal place -- can any waterway be a settling pond?  That is, here we have a lake.  And is it -- is it just up to the Corps of Engineers?  If they say this is a settling pond, it's a settling pond?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The -- the definition that was adopted, if I have it right, was the EPA definition.  That was the effects.  And it was the Corps that had the purpose test.  And yet, until 2002, if I understand correctly, if the only reason of raising the elevation of the lake was to dispose of waste, you didn't get a 404 permit.  That was not a 404 situation until 2002.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But in application, that never included filling a lake, raising the elevation of a lake simply for the purpose of disposing of waste.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But this is a procedural standard that has a manifestly substantive purpose, which is to restrict recoveries of penalties.  In that sense, it's like a cap on damages.  And if you're right, then the purpose that New York had would be completely undermined, because what lawyer would bring a $500 case in State court when she could bring a $5 million case in Federal court?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They didn't want to have class actions.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And how is it different from Cohen v. Beneficial, the security for costs?  Procedural in one sense, but with a definite substantive purpose in mind; that is, to restrict derivative actions.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You could say just as well here that the question isn't addressed by the Federal rules.  If New York wants to say this kind of claim can be brought only as an individual action, not as a class action, why shouldn't the Federal court say that's perfectly fine; this class of cases can't be brought as a class action; we respect the State's position on that.  Why should we as a Federal court in a diversity case create a claim that the -- that the State never created?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This Court in its recent decisions has been sensitive to not overriding State limitations, and so has read the Federal rule to avoid the conflict.  Gasperini is one such case with regard to Rule 59, interpreted so that you do not collide with the State policy, and the same thing with Semtek with Rule 41(b).  The Federal rule is interpreted so as not to conflict with the State policy.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there wasn't a cap on damages in Gasperini.  It wasn't a cap.  It was--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --It was that we want the courts to exercise a role in checking these damages so they won't be excessive.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So suppose in this case the New York legislature, instead of having a statute that covered penalties generally, minimum recoveries generally, wrote into each statute, each penalty statute, each minimal recovery statute, that this suit must -- may not be brought as a class action -- instead of having an encompassing statute that covered all of them, wrote into each individual statute that limitation.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you -- are you telling me that even if New York had provided for a specific penalty for a specific matter, the Federal court could disregard that and make it a class action, even if the State that created the right said, this is a right for an individual only?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are you saying that even if it -- then you are telling me it doesn't make any difference whether they do it across the board, as they did here, or in each penalty statute it says no class action.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, does it or not?  I mean, it presented you -- here's a case that says: You can sue for this penalty but only in an individual action.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you are saying that even if New York didn't use this shorthand, even if they incorporated it into each penalty statute, your answer would be the same--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --There is no New York Court of Appeals decision to that effect?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It depends upon the persuasiveness of the reasoning of the court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because the statute may put forth both a substantive policy and a procedural policy.  I'll give you a concrete example.  New York establishes a claim and says in the statute: But this sort of claim has to be brought within 1 year.  Then New York gets a similar claim under another State's law, and it says, even though we applied our -- even though our statute applies to our own law in a substantive way -- that is, it says you have no action after a certain amount of time -- we don't want our courts to be cluttered with claims from out of State when we wouldn't entertain similar claims in our own State.  That is certainly the way statutes of limitations have been interpreted by a number of States as having both a procedural aspect and a substantive aspect.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that is not altogether true, because there was always recognition that a so-called built-in statute of limitations was substantive.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought Byrd turned on the characteristics of a Federal court and that is the judge/jury relationship.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, it wouldn't matter what the answer to that was, with the Seventh Amendment looming over that case.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How is it different from security for costs?  I mean, that's what I started with.  That's -- there's nothing in the Federal rules that say security for costs.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Without the bond, the remedy would be -- I don't -- this is a plaintiff that had to put up security for costs.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There -- when you are dealing with a Federal statute, there's a -- there's a factor that doesn't come up when you are dealing with sister States, and that is the Supremacy Clause.  If Congress has made a judgment -- let's say 1983 -- I don't think the State that says, for our comparable claims, we don't allow class action could -- could apply that--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I can't see how that's so when they limit just a particular remedy or penalty.  If they were saying, well, across the board we don't want class actions, I could follow your argument much better.  But when New York singles out penalties, it seems to be talking not about the efficiency and fairness of proceedings, but that it doesn't want penalty claims to be magnified.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  New York doesn't have -- as the -- the question that Justice Sotomayor asked and that Justice Stevens asked -- doesn't have any anti-class action as a procedural policy.  It has picked out a particular kind of action, one for a penalty, one where there's -- what is it -- minimum recovery, and said that category, we have -- we're not anti-class action in general, but these penalties that we created, we don't want those brought as class actions.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  One -- one question that was raised by the other side is, well, if you're saying this kind of restriction -- restriction on class action -- applies in a diversity case, why not a State that says we love class actions and we want class actions to be -- not to be hemmed in by all of the Rule 23 requirements?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it could be -- it could be, as I -- the example of the statute of limitations.  We create a claim.  It has a certain life.  It's dead after that time.  That's New York law.  A sister State may say, we create the same claim, but we think it has a longer life.  New York would say, that's fine.  Bring that claim in your own State.  Don't clutter up our courts with out-of-State claims when we would not hear the identical claim under our own law.  There are policies that do operate as procedural limitations and have a substantive thrust.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  New York might well say, look, we don't hear in New York penalty cases, and so we are not going to entertain the sister State claim for any -- when we wouldn't entertain our own.  We are not frustrating the sister State.  They could bring the class action there, but not in -- not in our courts.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, they -- they bring up the Class Action Fairness Act, which allows a plaintiff -- they allow a defendant to remove a class action from a State court to a Federal court, but they also allow a plaintiff to initiate an action in the Federal court.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Does that mean that, even if we were dealing with police officers who did what the prosecutors were alleged to have done at the investigation stage, no prosecutor, only police investigators, the fact that a trial and a conviction had occurred would mean that the police officers were not liable, either?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm not sure that I fully grasp your answer to my first question and to Justice Kennedy's, that is, yes or no, if everything that happened was alleged to have happened, but it was done by a police officer or a different prosecutor, nonetheless, the trial went on, the fabricated evidence was introduced, without any participation by the actual prosecutor in that fabrication, does a conviction -- does the -- do the police officers or the prosecutors that was not involved in the trial get absolute -- are they -- are they no more liable, not because they have absolute immunity, but because the trial and conviction at which the evidence was used overtakes what liability they might have had, absent the trial?  Is that your position?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it's strange to say you can have a prosecutor, who wasn't involved in the trial, would have liability, but as long as the prosecutor, in effect, turns the investigatory stage material over to himself, rather than to another prosecutor, then there's absolute immunity.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, but the -- the question is not at trial, nothing about trial.  It's the pretrial conduct.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you said that there -- that there would be liability, as long as it wasn't the same person involved in the investigation and the trial.

You have to know that it what you're using is a means of identification.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is the first -- this alien's first effort to get papers that would qualify for him, if I -- if I remember correctly, the first time around he used an assumed name, not his own name.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  He used a false date of birth.  He got a Social Security card that happened to belong -- to be the number of no live person.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And -- and that would not have violated.  Even in the government's reading, that would not have violated--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --this statute.  But the second time around, your case, he did use his own name.  And the question was -- and it turned out that both the Social Security card and the alien registration, they were two different people, but they were both alive.

When he went to Chicago to buy false identification papers, did the first time -- did he go to the same outfit as the time he used a false name?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you have any sense of -- because there are many people with false identification papers -- how many times it turns out to be the number of a live person, and how many times it turns out like it was in the first instance in this case: It's just a number, a made-up number that doesn't belong to anybody?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the government's argument in this case that Congress was really going after people who have false identifications because of its concern to protect the victim, that is, the person whose number is misused?

The prosecutor said, yes, that's the difference.  Was that the right answer?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But what about the -- the even division -- I think it's an even division, 3/3 -- is it a 3/3 split?  And if you wanted one indication that this statute is indeed grievously ambiguous, is that that good minds have reached opposite conclusions with well-reasoned decisions on both sides.  So it seems to me that this is a very strong argument that this is an ambiguous statute, unusually so.  And I factor into that the answer that was given to Judge Friedman's question, which astonished me the first time I read it: That a prosecutor would say, yes, the same -- no different degree of culpability.  One happened to get a fictitious number; the other happened to get a real number.  Two years for the second one.  There is no difference at all in the state of mind of -- of the two defendants.

But I thought homicide is -- it's an answer to your argument that this statute is entirely victim-centered, because a person is just as dead if he's the victim of a reckless driver as a premeditated murder, and yet we certainly distinguish the penalties in those cases, no matter that the harm was identical.

You'd say Congress wanted one place; headquarters is a logical choice, end of -- but most circuits have made it more complicated than that.  The Seventh Circuit is the only one who said, keep it simple, as you urge -- headquarters.  Why are the other circuits resistant to the solution that you are proposing.

Some say ""headquarters"".  Some say -- well, there are a variety of things, but Congress picked this particular term, ""principal place of business"".  And I was thinking, when you gave the example of Texas, that the idea of diversity is you are not going to get a Federal forum where you are at home.

California is going to be the big winner in this.  It's going to be able to keep all those cases in its State court because so many multi-State corporations, I imagine, would come out, just the way Hertz does.  Am I right, that, under your analysis, the one place where, if you say, we don't want Federal courts to be dealing with corporations that are at home in the State, but in the State of New Jersey, under your view of things, a New Jersey citizen could sue Hertz in Federal court in New Jersey, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And why do you say, well -- why is it that the Ninth Circuit's method, California versus Florida, instead of California and let's see what the rest of the business is -- is, in the whole United States?

It seems to me that that -- that would be a harder thing for a lawyer to do, to identify herself in an advertisement as, I am a debt collector, than I am a debt relief agency.   ",08-1119
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the provision that says the directors, employees, are not included?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about an associate?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, let's take some of the examples that were in the amicus brief.  One of them was the debtor is just told by her doctor that she has a serious cancer that needs operation and radiation, and she is at the end of the line on resources.  She has her trade tools, which she could sell to get some money, but then she won't be able to carry on her business.  And she could also borrow money, but incurring that debt -- since she's on the brink of the bankruptcy, she's incurring the debt knowing that she's on the brink of bankruptcy.  Could the lawyer say, you don't have to sell your -- the lawyer could say: Sell your equipment.  That wouldn't be a problem.  But could the lawyer say, incur the debt?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, take this circumstance.  There is no other -- the person is on a brink of bankruptcy, has no resources, can get money by selling assets or by borrowing.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose she doesn't have a home equity loan.  Suppose she's a renter?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  One thing that lawyers who render services for money want -- is to be sure that they will get paid, and one part of this provision, this 526(a)(4), talks about incurring debt to pay an attorney for representing the debtor.  So what can a lawyer say safely about the lawyer's getting paid?   ",08-1119
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Before -- before we get to that, the Ninth Circuit did say, now, bankruptcy judges, we don't want you to -- to intermeddle in this.  So -- so the first step -- it wasn't clear to the Ninth Circuit that bankruptcy judges should not say, now, I am not going to let you do this until you prove hardship.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can a -- can a creditor say, oh, skip it, I know this bankrupt is going to be able to prove hardship, why go through unnecessary expense?  Can a -- can a creditor waive the hardship determination?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So he can't -- he can't stipulate to -- he will say: I want the deal that is being proposed; I think I am better off getting the principal, skipping the interest.  I can't make that deal?  We have to go through this hardship procedure, whether the creditor wants it or not?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's this case.  The creditor was there.  The creditor put in a proof of claim.  The creditor knew that the plan gave the creditor less than the proof of claim.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But why -- why should it be void, looking at 1327?  We have a confirmed plan.  You-you have -- 1328 does include -- except 523(a), as you pointed out.  But 1327 says ""Effect of confirmation"", and that says,  ""The provisions of a confirmed plan. ""  --the provision here is you get 13,000, not 17,000 --  ""bind the debtor and each creditor, whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided for by the plan. ""  --which it wasn't in full here --  ""and whether or not such creditor has objected to or has accepted or rejected the plan. ""  That seems to say at the end of the line, you get that final determination confirmed, that's it.  That's as final as you come and whatever mistakes were made on the way there, you can't look behind at the confirmation.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the only way to do it is to go through an adversary hearing with full notice, and every -- and nobody wants to incur that expense.  This is a bankruptcy.  You are trying to save assets.  The bankruptcy judge thinks this makes no sense.  The creditor says, okay.  But you -- you agree with your colleague that, under this 523 whatever, you must have the full adversary hearing, notice, complaint, the works?   INTERRUPTING ",08-1134
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It was the only debt.  This -- there was no other debt.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --So I take it that you do think the Ninth Circuit was wrong when they said: bankruptcy judges, don't stand in the middle of these arrangements.  Because you -- your answer was you think the bankruptcy judge does have the obligation to bring out this requirement that -- of a hardship showing?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But did you -- the net effect of this is if you have taken a debt that is non-dischargeable and put it into the category that it is dischargeable unless the creditor objects.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The -- the code puts the onus on the debtor to raise the hardship question.  Your reading is, even if the debtor is silent, totally silent, says nothing about hardship, unless the creditor objects, then the discharge will be proper; the plan can be confirmed.  So you are taking a burden that Congress has put on the debtor and switching it to the creditor.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it's in a category that's labeled ""non-dischargeable"".  There were other items in that -- that category, so let's take it that -- the child support arrears--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --The debtor says, look, I'll pay half of what I owe, and the spouse says, I need something for the children, I'll take it.  And then the plan is confirmed, with only half of the child support; and then the caretaker spouse has a second thought and says, 2 years later, I need that money, I'm going to go after the debtor for the rest.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But let's suppose -- this is my hypothetical.  It's right in there, and the -- the creditor haven't gotten all the notices -- I want what I can get right now.  So I'll make this deal.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, there are supposed to be additional notices here.  There's supposed to be a summons and complaint and all that.  And let's go down the list of the others.  How about taxes?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you're saying any of these things that are listed as non-dischargeable can become dischargeable unless the creditor--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --objects?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So then, why do we have this third category, then?  Nothing is nondischargeable.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But your answer to me was that if the creditor doesn't object, even to a non-dischargeable debt -- if the creditor doesn't object, it's discharged.  That's what you answered, I thought.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And it doesn't matter whether it's child support, taxes, or student loans, right?  Anything in the category -- you're saying the creditor must object; otherwise it's covered by the discharge.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's not -- their position is that 528(a)(8) -- or 523(a)(8) makes this -- it puts it outside the discharge order.  The discharge order does not cover this kind of debt.  It doesn't discharge student -- student loans absent a hardship determination.  So, what they are saying is the discharge discharged other things, but it could not discharge this particular debt, so it's not discharged.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And I'd like him to answer the question that I asked him first.   ",08-1134
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you agree that it -- suppose we accept your position and the case is remanded.  The Florida Supreme Court could say: Well, that's very nice, but we have a Florida Constitution with a counterpart to the Fifth Amendment, so we're just going to have the same opinion, but we are putting it under -- squarely under the Florida Constitution.  They could do that?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, that's what I meant.  They could do it on State grounds.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did Miranda itself -- I mean, it set out the four requirements, but there was a charge -- I mean there was a warning involved, am I not right?  Well, didn't they cite the then-FBI warning?  It has been improved considerably, but there was an FBI warning cited in Miranda itself, was there not?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It also said you have a right to keep silent.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It -- it used it in determining -- in -- in stating the obligation of the State, but it didn't use those words in setting out the warning that the FBI then gave.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It said, this is what -- States, this is what your obligation is, what you must say to the defendant is.  And I think the Florida court is the same way.  It said: You are entitled to the help of a lawyer.  Then it spells it out in that opinion, but -- but what it said had to be communicated was not the -- the full range.  Just you're entitled, I think it was, to the help of a lawyer.  So there's -- there's a confusion, I think, between what Miranda spells out and many other cases spell out as the State's obligation, what the State must do, and the statement that must be made to the defendant to communicate that.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The -- the warning that Justice Breyer has just referred to -- that's long after Miranda itself, and it was not the warning that the FBI gave at the time of Miranda.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the danger that Tampa, if you should prevail, will go back to the old way?  Now, it has a clearer form -- whether this form was adequate is one thing.  But now, it has the form that the -- like the one the FBI currently uses.  If you prevail, then Tampa can go back to what it had before?   INTERRUPTING ",08-1175
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, how about the reasonable defendant in this very case?  Powell's lawyer questioned him and asked him:  ""You waived the right to have an attorney present during your questioning by the detectives? ""  Answer: ""Yes"".  This is at appendix page 80.  So, apparently, counsel understood the warning to have conveyed the right to have an attorney present during questioning by the -- by the detectives.  Counsel understood that?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did she ever--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Was she asking her client a legal question?  You waived the right to have an attorney present during your questioning by detectives, is that what you are telling the jury?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But do--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Do you think that a suspect would think, now, I'm in this custodial room, they want me to stay put, that they're going to have me hopping in and out of the room to talk to my lawyer?  Wouldn't the assumption be, I'm stuck in this room, they are holding me here, and if I have a right to talk to a lawyer, it's got to be there and not my walking in and out of the holding room.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What do you do with the -- the Court's decisions in Prysock and Duckworth that dealt with the right to appointed counsel and the suspect was not explicitly told that he had a right to appointed counsel at the pre-arraignment stage.  It said something about a court would give you--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --You wouldn't have to have any additional information; you just tell them, you have a right to have a -- have counsel now.  That would be fewer words.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Didn't one of them say ""court"", and the suspect was not in court at the time?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  That the court will appoint counsel for you.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, they are -- they are free to do that.  I mean, politically, they might consider it risky, but if we say that the charge was good enough, the Florida court could say, but it's not good enough under our Constitution.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But they did say over and over again -- one was the certified question; another was the issue before the court is whether the failure to provide express advice of the right to the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation violates the principles espoused in Miranda, with the citation.  I mean, they said many, many times that the question was -- what did Miranda mean was the issue, not what -- what did Florida's extension of Miranda.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think you would have had a much weightier argument if it hadn't been for Michigan v. Long.  If you could have said--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --We could have then remanded to ask the Florida Supreme Court: Was it independently ruling under its constitution?   INTERRUPTING ",08-1175
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The real problem with your approach, which I take it is you have to find these duties in State law, is that some States will classify the same conduct as a felony that another will classify as a misdemeanor.  So that line won't work.  And then some States will make something criminal that other States won't.  So you're going to have, depending on geography, people potentially subject to a 20-year term because of the particularities of -- of a -- the State law.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you are asking us to say State law is the reference.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you have no objection to what they call the quid pro quo theory; that is, I -- I want you to hire me after I leave the legislature, and in return, I'm going to see what I can do to keep the tax level low on the--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But then I don't understand your question presented.

What you've been arguing isn't in sync with what I thought the question presented was: Must you look for the duty to State law?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you are asking for a State law reference, and that brings up the problem of the variety of State law.  And we do have in the mail fraud property area a decision, the Cleveland decision--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --that says: Don't look to how the States define property.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There should be a uniform Federal definition.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Before we do that, Mr. Dreeben--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Dreeben, I would like to ask you about this case particularly: One thing that the prosecutor did, one thing that the Ninth Circuit did.  So before we get to your larger theory of anything, we have a particular case to deal with.  We have an Assistant U.S. Attorney who came to the judge and said, we have alternate theories of this case.  One is the quid pro quo theory; the other -- and I am reading from 42 of the appendix -- is that  ""a public official can be found guilty of honest services fraud, irrespective of whether the public official took any act thereafter. ""  Just the bare nondisclosure.  That was what the Assistant U.S. Attorney was asking for.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then you must agree that the Ninth Circuit was wrong, at least in this particular -- this -- I'm now reading from 19a.  One is bribe, and that's -- everyone seems to agree that that could come within the statute.  The second is (2) nondisclosure of material information.  Period.  That's got to be wrong.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But this is an opinion that's going to govern district judges in the Ninth Circuit.  So I take it that your answer is that nondisclosure of material information certainly is not enough--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --The problem is that -- that, even if the U.S. attorney got it right in the end, if the U.S. attorney could think that all that's involved is nondisclosure, even if no action is taken thereafter, the U.S. attorney could write that down twice, that suggests that this statute is open to a high degree of interpretation.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Waxman, there's a preliminary question in this case, and that is: There was one agreement, undoubtedly signed by both sides, and that was the one to submit to the arbitrator the question whether the arbitration clause permitted class treatment.  The arbitrators answered that question, which they were given authority to do so by both sides, and the Second Circuit said that the arbitrators answered within the ballpark.  If we agree with that, then there's nothing else to consider in this case.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where did the arbitrators say that?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Waxman, may I ask you -- because your time is running and we are spending all of your time on this preliminary question.  There is one fundamental flaw, it seems to me, in your argument, and I'd like you to answer it.  And you can call it ""the vanishing class action"".  AnimalFeeds wanted to be in court, not in arbitration.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You said -- and they wanted to bring a class action.  You persuaded the Second Circuit they belong in arbitration.  So now they are in arbitration.  You say: The only thing we consented to is a one-on-one claim.  Fine.  AnimalFeeds can then say: Fine, well, we didn't consent to anything more than the one-on-one.  We had a class action.  We had -- we were in court.  We could have proceeded in an individual action or a class action.  Now we are in arbitration, and under the agreement, as you read it, we can't have the class action in arbitration.  That doesn't mean it vanishes, because if it does, then the arbitration clause is not merely saying what the arbitrator can decide, but it is shrinking drastically the dimensions of AnimalFeeds' claim.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's what it was doing in court.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And -- and the court said this goes to arbitration.  What is the ""this""?  If it's only a one-on-one claim, how do they lose the larger claim that they had in court?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But they never -- they never gave up.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If -- if the -- if you would regard arbitration as a change in forum, like a forum selection clause, it says where you go, but it doesn't change, if you have to go to another forum, what your claim is.

I -- I would assume that the tankers are now going to add to their contract, as many contracts do, a provision saying no class action -- you cannot proceed in a class action.  If the arbitration agreement says agreed to arbitrate any and all disputes, but you may not proceed on behalf of a class, would that preclude you from bringing a class action any place?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There are many, many contracts -- and pick up your average credit card agreement -- that will say you may not bring this as a class.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And your example of that couldn't happen, because if you were calling debtors, you should certainly check what time of evening the call is.  So you get over the first problem, but then on the second problem, the second -- how could that possibly be careful procedure, if you don't even check to see what time zone the person is in?   William M. Jay  --Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, if -- if you check, but due to a keyboarding error, for example, Arizona is entered as Alabama or an error in time zone is entered in whatever record is being consulting by the debt collector, that's the kind of factual error, a clerical, bookkeeping type error that -- that Congress had in mind when it created this defense.  And it bears repeating that Congress has created this -- this defense in identical terms in a number of other statutes; federal agencies have construed the identical language in a number of other statutes.  And never has Congress or a federal agency contemplated that one of these defenses would, in fact, encompass legal errors.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you know why when Congress codified that law errors don't count, codified that for the Truth in Lending Act purposes, it didn't make the corresponding change in the others?   William M. Jay  We don't have a specific indication, Justice Ginsburg, why it didn't go back and revise every other statute that -- that already had such a defense.  But I think that the answer is simply that Congress was revising the Truth in Lending Act in a statute called the Truth in Lending Simplification Act, and the -- the statute in which that was passed didn't make any other -- any other changes to non-financial statutes.  It didn't reopen the Federal -- Fair Debt Collection Practice Act in any other way.  In fact, the relevant portion of the FDCPA, Section 1692k, hasn't been amended in any way since Congress first enacted it in 1977.  So we think that the relevance of the 1980 amendment to TILA is simply this: It's part of a consistent pattern by Congress and by the agencies such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Reserve Board that interpret statutes with identical or very similar bona fide error provisions to say: Errors of law are not what Congress or the agency had in mind.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It also makes it hard to use the safe harbor to get the -- to get advice from the FTC.   William M. Jay  --I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.  You are saying that the statute of limitations makes it difficult?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That -- that if you have -- you can -- you are home free if you ask the FTC, right?   William M. Jay  That's correct.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's the only -- only way you -- under your reading that you are home free?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do we know what the time interval was?  You said there were seven requests for affirmative responses.  How long did it take from when the request was made until the FTC responded?   William M. Jay  In the four that were granted, three of them took three to four months.  The fourth is an exception, and that -- that's the one cited in the retail collection attorneys' amicus brief.  That is an exception because the request was originally submitted as a comment in a pending rulemaking conducted by the FTC and a number of other agencies.  The FTC agreed to take that comment in the rulemaking and act on it an advisory opinion under the FDCPA so that it wouldn't have to wait for the other agencies to agree with its view, and so that one took considerably longer.  But the average processing time is three to four months.  And of course the FTC makes a number of other informal guidance avenues available, if what the debt collector wants is simply a quick answer and not a formal safe harbor with the imprimatur of the Commission.  One can -- the Commission staff has published guidance, and indeed, the Commission staff is available over the telephone--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And also saying -- and then this sentence is what I would like to have your response on, that there is no statute -- Federal statute that makes mistake of law a defense.  So this would be highly extraordinary, and if that's what Congress meant to do, to make something that ordinarily is no defense a defense, we would expect Congress to do so expressly.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Could we do that in the context of this case?  Because we are talking on a highly abstract level.  This is a statute that required a validation notice, and for the most part the validation notice that was sent to the debtor is exactly the words of the statute.  But the lawyer added two words that are not in this statute, ""in writing"".  Where did that come from?  We are told this was not the model form that was used by the debt collectors' association.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It says you ""should""--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Rather than ""may""?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But why doesn't that just mean that Congress wants to confirm that the judges -- the majority of judges who -- who had held that it didn't -- that errors of law were not a defense, that they were right, it's not changing -- changing anything.  It's just confirming that the majority view is right.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, why wouldn't one say, now, Congress has confirmed that the word in the Truth and Lending Act means thus and so, Congress has said that's what those words mean, and then go back to the other statutes and say the same language was used, so it means the same thing, the same thing that Congress has just confirmed?

It would be impeded.  And the opinion said we assign weight to the Department of Transportation there, to their view that a tort suit there would stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the Federal safety standards.  And if the Court gives weight to what the agency says in Geier, shouldn't it equally give weight here when NHTSA is telling us there is no conflict?  It says its rule sets out what the statute calls for, a minimum standard.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then the Court -- what was the Court doing in saying that?  Was it -- just wanted the agency to feel good?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there is no such statement.  I mean there was a statement we don't want to impose those costs, but we have the agency in court -- we have the Solicitor General's office in court telling us, the statute says minimum, the statute says the common law isn't displaced, and we are telling the Court that we think this is a situation where it is minimum and so the common law isn't displaced.  Shouldn't we assume that the standard that the agency set, that as the agency said is a minimum standard unless the agency tells us that it should be preemptive of tort suits?

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  One point of information: What is the Michigan ID?   INTERRUPTING ",08-1402
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but there you were dealing with an express exemption.  There was an exemption for a woman, and also in the record was that the jury clerk was sending out notices saying: Women, if you do not wish to serve, return the summons to the judge named on the reverse side as quickly as possible.  And then, further -- systematic -- if the card was not returned, if a card sent to a woman was not returned, it was automatically assumed that she did not wish to serve.  There was no follow-up.  So there was all kinds of evidence of systematic problems in Duren that are not present here.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where did the Court say that?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Oh, that was after -- that was after showing the systematic factors.  It was the plaintiff's burden -- or the defendant in the case, Duren -- burden to show there was a systematic factor.  That was the automatic exception for a woman and how it worked in practice.  After all of that, then Justice White tells us, the State could still come back and say yes, that's true, but there were other reasons why women didn't show up.  Maybe they were disproportionately elderly, or maybe they were involved with child care.  That's what -- that's what Duren said, that the -- showing a systematic factor was the plaintiff's burden, and then the State could justify why the numbers came out that way.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where does it say that?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where does it say that?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I stop you there for a moment?  Because one of the things that was in the Duren opinion was that a child care excuse would be okay.  I think Justice White said at the end, now, I'm not touching the typical hardship excuses, and one of them was child care, and that is -- certainly, in the early '70s, was going to disproportionately affect women.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That was a question of what was permitted.  Here you're trying to say this is required.  The school's case was, these are measures the district could take if it wanted to.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Now, what would it be, Mr. Russell, if there were a suit under RFRA because a Federal penal institution was not allowing for the religious practices that the act protects?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In a suit under RFRA, could there be -- would damages be an appropriate remedy?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, could we back up.  You are saying you could get them against the Federal Government too, but the government doesn't think so?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Russell, the State looks at this statute and says, oh, this statute preserves the PLRA, and under the PLRA there are no damages without having a physical injury.  So putting the PLRA together with PLRA is telling us it's not appropriate relief when there is no physical injury.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But in the prison setting, then, isn't it an academic question, because there are not going to be damages anyway?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the answer to Justice Alito's question is that in the land use area, zoning for example, those are mostly cases against municipalities or counties?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Not against the State.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But those cases did not involve States, right?   Sarah Harrington  Those cases did not involve States, that's true.  But--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And I think that the -- the core question here is the State -- and Justice Alito just posed it: the State is being treated with less dignity than the Federal Government, because your position is that the Federal Government is shielded by its sovereign immunity, and you say the State is not.   Sarah Harrington  --On the contrary, as to the dignity point, Your Honor, if -- the State voluntarily waives its immunity when it accepts Federal funds that clearly condition the acceptance of the funds on the waiver of its immunity.  The State in this case doesn't contest that it has waived its sovereign immunity voluntarily to some universe of suits to enforce RLUIPA--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the waiver -- I mean, on the State side they can say it says ""appropriate relief"".  All right; we accept that we are going to be vulnerable to an injunction suit.  But we're the State and it's our treasury, and it is not appropriate relief.  We didn't waive it.  It's not -- doesn't say in the Spending Clause legislation that we open up our treasury.   Sarah Harrington  --But there is no basis in either the Eleventh Amendment or the statutory provisions in RLUIPA for distinguishing relief of an injunctive nature from relief in damages against the State.  The Eleventh Amendment talks about suits in law and in equity, and there is nothing in RLUIPA that would give the States notice that they are waiving their immunity to suits for injunctive relief, but not give them notice that they are waiving their immunity to suits for money damages.  This Court--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then you're bracketing the State with counties and municipalities.  It really comes down to a question -- who decides whether the state fisc is touched.  And why isn't it most appropriate for this Court to say, Congress can call it either way, but our rule is, Congress, if you want to reach the State treasury, you have to say so explicitly.  And then there is no doubt when the State enters a contract that it's going to be subject to money damages as well as injunctive relief.   Sarah Harrington  Well, this Court has consistently applied a clear notice requirement to conditions that Congress places on Federal funds.  That clear notice requirement arose out of cases like Pennhurst and South Dakota v. Dole, in which there were State recipients of Federal funds.  And the Court said that the validity of Congress's constitutional action in exercising its Spending Clause authority depends on it giving the recipients of the funds clear notice of the conditions that they are agreeing to because of the contract-like nature of Spending Clause legislation.  Now, that same rule was applied in Franklin and Gebser and Davis and Dole, even though the defendants in those cases were not sovereigns.  It's still the same notice requirement and there is no reason to think that a county government would be able to understand, would be on notice that it would be subject to compensatory damages suits, and a State government would not.  To be sure, the State government has more to give up.  It might be a harder choice for the State about whether to take the money or not.  But the choice is the State's, and when it says yes, I'm going to take this money, it agrees to the conditions that are attached to the money.   ",08-1438

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What do you do with the practical problem that's been brought up that if a State is sued, it can release the prisoner, it can transfer the prisoner, and then no relief is appropriate?

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can I go back to what Justice Breyer was asking?  Because this Court, with respect to the fighting words, Chaplinsky's ""in your face"", provoked an immediate action, the Court has been very careful to cordon that off so it doesn't have this spillover potential.  So you -- you didn't latch on to fighting words.  Your analogy is to obscenity for teenagers, as I understand it.

That was step one, and that was done here.  And then it says there's this rule that a quorum is three, but then it said: Except as to one of these three-member groups that has been designated, except, and there the quorum is two.  So why doesn't the statute answer the question that, yes, a quorum is three, except when it's two?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it's not an agent of the board because the three-member group that has a quorum of two has the full powers of the board.  So the statute doesn't say anything about a three-member group that has a quorum of two being an agent of the board.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But where does the statute make that three-member group with a quorum of two, a quorum of two, an agent?  It says they may be designated to exercise any and all powers?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The D.C. Circuit I think was the source of your opening argument because they said when the number drops below three there is no board, and I guess that's what your opening argument was based on.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There have been situations before where the board dwindled to two members.  Is this the first time that the board has continued to adjudicate the cases that they can, or when there were prior periods with only two did the board continue to adjudicate?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Heard an initial -- an initial decision.  But just -- the review of the panel is in the court of appeals, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you could have initially a panel of five, but that would not be reviewing the panel of three?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is this different from the practice that some courts of appeals follow of circulating a panel decision to the full court some days before it's issued to the public?  That doesn't put the non-panel members on the panel.  Is this practice that you are describing the same or is it different?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In practice, are there decisions in which -- and I'm assuming that you are right on the jurisdictional question -- in which a nonparty to the arbitration agreement but a party to the litigation has, in fact, succeeded in getting a stay under section 3?  I mean, one question is -- and that's the question on the merits -- assuming that a -- that a party to the litigation, not a party to the arbitration agreement, can come to court and say, court, stay the action pending arbitration.  Have there been cases in which section 3 stays have been issued on the request of someone who is not party to the arbitration agreement but is a litigant in the case?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the question -- ability is one thing.  It means they -- they have the capacity to apply under section 3.  I was just wondering how in practice -- I mean, here's a case where you have three parties together counseling a certain tax shelter.  One of them enters an arbitration agreement with the enterprise that they are advising.  The other two, sophisticated players, do not.  My question is, conceding jurisdiction, it seems to me unlikely that a court would listen to two such people who were perfectly equipped to get an arbitration agreement themselves and didn't.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do we have any situation -- and this one is really peculiar because the one party who has the arbitration agreement with Carlisle is now out of it, and is not going to get back in, because -- is it Bricolage -- is bankrupt, so there is an automatic stay of any litigation against Bricolage.  The one party that has the arbitration agreement is out of the picture, so you have an arbitration agreement effectively with no one, that two parties who have no arbitration agreement are trying to enforce: The difference between parties to the litigation joining in an ongoing arbitration brought by either party to the arbitration agreement, and relying on an arbitration agreement effectively without two parties to it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if you have a party to the agreement who is no longer in the picture, doesn't that change things?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if you read section 3, if you interpret, as you do, the word ""parties"" to mean parties to the litigation, then for purposes of jurisdiction the only thing is, is this person a party to the litigation?  Yes.  End of case; they can move for a stay.  Then whether they're entitled to one because of this equitable estoppel theory which is determined by the State law is a merits question.  You are making a more complex jurisdictional argument than I understand.  What's wrong with the simple argument that section 3 says parties; that means parties to the litigation; the -- the Petitioners here are parties to the litigation; therefore, they can move for a stay of the arbitration?  And then we go to the merits and say, do they have a good reason for staying the arbitration?  But you're presenting a more complex argument on the jurisdictional point which I don't quite understand.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  First, is there jurisdiction -- yes, appellate jurisdiction.  If you -- if there's an application to stay, is that appealable?  Why isn't -- why isn't the answer clearly yes?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But your step -- you seem to be involving some merits question of State law in that question.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you shouldn't do that.  You should tell us, this is the jurisdictional argument.  If we pass that threshold, then we get to the merits.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Good.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I ask -- may I ask?  Suppose it's somebody who has interest in the litigation but is not a party either to the arbitration agreement or to the litigation?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm asking if somebody who is not a litigant, who can -- if somebody who is an interested spectator moves for a stay of litigation to which that person is not a party, and the court says of course not.  Would that be reviewable on appeal?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that's your jurisdictional argument.

And to decide that question I don't think you get into how meritorious their claim was for the stay.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you -- you just told us that section 3 was ambiguous.  You don't know if the reference to ""parties"" means parties to the arbitration agreement or parties in the litigation.

And I thought you went further than saying there has to be strictly independent advocacy.  You recognized in your brief that they could meet with members of these terrorist organizations.  They could meet and communicate with them, but they can't communicate advice on how to pursue their goals through lawful means?

And that is speech.  It is not conduct.  They want to engage in advocacy of peaceful means of achieving the goals of these groups.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But they want to communicate, and you say they can communicate.  And I still am having trouble with the line of what they can communicate and what they can't.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The answer on the other side is: All we want to do is speak about lawful activities.  We're not supplying any guns, any communication equipment.  We just want to speak about lawful activities.  And I go back to my failure to understand your line between, yes, you can communicate with these people, but you can't communicate about going about their aims through peaceful means.

It's put on page 20, because one of the reasons why Carlson enables -- allows the Bivens Act is that it doesn't contain language and the -- and it -- it seems to me that this -- that this paragraph is contrasting statutes with Carlson, because in Carlson there is no -- there is no other statute.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This statute doesn't -- it doesn't differentiate between buyer and seller in terms of who makes the call.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You didn't -- I haven't heard you question so far the government's rationale.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And there were a total of seven phone calls?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So that would be an exposure--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Twenty-four years for the one gram of cocaine on two occasions.  Do you agree that it doesn't make any difference who initiates the call?  That is, if the seller says -- seller calls the buyer, and says, I understand that you are in the market for one gram of cocaine, I'll sell it to you.  Is the buyer similarly subject to this statute?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, we are assuming the purchase is made in either case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So what you're saying is it doesn't matter who initiates the call?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But we do know that -- that Congress drew a line it hadn't drawn before between the own-purpose users and people who were in the trafficking business, and it expressed sympathy for the -- or leniency, a policy of leniency.  But the difference between the classification felony and misdemeanor is huge in terms of consequences for a person's life.  So let's take the defendant in this case.  If he becomes a felon, rather than a misdemeanant, even if it's his first time and it's only one gram, he loses a lot of rights, doesn't he?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but I'm speaking about the post consequences.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Like -- let's take a young person.  It has an effect on student loans, government loans?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And it may be that in certain States voting rights are removed, and there is on this person's record forever that he is a felon.  It just seems odd that Congress would have at one and the same time, in the same statute, say, we want these -- to give these people a chance, and if they are in a rehabilitation program and they make it, they won't even get any charge, not even a misdemeanor charge, and then say, but a whole group of them are going to be treated just like traffickers if they use a telephone.  It's hard -- these two would seem to be working at odds with each other.  So mustn't the Court then try to reach some accommodation, some harmonization of these two provisions?  And it was suggested that we do that by saying ""facilitation"" -- ""causing"" in this context -- means the same thing as ""aiding and abetting"".  Then we have the buyer-seller rule for the aider and abettor, and then we have made these two provisions harmonious.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the -- the statement that in the manual -- maybe this is incorrect -- but that the charging policy of the Department of Justice instructs prosecutors to charge the most serious offense supported by the facts?  And if that's true, then the Assistant U.S. Attorney would have no choice.  The most serious offense is not misdemeanor of simple possession, but it is the violation of 843(b).   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ordinarily--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Is that the policy, first of all?  That they're supposed to charge the most serious offense supported by the facts?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So that means in every one of these cases, whether the dealer picks up the phone or the buyer picks up the phone for a transaction for one gram of cocaine, the prosecutor has no choice but to indict under 843(b)?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm talking about the choice between misdemeanor, simple possession misdemeanor, or 843 -- adding on this 843(b).  The prosecutor -- if what I read is correct -- has no discretion, has to, if he makes the charge -- he cannot make a simple misdemeanor charge.  He has to charge the felony.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How does it work?  I mean, I know your overall rationale about the ease of detection -- easier to detect face to face encounter on the streets.  But here, I mean, we know that the government tapped the dealer's phone, and that's how the government got the list of the people who bought from the dealer.  How common is it that -- that either the buyer or the seller is the subject of a telephone tap?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But what had -- what had to be met in this case in order to put this tap on the dealer's phone?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So, you would interpret Congress -- now we're getting away from '56, when simple possession was a felony, to '70, when simple possession becomes a misdemeanor.  And you're saying that Congress meant to relegate the simple possessor to misdemeanor status, but only if the encounter was face to face.  So you're reading into the -- what Congress did to sharply distinguish between traffickers and users, and say but that was only taking 843(b) into account.  That benefit -- that you're not going to be a felon; you're going to be a misdemeanant -- is only for face-to-face transactions.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I'm talking about this context, the purchase of one gram of cocaine on one occasion, nothing more.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So Congress's design was we treat as a less grave offender the buyer for his own use, but only if he buys in a face-to-face encounter?  That's what -- what you would have to read -- you would have to limit the line Congress drew between traffickers, on the one hand, and possessors for their own use, on the other, and say it applies only to drugs purchased in face-to-face encounters.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Olson, I thought you conceded in the -- at least as I read your reply brief, that you were no longer saying this is about an issue unrelated to any election.  I thought you said that this was a 90-minute movie  ""concerning the qualifications, character, and fitness of a candidate for the Nation's highest office.

And, of course, the ""electioneering communication"" definition would apply only if the film had been broadcast within a specified proximity to a primary or general election in -- in 2004.  But I think--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Was -- was this issue aired before the three-judge court, the distinction between, say, putting something on network TV and putting something on View On Demand that the listener has to opt into?   Malcolm L. Stewart  --No.  Indeed, the -- the appellant in its complaint simply alleged affirmatively that his communication, if aired on DVD -- I mean if aired on VOD would fall within the statutory definition of ""electioneering communication"".   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Olson, are you taking the position that there is no difference in the First Amendment rights of an individual?  A corporation, after all, is not endowed by its creator with inalienable rights.  So is there any distinction that Congress could draw between corporations and natural human beings for purposes of campaign finance?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would that include--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Would that include today's mega-corporations, where many of the investors may be foreign individuals or entities?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Own many shares?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Nowadays there are foreign interests, even foreign governments, that own not one share but a goodly number of shares.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Could they in your view, in the view that you are putting forth, that there is no distinction between an individual and a corporation for First Amendment purposes, then any mega-corporation, even -- even if most of the investors are from abroad, Congress could not limit their spending?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But what are the -- you have used the word ""prohibition,"" Mr. Olson.  One answer to that is that no entity is being prohibited, that it is a question of not whether corporations can contribute but how.  They can use PACs and that way we assure that the people who contribute are really supportive of the issue, of the candidate.  But so the -- the corporation can give, but it has to use a PAC.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Who is the ""you""?  I mean do you -- you -- those are the directors, the CEO, not the shareholders?  We don't know what they think.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But what about the district court's finding?  Wasn't there a finding before the three-judge court that Federal officials know of and feel indebted to corporations or unions who finance ads urging their election or the defeat of their opponent?  There was a finding of fact to that effect, was there not?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So if -- so if they just covered large corporations, so you take out the mom and pop single shareholder--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Not 97 percent of the contributions.  I mean, the contributions that count are the ones from the corporations that can amass these huge sums in their treasuries.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Abrams, Times v. Sullivan was not -- did not involve overruling precedents of this Court that had been followed by this Court and others.  So, I think the situation is quite different.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There was no -- there was no decision of this Court, I mean--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --We do tend to adhere to our precedents--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --especially a case like Austin which was repeating the business about amassing large funds in corporate treasuries.  It was not a new idea in Austin, and it was repeated after -- after Austin.  But there was -- so Times v. Sullivan I think is quite distinct.  The question that was posed here is, is it a proper way to resolve this case, to overrule one precedent in full and another in part?

Litigation generally, if a court determines that a litigant is abusing the court's process by filing false pleadings, is there a remedy; and if so, what is it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that all that was at stake there was whether the employer wrongfully withheld maintenance and cure that was owing.  The allegations made by Townsend go far beyond that they just unreasonably denied him maintenance and cure.  They suggest that this litigant, as a matter practice, standard operating procedure, makes false claims before a court.  And my question to you is, isn't across the board there a sanction, wholly apart from the particular claim, for a litigant who abuses the court's processes?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How many--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But you said never in the history.  I mean, there -- there are examples like the ancient Nancy case, where the damages, where they were called exemplary -- but when you say never has there been before or after punitive awards.  But there -- there is precedent, the Nancy case in this Court, cases in lower courts, there have been punitive damages awards in -- in maintenance and cure cases.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did this Court ever hold that under FELA or under the Jones Act there are no punitive damages?  Do we -- do we have any holding to that effect?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. McCreadie, there's a question about this case, a troublesome feature of it.  That is, you are saying because there are no punitive damages available under FELA and under the Jones Act, then there certainly should not be any under maintenance and cure.  But if we have to answer those questions, whether there are punitive damages available under FELA and the Jones Act, in the context of a maintenance and cure claim, then we're deciding a much larger question than are punitive damages available for willful refusal to pay maintenance and cure.  We're deciding a question under the Jones Act, a question under the FELA, and there are a lot of people who would be interested -- and the seamen are a sizable group that the law cares about particularly -- but there would be a larger interest, a larger interest in the answer in the Jones Act context and FELA.  And to decide those questions in a case that doesn't present any claim under FELA or any claim under the Jones Act is troublesome.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought there was -- it was on the high seas.  They had DOHSA.  At the time of Moragne, there was DOHSA, but then it was when you weren't on the high seas that was the gap.  Wasn't that the case?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's what the common law was.  That's why we had Lord Campbell's Act.  That was if you die, too bad; if you're injured, you correct -- collect.  That was fixed by statute on the high seas, DOHSA.  Because there was the gap, there was no Lord Campbell's Act, the Court effectively made one up, right?  That's what it did in Moragne.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How many of these seamen who seek maintenance and cure are represented?  I mean, what is the incidence of representation for maintenance and cure claims as distinguished from Jones Act negligence type claims with the -- the possibility of large recoveries for pain and suffering?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the -- the point you are making is that the recovery under the Jones Act can be very large, and the attorney on a contingent basis would get a piece of that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because it would be swelled by the pain and suffering damages which are not available in maintenance and cure.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It hasn't come before this Court under FELA or the Jones Act, either, the punitive damage question?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that -- that was not argued by anybody.  It wasn't raised in the lower court.  It wasn't a punitive damages case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There -- there wouldn't be any maintenance and cure claim if the system worked as it was intended; that is, that if you have a sailor who is injured, the shipowner pays room and board and medical expenses.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And yet the district court kept renewing his instruction, provide funding that reasonably relates to the cost, many, many times after the SEI became effective.  And we -- we have the original decree which was, what, a declaratory judgment in 2000.  Then he issues a series of order.  None -- and none of them are ever appealed.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Starr, can I take you back to the beginning of the 60(b) motion, because you seem to have shifted ground?  The 60(b) motion as presented to the district court said that this new law passed by the Arizona legislature, 2064 --  ""2064 creates a plan for adequate funding of programs for the ELL students. ""  That was the whole basis for the 60(b) motion, whether the new law was supplied adequate funding, and the Speaker of the House and the Senate intervened specifically for the purpose of defending the new law.  Your current argument is detached from the new law.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that was the basis for the 64(b) motion, that 2064 provided adequate funding.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do we -- do we have the -- the intervention application in the papers before us and the 60(b) motion?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, what is it -- No Child Left Behind I thought has a specific saving clause,  ""Nothing in this part shall be construed in a manner inconsistent with any Federal law guaranteeing a civil right. ""  And the EEOA is such a law.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That was the fault of the Arizona attorney general, who told the court: You cannot deal with Nogales alone because under the Arizona Constitution the -- all -- all the school districts have to be treated equally.  So, it wasn't the plaintiffs that initiated that move to make it statewide; it was in fact the Arizona attorney general.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that came in in 2000 and this case was going on for, what, eight, nine years before there was ever an argument.  I mean in all of these orders that were not appealed, don't those judgments, unappealed judgments, settle anything?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I didn't think there was in the district judge's declaratory judgment, spend this much on teachers aides, that much on the other.  It was: You need a plan and you have to figure out how much it costs, and then you have to appropriate money that matches the cost.  But the district court -- I may be wrong about this, but I thought that the original declaratory judgment didn't try to tell them what the components of that plan had to be.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But he was speaking alone for years and years, and 60(b) -- and it has been said over and over again -- is not a substitute for appeal.  What wasn't appealed was that Arizona is required by Federal law to determine the cost and adequately fund a statewide system of English acquisition programming.   ",08-289X

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Ostrager, you have characterized the Second Circuit's decision in a way the Second Circuit did not.  The Second Circuit said: The confirmation of the 1986 order stands, but that order did not encompass what was added in 2004; that is, that order dealt with the debtor, with Manville and the insurers' obligation to cover Manville's liability.  The Second Circuit said: Now, this 2004 order, which concerns independent actions against insurers for their own wrong, was never encompassed in the order that they affirmed.  So I think it's quite unfair to say it's a collateral attack on the 1986 order.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  At the time of the 1986 order, had these independent actions started?  I thought at the time of the 1986 order the concerns were suits involving Manville's liability and the insurers' derivative obligation to cover.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The insurers, to the extent of the insurance proceeds.  That's what created the pot that made the settlement fund.  But what I'm trying to get at is this extra piece, because the only information we have is that Manville -- there was the conversation that's reported in the Chubb brief.  This question came up, well, what about actions against the insurers for their own wrongs?  And the answer was, oh, those aren't covered.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The Second Circuit's view was that the bankruptcy court has no authority, no subject matter jurisdiction, when the debtor -- debtor's liability is not in question.  The Second Circuit thought, rightly or wrongly, that when the liability is between two -- the question is between two non-debtors, Travelers on the one hand, the claimants on the other, Manville is not in the picture.  That's what the Second Circuit said, it falls outside the domain of the bankruptcy court.  And that could be wrong or it could be right.  But in the Second Circuit's view the bankruptcy court lacked authority to deal with the nondebtors' liability to the claimants.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The direct actions against Travelers.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  These were cases in the State courts and, as I understand it, so far none of them has succeeded.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How can you say they ignored it when they had several pages devoted to 524, and they said it was -- it didn't cover these so-called direct actions, which really aren't what we generally call ""direct actions"".  But the Second Circuit did address what Congress did to codify essentially the Manville device.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I interrupt you there?  Because you told me that the Second Circuit ignored 524(g), and I'm looking at page 33a of the petition for cert, and the Second Circuit addresses 524(g), and its discussion continues for a couple pages.  I don't see how that's ignoring the issue.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I have an answer to my question about the Second Circuit ignoring 524(g) when they devoted two and a half pages to it?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If it--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Another mystery in this most mysterious case: If it was so clear that the original order, the 1986 order, ensured Travelers that it would have no liability for asbestos claims, period, then why did it put up $400 million, much more than it put up originally, in order to settle with people who were bringing precisely that kind of claim?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What was the difference between the release that you say flowed from the 1986 order and the releases that were obtained with the $400 million?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So, specifically what was not included in the 1986 release that was included as a result of the settlement negotiations?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I would like to know the difference.  What would -- what would Travelers be liable for under the 1986 order as you read it--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --that they got freedom from as a result of this settlement?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So then -- so that the 2000 clarification order did exonerate them from traffic accidents?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I have one question before you reserve the rest of your time.  That is, you said this is -- this was a sweeping release that Travelers got in settlement for the claims of many parties.  But some people were not there, and those are the people who still want to bring their claims.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I haven't asked my question.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I would like to know what -- what notice did the people who were left out of the settlement, who were not part of the settlement, who say, so we want our day in court -- what notice did they have and what opportunity to be heard?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How can it be successive when they didn't even get their -- I mean they -- these people haven't had a day in court.  They may have a claim that's no good.  All State courts so far have said their claim is no good.  But they have a right to sue.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The rule -- the particular rule that I am asking you about is that people who have not had their day in court can be precluded--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --on the basis of newspaper notice and radio announcements?

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, in the -- at the time of 1986, there were many claims against Manville, of course, for Manville's liability.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And it's also the original source, if -- if the relator is the original source of the information.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But what about the argument that Congress wanted to, in its most recent provisions, wanted to expand qui tam availability and this would -- if you would -- if you include State and local reports, that will shrink the availability?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  When you say ""twice"", you mean in the first clause that says  ""in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing? ""   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there is a redundancy there if the statute means what you say it does; it says ""administrative hearing"" in both the first clause and the second clause.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is this particular audit report we are talking about, this is the audit report was done by an independent accountant?  Is that--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Is that -- is that audit on file with the Department of Agriculture?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Let me go back to the other Latin phrase.  If you begin at the beginning and you begin with a phrase that you have no reason to say is modified by Federal,  ""civil, criminal or administrative proceeding. ""  why shouldn't that drive the statute, what's in the first phrase?     --Well, Your Honor, I -- I want to start by making clear that we disagree that that's a better interpretation of the first clause, but I will take it as the premise.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, it's a lot hard to say you have to put a caret mark and say -- vidi -- means Federal civil, criminal and administrative hearings.     It -- it may indeed be harder to do that.  We think that it is warranted in light of the policy that motivated Congress and in light of other references to Federal administrative, civil and criminal hearings in the statute.  But even if those reasons which we think justify limiting the first category to Federal proceedings -- the Court were to disagree with that, that would not justify disregarding the clear indications of the Federal limitations on the second clause.  And there is no policy--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There was an explanation for it in the opposing brief, that Congress in -- what was it -- 1986 didn't think that the legislature was generating reports, audits, as distinguished from administrative agencies.     Well -- well, Your Honor, it is of course a -- a truism, that -- that programs are administered by the executive branch more than the legislative branch, but that is no reason to think that Congress would have meant to exclude, if those State legislatures did conduct a hearing with respect to fraud by the State, exclude that as a public disclosure.  The reason that Congress didn't include State legislative reports is because it didn't include State reports at all.  It was--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well that -- that doesn't follow like the night the day.  It could be, as it was explained, they didn't include State legislatures because they didn't think they would be generating relevant material.     --Well, Your Honor, I -- I think that it is more likely as -- as the development and progress of the clause reflects, that Congress was focused on what does the government know and what does the disclosure show about the whether the government is already or is likely to focus on the fraud.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think the question was has the Department of Justice, recognizing that there's a circuit split this very question recommended that Congress amend the statute in this particular--     --I -- I don't believe that as of yet the department has taken a specific position on -- on the legislation that is contemplated in this particular ambiguity.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Do you think that the -- when a -- when State employees want to immunize themselves from fraud, they are going to say, okay, we will disclose it where anybody -- a prosecutor could pick it up, but we will take care of the qui tam obligation.     --Well, Your Honor, I think it's important to note that, in order to be a public disclosure -- the second category at the very least -- all that needs to have happened is that information be disclosed to -- to one additional person.  That -- and that makes a lot of sense when we are talking about disclosures of the government -- Federal government's own reports because, if the Federal government is already investigating and pursuing the fraud, one other person that finds out about it and then files a qui tam action on the basis of the government's own effort is precisely the situation that Congress sought to preclude.  But it doesn't make any senses when we are talking about a disclosure to an individual by a State or local--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there's lots of disclosures -- there's lots of disclosures in Federal reports that the government isn't pursuing.     --Well, we think that the -- the disclosures -- the allegations in the types of reports, audits, investigations, that are referenced in the clause are the type that would evidence that the government is pursuing them.  And -- but where a State -- perhaps a local school board discloses facts that might give rise to an allegation of fraud in a hearing where there was only one or two members of the public in attendance, there is no reason to think that that information is going to be brought to the Federal government's attention.  The purpose of the bar is to balance -- Congress was seeking to balance two rules.  One is to encourage qui tam relators to bring information and bring suit where the information was unlikely to be something that the government -- Federal government was focusing on.  Where the Federal government was able to protect itself and bring this suit on its own, then there's no reason for the Federal government to have to share its recovery.   ",08-304X

But that ""if"" -- if the agency made a free appropriate public education -- and here, as I understand it, the school district said that this child was ineligible for special education.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So if the child was entitled to a free appropriate public education and didn't get it, then under this sub (i), wouldn't the parents be entitled to tuition reimbursement?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that's your--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --That's your construction.  But couldn't this be read to say no reimbursement if -- the word is ""if"" -- the agency, not -- so the implication is if the agency did not make a free appropriate public education available, then--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Then -- then what happens in a case which I think is like this one, where the child doesn't receive special education because the school has determined that the child is not eligible?  So the child isn't getting public education, and in the parents' view, confirmed by experts, the child is in need of special education, can't get it from the public schools, because they declared the child ineligible.  What is such a parent to do?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if you can explain what the process is--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --because Justice Scalia said the parents just went away.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, wouldn't the school say, we -- we have no obligation to get up an IEP until the question of eligibility is determined?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The IEP -- they did the IEP after the hearing officer was finished?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't it also plausible that the district will say, ten days is not a fair trial for this system, this is a child with severe learning disabilities and to give this IEP a fair chance we need ten months?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How have -- how have hearing officers been proceeding?  I mean, here we had a case that went to a hearing officer.  There is no IEP when the hearing officer begins the process.  In the -- on the eligibility or not, do hearing officers give deference to the school district and then -- so that's eligibility.  At the IEP stage, do they give deference to the student?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, the hearing officer.  The hearing officer is the first-level decisionmaker.  And the school board gives its reasons why it thinks the child is ineligible; the parent, the reasons that the child is eligible.  That's the threshold determination.  On that threshold determination of eligibility, do hearing officers presume in favor of the school district?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where are you reading this?   INTERRUPTING ",08-305X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Salmons, I thought that the -- the courts, the district court, will not provide for tuition reimbursement, unless at least two things are shown.  One is that the school district did not provide an adequate education for this child.  And two, that the private school did, and then there are equitable considerations.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you must find both, not just that the private school was a good place, but that the school district did not offer an adequate education for the child.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But procedurally we -- we know that there is a provision addressed to a court for equitable relief.  The question was put before: Where does the hearing officer get the authority to order tuition reimbursement?  Because the statute on which you rely for the court speaks only to the court's authority.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought in 2001 even the parents agreed that he didn't -- that they didn't want to put him in special education?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But we are talking about two different things.  I think the Chief was talking about putting the child in special education, and keeping the child there for 10 days.  You are talking about the school district that says  ""no special education; this child is not eligible. ""   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the parents -- I think you agree that the parents would have the burden of showing both that the school did not provide an adequate education, an appropriate education, and that the private school does?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The district court doesn't get into the act until the hearing officer is done.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And so it would be odd to have a presumption applicable in court that isn't also applicable to the hearing officer, because the court is reviewing a decision by the hearing officer.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is the department--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Does the -- does the department have a regulation that says the hearing officer may order the private school -- the parents to be reimbursed for private school tuition?

This statute -- and I think the Alaska Supreme Court treated it discretely -- is a tax on one kind of property only, these vessels.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So as long as you are taxing on the basis of the value of the ship, then you have no Tonnage Clause problem.  Is that your -- the Tonnage Clause was a specific type of measure, and if you're taxing based on the assessed value of the property, it isn't a Tonnage Clause.  Is that your--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But we have said--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Olson, we -- we have said it's not just tonnage.

I thought, quite a bit of evidence comparing covered and noncovered in this record.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, you said all that there was was a number of section 2 suits, but I think there was quite a bit more than that.

But I asked you what formula would pass if Congress wants to get at (.) wants to protect the gains that have been made but are still fragile against backsliding?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the question is, do you agree that this is unlike access to buildings by people who are in wheelchairs?

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Castiglione, you have been asked to address the mootness question -- both counsel.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Have forfeiture proceedings occurred in the plaintiffs' cases?  Is there any lingering question concerning the status of the property?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Have concluded?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There were no damage claims when the final judgment was entered in the district court?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it was a final judgment, and it went up on appeal.  And at what point did they seek to -- I mean, while the case was in the court of appeals, the final judgment dismissing the case, there was nothing for the district judge to do.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --They did not ask for damages originally.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So as the case comes to us, we have a district court final judgment dismissing the case.  The case was only for injunctive relief.  It goes to the Seventh Circuit.  It's in that shape.  We are taking the case from the Seventh Circuit.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If it been there originally, but the problem is it wasn't there.  The case comes to us on a complaint that is simply for injunctive relief.  And that is moot.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the plaintiffs -- the plaintiffs didn't appeal the denial of certification.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, maybe we should -- we should ask the plaintiffs about that.  But you're saying that the two cases that were defaulted are not moot?  Isn't a default the end of it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You said in your opening that there is just the one proceeding, and that's the petition for forfeiture.  But in your brief you suggested that there is a means that these plaintiffs could get back their property pending the ultimate forfeiture proceeding.  You mentioned a Slocum type hearing, a petition for return of their property.  So I don't understand your argument that there's one and only procedure, the forfeiture procedure, when on the other hand you are telling us that there is a means.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How do you get an expedited hearing?  I thought -- I thought for property under 20,000, the State -- the time before the forfeiture proceeding could be 187 days.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the bond is for costs, not to get your car back.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there -- is there any procedure for putting up a bond for the car so you can get the car back, for the full value of the car?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There is no -- there's no hardship under the Illinois statute?  There is no provision comparable to the Federal legislation for hardship, is there?   William M. Jay  You are correct, Justice Ginsburg, that there is no statutory provision, no.   ",08-351X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Peters, I think the Court in Geraghty said it split the interests.  And they said his interests in challenging the denial of class action status continued even though he was no longer incarcerated.  So they were concentrating on his right to appeal the denial of class action certification.  And that's what you don't have here.  And that's what distinguishes this case from Geraghty.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But we must take it as it came into the Seventh Circuit, which is no appeal from the denial of class certification.  So we have individual plaintiffs who are seeking to overturn the denial of injunctive relief.  And that's all that's before the Seventh Circuit.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that -- I thought the government said it doesn't apply to cash.  So that -- which we are told is 85 percent of the seizures involved.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Right.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't that one of the problems with the Seventh Circuit decision?  That it covers the waterfront.  It covers cash, as well as any property.  It's not concentrated on cars.  And what your complaint asks for -- you said it was as applied, but you are asking for a declaration that defendants must hold a post-seizure probable cause hearing within 10 business days, and you are asking the Court to enjoin the defendant's current practice of seizing property and retaining custody without a judicial determination of probable cause.  That sounds, to me, like a facial challenge to this statute, and you are asking for a declaration that the statute is invalid, not as applied to any particular person.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where -- where does the Seventh Circuit--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But where you said -- you said that--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --the Seventh Circuit -- your complaint, you say, is -- you asked for the universe, every kind of property of due process hearing within 10 days or a short period.  But you said the Seventh Circuit narrowed the relief.  And I'm looking at the Seventh Circuit decision, and I really don't see what was narrowed.  I think they left everything open for the district Court.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where -- where is there any narrowing?   ",08-351X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there a variety of views among the circuits on what Justice O'Connor meant by the term ""direct evidence""?  It wasn't defined in Price Waterhouse either.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So there is a range of views on what it means, starting from direct versus circumstantial, to something like strong evidence.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In any event, it was the view of only one Justice, Justice O'Connor alone.  She did make the fifth vote, but no one else accepted a direct evidence test.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, would you -- would you urge that we should count Justice White's decision as the controlling decision rather than Justice O'Connor's?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But, Mr. Schnapper, there is a difference -- and I think it's critical to your case -- between what's called the prima facie case that a plaintiff would make under the McDonnell Douglas test and proving by a preponderance of the evidence that in this case age discrimination was a motivating factor.  I think you must concede that, in order to fit within this double motive frame, you must show not simply a prima facie case, but by a preponderance of the evidence that the discriminatory factor was a motivating factor.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can -- can one know if you've met that burden before the case goes to the jury?  That is, when -- when the case starts out, it's unknown whether you have established by a preponderance of the evidence that age discrimination was a motivating factor.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Couldn't -- couldn't any Title VII case be presented in either framework?   Lisa S. Blatt  Yes.  But this is -- I will also give you, which I think is important, especially when you write your opinion, the three reasons why you should not resolve this very difficult question in this case.  And the first is that it wasn't pressed or passed on below or raised in the brief in opposition and did not receive full briefing by the parties and all the amici.  And, second, just as you left this issue open in footnote 1 of your opinion in Desert Palace, Judge Colloton writing for the court recognized this precise issue in footnote 3 of the court's opinion on petition appendix page 12, saying: Assuming there is no direct evidence requirement, we are going to have to figure out when is it appropriate to give a motivating factor instruction, absent the -- the language, express language in Title VII.   ",08-441X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  As I understand the court of appeals, it said that Justice O'Connor's opinion was the controlling opinion, it was the decision on the narrowest ground; therefore, the lower courts ought to take that decision as the law made by Price Waterhouse.  Then there's a question of what did she mean by ""direct evidence""?  But I think the Eighth Circuit certainly did say Justice O'Connor's opinion states the law of Price Waterhouse, and that was the basis on which their decision turned.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Justice O'Connor.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But Price Waterhouse deviated -- that was--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --We have these two regimes out there.  You are reciting McDonnell Douglas and say everything should follow that pattern, but to do that you have to overrule Price Waterhouse, which gave recognition to the mixed motive framework that comes out of Mount Healthy.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Schnapper recognized when I asked this question, how does this differ from the prima facie case that you make under McDonnell Douglas and Burdine?  He said: We don't have to just make a preliminary showing; we have to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the prohibited discrimination was a motivating factor.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that -- that question -- I think it can't be before us.  We would certainly want to know what the government's position is on it.  And Ms. Blatt was very clear that the government is not taking a position on that issue today.  Your brief in opposition did not so much as mention McDonnell Douglas.  So how is anybody to think that was at stake, that that regime, which you later clarify in your Respondent's brief, you think should be the sole test?  How could that come into this case when it's not in the brief in opposition and, therefore, it's not in the Petitioner's brief and it's not in the government's brief?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But your line is following that same formula.  All those cases are following that litany: prima facie case, non-discriminatory reason--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But those weren't -- those weren't thought of in the mixed motive framework.  And what you want to do is get rid of the mixed motive and say, in a discrimination case, there should be only one regime, and the plaintiff should have the burden of persuasion from start to finish.  But that's not what McDonnell Douglas did.  It's not what the Eighth Circuit did, which you acknowledge by not even bringing this up until your brief on the merits.  So -- and you also said that Title VII is out of it.  The statute has taken care of it in 1991.  Ms. Blatt, I heard her say distinctly that -- that Title VII would be affected.  She urges not to touch this question.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And I assume -- and I assume the government, because it would certainly be informative to know what the agency responsible for the administration of Title VII thinks of this question.   ",08-441X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But to some extent, would you concede that interpretation; that is, not only the attorney general under New York's law, but the superintendent of banks as well, has authority over mortgage lending?  Would -- would you agree that the part about the bank superintendent's enforcement could not be enforced against national banks?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there is -- the provision that you are talking about, 296(a), concerns the authority of the bank superintendent as well as the authority of the attorney general; isn't that so?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Just with respect to the same issue on mortgage lending where there's a concern about racial discrimination?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Anything?  And you agree to that?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Even if the New York statute--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --May we clarify one thing about the 50 jurisdictions?  The attorney general from New York is not asserting authority over bank lending in Hawaii.  So for each institution, I assume it's going to be two sovereigns, the OCC and the State attorney general, not 50 descending on the single -- single bank with respect to particular loans?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But we come to the New York Attorney General.  I see your argument that there's a certain incongruity between saying private attorneys general okay, but no public attorney general.  But on the other hand, the attorney general starts out by asking for bank books and records.  And high on the list of visitorial powers is the authority to demand the bank's books and records.  So why isn't that -- his preliminary investigation at least, why doesn't that fit within the visitorial power bundle?   ",08-453X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I thought it is a given in this case -- and tell me if I am wrong on this -- that the State substantive law is not pre-empted.  You refer, I think, to enforcement pre-emption; that is, the State law is governing law.  But the only enforcer is Federal authority; and if that's so, is there any other -- in all of Federal-State relations, any other law where the State as sovereign can prescribe but cannot enforce?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's because -- because it's picking a rate.  It's not saying there is the Federal law and it has this rate, and the State law that has that rate.  Here, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, a Federal Act, undoubtedly applies.  And that is proper Federal -- Federal law enforced by the Federal authorities.  The State law, as this picture is drawn for us, is applicable.  It's substantive law applicable to these banks, but only the Federal authority can enforce it.  That seems passing strange.  And do you have an example outside the -- the two you gave us in the National Bank Act where the State prescribes but the Federal authorities enforce?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So do you think the same answer whether -- Justice Stevens mentioned employment discrimination.  The State has reason to believe the bank is discriminating in its employment policies, and it wants to examine certain employment records in that connection.  Would you say also that, although New York can prescribe its antidiscrimination in employment law, it can't enforce it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Waxman, your mention of Watters, which has been mentioned in the briefs, I think is an inaccurate description of what that opinion held.  Watters dealt with a regime that was indisputably visitorial.  It was a registration regime, where annual fees were paid, annual reports were filed with the State financial agency, and the State monitor could go into a lending organization any time for any reason without any suspicion of wrongdoing.  The only -- so everyone agreed that was a visitorial regime.  The sole question was whether the banks -- the national bank's operating subsidiary was to be equated with a division of the national bank.  That was the only question provided the Court.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that was in the context of a State law that says, mortgage lending institution, you may not lend unless you register and do all the rest.  That was the context of Watters.  And I do not think that excerpts from that opinion should be taken out of that context, which was: You can't be in this business unless you register with us.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So one could say, yes, the Federal authorities have visitorial powers, and they can go to court.  But we have here that the State can prescribe, not a supervisory regime, but -- fair lending.  And the State wants to go into court and say the bank is violating the State substantive law, which is applicable.   ",08-453X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  General Kagan, just as a factual matter, is there any other national memorial that consists of a solitary cross, just that one symbol and no other?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, I was just curious as a factual matter whether this lone cross, if -- if there was any other memorial like that, and your answer is no, but there could be other religiously oriented memorials?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is the -- is the private property owner who has this designation free to destroy it after it's been designated a national memorial?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Could they then substitute whatever other memorial they chose?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Or would there have to be some government approval?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it wouldn't automatically require acquire a national memorial status, would it, when the government hasn't seen it, hasn't -- I thought that to get national memorial status, the government has to approve what you put up.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought the Respondents asked to have the injunction enforced.  It is typical, you get an injunction -- and I'm glad that the government has recognized that that was indeed a final decision because you appealed it to the Ninth Circuit under 1291 as a final decision.  Then the question is, are you complying with the injunction.  One side says, the winner -- who by the way has unquestioned standing to enforce the injunction that is now final that that party obtained -- the winner says: Court, please enforce the injunction.  They are not asking for a new injunction.  They say this injunction, as Justice Breyer just explained, says, do not permit the cross.  The party comes in and says: Here's my injunction; court, all I want you to do is enforce it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you know, General Kagan, any case in which there has been a permanent injunction ordered, final, no more appeals are possible, where -- and standing was in question, raised, litigated, and decided, and then when the party who won the injunction comes to the court and says, court, please enforce the injunction, that you can say, now we can go back to square one and argue again about standing?  I don't see how you can revive what has been determined by a final judgment.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, we know it isn't that because, as I think you pointed out, the same docket number.  This wasn't a new complaint.  This was a motion to enforce the judgment.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but the standing issue was independently important to the government, because the government can face this kind of question again, and if you right -- if you were right on the standing point -- I mean, I don't understand why the government would not have had a strong incentive to say, we want to get rid of these cases on the standing ground, we think the Court was wrong on standing.  But in any case, you didn't do that, and I think that you started your argument this morning in the right place when you said, let's talk about this law.  Congress said, accepting arguendo that the Court was right, here's a law that cures the constitutional defect.  And that's where you were -- that's where you started your argument.  Maybe you can pick up with that.  But--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Who would see it, General Kagan?  Who would see it?  I mean, the Seventh Circuit case, it was -- it was on level ground, lots of people used the area, and I think the Seventh Circuit required a fence and a sign.  But here, this cross is high on a cliff in a desolate area.  And if you had a little sign, who would be -- you would have to climb up to it.   ",08-472X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Eliasberg, I thought that the Ninth Circuit the first time around had taken meticulous care to make certain that the issue of the validity of the statute would not be before the Court in the first round.  Judge Kozinski wrote:  ""We express no view as to whether a transfer completed under Section 8121 would pass constitutional muster, but leave this question for another day. ""  That's on page 104a of the petition.  And then the district judge said: Yes, I recognize the Ninth Circuit didn't touch the validity of that statute, left it for another day.  The day has come.  So it is for the first time that the Court is deciding the question of whether section 8121 passes constitutional muster.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think -- I think General Kagan agreed that they -- the Veterans couldn't substitute some other memorial, if it's going to be a national monument it has to have the government's approval.  And the only one that has the government's approval is the cross.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the government's argument that suppose the government took down the cross, gave it back to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, sold them the land in exchange for land of equal value, and then the Veterans said, fine, the cross was ours to begin with.  Now the land is ours, so we just put it back.  If that would be consistent with the injunction?  The government now has nothing to do with the cross.  It's all the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and it can't be regarded a sham because it was originally the Veterans of Foreign Wars who put it up, the government didn't put it up.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then we are talking about something that is rather formal rather than substantial.  If -- if all the government would have to do is say, Congress, you didn't get it right.  You should have just made the land swap.  And then the government would take down the cross in compliance with the injunction, and then it goes right back the next day.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think General Kagan recognized that there isn't an example of a final injunction, where, after it's final as it can be, you can come back and say, but, now, I want to reargue the standing question that's already been determined.  But there was something that I did want to ask you about, Judge O'Scanlon's opinion.  He said, if -- if you prevail and you are right, what happens in Arlington Cemetery, where there's the Argonne Cross Memorial and the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice, both right here in Arlington, what happens to them?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Goldblatt, I thought that what she said -- I'm looking at Schedule C, property claimed as exempt.  She lists, as property claimed as exempt,  ""See attached list of business equipment. ""  And then we have an inventory going for several handwritten pages of all these items of kitchen equipment.  And that's what she says is the property claimed as exempt.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But she -- in her inventory, she gives figures, and they add up to the amount that she's claiming, so she evidently thinks that those numbers will cover all of her business equipment.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. -- Mr. Goldblatt, this is -- this is really my concern.  It seems what she wants is her cooking equipment, not the money equivalent.  And if the trustee had objected, she could have said: Well, if they think that this cooking equipment is worth more than the value that I put down, I'll cut out the coffee maker, I'll cut out the microwave; but what I want is the equipment, not the dollar -- dollars for it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then you're going through all the administrative expenses of having an auction where if the trustee had tipped her off, it would be like amending your pleading.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And she was so -- so upset, she said: I'll get out of the bankruptcy; I want my cooking equipment.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It was very clear that that's what the debtor wanted.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The question is whether -- the question is whether the trustee had to make an objection, when it seemed really as clear as could be that what she was seeking was to keep her equipment, not to get the -- some monetary equivalent for it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, then she has -- on your reading, her claim is improper because she's claiming more than she's entitled to.  If her claim is improper, then the trustee has an obligation to object to it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can you -- can you -- that was -- what you've just said, no requirement that the trustee object to valuation, one of the briefs -- it may have been wrong, but it's the NACBA brief at page 27 -- said  ""Challenges to valuation are the most common types of objections to exemptions. ""   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  My concern is keeping it simple, giving fair notice to people.  She's got the same amount under exempt -- the last two columns.  A rule is proposed.  It says when the two columns have the same amount, that's a clue to the trustee that the debtor is claiming all of the -- that particular property.  That's a nice, simple rule.  It tells the trustee when he has to object, and the end of the matter.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it's not in kind in the sense that she keeps the asset no matter what.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  She is contending that she would like to keep her cooking equipment and she was entitled to notice before it's going to be sold at an auction.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then -- then her claim is wrong, her claim is objectionable, and the trustee should have made an objection.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If it's not the asset itself and it's just about money, here I have a piece of property and it wouldn't matter whether it was a case of widgets or my grandmother's diamond ring.  But Congress -- this is a peculiar list it has.  It has personal jewelry, tools of trade.  It sounds like -- even though those have a dollar cap, it sounds like Congress said these are the kinds of things a debtor would want to keep in kind.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What she did do, she said: That unsettles me so much that I'm going to withdraw from this bankruptcy proceeding; beyond anything, I want to keep that -- that property.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the -- but the Bankruptcy Court did that simultaneously with saying: And I'm going to deny the trustee's motion to have an auction.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What she could have done is trimmed some items from the list.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's much less informative than if she said -- I mean, here she -- she has one list that's showing what she paid for it.  She makes her best guess.  It's -- you're suggesting that she would be entitled to the notice if she put down 100 percent> [""].  So your -- on your theory, in order to do what she obviously wants to do, preserve her kitchen equipment, she has to give no information or inaccurate information.  If she said -- I think what you're saying is if she said a 100 percent, instead of saying what she thought was the -- the value, or if she said unknown, she would be entitled to notice from -- to an objection from the trustee.  But because she has tried her best to put down what the form calls for, she doesn't get any objection from the trustee.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would she--   ",08-538X

Are you talking about the part of the leftover of the wildcard exemption that she -- she used it for food, didn't she?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do we know what -- what's--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Here I thought that the trustee got the appraisal before the creditors' meeting, because at the creditors' meeting he said to her, you put down, what, 10,000; I have an estimate that says $17,000.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Brunstad, do we know what is the division among bankruptcy judges on this issue?

Do we know what is the lay of the land among bankruptcy judges?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But this debtor did know at the creditors' meeting -- she certainly knew that the trustee was claiming the property was worth more than what she listed it as being worth.  She could have, at that point -- so she had the notice of what he was thinking.  She could have, at that point, said, I will remove as many items as necessary to bring me safely within the limit.

Then at the appellate level, is there a continuing adversary contest about whether retardation exists and, therefore, is a mitigator, or is it just the -- the judge, the appellate judge, looking over the record that has been made at trial?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So -- so that the prosecutor could still argue that was unreasonable for them to find mental retardation, so there shouldn't be that mitigator?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If they didn't make a finding on mental retardation, how -- how could the appellate court determine that it was a mitigator but overwhelmed by the aggravating -- what did the judge charge the jury about mitigators and aggravators?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  First go back to the jury.  How do we know that the jury found mental retardation as a mitigator?   INTERRUPTING ",08-598X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the Ohio Supreme Court acting years before Atkins.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The -- wasn't the Ohio Supreme Court decision in this case pre-Atkins?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And it was dealing with retardation as a mitigator, not retardation as conclusive that there can be no death penalty.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But before you get to whether -- anything like that, you are urging issue preclusion against the winner.  It was a death sentence in this case.  And I am not aware of issue preclusion operating against a judgment winner.  Issue preclusion is for the party who fought this out and won.  Here we have a death sentence.  So there -- the ultimate determination, whatever intermediate determinations might have been made on the way, like mental retardation exists and was a mitigator, the ultimate judgment is death.  And I am not aware of, in all of issue preclusion, where a judgment winner is precluded.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the question is what is the issue, and an intermediate finding, say mitigation, on the way to the ultimate conclusion, life or death, is not the same issue as if retardation is found, no death penalty.  It's -- it's the ultimate issue in the case that was before the Ohio Supreme Court is, do the aggravators outweigh the mitigators?  That's the ultimate determination, and that's what would have preclusive effect, not the many intermediate findings that may have been made on the way to the ultimate determination of death.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How do you say you have -- you don't find that in the cases when you said to me, and I think frankly you were right, that issue preclusion -- and there are many, many cases on issue preclusion -- is something that a judgment winner uses, not a judgment loser, and here the Ohio -- yes, they weighed and they found retardation, but they also found overwhelmed by the aggravating circumstances.  So the ultimate determination of that, of all the courts, is death?  I don't see how you get to elevate an intermediate determination -- there are many; some go for one party, some go for the other -- to become the outcome determinative factor.  The outcome determinative factor is that the aggregators outweighed whatever mitigators there were.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But Ashe is about somebody who was acquitted.  He won.  There was no doubt that he won.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It didn't say anything about, well, suppose he didn't win.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  We have the factor that you would preclude Ohio from doing, when we expressly said that here is the rule: You can't execute the mentally retarded.  However, we are going to leave it to the State to shape the procedure, and what are the elements of retardation?  You would take all that away from Ohio because in a different context, the context of weighing mitigators against aggravators, the Ohio Supreme Court said there was retardation, it is mitigating; however, it was overwhelmed by the aggravators.  It's an entirely different operation than, States, here's the rule; the procedure for doing it is up to you.  Ohio didn't have a procedure for doing Atkins.  It couldn't until Atkins was decided.  And now you're saying, oh, Ohio, because you, in the context of weighing mitigators against aggravators, found this mitigator, you cannot shape the Atkins procedure as every other State can.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the incentive is vastly different, which is an important factor in issue preclusion.  That is, if the prosecutor thinks that there's overwhelming evidence of the aggravators, the nature of the crime, the prosecutor is not going to care so much about, so there is mental retardation as a mitigator; but when it's a difference, when the prosecutor wants to go for the death penalty and it thinks that it's got a secure case on the atrocious matter in which the crime was committed, there isn't the same incentive to litigate as there is when it is the ultimate question, not an issue on the way to reaching the ultimate judgment.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did they admit that as a finding of fact, or did they say that mental retardation had been found as a mitigator by the Ohio Supreme Court?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It was an admission; it couldn't have been a finding of fact.  You said that that's what the State claimed.  Where is the admission of the State in this State postconviction proceeding that Mr. Bies is mentally retarded?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You told me that this -- that State conceded that the defendant was mentally retarded, and I'm -- that's what I asked you.   ",08-598X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you didn't contest it in two.  Two cases, you concede that there was in fact a conference.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but the board can make rules of procedure.  It can't make rules of jurisdiction.  The dismissal of all these petitions was for want of jurisdiction.  Now, if the board has no authority to set its jurisdiction -- and I think that's plain; Congress has that authority, not the board -- then it is required to exercise the jurisdiction that Congress gave it.  So why isn't that the very first question that this Court should deal with?  The board threw these cases out for want of jurisdiction.  Whatever the failing was, it was not and could not be jurisdictional because the board has no authority to describe its own jurisdiction.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you say this is just a mistaken use of words, rather than -- than the board saying, under our rules, we don't have power to handle this?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you -- do you dispute what your opponent tells us, that some panels of the board, even when there has been no conference, let alone no proof of a conference, but some panels have stayed proceedings to allow the conference to occur, and then the board will pick up?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I am looking at the decision and they are all identical in this respect.  The board said it has no jurisdiction to consider any of the remaining procedural or substantive issues associated with this claim.  ""No jurisdiction"", that sounds like they are saying: We have no authority to consider anything about this case; we must toss it out because there is no proof of the conference.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And it's going against another panel that says, not only you don't have to have the proof, even if you didn't have the conference we are not going to throw you out.  Now, there is different panels, but it is the same board.  Why shouldn't the grievants here say, we don't understand this?  It's conceded there was a conference, at least in two of the cases.  Our buddies didn't even have a conference and this same board, a different panel, allowed them to cure it.  And I can't cure it now.  That is the height of arbitrary behavior by the board, it seems to me.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm not -- I'm not talking about due process.  I'm talking about conformity with the act, the act's requirement.  I--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --So does the board as a whole apparently, because I am looking at the instruction about joint exhibits and it tells the parties, when you are going to make a submission don't include unnecessary documents, and among things don't include things that aren't in dispute--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --like letters requesting conferences.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then the board is telling people, I will go back a sentence:  ""Representatives may wish to omit documents that are unimportant and/or irrelevant to the disposition of the dispute. ""  I mean that -- that seems to me is trapping people, if the board says, please don't dump on us unnecessary paper.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then if -- then a person following this is obliged not to pay heed to this advice because if you don't put in every document, if you don't put in enough evidence of conferencing, you are going to be out and never have your grievance heard.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They are not relying on it as applicable in this case.  They are relying on it as the board's indication that it's sound to tell the parties, don't dump on us unnecessary paper.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Some panels of the board.  Other panels think this is an eminently curable defect.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's a decision on the merits.  Here we are talking about a threshold barrier to even get your case heard.  And that is being decided differently by different panels.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And in two cases you concede that that condition was met, that there was a conference?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So we are not even talking about a conference requirement.  We are talking about a pleading rule, how you plead.  Everybody concedes that the conference occurred in two cases.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's how you plead that.   INTERRUPTING ",08-604X

You say, ordinarily, that's what the -- the carrier will -- would do, and then you are tipped off, and then you put in your evidence about conferencing.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You would be on absolutely sound ground if this were a convention on the mutual recognition of jurisdiction and judgment, but it's not.  You -- you said the whole question is deferring to the courts of habitual residence, but this statute is not raised in terms of court jurisdiction.  It's in terms of the right of a custodial parent.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You're not relying on the order; you're just relying on the statute?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What happens to the woman who, now she has abducted the child to Texas, and she says to the Texas court: If you send me back, I am going to be beaten by this man who has a history of being a batterer?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You are saying that the court -- the court that's asked to give effect to the convention is helpless, that it's automatic that if there is a custody right, the court in the state to which the child has been taken must order that the child be returned?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you know--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Ms. Howe, wasn't the -- the problem that gave rise to this Abduction Convention just the situation that Justice Breyer brought up?  That is, the parent that has visitation rights snatches the child, takes it to that parent's home country, and then you are relying on only the court order.  That's why we have the Hague Convention on the Abduction of Children.  It wasn't for the -- I mean, this -- this case is not the usual case.  The usual case is the noncustodial parent takes the child out of the country where the custodial parent lives.  And, internationally, there was a huge problem of getting the child back, and that's why we have the Hague Convention on Abduction, because courts weren't enforcing foreign court orders.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, what is the -- what is the significance of their breaking down the two categories?  One is the rights of custody, and the other is rights of access.  Because I take it that under your view of the Chilean law, given that the noncustodial parent will always have this right to block taking the child out of the country, then there's really no difference between the two categories, because every, say, father with the right of access -- not custody, just access -- would automatically by virtue of the law of Chile have this one custodial right; that is, to block taking the child out of the country.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You don't question what the representative of the mother has said in this case, that the emphasis -- when this Hague Convention was before Congress, the emphasis was on the custodial parent -- that is, the person in the situation of the mother here -- that what Congress was told was the urgent problem was the noncustodial parent taking the child away from the custodial parent.  That was the -- the major thing that drove this convention and that's what the State Department told Congress; isn't that so?   Ginger D. Anders  --I believe the State Department's legal analysis stated that the typical case might be one in which a parent with -- with primary physical custody had the child, but the visiting -- the parent with visitation rights took the child to another country.  But the fact that it was a typical case means that it wasn't the only type of case, and as -- as family law has developed over the past 30 years, joint rights of custody have become more and more prevalent, and we, therefore, think that this is a joint right to determine residence under the convention, because it gives the father the right to withhold or grant consent to the child's removal from the country.   ",08-645X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, you could say -- you can say that the mother did not have full custodial rights.  One custodial right is certainly to determine where the child will live.  And the mother did not have that right with respect to taking the child out of the country.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's a provision--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --If he has the right to say no, don't take the child out of the country, then he has something more than a right of access.  You -- you are talking, well, she has the rights of custody.  But because he -- it's not just the court, because it's his consent in the first instance.  He has a right to determine that the child shall not live outside the country of habitual residence.  That is not a right of access.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought the statute says the consent of the -- of the other parent.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that's true of custody decrees generally.  We get them modified by a court in the best interests of the child.  So it -- but in the first instance, it says -- it's he has the consent or withholding consent.  And my question to you is, whatever that is, it isn't a right of access?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It just says that the right of access is the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child's habitual residence.  There's nothing about procedure or substance in this; it says this is what right to custody is, and this is what right of access is.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Not according to the -- what is it, the Chilean central authority, you know, the letter that was sent to the Second Circuit, I think in the Duran case.  The -- the authority within Chile that is responsible for the implementation of this Hague Convention said that it regarded that statute to create a custody right for purposes of the Hague Convention.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought there was a sentence in there -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong -- that said that the statute, under Chilean law, amounted to a right of joint custody.

But you are also urging that when the lawyer is silent on a matter that he should inform the defendant that, too, is covered.  But whichever way you do it, how do you -- you say certainly deportation is a consequence that the defendant should be told about.  What about -- how do you distinguish that from, say, you'll lose your driver's license, you'll lose your right to vote?  How do we distinguish the consequences that count and those that don't?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But even -- even if we accept that, wouldn't a competent counsel, after telling him the deportation consequences, then say, but this is a case where the evidence is so strong against you, I advise you to take the plea rather than go to trial.  If you go to trial, you are likely to lose and you will get a longer sentence.  So does it matter in the end if competent counsel would have said, this is a good plea, take it?

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that would be what in this case?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How do you -- how do you know that?  In this case, Mr. Kinnaird told us the defendant might have preferred to go to trial because he had this defense that he didn't know what was in the packages.   Michael R.

In this Court, the opinion said nothing about direct or collateral; it just asks the question under Strickland, and it held that Strickland does apply to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel.  But it -- staring the Court in the face was this direct versus collateral, and the Court was totally silent on that.  It didn't consider it relevant to its determination.   ",08-651X

Why isn't the proper time to determine number of days to appeal when the judgment is entered?  And at that point, one can see that the government has done nothing, absolutely nothing in the case.  At the inception, I agree with you, we don't know what, if anything, the government is going to do.  But by the time judgment is entered, we surely know.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But we hear the government did nothing, not one thing.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The test is -- I don't know what you mean by ""active participation"" as opposed to just plain participation.  If the rule is at the time judgment is entered to determine how much time you have to file your notice of appeal, the question is, has the government done anything?  And if the government has done nothing at all, then you have 30 days.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there any advantage?  I mean, a notice of appeal is the easiest document, so it's not a question that there's any labor involved in doing this.  But is there any advantage to filing -- to taking the 60 days instead of the 30 days?  Why would counsel want to take advantage of the extra 30 days?  It isn't a question of a labor, having to write, like having to write a brief.  What advantage would there be to taking the additional 30 days?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How would the -- how would you know at the time of filing of the notice of appeal whether the government is thereafter going to file an amicus brief?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The government is not saying it doesn't need the 60 days.  It's saying you don't qualify for the 60 days, you are not the government.  I don't think the government is arguing that its own time can be shortened.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can the government appeal without having intervened in the district court?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Allen, you used a term before, and I think you were right in using it -- you said, v. Beneficial is a narrow exception and it -- the theory is, it is a final judgment.  It's not interlocutory.  And, nowadays, the courts have 1292(b).  They can certify a question, if they think it's sufficiently important and they need an answer, without pretending that it's a final judgment in the case.  So, given 1292(b), shouldn't we be particularly reluctant to extend Cohen v. Beneficial to include a case of a privilege that maybe was wrongfully denied?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that's what 1292(b) was meant to deal with.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's not -- it's not a rule of efficiency.  It's a firm final judgment rule that we have in the Federal system.  And we are talking about a narrow exception.  The exception was first declared in Cohen v. Beneficial.  The question there was security for costs, yes or no?  Does that -- that is a pure question of law.  It doesn't depend on the variety of factual circumstances.  Attorney-client is quite different because it can often be fact-bound.  It depends upon this particular case.  Cohen v. Beneficial was meant for the kind of question that doesn't get you into the facts.  Otherwise, once you get into -- once it's a fact-bound question, you are really eroding the final judgment rule.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you are carving out an area, attorney-client privilege, as opposed to the kind of situation Cohen v. Beneficial dealt with.  Here's a rule that a State has.  You have to put up security for costs before you go ahead with a class action.  The answer to that is either yes or no, that it either requires it or it doesn't require it.  No facts at all.  You just have a class action, you need security for costs.  Maybe this particular case doesn't involve many facts, but there will be attorney-client privileges cases, waiver cases that surely do.  So we can't take that category, attorney-client privilege, and equate it to what was the kind of question at issue in Cohen.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because those are cases that say your right is not to be tried, your right is not to be exposed to trial at all.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Allen, one of the purposes, one of the -- the underpinnings of Cohen v. Beneficial is that this kind of question is not going to come up very often, but attorney-client privilege, once you say that that's open to -- everything stops while you go to the court of appeals to get that.  And if you -- and if we hold the way you want us to, then a lawyer will be obligated every time she thinks that she has a valid claim to the privilege or that it hasn't been waived, she would be obligated to take an appeal which you are urging would be an appeal of right.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there any sensible line between an invocation of the privilege, denied, and a holding that the privilege has been waived?  I know in your reply brief you -- you draw some kind of a distinction between waiver of the privilege and the existence of the privilege.  I didn't follow it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There is another.  You are stressing the importance of the attorney-client relationship, the work of the attorney.  Do you extend your position to work product?  It's not privileged.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it's certainly -- it's certainly protected against disclosure.   ",08-678X

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Kneedler, I think I have this right, but correct me if I am wrong.  I thought in Cohen v. Beneficial, it wasn't just a question that we would like to get this legal question settled, but, in fact, for many plaintiffs if security for costs was something that the Plaintiff has to put up up front, that would be the end of the lawsuit.  It would be the practical end of the lawsuit.  Unlike in an attorney-client privilege, the suit goes on.  So Cohen v.

It's not the same situation that it was when he was initially questioned.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why wouldn't he think, I invoked my right to remain silent without a lawyer two years and seven months ago, I will do it again; they will have to stop questioning?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It was changing conditions.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Alleged changing conditions.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And this case -- this case could come out the same.  If we remand and we say that it's the traditional standard, this case might well come out the same way.  The -- the court might say, well, it doesn't make it under the traditional -- it hasn't shown a likelihood of success on the merits.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But -- but the standard that you say should apply under (b)(3)(B) is a standard that is described as applicable to temporary injunctions.  The word -- there is substantial likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm -- that that's -- that's the standard preliminary injunction, not preliminary stay.  The preliminary injunction standard.  So the two words certainly overlap.   ",08-681X

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And you would expect the standard to be in the (b)(3)(B) provision.  It says that no automatic stay unless the court otherwise orders.  Period.  That's the end of it.  So if one just read this, one would think that the normal standard for a stay would apply.  And then (f)(2) is separated by several pages and (f)(1) is dealing with something where we understand it.  It says no mass injunctions against the enforcement of a provision.  But (2) is really puzzling what it relates to.  If it's supposed to have some relationship to (1), (1) says you can't enjoin the enforcement of a provision of the law.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I ask just a technical point?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  One of the -- the motion to reopen was based on changed circumstances in Cameroon.  But there was also this independent application for adjustment of his status, which was turned down because this was a successive motion.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  As I understand it, the status adjustment could not have been asked for earlier because his wife didn't come become a citizen until after.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but now -- now he would qualify, except that it's a successive motion.  So it seems earlier he was premature and now he's too late.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I just ask a question?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This person is married to a citizen, has an American-citizen child.  Is there any way that his status could be adjusted?  It can't in this procedural situation because it's a successive motion.   ",08-681X

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Benza, do you know of any case where ineffective assistance was found on the basis of a closing argument alone?  General Cordray pointed out that this lawyer had put on a number of witnesses to testify to the defendant's mental illness, and that he did play that theme in the closing.  Do you know of any case where the closing, not tied to the way the case was presented at trial, was held sufficient to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You just told me that, under Strickland, under anything, there has been no case in which there has been a decision for the defendant, based on the inadequacy of the closing argument alone.  So you are asking us to take a new tact and inviting arguments focused exclusively on the closing argument, to see if it meets the Strickland standard.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why -- why isn't it the Strickland analysis that you read the charge in the context of the case that was presented at trial, and, here, the case was.  The only thing going for the defendant were the witnesses to his mental illness and whether, eloquently or not, that theme was played to the jury.  This is a mentally ill man.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How many -- how many issues were before the Ohio Supreme Court?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So the Ohio Supreme Court, faced with 67 issues, would have to write at least a per curiam opinion on each of the 67 to insulate itself against being overturned on federal habeas?

Hudnut, where cities attempted to make not even a criminal offense, but the subject of a civil suit, a violent depiction -- depictions of women as sexual objects enjoying pain and humiliation and degradation.  The Seventh Circuit said that that was a blatant violation of the First Amendment, to go after purveyors who show these women in the shocking, degrading photographs, and I believe we summarily affirmed.

What is the difference between -- perhaps I missed something a few moments ago -- between bullfighting, cockfighting, dogfighting?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Long, we're talking in the abstract--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --referring to Scott, but -- that this case -- what I took away from the Second Circuit's opinion was the flaw here was not that the method was no good if you had adequate notice; the flaw was the people affected were not told in what is the language of ERISA, in plain, simple language, what their entitlement was.  And that's -- that's the problem, not that this method wasn't perfectly satisfactory if you gave everybody notice.  But the Second Circuit said, you didn't give them notice.  Either it said nothing or it was totally ambiguous.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if -- if there were information, but the -- the ERISA provision says that you are supposed to give the summary description of the plan  ""in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant. ""   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And all that the 1989 statement said was the amount the employees received may be reduced, if they previously left the company and received a distribution at that time.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But where is it -- what -- what was in the summary plan description on this point between 1980 and 1990, where is that?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Right.  So there was no description of this in the summary plan description?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So is it -- but what period?  Between 1980 and 1990 or the 3-month period--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --you're talking about?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you seem to be rearguing the -- I thought that the -- I thought that you had surrendered on -- what is it called?  Frommert I.  That -- that the Second Circuit said: What you had was no good, because it violated the notice provision and it violated the anti-cutback provision.  So that's what they call a phantom--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --account.  It's out.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's out.  But you seem to now be telling us that was really a wrong decision on the Second Circuit's part, that there was -- that it was perfectly good, that it was described in the plan itself, although not in the summary plan description.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How does it -- how does it hurt the current employees?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You say they -- they don't get this--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --So some kind of equal protection, that another worker will say: I didn't get that boon that my--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But there's no -- no -- nothing -- no deduction from the current workforce.  They're getting what the plan said all along is the right calculation of benefits.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Roberts, I thought you said in this -- in this case -- and we're only dealing with this case -- there was the same basic problem, the same flaw in the second interpretation.  And you said in both cases, they wouldn't satisfy ERISA's notice requirement.   Matthew D. Roberts  --That's right.  Because ERISA requires the summary plan description to identify any circumstances that will result in an offset, to describe the offset in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant, and not to minimize the significance of the offset.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is it -- is it -- Mr. Roberts, is it a remedy?  So that's -- one thing is you can view this as the district court as substitute interpreter of the plan, or another way you can look at it is to say, the -- the benefit determination was wrong, we reject it, the court rejects it.  So, now, there is a remedy for that wrongful determination.  So is this, what's going on in the district court, an interpretation of the plan or a remedy for a wrongful determination?   Matthew D. Roberts  --In a benefits action, the first question is to interpret the plan, but what you have here is a plan that is silent and a plan that -- where interpreting the plan to provide for a certain kind of offset, there is inadequate notice in the summary plan description, so there's a violation of ERISA.  So, in this circumstance, not ordinarily, whenever there's a misinterpretation of the plan, but in the circumstances here, it is a remedial decision because the court has to fill the gap in the plan that's the result of the silence of the plan.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --The SEC doesn't have another overseer.  I mean, the SEC is set up like the FCC, the other independent regulatory commissions, but this is a board that has a relationship with the SEC, where it can't do anything that doesn't have the SEC's approval.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It can't even issue a subpoena without the SEC's approval.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So the SEC really could stop anything?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What happened to the Petitioners here?  I think, if you were challenging what happened to the Petitioners here, certainly it would be a question of how you would have to do that.  You ordinarily go through the internal proceedings.  But here you are bringing a facial challenge and you say, never mind any particular proceedings; the whole thing is no good.

So who can appoint such people in the FEC, the FTC, the FCC, and so on?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So this whole thing would be constitutional if, instead of giving the appointing power to the commission, they had given it to the chairman?

There's a problem that Congress had to solve.  It wanted to tighten the oversight of the auditing function.  And they wanted to have people who were not beholden to the profession, but who were knowledgeable and could command high salaries to be doing this job.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Cohen, you said in your brief that, in such a case, the prevailing party could argue that counsel should obtain a higher hourly rate in the litigation than the customary rate he or she charges in other cases, and that's the situation Justice Sotomayor inquired about.  But that sounds to me -- you take the second-year associate, pay him at the rate of the top partner because her performance was so outstanding.  That's an enhancement, but it isn't as transparent as the one that Judge Shoob gave.  But you -- this suggestion -- maybe you are going to retreat from it -- that it would be appropriate to take the second-year associate and pay at a higher hourly rate than the customary rate for that associate.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But not necessarily--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But we are going back to the judge, who did say that this was the best performance he ever saw.  So I can't credit just that it was just contingency.  But, first, you have clarified that what you said in your brief meant only the top range for a lawyer of this, period.  So this is more limited than -- than one might take it to be.  In some circuits, like the D.C. Circuit, the rate is set by the number of years that the person is out of law school, and there isn't any flexibility.  I mean, you give the 1-year associate so much, the 5-year associate so much.  So how in a system like that could you take into account quality at all?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is -- is there another example?  I mean, you -- you are saying the rule isn't never; it is sometimes.

Shah  --Your Honor, that is the only one that I think is left after this Court's fee-setting jurisprudence over the last 25 years.  It has consistently knocked down other bases for an enhancement such as complexity of issues, novelty of issues, contingency risk, delayed payment.  All of those other grounds of potential enhancement that the legislative history refers to have been categorically prohibited by this Court's jurisprudence.  I think that--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How about a downward adjustment?  You have the hourly rate, the number of hours, and the judge, after trimming the hours, then says: This has been a case, even though they prevailed, the lawyer wasn't prepared; I am not going to give the hourly rate.  Can a judge adjust the lodestar down for poor performance?   Pratik A.

I don't think that poor performance alone would justify a downward departure--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Hensley is you lost on an issue, so you don't get paid for what you've done.   Pratik A.

So if there were certain claims that the poor performance led -- led the plaintiff to be unsuccessful on certain claims but not all the claims, I think a downward departure would be appropriate.

Another is, in this case it was 75 percent.  How do you know what's the right multiplier?  That -- the concern is you are going to have variations from district judge to district judge in how good the performance was, in what is the appropriate multiplier.

And then there's a cutback, and there are going to be layoffs.  So the last hired is the first fired.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They just go back to the raw scores, and each time they picked the top people.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, what is -- what is the list, other than an administratively convenient way to use the scores?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So even though there is a clear case on the merits of disparate impact, unless the suit is commenced within 30 days of the announcement, then it's as though it were lawful.  That's your position.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is that -- is that -- there's a free pass.  You don't sue within 30 days of the compilation of the list and the notice of the list; you sue 420 days later.  The discriminatory practice gets frozen, the status quo gets frozen forever.  That's -- that is your position, is it not?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But this is not exactly a title -- a statute of limitations.  It's a time you have to file your charge.  It's a charge filing.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I didn't understand the Third Circuit rule to equate discretion with inadequacy.  I thought their position was -- the assertion was that the rule was mandatory; that is, if you are fugitives, you are out forever.  But in fact, at the time that Kindler fled, the rule was discretionary, so the mandatory rule hadn't been firmly established.  That's what I thought the Third Circuit held.  It did not equate discretion with inadequacy.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the fugitive forfeiture rule that they were talking about was the -- the mandatory rule wasn't firmly established.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You mean that the defendant might not have escaped if he knew that the rule wasn't--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But the question that you present -- I mean, you state it forthrightly in your brief, and I'm reading from page 7, you say:  ""The court of appeals interpreted this Court's precedent to compel a finding of inadequacy for any State procedural rule that permits the State courts to exercise a degree of discretion. ""  ""Any discretion is inadequate. ""  That's what you say the court of appeals interpreted this Court's precedent to say: Discretion, inadequate.  Well, I'm looking first at the petition appendix page 62, which describes the district court's understanding, which the Third Circuit affirmed.  It says:  ""An occasional act of grace by a State court in excusing or disregarding a State procedural rule does not render the rule inadequate to procedurally bar advancing a habeas claim in district court. ""  Well, that's saying, yes, you can have a rule with discretion, not to follow the rule woodenly, and that doesn't make it inadequate.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, do you want to modify then what you said?  You said that the court of appeals said that any -- any degree of discretion means that the rule is inadequate.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But what makes -- makes this particularly puzzling is you are attributing a rule to the Third Circuit that that very circuit in Campbell v. Burris said was not a tool.  In the -- in Campbell v. Burris, the Third Circuit said a State procedural rule can't be, cannot be rendered per se inadequate merely because it allows for some exercise of discretion.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, it would be really odd, considering that one member of the panel was on both cases, Stapleton, and these cases are in the same year, for at least that judge not to think that what he said in the one case was in no conflict with what he said in the other.   ",08-992X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, what's the interest in not applying this in this case?  As you say, that's a fine rule.  If you are a fugitive, you are out.  You say that wasn't the rule at the time he escaped.  But you are not asserting any reliance interest by the escapee, that, gee, if I knew that the rule was going to be mandatory, I wouldn't have a chance to appeal to the discretion, I wouldn't have escaped.  There is no -- there is no absence of notice that -- that matters.  I mean, if he had notice he would have still escaped, I assume.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you just said that it would be okay to have a rule going forward that if you are a fugitive, you are out.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There is a certain irony that the case you're relying on on the merits is Mills, where if he hadn't escaped he would have gone through the whole process before Mills was decided.   ",08-992X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which means -- which means what?  What is the consequence of that?  You concede that on the strict application of the 6 months she -- her income is much too high for her possibly to pay the creditors.  So what happens to her?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's -- can you explain that?  It seems very odd.  It says she can do that if she doesn't do what the statute requires her to do.  I mean, she's supposed to file that schedule.  She's required, the statute says, to file it.  But she gets an advantage if she doesn't do what she's instructed to do?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Moveable to where?  What -- what would be -- you say -- this time period, the statutory -- the 6-month lookback, she has these 2 extraordinary months.  So now she's going to say: Court, please change the period.  Change it to what?  Anything she wants?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you already told us that there could be a deviation through this 101(10A)(ii).  And why, if that was all that needed to be done, did the trustee recommend, did the trustee say, bankruptcy judge, let's move the period, let's use this provision and we will get another period that doesn't have those 2 months with the extraordinary income?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, it could have been suggested to the debtor: You can accomplish what you want by using this provision.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But let me just stop you there, because then the answer you gave to the Chief and to Justice Scalia doesn't fit.  Chief -- you can not -- the bankruptcy judge is not going to confirm the plan was she has to pay over $1,000 a month, because she could never do that.  So you are not going to get that confirmed plan which could be amended later.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, what in addition to -- you brought up the 101 solution that she doesn't do what the statute tells her to do, so she's able to move it if the judge agrees.  And you said she has other options.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then the creditors would have been a lot worse off, would they not have been?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, why would -- why would the trustee be urging the possibility that it would be okay for her to file under Chapter 7, in which case the unsecured creditors would get very little, but it's not okay for her to use chapter 13 with a plan that would give the unsecured creditors substantial payments?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't that -- wouldn't that amount to just a -- a waste of everybody's time, to dismiss it and then refile it, and then she gets a time period that doesn't -- why -- why not just drop out those 2 months that are not representative of her income?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the thing is -- but you have explained, your number one solution for her is this 101 route, which is -- gives lots of discretion in the court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How do you deal with the Petitioner's -- the two arguments Petitioner makes?  One is that on the expense side, Congress provided for special circumstances, exceptions, and it didn't on the income side?   Sarah Harrington  Well, the special circumstances exception comes in, in the calculation of the debtor's current disposable income, but it doesn't tell you what to do in terms of projecting that disposable income.  And so you can adjust what you think the current disposable income is based on an expense that isn't accounted for in the standard expenses or an expense that is accounted for, but is higher than is accounted for in those expenses.  But again, it doesn't tell you what to do -- how to project that number going forward.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the argument that this is a simple thing; she didn't have to file the plan -- she didn't have to file the petition at a time when those two months would be in the 6-month lookback.  She could have waited.   Sarah Harrington  Well, that is certainly true of this debtor, of the Respondent in this case.  That is not an option available to all debtors, many of whom are facing foreclosure proceedings or imminent foreclosure proceedings.  Delay is simply not an option.  And if I could address Section 101(10A)(A)(ii) option that the Petitioner offers -- I mean, one thing to note is it doesn't give the Court the discretion to set any other -- to just pick any other 6-month lookback period.  They pick a date and go 6 months back from whatever that date is.  So if a change occurs very soon before the filing of the petition, it makes it very hard for a court to use that provision to change the lookback period because you would have to wait 6 months, essentially, after the filing of the petition to set it back.  But again, the biggest problem with using that section as a workaround is that that is an option that is available to debtors, but not to creditors.  If a debtor files a Chapter 13 petition along with all the Schedules that are required under Section 521 of the code, then the debtor has no option for -- excuse me, the creditor has no option and the trustee has no option--   ",08-998X

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Blatt, you do have a substantial hurdle to contend with in this Court's decision in Bowles v. Russell, which seemed to say if you have a time limit and it's statutory, it is mandatory and jurisdictional.  So here, we have a time limit set by statute, not by rule, and why doesn't -- why isn't that dispositive?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that is jurisdictional, 7292?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How much time does 7292 give to go from Veterans Court to the Federal circuit?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Blatt, you are making -- you said that the closest comparison is in the Social Security, because there's disability benefits in both cases.  Apart from one is commenced by a complaint of -- in the district court, the other, notice of appeal, is there any difference in the brand of rebuke that is -- as I understand, the Social Security review, although it is by the district court, is also on the administrative record.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Earlier you said that they wouldn't even know.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So they don't get notice, only the veterans?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You have -- in Bowles itself it was from the district court to a court of appeals, and then we have from the court of appeals to this Court, and those two provisions were cited in Bowles, 2107.  And what is the provision for--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --2101.  Those, as far as I remember, were the only provisions that were cited.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that was -- that was the Federal Circuit's position until Bowles, right?  This was an en banc decision and it overruled two prior cases.   ",09-1036
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It didn't mention -- Bowles didn't mention anything like an appeal from an agency where the district court is -- is sitting, essentially, as an appellate court.  But Bowles really was dealing with court-to-court, because it mentioned 2107 and 2101, and I don't recall that it mentioned any -- anything other than court-to-court situations.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Except that -- that one is an adversarial proceeding, immigration proceeding, and the veteran is supposed to be claimant-friendly.  But I think that the -- the -- Bowles is -- is a challenge for Ms. Blatt.  So for you, it is a Social Security context, because it seems to me the quality of review is the same; that is, what the district court does in a Social Security disability case is the same thing that the Veterans' Court does in a veterans' disability case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But isn't it -- it is an appellant review, isn't it?  I mean, the district court goes on the record before the agency.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What happened in this case?  Was there -- was there a registered representative?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You made a point earlier that, well, the Social Security, there are many resemblances, but one is founded by complaint and the other by notice of appeal.  It could be that Congress, having been so kind to veterans, thought: Why should we burden this pro se, or at least lawyerless, veteran with writing out a complaint?  The notice of appeal is just a simple one-line document.  So could that explain why Congress said you begin with a notice of appeal instead of a formal complaint?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there is no determination on the merits whether this claimant should prevail?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That hasn't been aired because the Veterans' Court said it had no jurisdiction and the Federal circuit said that's right.  So we don't know if this is good or bad claim.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Congress couldn't just award money because there has to be an adjudication.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Justice Scalia just asked you: Could this be -- if Congress decided that this was a harsh result, could it be made retroactive, but for Congress to say, well, just what is it going to rely on to say whether it gives compensation or not?  I mean, the Government's position was he wasn't entitled to compensation for home care, which is what he was receiving.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  On the length of time, which is, you said, 120 days -- that's a long time, but isn't it on cert?  It's 90 days plus 60, right?  So it's even more?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the total number of days would exceed 120, assuming the application is made--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Application to extend this time.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's really the only thing that counsels your result, because in Reed you took -- the Government took the position that a statutory provision is non-jurisdictional if it does not speak in jurisdictional terms and doesn't address the power of the court.  I understand that was the Government's position in Reed.  Today you are saying that the only thing that counsels your result is the fact that Congress used the words ""notice of appeal"".  Is that correct?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there any statute on the time to appeal -- has any statute been held, quote, 2107, that extensions are possible?  Is there a 121 days or whatever, and that's it?  No extension, no matter what the circumstances are?

So that, let's say, there has been discovery; now we're just at the pleading stage.  The company would have said: That's it, we didn't have any more?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But they might have been able through discovery to find that there were many more.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But why shouldn't that determination be deferred until there's discovery, and then we can know how many reports there really were?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Hacker -- Mr. Hacker, you just said, if I understood you correctly, that when the -- when the news came out on Good Morning America, accurate or not, there was an obligation to do something about it, but among the -- the charges, it's not simply that there was these reports, but it's the way the company responded to them: Two press releases that said allegations of any link of these drugs to anosmia are completely unfounded.  That statement was made even after the -- what was it, Dr. Jafek?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --had this presentation, and he was going to put Zicam's name on it and the company said, you don't have any permission to do that.  So the company prevented Good Morning America from happening earlier, and it made these affirmative statements that there's no linkage.

According to Cetus or Roche, at the time that this scientist came to Cetus to work, there was no Federal funding; that that Federal funding for this project, the Stanford project, came about after the scientist had spent his 9 months at Cetus.  At least that's the picture that -- that they draw, that the Federal -- that they got their assignment from the scientist at a time when there was no Federally funded project.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Ayer, it seems the Federal Circuit emphasized a distinction between the scientist saying ""I will assign"", which was the language used in the agreement with Stanford, and ""I hereby do assign"", and it seems that that was critical to the -- to the Federal Circuit's decision.  They say -- they cite a whole bunch of cases.  The suggestion seems to be that if Stanford had said ""I hereby do assign"", there would be no case because Stanford would have been first in time.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is that what we're dealing with in this case?  I mean, there was a -- an agreement, a standard Stanford agreement, that said I will assign any -- any patent.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So why isn't that the beginning and end of this case?  I mean you -- there are important questions presented.  But the Federal Circuit said everything turns on the difference between ""I will assign"" and ""I hereby assign"".

Is that -- the Cetus agreement said ""I hereby assign"", and the Federal Circuit said for that reason, even though it was second in time, it takes precedence.  Stanford just said ""I will assign"".  So if Stanford had instead used exactly the formula that Cetus used --  ""I agree to assign and hereby do assign. ""  --would you have any case?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So if the Cetus agreement that came second in time had said ""I will assign"", then again, you would have no case?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  We -- we have a number of sample clauses in this record, and some say ""I will assign"".  Some say ""I hereby do assign"".

We're just saying we paid more money for it than we should because it wasn't of the quality that it was represented to be.  When the Federal judge said, having to make a determination of West Virginia law, no, it's not the law; you have to show causation, some harm to you.

But what was used here was quite a heavy gun, and that is the -- an empty suit injunction, which seems to say: We're not going to trust the West Virginia court to apply issue preclusion.  We're going to stop that court from proceeding altogether.  And the anti-suit injunction is -- it's a very strong weapon, and even though it's the -- the clients who are being precluded, it's really saying to another court: We're not even going to let you get to this question, we're going to stop you.  So maybe you could be right about preclusion but wrong about use of the anti-suit injunction.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's true about -- that's true about preclusion, but -- and so that you might go into the West Virginia court and say this second plaintiff should be precluded, but as Justice Kagan pointed out, you're dealing with the anti-injunction statute that talks about judgment.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  One case, Mr. Phillips, is pending for 20 years, is that not so?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it seems to me -- and there were something like 70 orders from the district court, the single-judge district court in that case?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And no change, so how much longer do we have to wait, another 20 years?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there in fact less overcrowding because I thought what this case was all about was that the receiver has said, the special master has said, “we can't make any progress at all until there are fewer people; we have no place to put clinics.  The first step, not the last step, but given what we are dealing with here, the potential first step, is that we have fewer people so there is more room for these health facilities, more room for staff to operate.”   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But he can't provide construction when the State doesn't supply the money for it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then if there are -- if there are these great changes in circumstances so that now they -- medical care can be administered in something approaching a decent way, you could go back to the single-judge district court and say I'm moving under 60(b); circumstances have changed, it is no longer the case that it's impossible to render decent health care.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do we have information about that substantial reduction?  I mean, in this record, it just seems to be that it's -- no matter how many efforts have been made, the population goes up and now you say that the population has gone down; from what point in time and how much has it gone down?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I thought that officer himself said, “I can't do this without as a first step reducing the population.  Nothing else is going to work until we reduce the population to the point where there is room for clinics, room for medical personnel to operate.”  I mean, that was the view of the district judge, the special master in one case, the receiver in the other case, everybody, they all agreed reducing the population is not going to cure it, not going to make everything perfect, but without doing that as a first step, nothing -- there will be no cure.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I don't get the class thing, because what -- you can't have a remedy just limited to the class.  The class wants to have clinics.  They want to have personnel who function someplace outside of a broom closet.  So you can't deal with this problem by just dealing with the mentally ill and the people with medical problems.  You have to provide space for facilities.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought the -- the -- that brief was filed because the -- there were, in your presentations there were representations about the special master, and he filed that brief to say, “You must understand this in context, I was making a speech at the club,” but he wanted to put in context what you had used.  You had quoted his statements.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  One piece of it -- you said something about the 2.35 million, they didn't come up with the 8 million, but they did come up with the 2.35 billion and then I'm just looking at this brief for the receiver and there is a footnote, page 11, footnote 3, that says, “No, that money isn't there.  It is dependent upon several approvals that have not yet been secured and such approvals ultimately may not be forthcoming.”   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But not the 2.35?  I mean, I think you did say earlier that this was a done deal, 2.35 billion, but this is a note telling us it's not so.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And one project that the joint legislative budget committee said, no, we are not going to give you money for that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can you explain me something about that, it was confusing in the brief, Mr. Phillips?  I thought that the State had said, “We don't want the plaintiffs to tour these facilities any more.  We don't want to have discovery go beyond, what it was, some date in 2008.”  I thought that it was the State that was urging, “We don't need any more discovery, we don't want any more inspection tours.”  So how could -- how could the plaintiffs submit more than they did when the State said it's enough, 2008 should be the cutoff?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then don't you have the burden?  If you concede that you have been in constitutional violation, then it seems to me that you have the burden of showing that is no longer the case.  That's generally so in the --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, maybe we are talking about one of the cases, but the other one, and it's the newer one in 2000 -- instituted in 2001, but what about the one that started out in 1990?

Do you have any information about what effect that legislation was passed January?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So do we know at all what effect this has had?

Why isn't that, wouldn't it be foreseeable to a reasonable police officer similarly situated?

They don't just knock on every door, but they knock on the doors where they smell marijuana, and they do that just as a routine, in all the buildings where they suspect there may be drug -- drugs being stashed.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And may we just--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Farley, may we just go back over -- you're putting in the fleeing felon, but as far as I understand from this record, it was never shown that the dealer that the police were following was aware that he was following and that he was fleeing from them.  I mean, this is the -- it's not part of the question you presented, because we've granted only on the exigent circumstances, but I didn't think that there was -- the dealer wasn't called and he wasn't asked did you even know that the police were following you?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Question -- may I ask a question that goes back to what you said?  You have clarified very nicely that there has to be probable cause to think that there's something wrong going on in the -- the apartment; and you said that is, at that point when they -- the marijuana strong smell comes from the door, at that point police could go and get a warrant.  Then they don't have to, because then they knocked on the door.  We start out with a strong presumption that the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant, a strong preference for getting the warrant.  So why in this situation wouldn't the first response of the police be, instead of knocking -- because once they knock they alert the people in there -- let's get a warrant; we'll come back?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How is it -- you mention Johnson.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And I think the other side says it was the same thing except it was a hotel room instead of an apartment building.  The police smell, in that case it was -- what was it?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Didn't they smell marijuana or opium or something?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You left out one thing.  I thought they heard rustling noises before they attempted to get into the apartment -- into the hotel room.  There was something about noises.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And what was that here?  Because it is kind of vague.  They heard movement.  What kind -- what kind of movement?  It said nothing about a toilet flushing--   ",09-1272

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Frederick, I thought when this case went back to the -- to the district court the -- the agency's position was, this is a total surprise to us, 14,000 suits or whatever it is.  No, we never -- we never envisioned making the individual whatever you call them -- the 430 B--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --We never envisioned making them beneficiaries and -- and allowing them to sue.  That would be quite disruptive of our program.  That, I thought was the position the government took.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought it was because the States have been given a role in the statute itself, where the 340B entities have not.  I thought that was the -- the government's position, that the States have a role in the Medicaid program and that's an entirely different thing than this program, where these entities have no statutory role, says the drug manufacturers and then this -- HHS.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The result is the same, Mr. Frederick.  And that's the central point since last brief, and call it whatever you want, it's -- Congress has not provided for a private right of action to enforce the terms of the statute.  The contract embodies the terms of the statute.  So it would be passing strange if Congress, as we now read Congress, says we want private parties out of this, this is to be between the agency and the manufacturer to say.  The same exact result.  The same aim can be achieved through this third-party beneficiary route.  And I think that said, that is what stands out about this case.  So how do you respond to that?  What's the difference between suing because the statute has been violated and suing because the contract has been violated?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How does the -- does the Commission, unaided by AT&T, go through the papers and decide what would be embarrassing for an AT&T employee, as distinguished from the corporation?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the Privacy Act?  The Privacy Act undoubtedly concerns individuals, human individuals--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --not artificial beings.  But it uses the words ""individual privacy"".   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Your argument is based on a case that will come before us.

Those all fall under the APA definition of person.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can you give us an idea of -- the corporation has been shielded by Exemption 4 for its confidential, financial information, trade secrets; and its employees have been protected under Exemption 7.  What is it, what would be -- would fall within this privacy exception that would not be confidential business information or relate to employees of the corporation?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you were about to give a second example of where, even though it hasn't, ""personal privacy"" hasn't been used in the media.  But you said one example is the two officials who are saying unpleasant things about a regulator; and what was your other example?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is that a reason to change what was the understanding of Exemption 7?  One of the items that doesn't work in your favor was the attorney general's memorandum at the time of the '74 amendments.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Klineberg, you have read the brief of the Project on Government Oversight where they give dozens and dozens of examples to show that, overwhelmingly, ""personal"" is used to describe an individual, not an artificial being.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Phillips, when the contractors -- when they failed to deliver the first aircraft at the time specified by the contract, their reason was that its costs would far outrun the contract price, and so it sought to reformulate the contract.  At that time -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I think at that time the contractor said nothing at all about superior knowledge and the government's obligation to share information that it hadn't shared.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you would expect them to say, if that was the impediment to going forward on this contract, to at least mention it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can you explain -- you've referred to it several times now.  I thought that that was not a progress payment based on completed work.  The government says that that money was advanced; you had not complied with what was necessary to comply with to get that $1.35 million.  They distinguished the $1.35 million that you legitimately received as a progress payment, but this next they say you have not fulfilled what you needed to do to get that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you are here seeking to -- to emerge as a total winner, that is to get from this contract what you would have gotten if it had been successfully completed, including any profit?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I -- I -- I think it's questionable, Mr. Phillips, for this reason.  You say that it's an implied term of this contract that the government has a duty to share certain information, and you are seeking to enforce that implied term of the contract.  So it seems to me as to that alleged duty you are the moving party.  You're saying: Court, please enforce this implied term of the contract.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You mentioned the 1.3 -- that you get to keep the 1.35 million, but there was also another figure, 1.2 million that you would get on top of that.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In all of those cases there was a forum in the United States where someone injured in the United States could sue.  Your proposition is that a company can deliberately send its products, wants to explore the U.S. market.  But I take it that there is no place in the United States, because New Jersey is no different than California or any other place -- is it your position that there is no forum in which McIntyre can be sued, even though it set up this distribution arrangement for the very purpose of having its machines in as many locations in the United States as it could?  Is there a forum in the United States where it could be sued?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which one?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It could be reached in Ohio.  Now, does that make a whole lot of sense?  Is it any more convenient for McIntyre to come to Ohio than New Jersey?  It's a lot less convenient for Mr. Nicastro, who had his fingers removed by this machine.  But you are conceding that there is a forum where this British company can be sued on a tort that occurred in New Jersey.  Explain to me why, since there is a forum in the United States, the logical one isn't New Jersey rather than Ohio.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm asking you the question: Where can it be sued?  Well, something happened in New Jersey.  The machine, allegedly defective machine, caused a harm there.  What happened in Ohio?  What basis for specific jurisdiction is there in Ohio?  There was no tort in Ohio.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I don't understand.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What kind of common law indemnity are we dealing with here?  Where does Mr. Nicastro sue?  He hasn't got any assignment, any indemnity.  Mr. Nicastro is injured in the United States by a machine manufactured in England and he wants to sue, understandably, in the United States.  Why are we talking about assignments, indemnity?  That has nothing to do with Mr. Nicastro.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, I would just like to know first -- you said there is jurisdiction in Ohio and not in New Jersey.  In New Jersey, it's the place where the accident occurred, and in Ohio there's nothing but the relationship between the distributor -- there's a contract between the distributor and McIntyre.  So why does Ohio have jurisdiction over this New Jersey tort?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's a forum what?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the claim in suit.  That's very important.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I still don't follow how Mr. Nicastro gets involved with assignment, indemnity.  Mr. Nicastro has a claim against -- well, he sued them both, but the distributor is now bankrupt.  And he says, well, this is specific jurisdiction; specific jurisdiction, as International Shoe teaches, is where the claim arose.  International Shoe, it arose in the State of Washington because that's where the shoe -- the people who were promoting sale of International Shoe's -- International Shoe's shoes worked every day.  So it was a claim relating to a tax owed by International Shoe based on the events that occurred in California.  It was not all-purpose jurisdiction.  And your suggestion that Ohio somehow is a proper forum for Mr. Nicastro's tort claim, I really don't follow that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Asahi -- Asahi, Mr. Fergenson, was a litigation between a Japanese component part manufacturer and a Taiwanese finished product manufacturer.  What -- how in the world could you compare that case, which really has nothing at all to do with the United States?  It's -- it's a Japanese valve manufacturer sells the valve to a tire maker in Taiwan, and there should be -- that suit should go forward in the United States?  I can see it going forward in -- in Japan, but it has no connection with the United States.  And how can you possibly compare that with this case where somebody was injured by a machine that malfunctions, allegedly?  There was something very interesting you said in your brief.  And you said the U.K., which you -- you say -- now you added Ohio, but you said U.K. would be the place for Mr. Nicastro to go.  It provides a trusted legal system.  What would be your answer if the manufacturer, same arrangement with a distributor, sell anyplace in the United States you can, is from China?  Would you give the same answer?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You -- you made a point about the trusted legal system.  Well, let's say it was Russia, Mexico.  You make -- pick any one.

So why would Camreta be precluded?  Why would he face punitive damages as you're suggesting?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, why isn't the answer, then, that that's the right case to take up?  Because in this case, we have a plaintiff who is not going to be confronted with this situation again and who has put herself out of the running for damages because she didn't -- she didn't challenge the qualified immunity ruling.  So she has no stake in any monetary relief from this claim.  She has no continuing -- the -- what has happened to her, happened to her at age 9, will never happen again now that she's past 18.

Because I was under the impression that they did say there's only three ways: One is you get a warrant; another is you get parental consent; and a third is exigent circumstances.  I thought that was the -- the ruling of law by the Ninth Circuit.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, let's see where they -- I thought that, yes, the case is about a single plaintiff; it's not a class action.  But they're making a rule of law.  What does the Fourth Amendment require?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You got a stipulation that there was a seizure, so--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --There was never any argument that was not at issue in this case.  Given that there was seizure--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --the question is: Is it reasonable?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Have you, in the -- many of the questions have gone to leads, but this is initially a social worker's investigation.

So the -- the distinction between Connick, who was taking a poll -- why wasn't that a petition?  Maybe -- did she just put the wrong label on it?  If she called her case a petition case, it would have been all right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Schnapper, let's come to the century in which we are now living.  We have Title VII.  Title VII has this provision, an explicit provision against retaliation.  But suppose it didn't.  Suppose it just prohibited discrimination and it didn't have a retaliation clause.  It's the thrust of your arguments that the government employee would have a claim for retaliation, although someone in the private sector would not?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is it because, Mr. Roberts, as you pointed out, it's not a continuing problem since the amendment to Rule 45, it's calendar days, and so there's no problem, and so what you're suggesting is we would not have granted cert on that question?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I think you don't.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Let's go back to -- I don't think you should have been so happy with the way the argument was going--  [Laughter]  --because -- because your view is, Rule 40 -- if it's always assumed that there be conformity between Rule 45 -- Rule 45, it was business days, and then rule 45 changed not only to say calendar days, but included statutes for the first time.  So I think what you're saying is that the interpretation of the statute tracks with Rule 45, Rule 45 formerly was calendar -- was business days, it is now calendar days, there is conformity.  And plus, 45, and that was at least laid on the table of Congress, so they know that it was there.   INTERRUPTING ",09-1498

What was the past -- what were the past events?  I mean, I'm trying to understand how you take these questions and say we can put a label on them here that says, well, this is to control an emergency situation, versus we want to know what happened historically.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose he had survived.  Suppose Covington had survived instead of died.  And then the prosecutor says, I want to introduce this evidence against Bryant.  Would you say that, yes, it's nontestimonial, so it comes in?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But why, if it's nontestimonial?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If you said -- you said it's -- you are typing it nontestimonial.  It goes to emergency situations.  So I'm saying: Would that carry over to the man survived and the prosecutor says, I don't need to put him on the stand so he can be cross-examined; I have got nontestimonial evidence that I can put in?  Would it become testimonial, then, if he survived?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then -- then your answer is that if we typed it as nontestimonial in my trial scenario, it would be nontestimonial, it comes in.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So are you saying that the rule would be that whenever the perpetrator may be in the vicinity, then the police are pursuing an urgent emergency situation rather than trying to find out what had -- the nature of the crime?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In the -- if you had the benefit of hindsight and this trial occurred before Davis, and so the prosecutor went on excited utterance, would you have instead tried to make a case that this was a dying declaration?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, how do you know that?  Because they would ask the same very questions if what they wanted was testimonial evidence.  So you can -- you can characterize that set of questions either way.  What would lead us to pick one rather than the other?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  One of the officers zeroed in on the victim.  No one was looking around to see if anybody was lurking in the bushes.  Then as far as protecting the public, do we take into account that this was between 3:30 and 4:00 in the morning when they are not likely to be many members of the public around, or do we just say, you find someone, looks like he has been the victim of a violent crime, doesn't matter whether the public is around or not, we -- the victim of a violent crime can be asked these questions.

I asked Ms. Palmer, suppose we were back there at the trial and the prosecutor knew that excited utterance wouldn't work, could he have raised dying declaration?  She said absolutely yes.  So my question to you is, just assume that we should hold the confrontation clause that is applicable.  Shouldn't the prosecutor then have a chance to say, well, if I realized that, I could have made a dying declaration plea here, so it would only be fair to allow the prosecutor to try to establish that this testimony was a dying declaration?

I mean, if you wanted to make it clear that there is no design defect liability, then say that: No civil liability unless inadequately -- improperly prepared, improper directions, or warnings.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but what he's bringing up now was a conceivable claim that he could have brought up then.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the issue is the same.  The issue is that he didn't qualify for the death penalty because at the time he committed this offense, there had to be, in addition to the eligible offense, at least one aggravator.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there no -- is there no possibility that a judge could say: I want to make this analogous to 54(b) under the civil rules; that is, I don't want to delay the time that the defendant can appeal from the -- from the -- from the sentence.

Well, in effect, you're saying the sentence isn't final, so she could change it any time within the 90 days?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that's rather theoretical because if that -- I mean, the -- the judge surely would have acted before he could process an appeal.   INTERRUPTING ",09-367X

And we're leaving this in a nebulous state if the judge says, within -- this is -- this is a judgment of conviction and sentence, but I'm still thinking about the restitution.  The defendant has to know at that point, must I appeal that first judgment?  Because if I don't, I'll never be able to appeal it.  But on your reading, the defendant can't wait.  When the judge imposes a sentence, the defendant must meet the time clock for notice of appeal from the sentence.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that -- that would mean even if the judge says, I'm going to impose the restitution order 10 days from now, defendant's time clock for notice of appeal would begin at -- at the time the sentence is imposed, not 10 days later when restitution is--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --So this then becomes a goal, not a time line -- a deadline?

""  --illegal conduct was found here --  ""although without a formal court order? ""   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This is not merely a catalyst.  In Buckhannon, the catalyst theory was rejected.  Here the court said: If I were to decide right now -- the district court said: I am inclined to rule for Hardt, but I'm going to give Reliance an opportunity to respond.  So the court had evaluated the evidence at that point as favoring Hardt.  To that extent, it wasn't a purely procedural ruling.  It says: As things stand now, Hardt should get fees; but I'm leaving the door open.  So it wasn't just a procedural decision.  It was an evaluation of the evidence up to that point, wasn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Rosenkranz, suppose the complaint was: I asked for a turnover of certain documents; they refused without reason.  And the court says: You're right; you're entitled to those documents.  It's interlocutory; there is no decision; but the only thing that the plaintiff asked for the plaintiff got, that is entitlement to the documents.  The court said: You are entitled to the documents.  And then it goes back, and the documents are turned over because the court has ordered that.  Under your theory, because there was no determination of benefits, even that ruling which was a total victory for the plaintiff doesn't open the door to fees.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So that would fall -- even if in the end of the -- at the end of the day no -- no award is made?  No benefits are awarded?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you -- but you say -- you called it purely procedural and you said yes, but that's the only thing that she asked for.  So she got it.

Even though you just characterized it as purely procedural, it's a purely procedural ruling, but it's all she asked for--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --so she gets benefits.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, I'm not dealing with something obscure.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But Winter didn't involve something -- as I understand, the -- the decision vacated the deregulation order.  You are not challenging that.  Well, it seems to me if there's no deregulation decision in place, then we're back to the Plant Protection Act, and there's no authorization for the planting of these crops.  So as long as you haven't challenged the vacation of the deregulation decision, I don't see how there's anything for us to deal with.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm looking at--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I'm looking at page 58a.  Maybe that -- you referred to what as the district court's--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Because I thought that the only purpose of this injunctive provision was to spare the people who had already purchased seeds, allowing those to be planted until March 30, 2007.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, then--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Garre, I'm looking at the injunction, and it says that the deregulation decision is vacated and Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again a regulated article.  We could simply say as far as it goes, that's all right; anything else is surplusage.  We take it to be the judgment that Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again a regulated article, period.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, but I thought--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I thought that was just a dispensation to people who had already bought the seeds.  That was recognizing that they had incurred an expense, that they were all ready to plant.  That -- that was the only exception.  It goes back to the status of a regulated article with this one exception.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would you explain, Mr. Garre, why that's so, because I thought that the Federal law is before the agency engages in an action that requires an EIS, it has to do the EIS?  So this unit of the Department of Agriculture violated Federal law by deregulating prior to the completion of an EIS.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can -- when you -- can you stop right there, because I thought the law was, government agency, before you engage on a major activity, EIS first, and then you can have a deregulation order?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, that's what I thought.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But as far as the court is concerned, it's conceded that NEPA was violated, an EIS was required.  And then the district court vacates the deregulation decision.  I thought that, under the APA, at that point, the court is obliged to say, well, the agency engaged in conduct that was not in accord with law, and so we send it back.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you agree -- would you agree that if the district court had just said the deregulating decision is vacated and Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again a regulated article, period, that would be okay?  And you would have no basis to prevent this from going straight back to the agency?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And all, it seems to me, that the district court did do in addition to that is to say that alfalfa seeds may be planted -- alfalfa seeds that are -- that have already been purchased may be planted prior to March 30, 2007.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I mean, in response to Justice Scalia's point of how many now, how many at this moment?  But you projected that there would be an enormous increase, and that was not just pulled out of thin air.  I assume it had something to do with what happened to other crops.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Robbins, but if, as is likely -- I think the government told us that the EIS is about a year away, but that the EIS is going to say deregulate--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --is going to recommend a deregulation decision.  So we're talking about the -- whatever the farmers of organic or conventional -- they're only a year away from, so they will have to accept that there are other planters who want to do the genetically engineered crop.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the specific examples he gave, that the -- just take that the -- that the employee must bear all the costs of the arbitration, win or lose, that's the provision.  Would that provision be enough to make the issue one for the court rather than the arbitrator?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But is it?  We don't need the ""if"".  Tell me whether you think a provision saying the employee under any and all circumstances pays all costs -- would that provision make this question of unconscionability one for the court rather than the arbitrator?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But all of the arbitration agreement, not the employment contract as a whole.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Friedman, this contract is -- is unusual in that, as Judge Hall said, it was more employee-friendly than most.  It had a clause -- it had a provision for back-end review with the court.  The review -- at the end of the line, there was to be court review, and as the parties said, it should be just like review of a district court decision, a much -- much more focused review than would be in the case of an arbitration agreement.  Now, that clause comes out because of our decision in Hall.  That leaves the -- the arbitration agreement in -- in an imbalance.  There was court review assured at the back end.  So why isn't it reasonable to say the parties contemplated vigorous court review; if it can't be had at the back end, it should be had at the front end?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it was very limited review.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Silverberg, the section 2 on which you place much emphasis just says that agreements are enforceable save on such grounds as exist in law or equity for revocation of a contract.  But the section 2 doesn't say any -- anything about who decides that question.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Silverberg--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --on that, underlying your whole case I think is the notion that this is an adhesion contract; it's a take-it-or-leave-it contract, very common in consumer, credit card agreements, in employment contracts, that one party has no say except to sign or not to sign.

The motor carriers have to pay motor fuel tax.  So are you saying to the State about that, you have to have the same sales tax, use tax, for everyone; you can't have a motor fuel tax for one and sales tax for the other?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, why does the course for the court -- taking account of what you said, that the provision about other taxes came out very late in the day -- they had spent a lot of time talking about the property tax.  And the property tax, we know, they wanted to preserve the exemptions.  So why not take this latecomer of thought or discussion and say: Well, we'll assume that they want to treat that with regard to exemptions the same way that they treated property tax, which was the big-ticket item.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the law firm that -- the lawyers who drafted the prospectus were in-house counsel for JCM on JCM's payroll?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But they weren't the independent outside lawyers who were representing the board or the Fund; they were the in-house counsel?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, this case -- this case went off on -- in the district court, it was -- was it 12b-6?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Okay.

The Federal legislation gives the States a choice to do it either in the State agency or a private entity.  The specification that the State agency has to be independent is in the Federal statute, isn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's not -- it's not up to the State to want to put it into an independent regulatory agency.  And is this VOPA, is that an entity that was created just to carry out this Federal program or was it a preexisting agency?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Does it ever do anything else other than administer the Federal program?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Anders, I understand that most States that are taking advantage of this program do it through a private agency, not a State; is that -- is that right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Doesn't the Federal statute say: Virginia, if you want to do this through a State agency, that State agency has to be an independent agency and has the authority to sue.   ",09-529X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's not a waiver, it's the Federal statute is clear.  It says State, you can do this in one of two ways.  If you go with the Government agency, then that agency has to have independence and it has to be able to sue.  So if the State is given a choice, it has -- it can do it through private entity, it can do it through, as in this case, an agency that was set up for this very purpose and no other, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So the point is, if it's not in -- you certainly agree that this State agency has taken on the obligations of the Federal program, and if it doesn't turn over records as the Federal statute requires it to do, it has to be amenable to suit somewhere.  We know if it were a private entity administering this program it would be suable in -- in Federal court.  So this State agency is doing the exact same thing, because Virginia chose it to do it that way.  Where -- where -- a very simple thing, the Federal statute says turn over records to the agency, and the State hospital says no, we are not going to turn over the records.  Where does the agency, whether private or public, that is administering the Federal program go to enforce the Federal right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If you -- is that -- I want to make sure I understood what your position is on that.  It's not that you go into the court that you ordinarily go to when you want to get documents in discovery, you go to the State's supreme court and you -- you apply for the extraordinary writ of mandamus, that's it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm asking you what is the forum?  We have a simple problem.  An agency, whether private or public, wants records.  Federal statute says you are entitled to the records.  And I would like to know now, Virginia having chosen to give this newly created independent State agency the authority rather than picking a 501(c)(3) organization to do it -- simple, we want records of these three people, the hospital has them, the hospital doesn't give them to us.  The only way under Virginia law is to petition the highest court of the State for a writ of mandamus?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But which office has said it has to go to -- to the State supreme court on mandamus?  You said that the office has taken that position previously?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you know -- do you know of any other statute in which there is an independent State agency that exists for the sole purpose of administering a Federal program?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Bottom line, then, is that -- to restrict Congress's choice.  Congress wants to have an entity to attend this program for disabled people.  So the instruction we would like to give Congress is: Congress, if you want Federal courts to be able to enforce the Federal right, then you have to set it up as an agency, as a private agency.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  General Katyal, why are we getting into this?  Because this case, it seems to me, is a challenge -- a challenge to a preliminary injunction which was quite narrow.

The only thing that's in contention there is the question about treatment or counsel.  Nothing else.  So why are we talking about the universe of what questions might be asked?  And on the other form, I take it, it's just the so-called open-ended questions, not everything on the form.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What do you think has been -- there hasn't been a formal injunction entered, a preliminary -- a preliminary junction, has there?

Form 85, we know we excise ""counseling or treatment"".  What in the Form 85 did the Ninth Circuit say?  It said ""open-ended questions"", but I looked at the form and it is not clear to me which ones they considered open-ended.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I still don't see why that -- why this is before us, because the Ninth Circuit said some of this form is okay, most of Form 85 is okay, and some of Form 42 is okay.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You are -- you are attacking these forms for all Government employment, not just the contractors?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm -- I'm very surprised to hear that.  I thought that -- that if there were in -- in the private sector similar questions?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where does it say you have to turn over your medical records?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can I ask you to clarify your understanding of what has been enjoined?  We know Form 85, but Form 42, you mentioned the releases.  I thought that the Ninth Circuit's order covers lots of question 7 and perhaps question 8, I didn't see, is there something, maybe I missed it, that says they can ask for release of the records?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They didn't say, Government, you can't ask for the release?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They say you can't ask open-ended questions?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If somebody is going to be enjoined, I mean, it can't be implicit in the ruling if you were enjoined.  Because it has been stayed you don't have a formal order, but you can't say, well, it is implicit in the how many page opinion.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  As I understand this process, this is not an oral interview.  You fill out a form, you meet somebody and they ask follow-up questions.  This is -- this handles on the papers, right?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  But is there an oral interview in this process?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So then they wouldn't say -- it says here, so I'm going to ask this, that and the other thing.  It's a written--   ",09-530X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't there something in between?  Because in Canton, the hypothetical was one rookie police officer.  Here, it wasn't one rogue prosecutor.  There were four prosecutors who knew of this blood evidence and there were multiple opportunities for them to disclose it, but four of them apparently thought it was okay under Brady to keep this quiet.  Now, if we were just talking about -- what was his name, Deegan?  it would be a different case.  But we have the three other prosecutors.  So I think it's questionable to characterize this as a single incident.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But life doesn't always come in just two categories, and my suggestion to you is this doesn't fit into this single rookie.  You have -- if you have four prosecutors who are not turning over this evidence, then it seems like to me it's kind of a culture in the office that we don't turn over -- either we don't understand Brady, because one suggestion was -- well, having the blood sample will show you -- you would have to have the blood sample from Thompson to have it mean anything.  So there was misunderstanding about that.  But what struck me was that to shoehorn this into a single incident, it doesn't fit.  So we have a situation maybe that hasn't -- that we haven't directly confronted before.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can you tell me -- I think I have a copy.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is that so?  I mean, you are assume that everyone who goes to law school takes a course in criminal procedure, and I think there are many law schools where they don't even have such a course and others where most -- I don't know anywhere it's compulsory to take a course in criminal procedure.  So you're assuming that.  And of course, the time is running.  There is something I wanted to ask you about Brady which seems to me unlike others and why you would want special vigilance.  And that is, Miranda warnings, you know what was said; search and seizure you know what the police did.  But the problem with Brady -- and this case illustrates it so well -- is you don't know.  If the prosecutors don't do what they're supposed to do, there is a very high risk, as there was in this case, that it will never come to light.  So, recognizing the legal obligation of the prosecutor and the temptation not to come out with Brady evidence because it doesn't help the State's case, shouldn't there be extra vigilance when we are talking about a Brady claim?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did you object to it?  To the charge?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  With the ""or"", difficult choice, ""or"" one that prosecutors had a history of mishandling?   INTERRUPTING ",09-571X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And it's something like I was trying to get at before when I said Miranda was out there, you know what was said, you know what was seized.  Talking about -- but Brady, if the prosecutor doesn't come out with it, high risk that it will never come out.  So we have use of force, plus that -- which could kill people if you were not properly trained.  Brady, because if they don't come up with the information, it could have what almost happened in this case.  Anything else on this special list?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The concern was that you don't want to have to give the prosecutors a clinical law school course before you let them do their job.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But what do you do with the Dubelier testimony?  Didn't he testify that it was standard operating procedure to turn over all lab reports?   ",09-571X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How do -- how do we know that the -- the California Court even reached that question?  Because there was -- wasn't there a motion to deny review as -- as -- wasn't there a time law question raised?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But did--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, what would the California Supreme Court do if they all agreed that this application should be denied, but two of them think it's for a procedural bar -- timeliness -- and then others think it has no merit, and they say just ""denied"", but there is no majority for either one?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Even though, in fact, it wasn't?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So there is that possibility -- even though there is that possibility, we should assume it was on the merits.  What about -- I mean, you said this was 3 decades, but we are told that the California Supreme Court has this pattern of saying merits when it's on the merits, giving a citation, if it's a procedural bar to the -- a procedural fault, and when it says simply ""denied"", that's most likely that they couldn't all agree on the reason.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's what they would say if, in fact, they were divided, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If, in fact, the court was divided.  All agree that the petition should be denied, but there is no majority for any particular reason, merits or procedure.  They -- they would say ""petition denied"", right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Colombo, you -- you say in any event, leaving aside the question of whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel, even assuming there was, there was -- there would be no prejudice in this case?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And could you just summarize why you say there would be no prejudice?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the -- the pool of blood?  There was one expert affidavit that said something about that Johnson, standing up, could not have produced that amount of blood.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  On the -- on the no prejudice issue, are you relying just on what happened -- what was found at the scene of the crime?  I mean, you said it's implausible that Klein would have been moved with no trail of blood at all, so you say, therefore, no prejudice.  Any -- anything else that goes into your no prejudice argument?   ",09-587X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that the point was that there was no trail from the bed.  I mean, the theory was that Klein was removed from the bed to the couch.  And I thought that the point that the -- that counsel for the State emphasized was, does the -- if someone were moved from the bed, taken to the living room couch, you would have expected to see a trail of blood from the bed.  And there wasn't that.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Gardner, what about the argument that all this is beside the point because the argument for prejudice is so weak, given all the other evidence that Mr. Colombo referred to?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What do you do with the ammunition back at Richter's home, that the -- the gun safe is found there and the unlikely story about them going -- having the zeal to clean up their workplace and then coming back.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What is your answer to the -- to -- to the representation that In re Robbins settled that when the California Supreme Court says just denied, it's on the merits?   INTERRUPTING ",09-587X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Srinivasan, as a threshold question, is there a mootness problem here, because, as I understand it, the Petitioner came back to the country illegally and committed another minor crime?  But his coming back illegally and being turned away again, as I understand the law, means that he cannot get any dispensation as a result of the illegal entry.  So even if we were to hold in your favor now, I take it that he could not -- he would not have any hope of getting any cancellation of removal or any other dispensation.  Is that so?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I -- I -- I think also in the picture is that he never contested removability.  The only thing was the grace: Would -- would he qualify for discretionary relief by the Attorney General?  So the -- the removal order itself, I take it, would stand.   ",09-60XX
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Saharsky, do we take into account at all -- I mean, in Lopez as I understand it, the petitioner prevailed because it would not have been a felony under the Federal law.  Is that right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Here we're talking about two crimes.  One is a small amount of marijuana.  He gets 20 days in jail.  The other is a pill that I never heard of, a Xan-something, and then he gets, what, 10 days in jail for that.  If you could just present this scenario to an intelligent person who didn't go to law school, as you're going to not only remove him from this country, but say never, ever darken our doors again because of one marijuana cigarette and one Xan-something pill -- it -- it just seems to me that if there's a way of reading the statute that would not lead to that absurd result, you would want to read the statute.  If you are forced to read it because there's no other way -- but maybe there is another way.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought if it's in the Federal court, and the -- they are going to use it as a recidivist offense, (a) the defendant is notified of that, and (b) is given an opportunity to say there's something infirm about that first conviction.  That's totally absent from this picture.  You say, oh, well, that's just a matter of procedure, so he doesn't have to get that anyplace.  I think that Congress is requiring that.  It's certainly an element of fundamental due process fairness, notice and opportunity to say, no, the first conviction shouldn't count.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But my point is that if it all happened in the Federal court, if these two possession offenses all happened in the Federal court, at the time of the second one the -- the defendant would have gotten the notice and the opportunity to knock it out.  I'm not talking about immigration, but just -- and he doesn't have that opportunity the way you treat it.  He doesn't -- didn't get that in the State court because nobody thought that this was a recidivist offense in the State court.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do we know practically, both on the State side and on the Federal side, do prosecutors presented with a simple possession case, do they -- do we ever see in real life this combination that somebody's going to be convicted as a recidivist when it's one marijuana cigarette on one time and one pill on another?  Do prosecutors, Federal or State, do that?   INTERRUPTING ",09-60XX
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So Mr. Mills, what then is the difference?  You point out, quite rightly, summary judgment looks to what evidence there was and the question for the Court is: What could the plaintiff prove?  When we get past trial, the issue becomes: What has the plaintiff proved?  So what was brought out at trial?  What was the record at trial that was larger than the record at summary judgment?  Because if there was no -- no new fact presentation, no more ample fact presentation, then it wouldn't matter.  It would be the same body of evidence, right?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why is it -- power -- jurisdiction is power, power to proceed in a case.  But we are in an area where there are many, many cases of this Court that distinguish the Rule 50(a), 50(b) from the run-of-the-mine claim processing rule because in the background is the Seventh Amendment re-examination clause.  That's the whole reason why there is this 50(a)-50(b) litany, why the verdict loser must repeat the 50(a) motion, after the verdict.  So I'm surprised that you're using the word ""power"" and you're not referring to any of that history which stems from a constitutional provision, the Seventh Amendment.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are you saying then that if we explain to the Fifth Circuit -- to the Sixth Circuit, that the record they must look at is the trial record, so it's different from the summary judgment stage, if we told them that then maybe they would look at the evidence differently, even though they purported to look at the trial evidence?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So if you're right, then there has to be a remand to the Sixth Circuit with instructions to send the case back to the district court to ask the district court whether it thought the evidence was sufficient?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you -- you prevailed on the summary judgment motion.  There was a summary judgment motion, right?  And it was denied.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So the -- we know that the district judge thought that at that point there was a case to be presented for trial based on the plaintiff's allegations.   INTERRUPTING ",09-737X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But, Mr. Mizer, then you must concede that this opening sentence that Justice Kennedy just quoted is wrong.  Courts normally don't review the denial of summary judgment motion after trial on the merits, but when the summary judgment denial is based on qualified immunity, there's an exception.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And in fact, you did.  You did move under 50(a).  This whole case is here because apparently -- well, what reason was it that you didn't make the 50(b) motion?  You told the court under 50(a), after all the evidence was in but before the case went to the jury, that the jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for Ms. Ortiz.  That was -- that was your motion.  You were saying: Court, there was no legally sufficient evidentiary basis.  Evidentiary basis.  That was the motion that you made, recognizing that the judgment, the question is whether there is a sufficient evidentiary basis.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then what you are saying is you didn't even need to make the 50(a) motion, that that was just an unnecessary touching base with Rule 50(a)?  Is that what you are saying?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Could you explain to me what -- you made a 50(a) motion.  Why did you -- was there a reason for making the 50(a) motion and not following it up with a 50(b) motion?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's very clear from Rule 50 that 50(a) and 50(b) go together, and the explanation, as I indicated when Petitioner's counsel was speaking, is the re-examination clause of the Seventh Amendment.  So I think every first year Procedure student learns 50(a), 50(b) go together, and there is an historic reason why you must back up a 50(a) motion with a 50(b) motion.  They're not -- they all -- they all ask the same question.  The Rule 56, the Rule 50, 50(b), they all ask: Is there sufficient evidence to warrant a jury finding, whatever.  They all ask that, but they ask -- ask it on the basis of a different record: the summary judgment record, the trial record, and the jury verdict.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you know of any case holding that you don't have to couple a 50(a) motion with a 50(b) motion depending upon what's in your 50(a) motion?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You -- you refer to Sandin.  There are some extra things about the confinement here.  She was shackled, she was ill, and nobody attended to her.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, is -- on the question of whether this treatment was punitive rather than just protective custody.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, wouldn't it be this, the segregated confinement in this case, not at large?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, then you are saying, the category -- the mixed claims -- as Justice Breyer proposed, if it's a purely legal claim, then you're right.  If it's a mixed claim, then you're wrong.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The purpose of -- of 50(b) -- Justice Alito brought out that it's not simply the historical background of the Seventh Amendment, but in that same line of cases, the court gave a practical reason.  And the practical reason related to the district court, that if the motion is made after the jury comes in, the district judge would have the opportunity to exercise her discretion to grant a new trial.  Let's take -- is it Ms. Bright where the Sixth Circuit said that, well, maybe there could have been a retaliation claim, but the Plaintiff didn't make it?  The district judge, given the chance, might have said: I would exercise my discretion to allow the Plaintiff to have a new trial on this retaliation claim.  I thought it was before the Court and it was a good claim.  The Sixth Circuit thought it wasn't.  I mean, the purpose is to get the district judge into the picture to exercise the district judge's discretion on the very question.   INTERRUPTING ",09-737X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, why does he have a claim?  As I understand it, after this case arose Maryland passed a statute putting time, place, and manner restrictions.  I read that statute and it seems to me that there was nothing unlawful, nothing out of compliance with that statute, that was done here.  It was at considerable distance.  There was no importuning anyone going to the funeral.  It stopped before the funeral, the service, began.  Am I right that under the current statute this conduct was not unlawful?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Didn't they stand where the police told them to?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And it was there with the knowledge of the police and with the permission of the police.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But they didn't prohibit it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, is this the case which the facts here meet.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If you knew just what was going on, do you suppose -- because this had been done before.  In fact, wasn't this the very same day they picketed at Annapolis and at the State Capitol.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So they knew what the signs were going to be.  Could they have gotten an injunction, do you suppose, against this protest?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you could go into court and say that the signs were this, that or the other things at the State Capitol, the same signs at Annapolis; they're going to use the same signs at this protest.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did they have the ""going to hell"" sign at the State Capitol and Annapolis?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Those particular ones that you mention, did they have those at the other two?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it sounds like to you it's the whole society, the whole rotten society in their view.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where did -- you said the Fourth Circuit found that those signs targeted the family rather than the whole U.S. society?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Your claim is that Hustler was a -- Falwell was a public figure and the Snyder family is not.  So I think what I got from your brief is you don't fall under that case because you are not dealing with a public figure.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It was or it wasn't.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that when the service itself began the protesters stopped.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That was defamation, wasn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --We have other instances where conduct is lawful, meets all the terms of the statute that's meant to govern protests at funerals, and yet there is an award of damages permitted.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that was a -- I'm not asking you for an example where -- a Federal case where the conduct was permitted by the statute, by the policemen there, and yet there was -- was a damage award.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm talking about this intentional infliction of emotional distress claim that you're bringing.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, it certainly wouldn't be because of the distance.  I mean, you would have to be a lot closer than the Maryland statute allows to spit in someone's face.   ",09-751X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Phelps, there is no question that these signs and the signs like that we saw during the Vietnam War.  But you had the demonstration at the capitol, and you had the demonstration at Annapolis.  This is a case about exploiting a private family's grief and the question is: Why should the First Amendment tolerate exploiting this Marine's family when you have so many other forums for getting -- getting across your message, the very same day you did?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you gave the answer before about -- you said stalking.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't this comparable to stalking?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The Court has made that a very narrow category, hasn't it?  I mean, we have not allowed the fighting words -- you say that to me and I'm immediately going to punch you in the nose, because it is an instinctive reaction.  I think the Court has rejected spreading fighting words beyond that.   ",09-751X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Olson, when you say the employees had no choice, but the district court found, didn't it, that the reason for this plan summary being misleading was that the employer, Cigna, feared that there might be a backlash on the part of the employees if they found out, if they were told the truth about this plan; that is, that it was less favorable, that they would not have the same benefits that they had under the prior plan?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that what the district court said was that they would treat the plan as containing what the summary said, not that -- that it was part of the plan itself, not an amendment, amendment.  I thought that was what the district court said.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But they can't do that because the statute requires a summary to be understandable and not prolix.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But wasn't the -- wasn't the meaning of ""likely harm"" simply that they were promised one thing in the plan documents, and so what likely harm is, is we have to do away with what they call, what is it, the wear-away effect?  So that's the harm, the wear-away effect, and we have to remedy that.  And the way to remedy it is to treat this as, what is it, instead of (a) or (b), (a) plus (b).   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it couldn't--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But it couldn't be brought as a class action, and isn't that a large piece of this picture, that proceeding as they did they can proceed as a class?  Proceeding under detrimental reliance, it would be hard to get a class because it would be an individual case of detrimental reliance.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, the question is, under the -- under the section that the district court proceeded under, not the one that you say is proper, a class action would be appropriate.   INTERRUPTING ",09-804X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But is it -- I think the brief -- the Petitioner's brief pointed out, it governs the plan only when it's more favorable to the participants, because you wouldn't say, if the plan were more favorable and the summary would show fewer benefits, that the summary would then govern.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where does the rule come from, then?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Kneedler--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Do you put -- do you put any weight on Congress insisting that the summary that each -- each participant get a copy of that summary, but there is no such requirement with respect to the plan?

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And there wasn't -- he didn't invoke the grievance procedure.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In this case, he didn't invoke the grievance procedure.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So that would keep you out, if that were the test, that you have to formally invoke the grievance procedure.  But we are told that every other time the word ""file"" is used in this Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, it refers to a writing.  And so you are urging a meaning that deviates from the standard meaning of the term in the very Act at issue.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there another provision where the word file is used to mean something other than a writing.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are you -- you -- are you urging that if you just tell a coworker, that that's enough?  I thought the whole idea is to give the employer notice that something is amiss.  So, how would telling a coworker serve that purpose?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What did he do?  What did he do specifically?  I mean, you are saying that -- that the employer has to know that he is making a complaint under the Act.  So what -- and you said here are the facts that was clear that he did.   ",09-834X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there is a protection built in, Mr. Phillips, it says it's criminal liability only if it's willful.  And on the civil side, the civil liability under the Fair Labor Standards Act, you certainly don't have to prove willful, you just prove a violation.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The question is whether the violation is willful.  The willful qualification in the criminal context is are you willfully denying your workers the wages and hours the statute requires?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Nothing to do with retaliation.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you know, how common is it to have criminal prosecutions under this section of the Fair Labor Standards Act?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that the whole idea of this statute is to protect the workers, and I would like you to address particularly the amici's point, that this statute in 1938 affected people -- many were illiterate, they couldn't write a complaint, many were immigrants who weren't familiar with the language, for that universe of people, wouldn't Congress have meant that all complaints are okay?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How does it work with respect to the more recent statutes?  Title VII, The Age Discrimination Act, Disabilities Act?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  If you have not filed anything with the Government, but you have to your supervisor opposed a practice.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But is it -- so in those cases I think you are quite right, intracorporate complaints count as opposing any practice.  Has there been any huge problems about people saying, oh, I made an oral complaint to my supervisor, and supervisor said I never heard of it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That isn't even brought up in the brief in opposition, right?  It -- it's in your brief on the merits.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How would it -- how would it relate to, say, an equal pay complaint?  Because equal pay is formally part of the Fair--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Labor Standards Act.  But an equal pay complaint could also be brought as a Title VII suit.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So a -- a worker just complains about the denial of equal pay to the supervisor.  Does that -- is that--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --And there's been -- you said there was no evidence of the government for 60 years -- but there has been some 30 years or more experience under Title VII of the statutes, with oral complaints to the employer as being sufficient to ground a retaliation claim.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it really -- it starts in 1970.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It starts in the 1970s.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Just one more question.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It seems to me you are saying the only complaint that counts is the one to the Government.  Isn't -- in the work setting that's being regulated, wouldn't there be every reason to want the employee to complain first to the employer rather than making a Federal case out of it by complaining to a Government agency?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Olson, are all institutions that employ residents schools?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it might be relevant, because it would be unseemly, perhaps, to have residents who are not working at, quote, FICA tax, and other residents whose training is approximately the same escape the tax.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you can't give me the reality there.  Are all resident programs conducted in schools or are there resident programs that would not qualify because they take place in institutions that are not schools?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Olson, why not read that provision -- now we are going to the statute -- if such service is performed by a student, et cetera, as saying: Well, this student status and the service is distinct from the student status?  Take the typical work/study program in a college.  That would seem to fit this language to a tee.  There is a student and the student is working part time, but you are -- there -- there is no independent significance to this term ""student"" as you read the text; that is, the student and the services are all together.  It's not,  ""I am a student here and I perform services there. ""  It's -- the student is -- the education is the service.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But wouldn't -- wouldn't this fit the work/study student who is studying philosophy and then he's working in the, say, speech department?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The -- it seems to me that what came into my mind when I read these words was a work/study program, where the student is studying and that -- the status is student.  The work is separate from that.  It's not necessarily to advance the person's education.  It's to give the student some money.  So that's what I thought -- I thought that this was -- this was describing student status, okay?  And the student is also working for some money.  But you seem to say that the service -- that -- that it -- the student status is not independent from the service.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, I have in mind the typical work/study program.  The -- the student signs up for work/study and may be assigned to work in the administration, helping out with clerical things there, but the student status is one thing, services are another.  Now, that, I assume, would be covered, that the earnings of the student in the work/study program would not be subject to FICA?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Olson, there has been a concern expressed that if we accept your position that residents are students, it will have ramifications for other areas of the law, notably, the National Labor Relations Act.  Suppose the residents wanted to organize and collectively bargain.  If they are students, they can't do that.  And let's take the Title VII and the other antidiscrimination in employment statutes.  If they are not employed, if they are students rather than employees, then they wouldn't be covered by that legislation.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Olson, you are not taking issue with what Mr. Roberts has said?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you recognize that sequential suits could be brought.  So that if the case in the district court went to final judgment, then it would be okay to go to the Court Of Federal Claims.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you don't have control over how long the district court case is going to take, and there is no mechanism to stop the running of the statute of limitations.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you couldn't get both.  I mean, that's I think Justice Sotomayor's point, about duplication.  It's not -- even if you can say, yes, it's a different mode of relief, but you could -- couldn't get -- I mean, suppose we didn't have 1500 and you prevailed in your suit on the APCA or whatever you call the statute.  You could not then turn around and sue the government official, because you have the -- the single claim, you've been compensated.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's not here -- it's quite different.  I mean, one suit is not precluded by the other.  You -- you recognize that by saying you could bring the Claims Court suit after the district court suit.  That's not so in -- in the cotton cases.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I -- I'm not sure I understand your answer to my question.  Assuming you had a recovery under the -- for the -- confiscated cotton, under the one route you had a recovery.  You could not sue again under the other route without -- leaving aside 1500, because the claim would be precluded.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But not so, not so here, because of the way Congress has set up the authority of each court.  You could never -- what is it, 54(c) or--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --54(c) is the relief to which you were entitled.  The only relief to which you were entitled in the one court, the Court of Claims, is compensatory damages.  So there isn't a question of some other form of relief.  You have to go to another forum to get different relief.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  To test that choice -- it's pretty stark in the Casman case, where Congress said back pay is for the Claims Court, reinstatement for the district court.  But your position is that under your reading of Casman -- let's forget about Congress's amendment.  Under your reading of the statute, the Casman decision was wrong and the plaintiff had to choose either back pay or reinstatement; there was no way to get both.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the Loveladies situation?   ",09-846X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The government says the statute is simple.  It says you can't have two suits simultaneously, or you can't when the CFC suit is the -- the second one.  And Mr. Yang told me that yes, the government thinks that in the Casman case there was a choice, you can sue for reinstatement in the district court, you can sue for back pay in the claims court, but you cannot get both.  And when Congress realized that that's what was happening, Congress did not adopt a two -- didn't bless the two-state -- two court solution.  Congress said, there will be one lawsuit.  It will all be in the claims court, and they can grant both the back pay and the reinstatement.  So the two-suit approach was rejected, I guess, in -- in Congress's response to Casman.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That would be inconsistent with the definition of ""claim"" in the federal rules, I think.   ",09-846X

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can you go back to the -- this is -- you said prior to.  I thought the Rule 35 motion is made after the conviction.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the current Federal rule provides for--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --It's Rule 35 also, but it doesn't have the pure leniency?  That's Rhode Island?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can you read the relevant provision of the Rule 35?  There are two categories, the ones about legal challenges, at least as I read the rule, and--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Read the relevant part of Rule 35.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And you are talking about reducing.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Justice Scalia's suggestion--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --that perhaps the -- the leniency review is -- is not review of the conviction or sentence.  But you didn't -- you didn't do anything with that.  You didn't argue that the kind of review that's involved with leniency is really not review of the sentence for legal error.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you agree that Rule 35 is not something that the prisoner must exhaust before seeking Federal habeas?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't the whole purpose of allowing tolling of the 1-year Federal statute the purpose to give the petitioner an opportunity to exhaust what he must exhaust?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If you look at 2255 -- that's the Federal post-conviction review, and it also has a 1-year statute of limitations.  That limitation would not be tolled for Federal Rule 35 motion, so why should it be tolled for State?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You think it doesn't matter that -- I mean, Rule 35 motion is a motion made in the original criminal proceeding, not to the side of it.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's nothing--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --There is nothing that indicates that California's laws are applying a different concept of unconscionability.  You haven't come up and said, oh, look what they did here.  And in another case they said it has to shock the conscience.  Maybe across the board, California is saying: We think that unconscionability should have a broader meaning.  Is it unfair to the weaker party to the bargain?  Is there really no genuine agreement here?  And if that is so, that will fit our definition of unconscionability.  You don't have anything that says -- the California court hasn't said: We are applying a special definition of unconscionability to arbitration agreements.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, any contract that would have an arbitration clause.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can we criticize one feature of this?  You are not claiming that, vis a vis litigation, arbitration is being disfavored, which was the original concern about arbitration agreements and what prompted the Federal Arbitration Act.  The courts didn't like to have their business taken away, and so they were disfavoring arbitration contracts.  That is no part of the picture here, as far as I can see, because the rule is the same whether it's litigation or arbitration.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Pincus, are they necessarily saying that?  As I read it, the plaintiff brought a case to court, not to arbitration, and then there was a motion to stay the State court litigation.  Why isn't it a proper reading of this case to say: You want -- if you are in the arbitration forum, it's bilateral, but you can't dupe these plaintiffs out of a class action?  So if you don't have a class action in arbitration, you can have it in court.  That is, the class action is preserved, not necessarily in the arbitration forum, but in the court.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So if we look at the California law and we find other instances of unconscionability that are applying a standard less stringent than ""shock the conscience"", then we would say okay?

If the seller or employer, whoever it is, doesn't want that class arbitration, doesn't have to have it.  And here that's surely the case; the ATT has not consented to class arbitration.  Then California law says: Well, that's okay; then you will be subject to a class-action suit in court.  But the very purpose of the arbitration agreement was that you would be in arbitration and not in court.  So why isn't Stolt-Nielsen dispositive of this case?

I mean, if the -- if the table is called ownership costs, then why not use the IRS's definition of what costs are; and that definition says what, loan payments and lease payments?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Burke, before you respond to that question, isn't it so that in the event that Justice Scalia just proposed, the trustee could propose an amendment to the plan to reflect that that cost is no longer being incurred?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  My question is: In the situation that Justice Scalia proposed, it's not automatic that this $471 gets deducted because there could be proposed an amendment of the claim to reflect that that -- there is no longer any expense for ownership.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it isn't -- it isn't automatic that because there's one payment, then forever, the rest of the 5 years, he gets to deduct the $471.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, I was.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why not -- it says you are suppose to look at the costs; it's ownership costs.  So the only thing you'd look at the IRS for is, the manual, is to define ownership costs.  And they say ownership costs means those two things.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I don't follow that.  If the simple thing is to just -- what does the word ""costs"" mean?  And then you look to the IRS manual and it tells you that the cost means loan or lease payments.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Burke, the -- it's unusual to allow a deduction for the purpose of calculating disposable income although you don't have any expense.  I understand how you get to that conclusion with respect to car ownership.  Is there any other provision that in calculating disposable income you are allowed a deduction for an expense that you don't incur?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No.  The question, is there anything else that works like this?  You don't have the expense, nonetheless you have the deduction?  Any -- I mean, there are a whole list of deductions, expenses.  Is there any other one that works this way?  It doesn't matter whether you have the expense, in fact.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You may want to save the rest of your time for rebuttal.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Burke, would you explain one facet of this case to me.  Given the deduction, the $471 deduction, projected disposable income comes down to $210?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  As opposed to it would be $600 some if you didn't count the $471?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Even though the disposable income figure was $210, the debtor was willing -- the debtor proposed paying $500.

The government can't stop that from happening, even if the government thinks that they are in violation of the Medicaid Act; is that right?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but that's a very drastic remedy that's going to hurt the people that Medicaid was meant to benefit.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there is a plaintiff -- we have a Bill of Rights and most provisions have plaintiffs who are hurting, whose speech is being suppressed, but this one doesn't have.  It's in the Constitution like all the others, and I thought, to be candid, that that's what the problem was in Flast v. Cohen, and that's what the Court was responding to.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it wasn't -- it wasn't -- I don't remember whether the government participated in the Winn case when it came up under the Tax Injunction Act.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And there wasn't a word from the government about lack of standing.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There was a case in this Court, the name of it was Bob Jones.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The Federal agency says that these suits complement, they're not at odds with, the Federal regime, because they give the manufacturers an incentive to come forward.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would they have to?  Would they have to justify the delay first?  I thought there was something about, well, if the time question is more difficult, the merits are easy, there's no merit, so we just decide this--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --And in California, if it just says ""denied"" then the presumption is that it is denied on the merits, is that it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So if it's going to be denied on time bar grounds there has to be something to indicate that it's for that reason.  Otherwise we assume it's on the merits?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This was taken over by California from capital cases, but in the capital case context they have a 90-day presumption of timeliness.  And when they extended the capital framework to non-capital cases, they left out the presumption that within 90 days is timely.  Was there a reason for that?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Was there a reason for then saying, well, in the capital context, we are going to make it clear that 90 days -- 90 days is timely.  Why didn't they add that to the original rule?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, why would it be different in the capital context?

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If your main position is right, then wouldn't the same go for 2255 proceedings?  I mean, this Court has said it makes sense to have the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel looked at by a trial judge first, not an appellate judge, and yet in 2255 proceedings, if you are urging ineffective assistance of counsel, you don't get an automatic right to counsel.  In 2255 proceedings, counsel will be appointed only if the court determines that the interests of justice so require.  So the proposition you are urging would have ramifications in the Federal system as well, wouldn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And so 2255 would no longer be the interests of justice so require because if it's your first opportunity to raise the point the court must appoint counsel for you.  Is that your view?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because of the what?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why would it be excessive if it could not have been raised earlier?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If you permitted this counsel to raise a claim that could not have been raised on the direct appeal, is the counsel limited to that point, or can the counsel representing the client bring up other things?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But could it be that the counsel could also bring up a Brady claim, a newly discovered evidence?  It wouldn't be limited to ineffective assistance of counsel?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's not a question of pay.  I think Justice Alito was asking, counsel says: I've got a duty to represent my client zealously, so I want to bring up not only ineffective assistance of counsel, but these other matters.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So the -- post-conviction application would go to the trial judge; right?  And on the--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --So both in the trial judge with this Anders type speech that doesn't raise ineffective assistance of counsel, but it's such an obvious claim to make that when the -- when the judge reviews that brief, if the trial judge thought that this defendant was abysmally represented, wouldn't -- wouldn't the Court say, sorry, I'm not going to accept this Anders speech.  It seems to me you -- there was enslavement -- ineffective assistance of counsel, and you should raise that.  That's a viable issue, so I'm not going to accept your briefs.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If the judge reviews the Anders review of ineffective assistance of counsel claims, a valid one, the judge would have spotted these issues, and it would have been -- it would have been argued on that first--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Yes.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would you explain to me why don't we consider this adverse boost to your proceeding, because this post-conviction proceeding, it began -- it began the same time as the direct appeal, but it ended before this case became final.  So it was a first -- it was a first tier, because it was decided before the direct appeal.   ",10-1001
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Foreman, I think everyone has been trying to get you to focus on the health care sickness leave alone, and in the -- in the portions of the act that this Court upheld, the Congress said there is this close association of women with children; we think it's going to be good for everybody if fathers recognize their responsibility for elderly parents, sick children, sick spouse.  So, we -- we can see the rationale for trying to change the stereotype, trying to open up care-giving for both sexes.  But you have answered the question that women and men get sick; there's no -- there's no disproportion.  So how do you tie that, just that part of the act, where there isn't the obvious association of women with childbearing?  So we extend the benefit to men, so they will be associated with child care.  There isn't that same link here, is there?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What relief did you ask for?  Damages we know and you have to overcome the Eleventh Amendment.  Injunctive relief you don't, but did you ask for it?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You must have asked for such other and further relief.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, Congress must have thought that giving the woman back her job was an important part.  The whole idea is she wasn't supposed to be fired.  So I think that the -- the relief, the non-monetary relief, is certainly important.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  When you--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --When you say you're concerned about a disincentive to hire women, but the Pregnancy Discrimination Act makes that unlawful, so if an employer decides I don't want to hire women of child-bearing age, that is an out-and-out violation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you are relying on the incentive, the disincentive to hire women of child-bearing age.  The law protects the woman of child-bearing age by saying: Employer, you can't refuse to hire her, promote her, and all the rest because of pregnancy.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I'm just asking you about -- your -- your argument rests on an employer acting unlawfully, you see.  He won't hire -- we have to give them medical leave to everyone because otherwise the employer won't hire women.  And that's -- the question I'm asking is, you are assuming that the employer will break the law by refusing to hire women that -- of child-bearing age.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But your argument to a large extent depends -- or you say Congress did this because they wanted to eliminate or at least reduce one kind of discrimination against women in the job market.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that -- that discrimination was refusing to hire women of child-bearing age.  Well, they couldn't do it out and out because that would be a violation of the law.  So is Congress having in mind discrimination that is under -- under the radar screen, that is going to go on even though it's unlawful?   ",10-1016
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Need go no further?  I'm sorry?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They couldn't -- the Pregnancy Discrimination Act says you have to treat pregnancy like any other disability.  So if they are not giving anybody any leave for anything, they don't have to give any leave; not 12 weeks, not 1 day.  And that's what -- that's the gap that this legislation fills, essentially.  Yes, you do have to provide leave for women who have disabling conditions, including pregnancy, but then you have to give that to the men as well.  You can't reserve that for the one sex.  So it was the gap in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act that this -- this was referring to.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The idea is it's part of one package.  I think that's what Justice Breyer was getting at.  But just suppose that Congress wanted to improve conditions for the -- in the job market for women, which I think it's fair to say was the motivating force behind this act, and they also wanted to protect families so that sick children, sick spouses are attended to.  Now, what leave policy would say, okay, to do that we will have leave when a spouse is sick, a child is sick, a parent is sick, but not when the worker herself is sick?  Without -- it's all part of one package which is designed to increase job security for women and increase protection for their families.  So, I don't think you can slice off (D) from the other three.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Was that -- that wasn't part of the original act, was it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it was -- that was -- the concern was a discrete concern for veterans.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It wasn't part of the package that was the Family and Medical Leave Act.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's some focus in the legislative history particularly on the -- the family that has a single parent -- much more often a woman, not a man -- and the devastating impact on that family of the woman getting sick, the sole breadwinner getting sick.  So that was certainly a -- a problem for families with -- with only one breadwinner.  And Congress was focusing on those women and wanting to have job security for them.  That wasn't the only group of women, but certainly that -- that affected this act as it came out, didn't it?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the question of how Congress would do it if they -- if they provided only for the woman who was the single head of the family, then that would be vulnerable under Equal Protection because they didn't provide it for men.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But (D) is a remedy for the problem.  I think there's really not much disagreement about the problem, that there is gender discrimination in the job market.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And then the question is how do we remedy that?   INTERRUPTING ",10-1016
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then maybe Congress shouldn't have passed this statute.  But the injury, the invasion of privacy, that's not something where pecuniary damages are -- are prime if they exist at all.  I mean, this is -- the -- the tort that this is comparable to is intentional infliction of emotional distress.  The -- the person who is subject to this, to this embarrassment, this humiliation, doesn't have out-of-pocket costs, but is terribly distressed, nervous, anxious, and all the rest.  The -- the act that the Congress is reaching, the impact of it is of that nature, not -- I mean pecuniary damages, you know, ordinarily attend conduct that embarrasses, humiliates you, causes mental distress.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Even if it is -- even if it is, the damages are -- the damages are not of a pecuniary kind.  So you could say that Congress was much more generous than the common law was, but the impact on the person who is suing is not going to be out-of-pocket business loss, pecuniary loss; it's going to be the embarrassment, the humiliation.  So it's -- it's -- if Congress wanted to do something about the impact on the person it has given a right, it's not going to do something that has to do with pecuniary damages it's not likely the person in -- in this plaintiff's situation is not likely to suffer.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's the -- why -- is it -- is a harm to a dignitary interest, is that an actual injury?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You describe that injury.  I mean there is an injury, the emotional distress, humiliation; is that an actual injury?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, let's take this case.  Did the plaintiff suffer an actual injury?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  St least, did he allege that he had suffered an actual injury?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I didn't -- I didn't ask you that.  I asked you did he suffer an actual injury, as opposed to someone who is complaining about something -- an abstract right or an abstract theory?  Is there an actual injury here?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You have to have an injury first before you can get damages, so my question is was there an injury.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What does ""actual damages"" mean under the Fair Credit Reporting Act?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it can mean, and I think it has been held to mean, damages to a dignitary interest.  Mental distress has been held to, the term has been held to mean that under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  We're discussing what the term means, what the term ""actual damages"" means.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the -- the Privacy Study Commission coming after can't say what the statute means.  I mean, that would be post-legislative history.  I mean, the statute exists and then we have a Study Commission to see what amendments might be made.  But the Study Commission can't decide what the act means.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's just saying that he didn't have a good claim for relief.  But let's take the worst case, where -- where a government official spreads all kinds of false information, or even true but terribly embarrassing information about a person, does it deliberately.  Let's take that case, because your rule covers all of them.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But wasn't that the very thing that Congress -- why did they pass this in the first place?  I mean, Congress was thinking of emotional distress injuries.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But does--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --It did set a pretty high bar for the plaintiff to meet, because the plaintiff would have to prove intentional or willful conduct, not negligence, but--   ",10-1024

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Russell, when you say the agency in charge, am I right in thinking that HUD and its successor, they don't have any suit-commencement authority?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  For injunctive relief?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the -- but the purchaser is the giver.  The statute reads  ""No person shall give and no person shall accept. ""  The acceptor is the loan company.  The person who is giving would be the consumer, the customer.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But -- so the person who gives is -- is not answerable under your reading of this (b)?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But then we'd have Quicken as the giver and the person who receives the referral or the kickback as the receiver.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Russell, there is one puzzling aspect of your interpretation.  It would be a rather large thing for Congress to say we're going to cover overcharges, as I believe HUD says is so, and yet in the purposes of the act on page 1 of the appendix it says nothing about overcharges, nothing about payment for service not received in the four.  ""It is the purpose of the act to. ""  and then there are four things listed and none of those say to stop charges for services that weren't performed.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that is, that is HUD's interpretation?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you are now splitting HUD's position.  HUD's position says overcharges are reached by the statute.  You say not overcharges, but only a fee when no service is performed.  So why couldn't the customers have said, there is a fee for the service performed, that's the reasonable fee, and the rest of it is a charge for service not performed?  I mean, can you maintain that distinction between an overcharge and a fee for services that are not performed?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Where is that in the policy statement?  The difference between unearned and--   ",10-1042

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did you give a complete answer to the question what does (b) cover that (a) does not?  So one -- one suggestion that is made is well, you didn't -- if all this statute has to do -- do, with is kickbacks, then all you need is (a) and there is no necessity for (b).  You said one thing was contract, approving a contract, and not -- is there anything else?   ",10-1042
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Waxman, in your opening statement you said whenever, in civil contempt, a person is subject to incarceration he or she is entitled to counsel.  In your opening statement you didn't limit it to cases like the case we have before us; that is, where the defense is I'm unable to pay.  Therefore, I can't get out of jail.  Are you limiting -- are you limiting your argument to the case of a noncustodial parent or a former husband who says I just haven't got the wherewithal to pay?  Or are you making a broader claim that anytime someone is subject to incarceration they must have counsel?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are you saying all the trappings of criminal procedure come with it?  This case is focused on a right to counsel, but what about a burden of proof, what about a jury trial?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Waxman, you mentioned Lassiter, and you mentioned something that Lassiter said in passing, but what was at stake there was deprivation of parental status.  And the court said sometimes, in some cases, yes, but we're not going to make an across-the-board rule.  Now, that deprivation, some people think, is the worst possible, for a custodial parent to be told you're no longer a parent, you no longer have a child.  And yet the court said we're not going to provide counsel in every case, because in some cases the person can get a fair hearing without counsel.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Does that go for alimony and palimony as well as child support?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, it did.  It would cover.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there a State -- we've been told that in many States appointment of counsel for an indigent, noncustodial parent who has -- who has child custody -- that counsel is automatic.  You have described something less than counsel.  Is there any model, any State where there is such a procedure so one might find out how it's working?   Leondra R. Kruger  --I don't think that there is any one place you can look in order to see what -- features States are employing.  We know anecdotally from talking to individuals who are responsible for running programs in individual States that they do ordinarily, even in States that don't categorically require the appointments of counsel, satisfy each of the three procedural protections that I outlined earlier in response to Justice Kagan.  So, for example, in New Mexico, which hasn't recognized a categorical right to appointed counsel, there is a solicitation of financial information in advance of the hearing.  That information is reviewed by a caseworker, who will make the decision whether or not to refer the case to civil contempt proceedings.  There is a hearing at which further information is explored or elicited, and ultimately there's a determination made whether the alleged contemnor has the ability to comply.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about, an aid who is not counsel?  And the family court has a lot of auxiliary people like child advocates who are there to assist people who need some kind of representation, but not necessarily a lawyer.  Is that any part of your -- of what you would propose?   Leondra R. Kruger  I think it would certainly be open to the Court to consider whether or not having the assistance of a layperson who may not necessarily be a lawyer would be a requirement of due process, but I think given the nature of the inquiry which goes to financial condition, it's the kind of information that individuals provide on a regular basis without the assistance of either competent lay people or lawyers with legal expertise.  It seems unnecessary to satisfy the commands of fundamental fairness in order to create that requirement across the board; in much the same way I think it's unnecessary to appoint counsel in every case as opposed to taking the modest and relatively inexpensive steps that we've outlined in order to ensure a meaningful opportunity to be heard.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is the form you have in mind something different than the form, the IFP form that would be filled out say, by a 2255 petitioner?   Leondra R. Kruger  I don't think it would, Justice Ginsburg, but precisely what the form would contain would have to be tailored to the law in the relevant jurisdiction.  So where the determination is made on the basis of assets and income, it would be appropriate for the form to elicit that information.  Where in other jurisdictions the law is clear that the other information may be relevant to that inquiry, it would be appropriate for the form to elicit that information as well.  But I think in substance the form would look very much like the form that this Court sees on a regular basis attached to its petitions for writs of certiorari, and would also look very much like forms that are commonly applied in jurisdictions across the country in child support programs in order to establish the amounts of child support obligation in the first place.  South Carolina employs such a form for that purpose, and I think it would be a relatively trivial matter for South Carolina to use a similar form for the purpose of enforcement.   ",10-10XX
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The South Carolina Supreme Court, as I understand, heard this case after he was released, so they didn't consider it moot.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it was a fact, was it not, that he was already released?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't it -- isn't it true that most States in child support cases, when the defendant says I have no money, will appoint counsel?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought the point was it's only if the defendant -- the complaint is only if the defendant does not have keys in his pocket because he has no money.  So in cases where typical recalcitrant spouse won't pay until he's threatened with jail, that wouldn't come in this category.  I thought Mr. Waxman was speaking about people who do not have the keys in their pockets because they simply cannot -- they do not have the wherewithal to pay.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about you -- you stressed that this falls on the civil side, so why shouldn't we take Rule 54(d) as our model say that instructs the court that you give parties the relief to which they are entitled, even if they haven't asked for that relief, even if they've asked for something that they can't get?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do we have any -- any computation about what it would be, what the counsel fee would be as opposed to keeping someone in prison for a year?   ",10-10XX
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can we go back to what you said initially, that is if there's no alternative remedy Bivens fills the gap.  Suppose we had a case just like Carlson, only the State law allows survivor actions.  In Carlson, I thought the rule emerging from Carlson is that prison personnel in Federal prisons are subject to Bivens liability, and we don't look in each case to see whether they could have been a State tort.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is that so?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Franklin, there were some references to Mississippi law that seems to be inconsistent with the notion that all States would provide an adequate remedy.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is it -- then it might hold State prisoners as well.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It might hold -- some private facilities will take State prisoners as well as Federal prisoners.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And if they do have State prisoners, the State prisoner would have recourse to, not Bivens, but 1983.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you have two prisoners, identical mistreatment, and one gets a Federal remedy and the other doesn't.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did any of those courts address the problem of how the pro se prisoner is going to get an affidavit?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Shah, go back to what you said about lacking these private -- these employees of the private corporation you said lack qualified immunity.  But they do have -- courts have allowed them to have a good faith defense.  So in practice, how different is that, whether they have qualified immunity or whether they have a good faith defense?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the character of the claim?  If it's a Bivens claim it's a constitutional claim, it's an Eighth Amendment claim.  And if you are looking to state remedies, that's an ordinary tort remedy with no constitutional involvement.   ",10-1104
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would you be taking the position that even if there is an alternative State remedy, tort remedy, even so, there ought to be a power of Bivens action?  Or would you say no Bivens action if all of the States have adequate tort remedies?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But in Carlson, it was Bivens or no damage remedy.  Here, that's not the case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In Carlson, the Court was operating on the theory that with respect to the Federal employees, it was a Bivens remedy for damages or no remedy at all.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Right.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And here, it is different from Carlson because there is an -- a remedy against an individual.  So we have the parallel remedies here which didn't exist in Carlson, and that makes the two cases different.   ",10-1104
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Rosenkranz, you knew that, though, from day one.  This case is brought in State court, it's removed to Federal court.  Ultimately the plaintiff says: I recognize that as a matter of law my 1983 claim is no good.  But the plaintiff didn't say that until 18 months after the -- the transfer.  So doesn't the plaintiff have some responsibility for running up all these costs in the Federal -- burdening the Federal court, having discovery in Federal court, instead of saying when defendant removed the case -- either dropping the Federal claim or conceding at that point that it had no merit so it's only the State claims.  I mean, doesn't -- doesn't the plaintiff bear responsibility for keeping that case in Federal court for 18 months?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Rosenkranz, there -- there are distinct differences in the 1983 suit because, first, the plaintiff has to show defendant acted under cover of State law -- that's not going to be necessary in the suit for extortion or defamation -- has to show that Vice was an official policymaker for the city.  Those are discrete issues that relate to the 1983 claim but have nothing to do with the extortion/defamation claim.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In other words, you're saying that the lawyer has to keep account of -- now, if I'm going to spend time on ""under color of State law"", I have to label that and figure the hours for that separately; similarly for whether Vice was an official policymaker, those hours that you are requiring that -- instead of saying X number of hours for deposition of witness A, you are requiring particularizing the issue?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Rosenkranz, one -- one piece of this you must know the answer, under the Louisiana law we have the extortion, defamation, and emotional distress going forward in Louisiana courts.  Does Louisiana follow the American rule so that plaintiff even -- if the plaintiff prevails, there would be no award of fees?   ",10-114X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I don't see how that -- one can say that looking at the complaint.  It said extortion, emotional distress -- where is the complaint?  Let's look at it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Right to be free from extortion.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I thought that the Louisiana pleading rule were -- was that you state the basis of your claim, and you do not have to plead legal theories; and if that's so, then if this -- defendant removed this case to Federal court; the plaintiff wanted to keep it in State court; and in Louisiana, under the Louisiana pleading rules, it would have been perfectly appropriate.  The -- the claim alleged gave rise to extortion claim, the defamation claim; so this complaint was filed in Louisiana court that has a rule that says tell us what happened, and then you can have whatever legal theory you're entitled to.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't that implausible, Mr. Stancil, when we consider that of all the claims here, the one that would seem easiest to prove is extortion, because Vice was convicted of extortion in a criminal proceeding?  So if you're looking look and you say what is the outstanding claim here, I would assume that it was the extortion.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The district court was prompted to do that by your motion for summary judgment.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And you could have brought that motion very early on.  If this is a frivolous claim on its face, then why didn't you move to have it dismissed immediately?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Stancil, the first magistrate to get this case said explicitly that the discovery materials, the discovery in the Federal Court, would be usable in State court proceedings where those materials might aid in obtaining a judgment.  So doesn't that have to be taken into account, that the discovery materials developed in Federal Court will now be used in the State court proceeding?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that certainly conflicts with the first magistrate.  The first magistrate said use the material in the State for the State court proceeding.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's disembodying what -- we have a factual scenario here.  Some of the discovery was spent in determining what happened with the alleged racial slur.  Investigating the facts of that claim are certainly relevant to the State court proceeding.   ",10-114X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Shapiro, on that question and the question Justice Scalia just raised, the government, you know, has taken the position that you are under the wrong section.  It's not a question of patentability, but you used the -- the example of the finger, you said it's obvious.  So why didn't you raise the sections that the government says would have been the appropriate ones on the novelty or anticipation of prior art and obviousness?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Shapiro just told us, when I asked him that question based on your brief, that people need to know up front that this is not a patentable subject matter; very important that it be 101 and not 102 and 103.  So how do you answer his rejection of the adequacy of prior -- as it's anticipating prior art or obviousness?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  I think the answer, Justice Ginsburg, is that from the perspective of the United States and the PTO, it's exactly the opposite; that importing these -- taking, as Justice Kennedy suggested, taking up the temptation to import a look into novelty and nonobviousness into the 101 inquiry is going to be very destabilizing; 101, as Bilski said, is a threshold eligibility test and the question is whether there is a process.  Here there is a process.  It's the administration of a drug that changes the body chemistry and there is then a test to determine the extent of the change and then there is an end of the test.  That's a process.   ",10-1150

And then it set an outer limit at 3 years, and it was the same thing in Merck.  Here we just say -- it just has what seems to me a plain vanilla statute of limitations that is traditionally subject to equitable tolling.  We don't have that special kind of a statute that gives you one limit and then sets up a further limit that will be an outer limit.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The problem is it reads like dozens of statutes of limitations.  It says: No suit more than 2 years; and that I think there's the general understanding that that limitation, that kind of limitation, there is a presumption that it is subject to equitable tolling, forfeiture, waiver.  And why, if this one doesn't use any different words -- why--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, it -- it's not simply prophylactic.  I mean, there is an objective that 16(a) expresses.  That is, Congress wanted these trades to be reported and to have this form filed, Form 4 filed.  So it's a -- it's a disclosure-forcing provision, 16(a) is.  Then why would Congress mean for it to operate to immunize a defendant who has not made that filing, and who has concealed what's supposed to be reported in 16 -- under 16(a)?

That could be considered quite arbitrary when the question is, is the child left orphaned, but the Court said, well, that's what the statute said.  It made that distinction, and the Court upheld it.

So if you look at standing alone, it seems to me the States would have standing on the same basis that Massachusetts had standing.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought your -- your first argument when you addressed this issue was there is a decisionmaker and that decisionmaker is EPA.  So you wouldn't get to even how arduous a task this would be if it was within the court's bailiwick.  I thought your position was that the function, this regulatory function, has been assigned to the EPA and not to the courts.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  EPA couldn't give -- could EPA give that relief?  We're dealing with existing stationary sources.  We're not dealing with new or modified sources.   ",10-174X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  More than that, Newdow was a case of a father trying to assert a right on behalf of a child, and the child herself did not want that right nor did her mother.  So it seems to me it's worlds apart, and when you describe prudential standing as involving generalized grievance, I thought that the generalized grievance was Article III.  I thought that's what Mrs. Frothingham's case was about; it was a grievance that she shared with everybody in the populations, so she didn't have standing.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  To that extent you disagree with Mr. Keisler because he says there is no Article III?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can we get to -- to the situation that now exists?  They are seeking standards for existing sources.  I asked Mr. Keisler, and do you agree with him, this is not a -- this is not a new source or a modified source; we're talking about existing sources.  Does EPA, could EPA, regulate and set standards for existing sources?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's not an area where the Court can't go.  To take a political question we all agree on, I think, the courts can't mess with the impeachment of a president, just -- but here the Court does deal with the subject matter all the time.  It reviews decisions that the EPA has made.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  General Underwood, the -- the relief that you're seeking, asking a court to set standards for emissions, sounds like the kind of thing that EPA does.  I mean, Congress set up the EPA to promulgate standards for emissions, and now what -- the relief you're seeking seems to me to set up a district judge, who does not have the resources, the expertise, as a kind of super EPA.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if we just concentrate on I think the relief you want, you say: District court, if we pass everything else, you set emissions standards, you put a cap immediately, you set a cap, and then annually you require further reductions.  Well, that just sounds to me like what EPA does when it sets emission standards.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The agency -- the agency is engaged in that, in it right now, and that's another facet of this case, the potential for conflict.  The EPA, after acting for a while, has now agreed that it does have authority to classify this as a pollutant and it has taken the first steps.  One argument that the EPA -- that the United States is presenting is the way agencies go about this is incrementally, so they're starting with motor vehicles and then maybe they will go to new sources, and then they'll get to maybe where you are.  But you want the Court to start with the existing sources, to set limits that may be in conflict with what an existing agency is doing.  Do we ignore the fact that the EPA is there and that it is regulating in this area?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Your point is that EPA, unless and until EPA gets to the point of setting standards for existing sources, the court can be side by side with the agency; we know that the agency is beginning, it starts with light motor vehicles, and then it's moving forward.  But you say as long as the EPA hasn't gotten to stationary sources, the court can be conducting a similar function with -- one of many differences is that if the EPA is setting the standards they will set -- they will do it through notice and comment, everybody will be able to put in a submission; but the court substituting for the EPA, how does the court replicate that notice and comment process?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But now there is an agency, and we know that it operates in a certain way, through notice and comment rulemaking.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And here is the court and how does it operate to get to those standards?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  One aspect of the litigation process as opposed to the agency process, the agency makes its rule and that can be challenged in court, but suppose your plaintiffs lost this case on merits.  I take it this is not a class action, there's no certification of any class.  Other plaintiffs before another district court could launch a similar action against these very same defendants, right?  There would be nothing to preclude that?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That means you have--   INTERRUPTING ",10-174X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Richland, isn't there this difference: Just to take ordinary civil procedure, compulsory counterclaim doesn't have to satisfy any jurisdictional requirements, because it comes in under the wing of the main claim, but a permissive counterclaim has to independently satisfy jurisdictional requirements.  So that could be a reason, even though the Bankruptcy Code just says counterclaim, to distinguish the two.  If there's an authority to deal with the claim, then there's authority to deal with the counterclaim; but if it's a permissive counterclaim, if it's not based on the same transaction or premise, then it would have to be a self-standing claim.  But, as you -- as you have said, this case does present what the parties have agreed is a compulsory counterclaim.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the counterclaim came at what point?  After the proof of claim was filed?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Will you include in that this 157(b)(5), because this whole thing would be a futile exercise if the tort claim comes -- comes out of the bankruptcy judge's--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Does the government have a position on what the answer would be vis a vis -- because that's an open question?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I wanted to ask you, Mr. Englert, about something you just said about if he had any opportunity.  I thought his position was this is a nondischargeable debt; that even if it's discharged in bankruptcy, this debt would survive?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it wouldn't be wiped out?  I mean, it would--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --He would have another forum.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Just one more point about the nondischargeability.  He didn't have to bring that claim, did he?  I mean, if it's -- if it's a nondischargeable debt, he doesn't have to have the bankruptcy judge confirm that it's a nondischargeability debt.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Of course, there was no Bankruptcy Court handling it to start with.  There was no claim.  If you're going to go back to equity, equity lays hold of a claim that fits within the equity court, and then, as you know, there were clean-up and clear-up doctrines so they could decide the whole case.  So I think that the one thing one can say about Marathon is that when the debtor has a claim against the creditor and the creditor hasn't made any claim in the bankruptcy, he can't drag that into the Bankruptcy Court.  But once the Bankruptcy Court has authority over the claim, the creditor's claim against the debtor, then the court can clear up the whole matter.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Just clarify one point, Mr. Englert.  As I understand it, before the code was amended, when the Federal courts were operating under the interim rule, it was standard that the bankruptcy judges, given a claim against the estate, routinely dealt with counterclaims.  Isn't that what the practice was when the interim rule was in effect?   ",10-179X

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So there's no difference between a report -- the government has an investigating commission and it works up a report -- as opposed to the many government agencies that are just repositories?  They accept pieces of paper, reports, filed by other people, like a tax return, like a financial disclosure.  The agency does nothing, has no input.  I mean, there's surely different between those two kinds -- one, I would say, the natural understanding would be it's a report by the person who's filing it to the agency; and the other, where the agency puts personnel to investigate an issue, is a report of the agency.  And you seem to say, no, they're all reports of the agency.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Let's take this very case--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I'm asking you isn't there a difference between saying we want the raw filings, we want what Schindler filed, we don't want the government to do any investigations, we want them to do just the mechanical thing that they do under FOIA, and an agency saying we're going to investigate and make a report, we're going to put our people under the investigators, and we're going to interview witnesses, they're going to examine documents, and -- and we'll make a report?  That's how I understand a government report.  But it's very hard for me to understand how a report by Schindler becomes a government report simply because it is filed with the agency.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  We'll find out from them if that is what they have set their position.  I had not read them to say that.

But that he would have gotten the 51 months or 68 is certainly controverted because of two interventions: The prosecutor can say no deal; I'm withdrawing it, even after an initial acceptance; and the judge can say, I think 51 to 68 is entirely improper for what this man did.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The judge -- the judge, he knows what the plea -- let's say he knows what the plea bargain was, but he also knows that for one of the crimes, felon in possession, that alone, the sentencing range is 81 to 135.  So without any, considering anything that happened at trial, the judge knows that the plea bargain was for less than if the man had been charged with -- only with a felon in possession.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it -- it seems most unlikely that a judge would have accepted the plea bargaining for 51 to 68 for the crimes that were charged.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That may be, but is it not true that the sentence range was 81 through 135 for felon in possession?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Unanimity on the remedy?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that the point of Buckley was that the public funding, which you can accept or reject, the justification for it was that it increased rather than decreased speech.

But wasn't it -- didn't the Court say we will not order the prosecutor to reinstate the earlier offer?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you are -- you are leaving out of the picture the prosecutor's prerogative to withdraw or flip.  You said that the court, that it lacked authority to order the State to offer any bargain, but also the court said, I'm not going to require the prosecutor to renew an earlier offer.  One thing is clear in this case; the prosecutor did nothing wrong.  The wrong was on the part of defense counsel.  So why should the judge disarm the prosecutor, take away the prosecutor's right to change his mind?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that's -- is that the question that the Court raised?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The Court was expecting you to address.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are -- are you recognizing that the remedy that the Missouri Supreme Court did give was a futile remedy, that is, plead guilty, to have another open plea or trial, because this defendant apparently doesn't want to go to trial.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But why should -- now that we know what the judge's sentence was, and part of the plea offer was remade, the part about -- what was it, 3 years versus 10 days in jail?

The -- this worker we're told was on the outer continental shelf 98 percent of the time.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought your brief, your reply brief, said you -- you superimpose a status test.  You have the situs of the injury and then you superimpose status.  So your test is not simple state of -- place of injury.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Clement, if your position is right then we have a worker who most of the time is doing work on a platform and he will be covered or not depending on whether the injury occurred on the shelf or on the land.  So it's -- the other view is to say, what this person does most of the time is what counts.  Then this worker would always be covered by OCSLA and if you take your view, then one will be covered by OCSLA, and another one who is doing the same job is covered by a State -- a State -- you have a variety of State workers' compensation laws as opposed to a uniform law governing workers of this kind.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Clement, may I go back to -- you referred to Herb's Welding, but that was a case -- it was a claim under the Longshore Act, not an OCSLA claim, and the Court said it was expressing no opinion on whether 1332(b) covered the injury.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But Congress also did not adopt the proposal, the specific proposal to confine OCSLA to situations in which State workers' compensation was unavailable.   ",10-507X

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You said that Congress can set a time limit.  In this case, we are dealing with, let's say, Aaron Copeland, who gets the benefit of copyright, and Congress says: No, we think Shostakovich should be treated just like Copeland.  Yes, we took care of our own when we weren't part of the world community, but now we are.  And so all that Congress is doing is giving Shostakovich works the same limited work as Aaron Copeland.  And why does that violate the limited-time prescription?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the person -- the person we are talking about, the work we are talking about, never got the first limit.  There was no, there was no time, there was no time when that work could have been protected.  So why isn't it consistent with the Copyright Clause to say, you are entitled to limited time protection?  We are not talking about a case where you've had the protection, enjoyed it and then it expired, and then Congress says: We'd like -- we like your work so much, we are going to give you another term.  What's affected here are people who were unprotected.  And Congress says we think that they should have a limited time.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They didn't get the equivalent of what a U.S. author -- but let's take the large category, because it's the ones that you feature.  We are talking about Shostakovich, Stravinski, and I say: Well, what's wrong with giving them the same time that Aaron Copeland got?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's not a limited time.  That's saying you have no time.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it has to have a beginning, too.  And for these people who were unprotected, because we didn't recognize their copyright, there is no beginning.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I can understand your argument that the public domain is untouchable.  I'm not sure I get that from the Constitution, that says to secure to authors for a limited time the exclusive right.  That -- that's talking about what you can secure to authors, so I don't see why using the words of the Constitution  ""to secure to authors for a limited time. ""  Congress can't say: We want every author to have a limited time.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The foreign works that we didn't give, we're not treating them any better.  They don't get a different startup date, but they get the same end date as our own authors.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  We're not talking about expiration dates.  So I'd like you to concentrate.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's not -- that's not -- none of these -- none of these copyrights have been extended beyond their expiration date.  They just weren't protected.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that is -- that is not -- that is most distinctly not before this case, so please let's not talk about a copyright that has been protected, has expired, and Congress wants to revive it.  We are concentrating on what Congress did to bring us into compliance with the worldwide system and it's saying: We are giving a limited time to these authors.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They never had a limited time before.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did anyone in the same -- the same -- published the same year as de Tocqueville, a U.S. author, that would have a copyright protection today?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I gave the example of Aaron Copeland versus Shostakovich.  Let's go back to de Tocqueville.  Who has a copyright who published in what, 18 -- what was it -- 40s?  Right.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think you gave an analogy to the statute of limitations, and I thought you were quite right about that.  You can extend the statute of limitations before it's expired, but once it's expired it's over.  The problem with using that as an analogy is that there was a beginning.  Time ran out, and you're trying to deal with a situation here where you say, you know, the time was limited for the U.S. work, but it's unlimited; you -- you cannot treat the foreign work -- you cannot give it a limited time, the same limited time that you would give a U.S. work.  You're saying these people had no time and they may never have time.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it isn't quite so, because there are these examples of people who couldn't get copyright because of wartime after both World War I and World War II, and -- so those people were allowed to get the protection that they couldn't get because of the war.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Laycock, could you clarify one point?  You say the church decides who's qualified to be a minister, but, as I understand the facts here, she was never decommissioned as a minister and, beyond that, she was even recommended by the officials to other parishes to be a commissioned minister.  So it's -- it's odd to say there is any interferences with who is qualified to be a minister, because the church was holding her out as being qualified.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I thought your position would be if she's a commissioned minister, as distinguished from a teacher who conducts grace or takes the class to chapel.  I'm -- I'm taking -- the Chief is asking for somebody in this, you categorize as a minister, although mostly she's a math teacher.  You would say the extent of her religious duties don't matter; what counts is that she is commissioned as a minister.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that it was part of -- it was agreed that there was no fact dispute that what she did, her duties at the school, did not change from when she's a contract teacher, and therefore not a minister, and then she takes courses and is qualified to become a minister, but what she's doing at the school is the very same thing.  And I thought that was the basis for the, the decision that we are reviewing, that there was no difference at all in what she did before she was commissioned and after she was commissioned.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you're isolating one parish, but there was something in one of these briefs that said the majority of the teachers in the Lutheran schools -- let's see where it was.  I think it was--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Is it -- is it in the handbook?  I mean, one of the objections -- if this -- if this is a rule that's going to bind a teacher, then you would expect to find it in the handbook.  But the handbook doesn't tell her, if you complain to the EEOC about discrimination then you will be fired.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Laycock, you, in order, I think, to dispel the notion that nothing is permitted, in your reply brief you say that there are many suits that could be brought that would not be inappropriate.  And I think it's on page 20 of your reply brief.  But I don't understand how those would work if the policy is you're a minister, if you have quarrels with the church or a co-worker, we have our own dispute resolution and you don't go outside.  But you say torts arising from unsafe working conditions.  Suppose one of these commissioned workers said: I think that there are unsafe working conditions and I'm going to complain to the Occupational Health and Safety Agency.  And wouldn't she get the same answer: This has to be solved in-house.  You don't go to an agency of the State.  Why -- I don't follow why the tort claim based on unsafe working conditions would not fall under the same ban on keeping disputes in-house?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I thought the reason that she was unfit for the ministry was that she went outside the house.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So in all of these cases, you go outside the church, you go to the government, then you have a--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But she could be, for any of these things, she could be disciplined, fired because she complained outside the house?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The tort claim could proceed, and then she would get damages and that would be all right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did you say -- did I understand you before, in response to Justice Sotomayor and Justice Scalia, that even if she were merely a contract teacher, the fact that she teaches religion classes would be enough for her to qualify for the ministerial exception?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is the clincher in this case, but even -- I think you answered if she were not a commissioned minister, she's teaching the faith, therefore she can be fired, and it doesn't matter whether she's commissioned, so the commission is irrelevant.  It's -- it's her job duties that count?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, it was certainly for some purposes, I mean, if every teacher who teaches religion and math and a lot of other things said, I'm a minister and I'm entitled to the parsonage allowance on my income tax return, certainly that's something that a government agent would review.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Whalen, the common definition of deceit is acting -- intentionally giving a false impression, intentionally giving a false impression with the intent that someone will act on it.  So it seems that's exactly what filing a false return is.  You give a false impression of what your income is with the intent that the IRS will accept it.

Why do you have to have anything more than that to establish deceit?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do we have it in the briefs?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the point that is being made is not that it's fraud and deceit.  Quite the opposite.  I think Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Scalia have tried to get you to focus on the evasion that involves no false statement at all, evading payment where you say nothing.  What would be the crime if you simply don't pay your taxes, and you don't file returns, so you are not filing anything that is false?  Where would that come in the internal revenue?   ",10-577X

And when Congress picks out one tax crime and one tax crime only, why wouldn't we assume that that's what Congress meant with respect to aggravated felonies?  That there is one tax crime, the most serious tax crime; that fits that label.  And the (M)(i) provision deals with the many, many statutes that involve loss -- fraud or deceit and loss to the victim?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, one of the problems that was brought up in the amicus brief which actually was considered, that reading the (M)(i) to include 7206 offenses would also -- would bring in offenses that are merely misdemeanors at the State and local level, it would really swell the category of tax crimes that lead to deportation.  That -- did Congress really mean to turn misdemeanors into aggravated felons?  And then there was a very practical point made that government is going to be hurt more than helped by what you are seeking, because we are told that very often the government will try to make a bargain.  It has a 7201 case, but it's going to be a little hard to prove.  So they offer as a plea bargain 7206.  And if you -- if your position prevails, we are told, there will be many, many people who will say: If it's a question of whether I get thrown out of the United States, I'm going to go to trial; I'm not going to plead to something that will mean immediately when I serve my time I will be thrown out of the United States.

So they weren't anticipating that he was going to rule without anything further.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But as far as -- as far the record shows, De Leeuw was not on the record at all.  There were three counsel of record.  Two of them -- well, let's go back to the -- this first issue.  The State by its own conduct showed that it didn't regard Butler as any kind of representative, because it didn't even send its Rule 32 response to Butler, isn't that so?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about -- what about the notice that he had lost in the Alabama court and he better, if he wants to go to the Federal court, do something about it?  That notice went only to Maples, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And Mr. Garre made the point that if Maples were represented, that that would be improper, to send a notice to Maples alone.  So the State's attorney must have thought that Maples had been abandoned by his lawyers because he didn't notify any of them.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But we do know they were counsel of record.  We do know that the only two counsel of record were no longer representing him and he had no reason to know that they weren't, but they were not -- they couldn't represent him.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So there was no one from Sullivan & Cromwell other than those two on the record.  So on the record, they had abandoned him and there was no substitute.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What happened here when they -- they -- they did seize weapons that belonged to the plaintiff, Mrs. Millender?  They -- they took them because they thought they were the defendant's?  Not that -- they thought they were Bowen's?   INTERRUPTING ",10-704X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because she can't prove it at the early stage, and the problem that Congress was concerned about was that you can't tell until the house is going to be sold in the end how adequate the title insurance was.  So Congress is acting on the potential that these kind of kickbacks can cause harm.  And this does seem to fit the bill of restitution, unjust enrichment cases, where the plaintiff doesn't have to prove any harm, she just gets back what the defendant should not have received.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose she appended to her complaint an affidavit by a well-respected economist that says: Congress was right; these kind of arrangements will have an adverse effect on the people who are purchasing title insurance, and goes through all kinds of analyses that show that.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's one piece of this I don't quite comprehend.  You -- there's no contest that there is jurisdiction over the parent, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it's -- it's based on consent?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You are met with an argument that it's all one ball of wax, parent and sub, they merge, it's one enterprise; and so if the subs do something anyplace, the parent is -- it's all part of one thing, so I think that was the principal argument made by Respondents.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Perkins is kind of an unusual case, because it was a company that at the time was doing business only in Ohio.  It was a Philippine mining company and it was World War II, so the mines couldn't be run.  So to the extent that the corporation was existing anywhere, it was in Ohio.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, suppose it's just a corporation that's registered to do business in North Carolina, and the connection with that registration; it says: I appoint so-and-so my agent to receive process for any and all claims?   ",10-76XX
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think there's something very new about this, because general jurisdiction is all-purpose jurisdiction and for a corporation it's sort of like a residence for an individual.  I think Mr. Feder was making that point.  What's -- what's troubling here is that the North Carolina court seems to be blending the two together, specific jurisdiction based on the claim arising in the forum, and general jurisdiction with a claim that has nothing to do with the forum, and it's insertion of jurisdiction over any and all claims.  And I do not know of any case post-International Shoe.  The only thing that we have is Perkins v. Benguet.  Is there -- is there any case in which this Court has sanctioned the assertion of general jurisdiction based on some prior -- some product coming into the State, not the product that caused the injury abroad?  I don't know any case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --we don't have anything in the record about this being a unitary business.  Unless you're trying to present some sweeping, piercing the corporate veil theory, there is nothing here that says that these are -- corporations are not acting separately, that have their own officers, have their own employees, keep their own books.  There's nothing to show that it's all part of one--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But the ""it"" wasn't the product that caused the injury here.  As I understand the case the tire that allegedly caused this bus to turn over was designed for the European and Asian market, not the U.S. market.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But why did -- why should -- Mr. Feder brought up the Helicopteros and he said in that case it was purchase; and in this case it's sales, and in the purchaser case certainly we said no, there's no general jurisdiction.  Why should it be any different?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In Perkins it was the home of the corporation.  There was no other at the time, because their permanent home was not functioning because of the war.  So there was only one place.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  He was the president of the corporation?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And whatever business it was doing, it was doing from that office in Ohio.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I ask you about the ramifications of your theory of this general jurisdiction in North Carolina over these three subsidiaries?  Suppose that one of the children on the bus was a Canadian citizen, was going home to Canada, and had the idea that juries in North Carolina are more liberal than in France -- well, there wouldn't be any jury in France.  So could the Canadian come and sue because there's general jurisdiction in the United States?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, we're talking about Goodyear and these three subsidiaries.  You say there's general jurisdiction in North Carolina.  Those companies can be sued on any and all claims.  So my question is: Could anyone on that bus that turned over in Paris come to North Carolina to bring the wrongful death or whatever suit?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you have any case law that supports your position, which, I take it -- and correct me if I've got it wrong -- that a subsidiary is subject to jurisdiction wherever the parent is, so long as some products made by the subsidiary are shipped by the parent to the -- to buyers in the foreign State?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I see nothing in the North Carolina court's opinion that explains that this is the -- this is a corporation where we can obliterate the distinction between parent and sub.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's -- there's a -- you open your brief saying something to the effect that this case is about outsourcing.  Jobs in the U.S. going to some subsidiary port.  But then these subsidiaries are making tires, which on your own admission, very rarely come to the United States because they're designed specifically for vehicles in Asia and in Europe, and so I would think that Turkey would be the ideal location for -- for such a place.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would you clarify--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --You answered my question earlier that they don't sell it to anyone else.  That's why I was trying to clarify your answer to Justice Kennedy, because you told me the only sale -- the pharmacists, they sell this to the data miners, they do not sell it to the other people.  But now you're answering Justice Kennedy's question, yes, they sell it to universities.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's another -- there's another purpose that I would like you to comment on, and that is the, the State is interested in promoting the sale of generic drugs and correspondingly to reduce the sale of brand name drugs.  And if that's the purpose, why doesn't that run up against what this Court has said that you can't, you can't lower the decibel level of one speaker so that another speaker, in this case the generics, can be heard better?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Kneedler, in most of our commercial speech cases there has been a commodity.  Here it's a record maintained by the pharmacist.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Pincus, you said -- I think you used the words  ""the one who motivated the charge. ""  or something to that effect.  And I'm looking at the complaint that was filed in this case and it says, and this is on page 28 of the joint appendix.  It says Mr. Hodges -- that's the prosecutor -- know or should have known there was no probable cause.  Mr. Hodges,  ""directed Mr. Paulk to appear before the grand jury and attest to the truth of such charges. ""  So if anyone was the instigator, it was the prosecutor, not his aide.  But the prosecutor gets absolute immunity.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if he did it -- if he did at the prosecutor's bidding, then he is not the prime mover.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The -- the -- instigator, what you call the complaining witness, would have been -- immunity, identical testimony at the trial itself, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's only -- it's only what you call the complaining witness that gets this special treatment?  All the other witnesses before the grand jury would be absolutely immune?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The question is where do you locate the grand jury?  We have on the one side you recited Malley.  That was an arrest warrant, testimony in support of an arrest warrant.  Then we have the trial, where everybody gets absolute immunity.  And the grand jury is in between those two.  So why should we bracket it with the arrest warrant rather than with the trial?  The arrest warrant is certainly pre-prosecution.   ",10-788X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then you agree with the position that the United States took, which is you can -- if there was evidence outside of the grand jury proceeding that this person was the instigator, that that could be the basis for a malicious prosecution 1983 claim?  I thought the United States' position was: We're not going to use the testimony before the grand jury, but if this person did things outside the grand jury to instigate the prosecution that -- that could--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, let's go back one stage.  Let's go back to an arrest warrant.  The witness -- and the affidavit in support of the warrant is filled with lies.  The affidavit is presented to a judge, and I would think that's better than a prosecutor.  And yet there is no absolute immunity for someone who lies in order to get a warrant, even though the judge makes the judgment whether the warrant should issue.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose -- suppose we had, instead of a grand jury proceeding and an indictment, an accusation to begin the prosecution and a supporting affidavit in connection with the accusation.  Would there be -- would there be absolute immunity then for the affidavit that supports the accusation which will begin the prosecution?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No.  We take the grand jury out of it.  We are going to begin the case, the prosecution, by an information.  Or I think the Georgia law refers to something called an accusation.  If -- if we are not before a grand jury, and the prosecution is instituted by an information, and there is an affidavit supporting that information, is there absolute immunity for the false affidavit in support of the information?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you -- you cited a provision of the Georgia Code that seems to equate what's called an accusation with an indictment.  It's on the bottom of page 22:  ""All legal proceedings by which a person's liability for a crime is determined, commencing with the return of the indictment or the filing of the accusation. ""  So if the Georgia Code equates those two, the return of the indictment or the filing of the accusation, why shouldn't the immunity rule be the same for the two?  And you told me that Malley would cover the filing of the accusation.  So why shouldn't it be the same for the return of the indictment?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you regard the grand jury as a judicial proceeding?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there's no judge.  And it seems to me odd to say -- there is no presiding judge, there is no cross-examination.  And the indictment has the same function as an information.  So why should it rank as a judicial proceeding?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that would go for the prosecutor, too, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  For the information?  If you -- if you granted it was Malley, the -- the prosecutor who lies to the magistrate is not going to have absolute immunity, as the arrest warrant states.  Is the prosecutor absolutely immune for making out an information that is packed with lies?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why isn't an arrest warrant intimately associated?   ",10-788X

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Millett, suppose, instead of having a statute broken down into (c)(1), (2) and (3), Congress had written (c) as just one paragraph that says: You must have a certificate of appealability, and this is what the certificate must contain.  No division into (2) and (3).  Would you still maintain that only the first sentence of the paragraph is jurisdictional and the rest is not?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then that would exclude this case, wouldn't it, because there is a constitutional issue.  It's the speedy trial issue.  But that issue was not reached below, because the case was dismissed as untimely.  So the only constitutional issue that's in the case is one that couldn't be adjudicated by the court of appeals.  Isn't that right?  Is there another constitutional issue other than the speedy trial issue?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's a little odd that you would identify that issue for the court of appeals when the court of appeals couldn't take it up because it wasn't reached below, because the case was -- was dismissed at an earlier stage.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it does, it does suggest, Ms. Millett, that final, two ways -- conclusion of direct review is you've gone up the ladder and that's it.  And the second part is, well, if you don't go up the ladder you would stop.  Then when your time to go up the ladder has ended, that's it.  It -- it seems that there are those two possibilities, as Justice Kagan put it so well: You lose or you quit.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you would have a difference between 2255 and 2254.  And on the State level you would have a variety of times, because some States, they don't all make it the mandate.  They don't set finality as mandated.  There may be different -- there may be different periods of time before the mandate issues.  So you would have various time periods for State prisoners.  But if you were a Federal prisoner, then you would have -- this would be the one--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I'm not talking about test.  I'm talking about time periods.  There's a uniform time period on a 2255 petition.  It would not be a uniform time period for 2254 petitions.   ",10-895X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can we back up and tell me why the statute we are dealing with 2253, why does jurisdictional, if jurisdiction means, as we have said, that class of cases that the Court is competent to hear.  So I look at 2254.  That's State habeus.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Federal petition by a State prisoner.  And 2255 is a petition by Federal prisoner.  So those are the classifications.  The classifications are habeas cases, 54 state prisoners, 55, Federal prisoners.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  2253, it seems to me, is a processing rule that applies to both categories.  It applies to 54 and it applies to 55, but the classes of cases identified in 54 and 55.  So I would write 2253 as a mandatory processing but not, not a rule that tells us what class of cases the Court is competent to hear.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So is it doubles the -- 2254 is jurisdictional; 2255 and then 2253, which tells how you are to proceed under either one of those, is not simply a mandatory how you do it but jurisdictional.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The feature of this case that I think is very unsettling is there is an issue for the court of appeals to decide.  It's the timeliness issue.  The court of appeals could not decide the speedy trial.  If the -- if this case were to fail because the trial judge didn't identify the speedy-trial issue, when the court of appeals in no way could reach that issue in this case, isn't that something only a, a distinction only a lawyer could love?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If you say -- if you say that, here's Judge Gaza, and he says: Yes, there's a statute of limitations question here.  It has to be decided before we get to the speedy trial.  But if the judge felt that the speedy trial issue was not meritorious, then why would he grant a certificate of appealability on the threshold question that you'd have to decide before?  Because it seems to me it would be a waste of everyone's time if the judge thought that the speedy trial issue had no merit.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In -- in this very case, that was so, right?  Because the -- the period for discretionary review expired in August.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the mandate issued September -- some date in September.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So there could be no State habeas until the mandate issued.  So the days in between would count against the defendant on the speedy trial clock -- even though he would -- could not have filed a State habeas; he could not have stopped the clock by filing a State habeas.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So if someone on the court of appeals noticed that yes, the certificate pinpoints the only case, only question that the panel can decide at this juncture, but there is a lurking constitutional question, then isn't 28 U.S.C. 1653 exactly what the panel would do then, is 1653 says that detective jurisdictional allegations can be amended in the trial or the appellate court.  And so all that would have had to have happened is very much in line with Justice Breyer's questions, is that the judge on the panel said oh, certificate of appealability didn't make it a speedy trial issue.  So counsel, would you like to amend, or we on our own will amend to put that question in?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the appeal couldn't go forward on that issue, because that issue hasn't been decided below.  One thing we know is with speedy trial issues, the case cannot go forward on the speedy trial issue.  Isn't that right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then how common is it for courts of appeals to reach substantive issues in the first instance?  There's no decision of the district court.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Wouldn't -- wouldn't the most sensible procedure be -- let's forget the efficacies of 2244 and 53, but you -- you have a case where there is a statute of limitations question and that has come up for review.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You're talking about a very narrow range of cases, because I take it your principal position is it -- it would be unusual that the defendant needs to be competent in order for the lawyer effectively to represent him on habeas.  So, under what circumstances do you think competency matters so that the lawyer should not be expected to go on without a competent client?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, why should the--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --why should the Court do that?  Why should it provide any guidance if, as you say, in both of these cases the review is limited to the record, and we would never get to the question of, if it weren't reviewed, limited to the record, then what?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Opposing counsel says there is an exception for ineffective assistance of counsel under our decision in Martinez.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Like -- like the stay in Rees.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You would have to -- to maintain your position, the Court would have to qualify Rees, or at least the interpretation that says the stay should be indefinite once the petitioner is found incompetent, because that's what happened there.

What was wrong with his explanation?  He looked at the case carefully and he said: There's nothing that can't be fairly adjudicated on the record.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Treatment stopped because he said there were side effects?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  At least only -- only in cases where the -- the claim of incompetence is genuine.  I mean, if anyone says, oh, I want to make -- take advantage of the more defendant-friendly standard, all I have to do is allege I'm incompetent.  But that's not the case.  He has to be.  There has to be a hearing that determines he is, indeed, incompetent.  And most defendants I don't think would be able to establish that they are, indeed, incompetent.

So the consumer doesn't really elect arbitration.  It's just presented as part of the terms that the consumer can take or leave and not negotiated.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's a question of whether we take that into account in -- in determining what  ""You have a right to sue. ""  means.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you -- but this arbitration agreement precludes class action, doesn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, Mr. Nelson just said no, that his position does include that fact.  And I asked him about post-dispute and he brought up settlement as well.  He said that their interpretation does not exclude settlement, in which the Plaintiff agrees--   ",10-948X

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would your position of right to a lawsuit, would that extend to a post-dispute genuinely bargained for right to arbitrate?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Another argument that is made, and perhaps to your position, is that the statute says that any waiver of any protection or right may not be enforced by any court or any other person.  And the suggestion is ""any other person"" must contemplate an alternate dispute method that doesn't involve court, court or any other person.   ",10-948X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  General Verrilli, can you be specific on who that person would be?  Because, as I understand it, it's unlikely that, for example, the lawyers in this case would be charged with any criminal offense.  It's more probable that their clients would be; but, according to the government, their clients have no Fourth Amendment rights because they are people who are noncitizens who acted abroad.  So it's hard for me to envision.  I see the theoretical possibility, but I don't see a real person who would be subject to a Federal charge who could raise an objection.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So the client is somebody who is abroad and who acted abroad, and is not a U.S. citizen.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How likely is it that a service provider would object?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the litigation was unsuccessful.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, using what you just mentioned, suppose -- just let's suppose that the Court should hold there is standing.  Wouldn't the government then say as far as the merits of the complaint, this information is classified, is a state secret, we can't -- we can't go forward with the litigation?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  General Verrilli, but in this case the Complainant can never know.  I mean, I know you emphasize the speculative nature of this claim, but it's not speculative if the government being given this authority by Congress is going to use it.  Isn't that so?  I mean, are we to assume that--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Is there much of a speculation involved in how -- I think it's only one time, and it was under the pre-amended statute, that the FISA court ever turned down an application.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You never know.  There may be dozens of concrete applications affecting the Plaintiffs in this case, but we will never know.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which they can never, never have, and that's what makes this -- if -- if there could be a person in this category who would know, but the person will never know.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Jaffer, could you be clear on the expanded authority under the FAA?  As I understood it, it's not like in the old statute, where a target was -- identified and FISA decided whether there was -- the court decided whether there was probable cause.  Under this new statute, the Government doesn't say who is the particular person or the particular location.  So, there isn't that check.  There isn't that check.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What other measures besides having to travel to have conversations?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the travel overseas I understand is the one thing that has a dollar amount attached to it.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did that offer include admission of liability, or was it just that it was going to pay the amount of damages requested?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So if -- if there were judgment of liability, then that would be preclusive for all other people similarly situated?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that -- so the next case is another employee who claims uncompensated work time, and that's brought on behalf of similarly situated people.  Then that next case, the employer would be -- would be subject to summary judgment because the liability has been established.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It was not possible for anything to be done about the certification because you moved immediately.  The complaint is filed, and then you moved -- then you immediately offered the judgment that you did.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there is nothing in Rule 68 -- you're basing the -- your position on a rule that provides as the only sanction if the plaintiff continues and gets less than the offer of proof, then the plaintiff has to pay the costs.  Rule 68 doesn't say anything about dismissing suits.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What do you do when -- when you have a governing statute that says that an employee may bring suit for and in behalf of himself and other employees similarly situated?  Can you use a mere rule, Rule 68, to carve out what the statute authors -- authorizes, that is that the employee can seek relief on behalf of himself and others similarly situated?  Mustn't you give a chance for the statutory provision to work, which you didn't.  By filing immediately, you didn't allow the normal process of inviting opt-ins to occur.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but you have to give the plaintiff an opportunity.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose -- suppose the plaintiff had simultaneously with the filing of the complaint moved to have it preliminarily certified as on behalf of other employees situated; so, instead of having the complaint, which was labelled a collective complaint, separate from a motion for certification, they came together; that the plaintiff filed a complaint and immediately filed a motion for certification and a request to discover the names of other people similarly situated.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why didn't -- why didn't you file the motion for certification along with the complaint?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you could have done that with the complaint and I don't -- you say you want to get joiners, so why do you have to wait?  Why wouldn't you -- why wouldn't the most logical thing be to say, court, we have labelled this a collective action and now we want to start the ball rolling in getting certification.   ",11-1059
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought we were talking about, Mr. Waxman, the materiality of the alleged misstatement; and I am really nonplussed by your answer that if the judge says it's immaterial, that doesn't end it for everybody.  Certainly it ends it for the class; you said that.  Should it also end it for the representative of the class to say: Okay, now I'm going to come back, and this statement, this finding of the immateriality doesn't bind me.  Of course it's going to bind the class representative.  So if it's immaterial, the case ends.  And if it is material, then it is material to everybody in the class.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Waxman--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Waxman, there is no question about 23(a), right?  The 23(a) prerequisites have been satisfied.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So the only thing is (b)(3), that is a question of law or fact common to the class members predominates over questions affecting only individual members.  The question that predominates is the question of were these representations material; if they were material, then the certification is proper.  If they were immaterial, it's not.  It's just -- I don't understand why this isn't just a clear case of a question common to the class; that is, the question of materiality.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Waxman, the -- the Basic opinion that started all this off, on page 242, lists materiality as a common question.  The materiality of the misrepresentation, if any, is listed as a common question, and that made perfect sense to me.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Waxman, you seem to be setting out two determinations of materiality.  You say in order to certify the class you have to show that the misrepresentation was material.  And in order to win on the merits, you certainly have to show that the misrepresentation was material.  How do those two findings of materiality differ?  How does the finding that you say must be made at the certification stage differ from the finding that must be made at the trial?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I still -- what does “ material ” mean at the trial level, what does “ material ” mean at the certification level?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it's the same question.  It has to be -- if it's established at the certification stage, it has to be established again at trial?

Whatever the State -- whatever the State court says as a matter of patent law has no binding effect on that question coming into Federal court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What would happen -- what would happen if that came up in an ordinary litigation in Federal court, and the Federal circuit ultimately decided the question, the State court was entirely wrong about this; you don't need a witness.  Well, that's the end of it, right?  Once the Federal court decides the question, then whatever the State judge thought was the Federal law is gone.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Anytime -- anytime we allow patent questions -- as you already pointed out, a lot of patent questions come up in State courts litigations, contract litigations.

But the Federal court is certainly not going to follow what the State says on experimental use.

And you're saying this is how we read it.  We start with the antitrust exemption is for the state, not subdivisions, so the state has to give it to the subdivision for the subdivision to have it.  Could the Federal court have said, we'd like to know what the Georgia legislature -- what the Georgia authorities think this statute means?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, indeed, but -- but you are assuming a conflict.  You're saying either the -- the statute applies or Rule 54(d) applies, but the statute can be read to say,  ""We're describing one category of case. ""  ""We are describing the worst case; the bad-faith harassing plaintiff. ""  and the statute deals with that category of person and no other.  So if you're not a bad-faith harassing plaintiff, but you nonetheless lost, then you're under 54(d).   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, there are a number of reasons.  One is symmetry, because they have costs in the part about defendants.  And the concern that, well, if we leave out costs for the bad-faith harassing plaintiff, then it -- it may be assumed that they get only attorney's fees and not costs.  So the statute's provisions like this may be redundant, but one can see that a drafter might very well want to say,  ""Well, we said we're dealing with the defendant costs.

They are covered only under 54(d), which is costs, not fees.  Why should we read this act in a way that -- so -- so that a defendant under this act who can get attorney's fees is worse off with respect to costs than defendants under the other lending legislation, the ones that have only 54(d)?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You said that Congress can set a time limit.  In this case, we are dealing with, let's say, Aaron Copeland, who gets the benefit of copyright, and Congress says: No, we think Shostakovich should be treated just like Copeland.  Yes, we took care of our own when we weren't part of the world community, but now we are.  And so all that Congress is doing is giving Shostakovich works the same limited work as Aaron Copeland.  And why does that violate the limited-time prescription?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the person -- the person we are talking about, the work we are talking about, never got the first limit.  There was no, there was no time, there was no time when that work could have been protected.  So why isn't it consistent with the Copyright Clause to say, you are entitled to limited time protection?  We are not talking about a case where you've had the protection, enjoyed it and then it expired, and then Congress says: We'd like -- we like your work so much, we are going to give you another term.  What's affected here are people who were unprotected.  And Congress says we think that they should have a limited time.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They didn't get the equivalent of what a U.S. author -- but let's take the large category, because it's the ones that you feature.  We are talking about Shostakovich, Stravinski, and I say: Well, what's wrong with giving them the same time that Aaron Copeland got?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's not a limited time.  That's saying you have no time.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it has to have a beginning, too.  And for these people who were unprotected, because we didn't recognize their copyright, there is no beginning.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I can understand your argument that the public domain is untouchable.  I'm not sure I get that from the Constitution, that says to secure to authors for a limited time the exclusive right.  That -- that's talking about what you can secure to authors, so I don't see why using the words of the Constitution  ""to secure to authors for a limited time. ""  Congress can't say: We want every author to have a limited time.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The foreign works that we didn't give, we're not treating them any better.  They don't get a different startup date, but they get the same end date as our own authors.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  We're not talking about expiration dates.  So I'd like you to concentrate.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's not -- that's not -- none of these -- none of these copyrights have been extended beyond their expiration date.  They just weren't protected.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that is -- that is not -- that is most distinctly not before this case, so please let's not talk about a copyright that has been protected, has expired, and Congress wants to revive it.  We are concentrating on what Congress did to bring us into compliance with the worldwide system and it's saying: We are giving a limited time to these authors.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They never had a limited time before.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did anyone in the same -- the same -- published the same year as de Tocqueville, a U.S. author, that would have a copyright protection today?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I gave the example of Aaron Copeland versus Shostakovich.  Let's go back to de Tocqueville.  Who has a copyright who published in what, 18 -- what was it -- 40s?  Right.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think you gave an analogy to the statute of limitations, and I thought you were quite right about that.  You can extend the statute of limitations before it's expired, but once it's expired it's over.  The problem with using that as an analogy is that there was a beginning.  Time ran out, and you're trying to deal with a situation here where you say, you know, the time was limited for the U.S. work, but it's unlimited; you -- you cannot treat the foreign work -- you cannot give it a limited time, the same limited time that you would give a U.S. work.  You're saying these people had no time and they may never have time.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it isn't quite so, because there are these examples of people who couldn't get copyright because of wartime after both World War I and World War II, and -- so those people were allowed to get the protection that they couldn't get because of the war.

What you're saying is this specific exception, rightly cabined, is generalized so that in all cases, the second wife will prevail over the first.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why should it be different than the outcome in Wissner and Ridgway and one -- one case that you cite quite often is the Hisquierdo case for -- you -- you cite it for deference to State domestic relations law, but what was the outcome in that case?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Which is quite something different.  This is taking it from the designated beneficiary and giving it to somebody who isn't designated.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Ruttenberg, how do you get to this notion that administrative convenience is all that is involved?  After all, this is an employee's life insurance and the Government is saying to the employee: The beneficiary is your free choice; you can pick anyone, your spouse, a charity; it's your choice; but we want you to know that, although you make it and you can change it any time you want, if you don't change it that will be it.  That -- so it's giving, the employee, control over the proceeds of his or her life insurance.  Why isn't that a purpose along with administrative convenience?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You would agree with that?  I assume you would agree with what Justice Alito just said?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That it has only to do with administrative convenience?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why should this scheme be treated differently than the National Service Life Insurance and the successor law in Wissner and Ridgway?  Those operated the same way.  They said the person who designates says who gets it and if you -- the only way you can change it is to have a change of beneficiary form filed with your employer; if you don't do that, whatever you've said is where the money goes.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the two decisions that dealt with the anti-attachment, they gave that as an alternative ground of decision.  It was quite separate and discrete from saying what's on the beneficiary, the designation that controls.  And they say, and also there's this anti-attachment.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In -- in your briefs in this case, you put in the assignment provision as -- as an afterthought.  I think you did not put it in your main brief.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Ruttenberg, what about the interest, which was an interest in Wissner and in Ridgway, of uniformity under this Federal insurance scheme?  That is, one of the hypotheticals in the briefs was: The deceased dies domiciled in Virginia.  Wife No. 1 comes from X State, not Virginia, Wife No. 2 two from Y State, and they all have different -- different rules.  The employee, in the course of her career, may move around from here or there.  But if you follow the Federal law, then it's going to be the same for every employee.

So if Congress really wanted there to be no leeway at all, then it should have done something about that regulation.   John F. Manning  --Justice Ginsburg, you're entirely right.  Congress has amended the statute, in fact, eight times since the Secretary promulgated her regulation establishing a good cause requirement.  But this Court has in recent years been more careful about finding acquiescence than it did at one time.  In the Solid Waste Authority of Northern Cook County, what this Court said is that before it will find that Congress has acquiesced, there must be evidence that Congress was aware of the regulation and a clear signal that Congress meant to embrace or put in place this regulation.  And this is a sound policy because Congress leaves regulations in place for all sorts of reasons, because somebody is using a parliamentary tactic, because Congress doesn't have one opinion or the other about whether the regulation is right, because Congress didn't think of the problem.  So, in recent years, this Court has insisted upon a high degree of proof before it will find acquiescence, and that degree is not present here.

When he asked for a permit, he voluntarily said, As mitigation for the loss of wetlands, I am going to voluntarily create a conservation easement on the rest of my property.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And if he had offered nothing and he just said, I want this permit to develop my land, and the agency said, You have offered no mitigation, we deny your permit, would he have a claim?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose he just put in the application, no mitigating -- no mitigation of any kind, and the agency says no.  You recognize that he would have no claim, right?  That he had an obligation to mitigate.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think you -- I think you have a problem with that, Mr. Beard, because if you look at the record, the record is very clear that it was not -- that the district didn't come back and say, Take it or leave it, you -- you improve our wetlands or you get no permit.  There was and if you -- they are set out in the Respondent's brief at pages 13 to 15, oh, at least half a dozen, maybe more, that the district said here are several ways, several ways that you could sufficiently offset the adverse impact.

So if we can't -- we really can't say this was a take it or leave it, either you do the improvements that we are asking you to do or you get no permit, what do you do with the fact that as the appendix certainly bears out, that the district offered a range.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Boutrous, I thought at least as an alternative argument, you're saying: The statute itself is silent.  It doesn't deal with this question of amount in controversy.  However, the individual, the named plaintiff, who has said, I'm not going to seek more than the $5 million, cannot speak for the members of the class who are absent.  He can't stipulate that they will take under 5,000.  I thought that was the central part of your argument, not based on the statute itself, but on the notion that a named plaintiff, unless and until he is -- he is certified to represent the class -- doesn't represent them.  He can represent himself, but he can't bind the people who -- who have not been certified as part of a class.  I thought that was part of your argument.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about specifically the question that the Chief asked about time?  You did argue in the district court that these plaintiffs could have specified a 5-year time period, in which case it would be clear that the amount in controversy was satisfied.  But instead, they took a 2-year period.  Can we take that also into account in determining the amount in controversy, that the complaint could have been enlarged to include 5 years instead of 2 years?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Your concern is that the -- that the certification -- if the certification would occur in the Federal court, that's one thing.  But you're saying that the named plaintiff can't stand for the entire class when we know that -- that the certification question, if the stipulation is binding to prevent removal, it's going to be the State court that's going to look into the adequacy of representation and whether the stipulation binds all members of the class.  That's your whole concern.  If the Federal court made that determination, I think you wouldn't be here.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What do you do -- in the language in 1332(d)(1)(D), the term “ class members ” means the persons, named or unnamed, who fall within the definition of the proposed class, the proposed class, and that's what we have here.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Even though you admit in your brief -- you agreed that the stipulation -- I didn't think that this is what you said on page 53, the stipulations that have no effect on absentees, until the Court finds at the certification stage that the stipulation was made in good faith and doesn't render the named plaintiff an inadequate representative.  But we have to judge removal at the time removal is made, and at that time, there is no determination of class.  So at the removal stage, the stipulation is inoperative as to the non-named class members.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How is it binding when you said in your brief it doesn't bind the unnamed class members?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Goldstein, this case has been presented in a very complicated way, but it seems to me that what we're dealing with is a rule adopted by the Commission, and the Commission's rule-making power, as you know, is very broad.  They have power to make the rules needed to carry out the provisions of the Act.  And 332 is -- counts as a provision of the Act.  So why isn't it just a proper implementation of that rule-making authority?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the abstract question really isn't presented.  I mean, just to follow on what I asked you first, here is a phrase, “ a reasonable time ”.  And the Commission interprets that phrase in a reasonable way.  Why is this case any more complicated than that?  Why doesn't the FCC have the authority to interpret that term, within a reasonable time?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Goldstein, in following that, it seems to me you -- you are basing your argument on what is said in 7(a).  And that preserves the authority of the local governments.  But the provision that we are talking about is (b), and (b) says limitations, authority that the local governments do not have, and among those limitations is that they have to act within a reasonable time.

A wage earner can have a child, undisputed that the wage earner is parent, but the wage earner is not married.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I thought we weren't supposed to look to (h) at all.  Your thesis is (e) covers it and there is no reason to refer to (h).   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Rothfeld, don't you run into a problem, perhaps not in 1939; but since then this Court has had a number of decisions that deal with the distinction between children born in and out of wedlock, and in some of those cases it has held that the distinction between the two is unconstitutional, that there are no illegitimate children, all children are legitimate, whatever their parents may be.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but if we are going to apply those equal protection decisions to this statute--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Rothfeld, these children were born 18 months after the insured wage earner died.  If we look to other categories of children, say, stepchildren, and there is also one for adopted children, for stepchildren, they qualify only if they had that status no less than nine months before the wage earner died, and adopted children is also a limitation.  The stepchild and the adopted child, there could never be any question of being born 18 months later.  They wouldn't qualify.  There is a time limit for the other children.  And if Congress had thought about this problem, maybe it would put a time limit on this, too.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, that would be fine if the statute said what you claim it said.  It says a child is a child of a wage earner.  And you'd have to import these things that Congress didn't say to get to what you claim is the plain meaning.  But what do you do with the sentence in (h)(2)(A) that says  ""in determining that an applicant is a child of an insured individual for purposes of this subchapter. ""  The subchapter is not for purposes of (h), but for purposes of the entire subchapter, which would include (e).

Does it deal only with the discrimination claim, or does it deal with the MSPB's procedural ruling?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why don't we take this -- this very case, where the MSPB said that -- that the claim was time barred, so the government would raise it as an affirmative defense.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's -- you're talking about the discrimination claim.  In your view, could the plaintiffs now in the district court say, I'll forget the CSRA remedy; district court, you have authority to hear the Title VII case, the ADEA case, and that's all I need?  And so I'm not -- I'm abandoning my CSRA.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And then that would take care of the whole thing you discussed before about the affirmative defense and the Government.  It would be the plaintiff's choice, I want my Title VII case and that's it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Schnapper, can you explain something about the MSPB's role?  That is, once you have a final decision from the agency, you could go right to court.  You don't -- on the discrimination claim, right?  You don't need to go to the MSPB.  You don't have to exhaust anything before the MSPB to get your discrimination claim.  So, how does the M -- the possibility of going to the MSPB make the discrimination claim any less ripe for judicial review than it would be if you stopped at the agency level?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What are -- what are your advantages?  You are deciding -- you have the final agency decision, you could go right to court on the discrimination claim.  What do you gain by invoking the MSPB authority?   INTERRUPTING ",11-184X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Harrington, may I just clarify that if -- if the case goes to the MSPB, and the MS -- the Federal circuit, the Federal circuit agrees with the MSPB that this was untimely filed, that's the end of the case, the discrimination claims would never be heard then.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So if the Plaintiff then goes to the district court, then what position does the government take?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Schnapper told us in his brief, and he repeated it this morning, that the MSPB and the EEOC disagree with your reading of the statute, that they think that the so-called mixed case goes to the district court.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, didn't -- in the Ballentine case, didn't the MSPB take the position that it didn't go to the Federal circuit?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And so you -- are you -- are you telling us that the position you're representing on behalf of the government is the position that the MSPB would take today, is the position that the EEOC would take today?

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Srinivasan -- I'm sorry.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The United States is governed by the substance of the Credit Reporting Act.  The Act applies to the Government, but your point is that there's no sanction for noncompliance, even though the United States, a Government system, is supposed to conform to the standards in the Act.   INTERRUPTING ",11-192X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I ask you, Mr. Jacobs--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --whether you think Congress ever honed in on the issue whether the United States, given the multitude of financial transactions in which it engages, ever thought that sovereign immunity would be waived?  I mean, if you're right about this, the consequences are enormous for the Federal fisc.  And we -- the statute developed in a peculiar way.  First, there was the definition of person when there was no civil liability, and then some years later the prohibition of having both the credit card number and the expiration date.  In all of it, is there any hint that Congress envisioned a waiver of sovereign immunity in the Fair Credit Reporting Act?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  When the definition of persons was put into the statute, there was no civil liability; isn't that right?  So they didn't -- they could not have been thinking about civil liability.   INTERRUPTING ",11-192X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And you are agreeing with the dissenting judge, who I think did say this error is harmful.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And so you are not saying that it's just that they didn't use the right formula, but you would say, given what occurred here, the importance of this witness, that -- that this was a harmful error?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought -- I thought your main point, as you said ""this jury"" rather than a hypothetical jury, I thought your main point is that what's wrong is to say, strip out the infected testimony, take that out, look at the rest of the record and if the rest of the record warrants conviction no harmless error.  I thought that what you were saying is that the basic mistake is what are they looking to, are they looking to all of the evidence, or are they just asking the question, let's take out the tainted evidence and see if there's enough to convict?   ",11-199X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But, Mr. Yang--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Going back then to your position in your brief where you said that you would not include in the harmless error calculus that the jury requested to hear Marina's testimony again, the length of their deliberations, the divided verdict.  You said in your brief at pages 32 to 35 that you would not include those.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I think you answered Justice Kagan that you could take them into account, the Court could take them into account but cautiously, not give them -- not give them undue weight.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You would -- you would take into account that the prosecution apparently thought this was important, so important.  The trial was over.  The prosecutor said: Judge, I'd like to come back so these tapes can be introduced.  The -- we have the witness testifying that defendant was there by chance; he was not part of the scheme.  We have no direct evidence, because Cruz never spoke to this defendant, to Vasquez.  He's at the scene, we know that.  And an explanation, an innocent explanation, is given why he's at the scene.  And then the government comes back after everything is done, and says: We want the jury -- we want these tapes to be before the jury.  Isn't that -- don't we take into account that the government itself thought this was very important?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But my point to you is it wasn't fleeting.  If the government says: We want to extend the trial so that we can play these tapes, all of them, and they contain not just the one statement, there's the one statement that the trial will be bad, a trial will be bad for all of them, and they ought to -- so they should take a--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --What was the line that the government, the prosecutor, repeated three times while she was on of the stand, the exact lines.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  The government thought it was important for the jury to hear it, because they said it three times.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you -- you are essentially saying, as I understand you, that -- if there was such a thing as a directed verdict in a criminal case, if the judge would say, you know, I will direct a verdict here because there's only one way a rational -- rational jury could come out.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You do agree -- you do agree that the government has the burden of showing that the error is harmless?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The government's burden.  And you also agree that we -- we should look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant in making--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --So what does it mean that the government has the burden?  What does the government have to do.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The absent error.  So that means -- wait.  You look at just the evidence that's not tainted?   ",11-199X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because -- because the limitation on sale is they can't sell -- by Federal law, they can't sell.  And you're -- you are debating about exchange, sale.  What strikes one about this case is that these are workers -- they work autonomously.  They don't clock in and out.  They work outside the workplace.  After they're trained, they have minimal supervision.  Is there any other category of exempt workers that have that kind of autonomy and yet come under the wage and hours--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --For example, what are the -- that's what I wanted to know.  What are the categories of people that seem to be autonomous, not the type that clocks in and out?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about -- what about the extras?  I mean, we're told that part of this job is to have a good relationship with the doctors.  It includes dinners.  It may be conventions.  Entertainment, maybe golf.  If -- if you're right, would the time on the golf course get time and a half?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You were -- you were giving examples, and we just stopped at--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --emergency service worker.  But you said there are many examples--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --of people who are highly autonomous and still come under the hours regulation.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I ask you -- may I ask you to follow up on other -- other categories of employee?  You gave me cleaning workers, emergency service workers.  Are any of those categories people who get paid commissions?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Malcolm -- Mr. Stewart, is it -- is it true that that option is no longer available, that the Department of Labor no longer gives opinion letters?   ",11-204X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it also says, it also says promotional work incidental to sales made by someone else.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --is nonexempt.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And these, these sales -- I mean, eventually there is a sale to a hospital, to a pharmacy, and that sale is not made by the detailer.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it's got to be non-binding.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that seems to be inconsistent with this, this opinion letter.  The request is put in by the pharmaceutical company and they want an exemption under administrative employees.  In the Department of Labor's response allowing that exemption, it says that these detailers, and they use the word ""detailers"", medical detailers, are engaged in a form of promotional or missionary work.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I think the letter goes on to say that these detailers are engaged in a form of promotion not having for its object the making of specific transactions.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But as far as your years, it's suspect for two reasons.  One is we are told that in the early years, at least, before there were regulations restricting the sale of prescription drugs, that these detailers did two things.  They did have their informational function, but they also did direct sales to pharmaceutical companies, to hospitals.  So for at least 20 years of those 70 years these people were engaged in what the department would call sales.  So that's suspect.  And then when we have the commitment, the opinion letter that says: We have a category for these people; they are engaged in instruction, in information; they are not engaged in sales; but because they are so independent, we rank them as administrative -- in the particular case we rank them as administrative people.  So it's not as though there was a sudden about-face as you suggest.  We have a categorization as -- as administrative employees, but not sales employees, and we have a history of these detailers at one time actually selling.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did you claim -- did you claim exemption as administrative employee?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So that would -- then that would be still open if you lose on the outside sales?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did -- did the pharmaceutical companies request -- ever in this period, request a ruling, a rulemaking on the status of these PSRs?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That was an opinion letter, they said.  I thought they said that was an opinion letter.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  I asked if there was a request from the pharmaceutical companies for a rulemaking on the proper classification in this case.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why would you -- why must you look to an amicus brief?  Why not just look to the regulations that define -- the regulations that define ""sale"" and that define ""promotion"".  The 541.503 says promotion work incidental to a sale made by somebody else is not exempt.  Why do we get into the amicus brief when we have in these 541 regulations a definition of sales on the one hand, promotion on the other, and then this statement that promotion work incidental to sale made by somebody else is not exempt?  Why doesn't -- why isn't that the answer to this case?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Does the pharmaceutical company have a sales force?  I mean, who sells to the wholesalers, the pharmacies, and the hospitals?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there are -- there are people who sell to them.  There may be only a few, but--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Are they exempt, too?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The -- the actual sellers from the -- the people on the staff of the pharmaceutical company who sell to the wholesalers, pharmacies, and hospitals, are they exempt?   ",11-204X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose -- suppose, General Verrilli, that the decorations were left out and Congress had said: We don't like people saying that they were in the Marine Corps for 25 years when they never served for a single day in any armed force.  So they have a statute just like this one, but it is directed to the false claim that one has served in the armed forces.  I don't see in your argument that there is something special about the decorations--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, the assumption -- the assumption is that it's false, that was -- and that it's not so hard to find out if somebody claimed to have the Medal of Honor and he doesn't.  So that -- first you answered yes, that it's only self, and now you said, no, it can be -- or at least I think you said -- making a false statement of fact.  And the concern is -- and I gave you the question of just in the service, leaving out the decorations -- other statements of fact, false statements like  ""I deny that the Holocaust ever occurred. ""  That's a statement, a false statement of fact, isn't it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did the military -- did the military ask for this?  You're claiming there's a special interest in seeing that a military honor is not debased.   ",11-210X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why?  I mean, it's expressive.  One is I am speaking through conduct and the other is I'm speaking through words.  You wear the medal and you are saying, I am a Medal of Honor winner.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you think wearing--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --that the wearing of a military decoration that you haven't earned, that that's also of questionable consistency with the First Amendment?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No circumstances.  You go out in the street with the medal on you for everybody to see.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the government has said: That's not how we read the statute, and the courts read statutes to avoid a constitutional collision.  So let's assume that we are not going to cover performances, satire; it's just a baldfaced lie.  That's all that this covers.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose -- suppose the statute were amended, as has been proposed, to require an intent to obtain anything of value.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that wouldn't -- that wouldn't reach this speaker.  Is that -- that wouldn't reach Alvarez, because he didn't obtain anything of value.   ",11-210X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that would be true of Mr. Patchak?  Suppose he had filed in the 30-day window.  The Secretary gives notice to affected persons.  So he comes in and he says: I think that you don't have authority to do it because this tribe wasn't under Federal jurisdiction, and so I want you to call -- call it off.  Nothing -- nothing has been transferred within 30 days.  I thought both your brief and the tribe's brief said that the judicial review would be available to any affected person who used that procedure.  Is that -- is that true?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you said -- you said it was important if.  So the argument is this tribe wasn't under Federal jurisdiction.  I could raise that because I'm an affected person.  Somebody's got to be able to enforce against the Secretary the limitations that Congress put on the Secretary.  So would there be standing in that situation?  Mr. Patchak comes in within the 30-day period, so he's not trying to undo any done deal.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So then you disagree with the tribe that said in no uncertain terms, in its reply brief, that this case is not about the availability of judicial review.  Judicial review was available in the 30-day window.   ",11-246X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But he didn't file it within the 30-day window, so that -- that is -- there was a clear track.  He could have filed within 30 days, and at least the government tells us that that would have been subject to judicial review, the ruling made within -- that nothing would go on until that action was cleared.  So why, if he could have sued early, before any title transfer, why isn't that all the relief someone in his position would be entitled to?  Why should he be allowed to wait?  I mean, the whole purpose of the 30-day window is to get people to state their objections.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The government answers that that's in diversity.  You know, you determine citizenship as of the date the complaint is filed.  Citizenship of a party changes, so if it coincides with someone on the other side of the line it doesn't matter.  But do you have cases other than diversity cases where the filing of the complaint -- nothing happens, nothing that can happen after affects the jurisdiction as set as of the time the complaint is filed?  I don't know outside diversity where this principle has applied.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But I think the government told us that the land didn't belong to the tribe in the first place.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the government did say that the Band was not the prior owner of the tract.  So where would it go?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Didn't they -- wasn't -- didn't they have some encouragement from a court of--  appeals suggesting there might be a due process problem if they didn't have that notice?   ",11-246X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there was no ruling in the court of appeals.  The court of appeals did not rule on the statute -- whether the statute mandates that these logging roads be governed.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So is--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --And so that's not a point that this Court could resolve in the first instance.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, you can do that; but, this Court is a court of review, not first view, and we don't take questions that haven't been aired below.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You wouldn't have to do anything if the Court vacated the decision below.  Then you wouldn't be facing anything.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Would you be--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Would you be entitled to it?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So -- so if you're right that you're entitled to it and we agree with you, then there is nothing.  You don't have anything hanging over your head as a result--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --of the prior decision.   ",11-338X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But we didn't--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But that -- that is the question, the question of what the statute requires, was not decided below.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And you're not urging that we reach it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if you were challenging the new rule, you would have EPA as your adversary.  The format of this case now is we have -- we have Decker on one side and you on the other and the EPA is not in the lawsuit.   ",11-338X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Rein, before we get to that, because the Court is supposed to raise it on its own: The question of standing.  The injury -- if the injury is rejection by the University of Texas, and the answer is no matter what, this person would not have been accepted, then how is the injury caused by the affirmative action program?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I ask you on that specifically, let's take away the 10 percent solution.  Suppose the only plan were the one that is before the Court now, no 10 percent.  This is the exclusive way that the University is attempting to increase minority enrollment.  Then, if we had no 10 percent solution, under Grutter would this plan be acceptable?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, then the question is can you have both?  But it seems to me that this program is certainly no more aggressive than the one in Grutter; it's more -- in fact, more modest.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Rein, it seems to me that in your talking about critical mass, you are relying entirely on the 10 percent is enough.  They don't -- they got minorities through the 10 percent, so they don't need any more.  And I tried to get you rigidly to focus on -- forget the 10 percent plan.  This is the entire plan.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because of the 10 percent.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But -- the race-neutral alternative is the 10 percent plan?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you say, and that's okay because it's -- it's race-neutral, but is it really?  I mean, the -- the only reason that they instituted the 10 percent plan was to increase minority enrollment.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that -- the only way it works is if you have heavily separated schools.  And worse than that, I mean, if you -- if you want to go to the University of Texas under the 10 percent plan, you go to the low-performing school, you don't take challenging courses, because that's how you'll get into the 10 percent.  So maybe the University is concerned that that is an inadequate way to deal with it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is it any more unchecked than the Harvard plan which -- that started all this off in 1978, decided by Justice Powell?  Is it any different from how race is used in our military academies?   ",11-345X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Garre, could you explain -- I think you were trying to before -- what seems to me the critical question in this case: Why didn't the 10 percent solution suffice?  There were a substantial number of minority members admitted as a result of the 10 percent solution.  Why wasn't that enough to achieve diversity?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Garre.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Garre, before your time is -- runs out, the other point that I'd like you to answer is the argument based on Parents Involved, that the gain is just too small to warrant using a racial criteria.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Once you have the 10 percent, you don't need more.  So how do you answer the argument of it being too small?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that's the same -- the same would be true in -- of the Bakke plan, that in some cases it's going to make a difference.  The same would be true under Grutter.  The same would be true under the policies now in existence at the military academies.   ",11-345X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Schwartz--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Mr. Schwartz, I thought you're talking about the constitutionality of a statute--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --not any constitutional claim that there has been unconstitutional action by an official.  I thought that your point was when you're challenging the constitutionality of a statute then you have a right to go to the district court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought your -- your position was that the Merit Systems Protection Board has said we have no authority to adjudicate constitutional questions, period.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So I thought the court was saying that this claim is dismissed because we don't have jurisdiction to deal with that kind of question.  And then your next -- the Federal Circuit, well, how can the Federal Circuit exercise jurisdiction over a claim when the first-instance decisionmaker said it didn't have authority to render the decision?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that that's what your position was.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought your position was that whatever the MSPB cannot hear, then you go to the district court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you take the position that, the MSPB having no jurisdiction and saying it has no jurisdiction it, can adjudicate this matter, well then, a reviewing court has no jurisdiction to, to -- to review?  There is nothing to review because the MSPB said, we have no jurisdiction?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought your point was and hasn't the Federal Circuit said that the MSPB has no jurisdiction to decide, we have no jurisdiction to review.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that an appellate court is reviewing a court of first instance.  The scheme that has been proposed would turn the Federal Circuit into a court of first instance, rather than an appellate court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought you said this one.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This one, because you want to make a record of all the changes that have occurred in the service and you need much more than briefs.  You need to have maybe testimony from people who have -- who have been working with the changes and the opportunities of limiting service.   ",11-45XX
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Those statutes to which you refer said that no action on the claim for Social Security benefits, no action shall be brought under 1331.  There is no such provision here.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can you go back and tell me when the government changed its position.  It was my understanding that up until, well certainly this case was litigated, the government was taking the position MSPB has no jurisdiction to pass on the constitutionality of a statute.  When did government back away from that position?  When did it say no, we were wrong; they do have jurisdiction?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there any such possibility in this case?  I mean, the statute says: Men must register for the draft.  There is no way to avoid, to reread that statute, to say anything other than that.  So I don't, I don't see any constitutional avoidance.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Johnson v. Robison is one such case.  I don't recall in that case anybody referring to an -- any administrative law treatise.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you know of any other -- any other case where an appellant court has authority to decide a question that the court of first instance lacked authority to decide?  You say MSPB says it has no authority, and you agree with that.  I couldn't think of another case where a court of appeals, which is a court of review, not first view, substitutes itself for an incompetent court of first instance.   ",11-45XX
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What was the purpose of having the monitoring station if nothing can be done?  And are -- the monitoring shows yes, there is a lot of pollutants in there, and we know that at least some of them have to be ascribed to the district.  But you say unless you show the outflow, that it comes from there, no liability.  Why shouldn't it be that, given there is going to be a contribution that the district is making, that the district should have the burden of showing, no, there are all these other ones out there, so our percentage is X, not the whole thing?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Shah, what about the problem that one of the amici brought up concerning dredged material?  Said that if we just say Miccosukee applies, then when there's a dredging operation and the material is redeposited back into the same water, then that would also -- there would be no responsibility based on that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Shah, am I right about that this other theory, if it were open to the Ninth Circuit, would apply equally to the other rivers that Justice Breyer mentioned, and those were out of the case because when it got to the Ninth Circuit we were talking about only the Los Angeles and the San Gabriel?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That -- that other theory would apply to all four.   ",11-460X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But how do -- the district is a big contributor, but there are other contributors.  So, on your theory, how do we determine what is the share that the district would be liable for?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, wouldn't you still -- I'm not clear if you gave me an answer to how the district share would be determined.  It is not the only polluter.  Are you saying each permittee is responsible for the whole?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So how do we find out what is its part -- what is its share?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why was it giving up -- you're giving up on the two rivers even though your theory would work the same way with respect to them?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But do you think that the trial court was wrong, the district court was wrong, and the Ninth Circuit, both times, when they said, well, you didn't prove -- there was no proof that the district was responsible for a given part.  So, on your theory, both the district court and the Ninth Circuit were wrong on that?   ",11-460X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Brenan, we are straying pretty far from this case.  And correct me if I'm wrong, but, as I understand it, the argument was made under State law, and then Williams said there was an abuse of discretion under State law and therefore the Sixth Amendment was violated.  So there really isn't any independent -- Williams hasn't stated any independent Sixth Amendment right.  It's State law was violated and therefore the Constitution was violated.  So it seems to me if we just look at the position that Williams was taking, that these two, the State and the Federal claim, are tied -- tied together.  And we don't -- to go beyond this case and imagine some other case that might come before us some day would not be wise.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I ask you about the underlying claim here?  It is quite troublesome.  I think this is a state that doesn't allow an Allen charge; is that right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the possibility of getting rid of the juror, the hold-out juror, in this way is -- is really troublesome.  The judge can't give an Allen charge to urge the jury to deliberate further, but can say -- now, the judge knows who the hold-out is, and to just dismiss that juror, it is -- it is very troublesome.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Ortiz, why isn't the question that you're presenting academic in this case?  Because didn't the district judge say that there had been no showing that Davis' conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive?  It wouldn't matter if the supervisor -- if the conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive harassment, and, equally, if the company responded every time a complaint was lodged.  The district court found both of those things, that it wasn't severe and pervasive, and that every time she complained an investigation was made.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What other than the job description?  The job description says that the catering specialist has authority to direct or lead the part-time employees.  But what concrete instances of Davis exercising supervisory authority over Vance is there in this record?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What I mean is not the statement, well, she's a supervisor.

We don't have anything like that in this record.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that was also -- that would be for a very confined period.  It would only be when the -- when Vance was a part-time employee.  Once she is a full-time employee there isn't that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Ortiz, did she ever have that authority, because the record as far as we have it says that the work assignment, what Vance was doing, came from the chef or from Kimes, and the most that Davis did was transmit the chef's orders of where people would be stationed.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Have you answered the argument it shouldn't get any deference because what -- what the EEOC guidance does is it is -- it is interpreting two decisions of this Court, and this Court, not the EEOC, is in the best position to determine what those two cases mean?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought in Faragher it was that -- that the lifeguard gave her her daily work assignments.  He controlled what she would do on the job.   Sri Srinivasan  He -- he controlled every aspect of her -- of her day's work, and cleaning the toilets was one aspect of it.

The burden is on the defendant to show those two things to get out from under the main statute.

And it was the question of -- the penalty was four times the value of the goods, and this Court said the judge, not the jury, is responsible for imposing the fine and therefore also for determining the value of the goods.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the amount of loss issue that Justice Breyer raised with -- very complicated to determine what the amount of the loss is.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If -- if -- on the question of the value of goods or the amount of the loss, what would the standard be?  Would the jury have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that it is -- the value was such-and-such?   ",11-94XX

If there was -- if there was not general jurisdiction over MBUSA, that would be the end of the case, wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you didn't -- we can't resolve it that way since you -- you didn't challenge the general jurisdiction over the subsidiary.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose -- but suppose we had a case of an accident on a California highway injuring California people and they sued charging that the Mercedes Benz was defectively manufactured.  Would there be jurisdiction over both the parent and the sub in that situation?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And what does that mean?  I mean, it certainly wanted to have its cars sold in -- in California.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, there was injury in the forum and it was caused by defective manufacturing abroad.  That's a typical basis for jurisdiction under long arm statutes.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it does -- it does provide for the exercise of jurisdiction to the limits of due process.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that was -- that was conceded.  But that was -- there is a very substantial argument that there was no general jurisdiction over the subsidiary, but that was not contested below.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And a party can always consent to jurisdiction.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, you don't -- you wouldn't have any doubt, would you, in the hypothetical that I pose.  A Mercedes Benz car causes an accident -- there's an accident in California.  It's alleged that the accident was the defective manufacturing of that car.  California people are injured.  There would be jurisdiction in a California court.   ",11-965X

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What was the year of that decision?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but the thinking about jurisdiction has changed enormously since then.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If there was ever an example of a corporation being at home in a particular place, it's Perkins against Benguet.  It was a Philippine company that was shut down entirely.  It was World War II.  To the extent the company was operating at all, it was in Ohio.  It was not able to operate in what otherwise would have been its home base.  So everything that the corporation was doing occurred in Ohio.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, but why should we -- now that the Federal claims are out -- I mean, when you started the suit you had a claim under the Alien Tort Statute, you had a claim under the Torture Victims Protection Act, but now those Federal claims are out and we are left with a claim under California law and Argentinian law.  Why should a Federal forum exercise supplemental jurisdiction over those claims once the Federal claims are out of the picture?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Wouldn't it be arbitrary for it to exercise personal jurisdiction when there is no Federal claim and the case involves foreign plaintiffs injured abroad, allegedly due to the activities of a subsidiary operating abroad?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but that test that you just -- the sufficiently purposeful availing, those are all specific jurisdiction questions.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And not general jurisdiction questions.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And Goodyear distinguished the two by saying general jurisdiction means it's equivalent to residence for an individual.  It's where you are at home.  And general jurisdiction was much broader in the days before long arm statutes.  But now that we have specific jurisdiction so you can sue where the event occurred, just as specific jurisdiction has expanded, so general jurisdiction has shrunk.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, any claim arising anyplace in the world.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if you go -- if you go back to the -- to the foundation case of International Shoe.  That case recognized that you can be an agent for one purpose, but not for another.  So the people -- the salesmen who were promoting the sales of shoes were the agents of International Shoe for the purpose of promoting the sale of shoes.  They were not an all-purpose agent for the purpose of, say, dealing -- real estate dealings on behalf of the corporation.  So you could have an agency for one purpose, selling cars in California, but totally unrelated to torturing people in Argentina.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What is the additional thing?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You did say in your brief that recognizing that other nations are highly critical of our expansive, one-time expansive, notion of doing business as a basis for general jurisdiction, you say that that shouldn't be taken into account as a basis for constitutional decisionmaking.  And yet what we are talking about is a notion of whether it's fair and reasonable to require a corporation to answer in a forum, and is what the other countries think unenlightening on what's fair and reasonable.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't that exactly what Goodyear held?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There would hardly be room for a decision next to Goodyear that says, oh, for general jurisdiction purposes it's enough that you have some subsidiary operating in the State.  The whole idea of Goodyear was to say there is one place you can always sue a corporation, one or two, place of incorporation, a principal place of business.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So -- if -- if you are uneasy about the covenant as it exists, why didn't you say, judge, this covenant doesn't give us adequate protection, it should be amended, and then say what you think you need to be adequately covered?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Dabney, that's a different answer than the one you gave me when I asked the same question.  You said, because we don't want to be an involuntary licensee of Nike.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But can you -- can you just explain to me, you've given a name to this carte blanche that -- that Nike would give you.  What is the significance of your being an involuntary licensee?  It's not something that you wear as a brand.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Then you're going back to saying the covenant -- no covenant is any good.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Dabney, suppose there had been no infringement claim, could you have -- but you're in the shoe business and you're worried, could you have brought a declaratory action or an action for an injunction to have the trademark declared invalid?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you say you could not have brought a suit to cancel?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But, Mr. Dabney, you told me you could not bring such an independent suit, you have to be stoned once.  So you can bring it as a counterclaim, as you did here, once there's an infringement suit, but you did say that you could not just walk into court and say, I want an injunction invalidating the trademark.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Anders, you did say, if I recall correctly, that Congress regarded the PTO as the preferred form for cancellation proceedings.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it's -- so it's a question of -- of deficiency in their pleading.  Suppose they amended that counterclaim and said, as soon as we are able, we want to do a counterfeit.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why?  I know you said that in your brief, but if you give it -- yes, if you -- if you say the -- the whole world can copy it.  But this covenant would give it to only one manufacturer.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So why would you abandon -- why would giving a covenant to Already amount to abandonment of your mark?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Goldstein, can you inform us of when this practice of the unilateral covenant in order to moot a -- a cancellation claim, when -- how long has it been around?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Goldstein, what about Federal Rule 41(a)(2)?  It says if the defendant has pleaded a counterclaim, and you have recognized that there was Article III jurisdiction over that counterclaim, the case may be dismissed on the plaintiff's request over the defendant's objection only if the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So on the face of it, it seems that that rule fits this case to a T; that is, the -- plaintiff wants the case withdrawn, defendant objects, and the question is can the counterclaim remain pending for independent adjudication.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May I interject just one thing that I would like you to clarify?  Justice Breyer started out by saying the standard comes from Friends of the Earth.  Do you agree?  Because, as I recall, your brief doesn't -- doesn't even cite Friends of the Earth.   ",11-982X

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Massey, you envision one proceeding, it could be a class action on behalf of the individuals, that doesn't require everybody tot satisfy the amount in controversy, and then this action by the Attorney General, which does, among other things, seek restitution.  Isn't there an overlap between those two claims, and how do we sort out -- you said -- at one point I think you described the restitution as “ disgorgement of ill gotten gains ”.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But now we have the consumers who were affected, they've already been paid.  So how does it work for the Attorney General's suit?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are there many actions of that nature where there are hundreds of people each with a claim of 75,000 or more?

So -- and after the disturbance occurs, it's too late.  So the State is trying to say, We want to make sure that the entrance is not blocked, and the only way we can do that is to have a rule that applies to everyone.  We can't -- we can't screen people to know who will be well behaved and who will be disruptive.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How much is -- how much is restricted?

And your position is that it can be an intra-session recess.  But if we look back historically, Congress met and they met continuously.  And then they went on horseback back home and they were away for 6 months, even 9 months.  Today, there's nothing like that.  The inter-session -- the inter-session recess could be -- could be an hour.  So what do we do with that?  There was the vision of a long recess running for months and today, the inter-session recess might be momentary.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it isn't -- it isn't tied then to the availability of the Congress, availability of the Senate.  I think you said throughout your brief that the rationale for the recess power is the President must be able to have the government functioning and staffed even though -- although the Senate isn't -- isn't around.  But now the -- you seem in your answers to be departing from the Senate not available and making quite another justification for this.  The Senate, I think to be candid, the Senate is always available.  They can be called back on very short notice.  So what is it that's the constitutional flaw here?  It isn't -- it isn't that the Senate isn't available.  The Senate is available.  It can easily be convened.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You do have -- you do have the one that you relied on in your brief, and this understanding goes back at least to 1823, and the -- the Wirt letter, Attorney General Wirt said, on the wording -- maybe on the wording, the case is not strong.  But the purpose, he said, you would be honoring the letter and defying the spirit.  That was the -- on the question of the -- when the vacancy--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Before you -- before you--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --The -- we sort of drifted away from the new -- the new practice, the pro forma session.  And you were asked, suppose there was nothing in the resolution about they would conduct no business.  It was an informal understanding that they wouldn't.  But there is no express agreement that they're not going to conduct business.  Then do you lose on that part of the case?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If there is a 3-day recess between sessions, then your argument is that -- that is a recess and the president can make -- can make appointments in that time.     Justice Ginsburg, that is a very interesting and somewhat difficult question.  On the facts of this case, there is a substantial question, which no one really has litigated, as to whether there was, in fact, an inter-session recess, whether the first session of the 112th Congress ended on the morning of January 3rd and therefore, we have the same Teddy Roosevelt situation, or whether by adjourning on December 30th and contemplating no further meetings until January 3rd, whether that in effect -- in effect was a sine die adjournment that ended the first session of the Congress.  If the president had the same view about the nature of the pro forma sessions, he could have taken the view about the sessions between December 17th and January 3rd and could have had a better legal argument in attempting to claim that between December 30th and January 3rd, there was at least an arguable inter-session recess.  And he did not do that.  Why didn't he?  Because by waiting until the convening of the first session -- of the second session of the 112th Congress, by making an appointment on January 4th instead of the morning of January 3rd, he gives an extra year to his appointees to serve.  That shows that this is, indeed, the bottom of the slippery slope on the Recess Appointments Clause.  It is a complete abuse of the process.  It is being used for no other purpose than to overcome the Senate opposition or the Senate disinclination to agree with the president's nominations.  What the Framers contemplated in coming up with a joint power of appointment was you have to act jointly.  You have to play nice.  And in a country of 300 million people, when the president wants a nominee and the Senate does not agree, it is always possible for the president to come up with another nominee who is even more qualified and acceptable to the Senate.  The key here is acceptable to the Senate.  He has to be able to proffer someone to the Senate that the Senate is willing to engage in a joint power of appointment for.   ",12-1281
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But your argument would destroy the recess clause.  There would be -- under your argument, it is totally -- totally within the hands of the Senate to abolish any and all recess appointments.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Suppose -- suppose we have an inter-session break.  It's three days.  On your reading of the Recess Clause, in that three days, the president can fill up vacancies.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, leave out this second question.  Just on -- on the first question, because it seems to me if the rationale was when Congress was out of town for 6, 9 months, of course, the president has to be able to make the government work.  But now you're saying that in that time, it's only three days, they are going to be there available very soon to confirm.  And let's say somebody -- somebody dies on day 1.  The president puts in -- makes an appointment on day 2.  You would say that's okay?   INTERRUPTING ",12-1281
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  On damages as well as injunctive relief?  I thought your brief said injunctive relief but not damages.   Nicole A. Saharsky  --Right.  We would distinguish between equitable relief and legal relief.  And that's because that distinction was well established in the courts of equity and in the courts of law and post merger at the time this Court enacted in 1957.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Saharsky, this -- before you sit down, there's one puzzle I'd like you to address for us, and that is your position is damages within the 3 years, okay.  Injunction, you can adjust for the laches.  In the patent area, also intellectual property, the Federal Circuit has said that laches may bar as it goes -- just the reverse, laches may bar monetary relief, but not injunctive relief.  What explains the difference between, in the patent area, no monetary relief, but yes, injunctive relief, and your position in the copyright area, monetary relief but no injunction or a modified injunction?   Nicole A. Saharsky  --You're right that there is that difference.  The Patent Act is different in several respects.  First of all in terms of the time period, it doesn't have a statute of limitations in which -- after which a claim is barred.  It says that you can only recover damages for a certain period of time.  There's actually a shorter period of limitation, or a shorter period of protection in the Patent Act, and you have the Patent Act time period that was enacted well before the copyright period here.  So we think that the patent context is different, but I take your point that the analysis that the Federal Circuit underwent is not the same type of analysis that we are undertaking now.  Ours is based on the background principle on which Congress acted, as opposed to that analysis, which was more on policy grounds.  Thank you.   ",12-1315
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Perry, you said that the objective is to get the copyright holder to sue early on and not to wait, but if no profits had been made in that early period and it would cost the plaintiff more to mount a lawsuit then the plaintiff could possibly receive in damages, why should the plaintiff, who has a copyright that's going to run a long, long time sue?  If things stay the same, no suit will ever be brought.  Why is it unreasonable for the plaintiff to see if the copyright is worth anything?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why should it be different from the patent case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you think the Federal circuit's decisions are wrong?   ",12-1315
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Kellogg, suppose it goes to arbitration as you think it should, and the arbitrator says to the merchant, to prove your case, you have to show the relevant market, you have to show that American Express has market power, that it used that power to the detriment of its competitors, and the way these sections -- the way these kinds of cases have gone is to get an expert.  And I don't see that you can prove it in -- in a new way.  I mean, the whole point of this is that the expense to win one of these cases is enormous.  And no single person is worth that person's while.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What was the -- what was the -- I missed that.  The sharing of the costs, how does that work?  It's certainly not in the agreement, not in the arbitration agreement, that -- that American Express is going to pay for the expert for the other side.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Oh.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And then what you would you have, five, six different arbitrations going, and in each of those five or six cases, you would have -- they could share?  They could share the million dollar cost of this -- the experts?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I -- I'm sorry, but I don't think I got the answer to my question.  The -- the arbitrator has now said we have to have an expert, and the plaintiff says -- or the complainant says, I haven't got the wherewithal, and if I have six friends who bring individual arbitrations, that's not nearly enough.  So what happens then, the case ends, and it's not possible--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I thought the only thing that the court of appeals said is, you have to pay 300,000 minimum for the expert, the most you can get in treble damages is 5,000.  It didn't go into all the other things that you were saying.  It said nobody in his right mind will bring such a lawsuit to pay $300,000 to get $5,000.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In the AT&T Mobility case, the Court remarked that this was a -- that the arbitration agreement had certain provisions that made it easier for the consumer to use the arbitral forum.  Is there anything like that in this arbitration clause?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, where not some other consumer in another arbitration, not that sharing of the costs, but wasn't AT&T Mobility going to pick up a good part of the tab of the cost of the arbitration?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did -- did American Express say, as Justice Breyer suggested, that, well, we will concede A, B, and C, so the only issue on which you need proof is D?  As I understood it, American Express never took the position that it would -- it would concede certain issues so that you could limit the proof.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  No, I'm not talking about--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --I'm not talking about pooling with other single merchants bringing single arbitrations.  I'm asking whether American Express -- so here's the complaint.  It says, I have to prove relevant lawsuits separately.  And did American Express take the position, no, you don't have to prove all that.  I think that's what Justice Breyer was suggesting.  There's only one thing that's really in controversy and the rest we could stipulate.  But I didn't see anything in all the time this case has been in the courts on American Express's part to that say that we are not going to demand the full breadth of proof.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It was because -- it was because Judge Pooler said:  ""I have been instructed by the Supreme Court that I may not require class arbitration. ""  That's -- and she was bound by our decision that a court can't order class arbitration; isn't that correct?  So that was not an option for her.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The Second Circuit never said anything about, this is what it would cost in court.  The court -- the Court of Appeals said, this is what it would cost to prove this kind of tying, right?  It didn't say one word distinguishing what it would cost in litigation from what it would cost in arbitration.  It was simply what it was going to cost.   INTERRUPTING ",12-133X

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But -- about the parties never considering it, when this case was in the New Jersey courts, Oxford explained -- this is in the red brief at page 27 that's quoting Oxford's counsel then, that  ""the arbitrator has the power to ascertain whether the parties contemplated class arbitration in their agreements. ""  A power in the arbitrator that Oxford does not contest.  Does it -- that seems to be a recognition by Oxford that -- that class arbitration was contemplated.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there was no -- in Stolt-Nielsen, the parties stipulated that the contract said nothing on the issue of class proceeding.  In this case, we have no such stipulations--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --and the arbitrator is interpreting a term of the contract, the ordinary rule is that -- that the arbitration -- arbitrator's interpretation of a contract term, wrong or right, unless it's off the wall, is -- is not to be overturned.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It was a combination of the two provisions.  He said that everything that is excluded by the first provision is included in the second.  And he also said something, which may or may not be so.  He said that this particular way of describing the -- the -- what's arbitrable, this is an unusual wording.  We have -- there's no civil action in the first clause and then arbitration in the second.  He said that he had never seen this particular language.  Is he wrong in -- in saying that this language is unusual?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Was this -- was this a -- well, was this an experienced arbitrator?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, of course, this was -- this was an adhesion contract, so there's no -- it was drafted by Oxford.  And you made a point about betting the house, that the company wouldn't have agreed to it.  But on the side of the doctor, he has a $10,000 -- a $1,000 claim, and he is saying that without a class proceeding, there is -- there is essentially no means to enforce the contract against Oxford, that none of these parties, none of the, what was it, 13,000 doctors, none of them could enforce the contract because the expense would be much greater than the $1,000 they could get at the end.   ",12-135X
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that Oxford conceded that it did not preserve any question of entitlement to de novo review.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why don't you, Mr. Katz, why don't you concentrate on what the arbitrator himself said.  Mr. Waxman said this clause wasn't unusual but the arbitrator said, I've never seen anything like this.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is the -- is the contract authorized it as for Dr. Sutter, all of the others are similarly situated, they got the same contracts?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So either the contract means what the arbitrator said it meant or it doesn't.  If it means what the arbitrator said it meant, then everybody's bound.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And those -- and there are rules that governed that, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You would never have class action arbitration if that were so.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It would be impossible, because you could never get in advance -- they find out that by getting notice and then they decide whether they want to stay with it or opt out.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How long -- can we straighten out this 11 years?  How many years was this in the New Jersey court before there was ever an arbitrator appointed?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How many -- how -- what is the history of class actions and arbitrations?

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I have no problem with the description of what Congress had in mind, routine conduct that was prosecuted only as a misdemeanor.  But the -- the words that Congress used has, as an element, the use of physical force.  Under the Tennessee statute, as I understand it, you don't have to have physical force.  You have to cause bodily injury to another, which can be caused by a means other than physical force.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   ",12-1371

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But on you reading, it seems that one thing that Congress really wanted to cover, it didn't; that is, the -- the defendant has brutally beaten the mother of his child.  But under the Tennessee statute, you would say that that doesn't qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So that means that on your interpretation, we leave out the one thing that we know Congress wanted to cover.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Goldstein, you have given us three parts for an opinion.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is it your position essentially that under this bilateral agreement, the case is to be decided by an arbitrator, not by a court in Argentina or the United States?  So the question is when an arbitrator will decide the case.  And so the question of when doesn't say whether it's an agreement or not.  It just says, did you sue too early, you started too early?  Is that your essential position, that this bilateral agreement says arbitration is the way this dispute gets decided, and everything on the way to that is what you call a preliminary question, but essentially the parties have agreed that their disputes will be resolved by arbitration?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't that the same thing in France, which is supposed to be a popular place for international arbitration, that in the first instance the arbitrator decides, but ultimately the court can review everything?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How do we know that?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And if it is resolved, but not to BG's liking then, thereto, BG can invoke arbitration.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I don't get your answer to my question.  Am I wrong in thinking that under this treaty, the ultimate decisionmaker is the arbitrator.  There is no provision for the court to be the ultimate arbiter of the controversy?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's the D.C.

That will be the method of dispute resolution.  You have to take certain steps before.  So, you have to go to the local court.  But why isn't the dispute settlement mechanism decided upon by the parties' arbitration, and then what you have to do before that is in the nature of a procedural condition?

But the defendant doesn't know about Rule 11 and doesn't know about 11(c) that says a judge is not supposed to participate in plea bargaining, and his lawyer doesn't tell him the judge is doing something wrong because his lawyer wants him to plea.  So he lacks the information necessary to make a prompt objection.

One is it's a different judge, and two is we have the interval of some three months in between.  And then we have a plea hearing that looks to me like it's exemplary.  The district judge did go through everything that Rule 11 calls for.  So it is a different case, isn't it, when we have a plea hearing with a judge who is exerting no pressure at all, has nothing to do with encouraging the defendant to plead, but there was an earlier episode where a magistrate judge did overbear?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But -- but the -- but the judge did ask, do you recognize that your -- your conduct satisfied the elements of the conspiracy?  And the defendant answered yes.

So you would get what is the equivalent of a use patent, which is a patent that we would think under our patent laws is acceptable, too.  If you -- just as with the question that Justice Alito asked earlier about identifying a -- a useful substance in a plant in the Amazon, if you isolate that and it proves to have therapeutic effects, you can get a patent on that use of it, but what you can't do is get a patent on the substance itself so that no one else can explore it for different uses and for -- and for different therapeutic purposes or to try to recombine it and turn it into a -- an even more therapeutic -- therapeutically valuable substance.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Ms. Murphy, on the “ everyone else ”, can you give us an idea of whose expression is at stake?  I mean, most people couldn't come even near the limit.  So what percentage -- is there any information on what percentage of all contributors are able to contribute over the aggregate?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Burchfield, I'd like you to address this question about the restriction on speech.  It has been argued that these limits promote expression, promote democratic participation, because what they require the candidate to do is, instead of concentrating fundraising on the super-affluent, the candidate would then have to try to raise money more broadly in the electorate.  So that by having these limits you are promoting democratic participation, then the little people will count some, and you won't have the super-affluent as the speakers that will control the elections.     Your Honor, I disagree with that, for this reason.  First of all, this limit, the aggregate limit on political parties, places like-minded political parties in the position of competing against each other rather than collaborating against each other.  All the national political parties on the Republican side and the State political parties compete against each other for an artificially limited pool of money from each contributor.  The same is true on the candidate side.  They compete against each other for the same artificially limited pool of money, even though each individual contribution to the candidate or to the party is limited by the base limits.  The Federal Election Commission regulations -- and Justice Breyer, I would -- I would propose that you look at Section 110.1(h), which specifically -- which specifically prohibits a PAC of the nature you describe.  If a person contributes to a PAC with knowledge his contribution is going to a particular candidate, that is an earmark under the -- under the precedents of the Federal Election Commission.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Has it worked out that way in practice?  Has it worked out?  Because there was one brief at least saying no, that -- that that's wrong.  In fact, it's the challengers who are aided.     Well, Your Honor, I think it is -- it is -- there's a hard cap on the number any contributor can give to all candidates, and a separate cap on the amount that contributor can give to all party committees.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But he can -- he can write checks to everyone that he wants to write checks to.  It's just he can't give his special number of 1776.     If -- if he wanted to give a contribution to every candidate running for a Federal congressional seat, congressional and Senate, he would be limited to $86 or some number like that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In his own case, it would be something over $1,000, right?  Because he identified 12 more candidates that he'd like to give 1776 to.  But he could give each of them over $1,000.     Your Honor, he could.  But again, you're -- you're diminishing his right to associate and the intensity of his association by applying this aggregate limit.   ",12-536X

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's the point that the Chief made about what this does is limit particularly on the national strategy.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Using the language of the statute that you just quoted, can you explain to us what is the adjustment of the partnership item?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Goldstein, can I take you back to the origins of all of this?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The main move for personal jurisdiction traditionally is the plaintiff must go to where the defendant is, no matter how inconvenient that is for the plaintiff.  Jurisdiction is defendant-centered.  You're trying to hold a defendant, you have to go where he is.  Then the long arm age comes about, and we have specific jurisdiction, which, by the way, is what you're urging.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You're still not saying they have all-purpose jurisdiction over Walden.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And this Court, as the McEntyre decision indicates, has been pretty careful about specific jurisdiction.  And Miguel wasn't enough that machine blew up or cut somebody's fingers in New Jersey.  They had to purposely avail themselves of wherever the -- the standard words are.  And here you're asking for -- really pushing this specific jurisdiction to the limit.  The defendant has acted only in Georgia.  He hasn't set foot outside the State.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you are asking the Court to decide a big ticket item, personal jurisdiction, and the theory that you are proposing would apply not to, just to Officer Walden, but it would be about as far out as any specific jurisdiction case I know.  So the Court shouldn't say, well, jurisdiction okay; venue, okay, but consider it transferring it to Georgia.  That seems to me wild.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  General -- general--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But he -- the Defendant would have to introduce the issue of his mental state either by his own testimony or an expert, but there's an oddity about this case.  Do I understand correctly, General Schmidt, that if there had never been a Federal proceeding, if this case had proceeded from start to finish in the Kansas courts, there would have been no Welner evidence, there would have been no prosecution expert, because it wouldn't have been allowed under Kansas's own rules?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This -- this case was voluntary intoxication and -- and under Kansas procedure, the -- the prosecution could not have called a witness absent insanity or a mental disease; is that right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  One issue is whether the expert, the government's expert, went beyond the scope of the direct, the experts for the defendant.  That's an open -- that would be an open issue because I think Rule -- the Federal Rule 12.2 is very clear that the rebuttal testimony cannot exceed the scope of the defense expert's testimony.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Isn't that an academic question in this case?  After all, this expert for the government came in when the case was in the Federal system.  The Federal system has a rule that when the defense puts on an expert, the government can counter it.  So the -- the limit would be -- I mean, Kansas doesn't provide for this?  The Federal Rules provide for it in a very limited way.  So to talk about using it beyond the scope of the Federal rule seems to me not the case that's before us.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are you suggesting that the government can answer in -- in a like manner as the defendant?  The defendant opens the door by experts, then the government can call experts.  That is not to say that a defendant simply offers his own testimony, the government can do something that -- that the defense has not opened the door to.   ",12-609X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Katyal, if this had played out entirely in the Federal court, the examination of the Defendant was pursuant to Federal Rule 12.2.  Your argument seems to be that Rule 12.2 violates the Fifth Amendment.  I mean, the mental examination was ordered in the Federal court after the defendant said: I am going to put on a couple of witnesses, expert witnesses, to testify to my mental state.  Rule 12.2 says when a defendant does that then the government has the right to have the defendant examined by its expert.  So the broad argument that you're making seems to lead inevitably to the conclusion that Rule 12.2 is unconstitutional.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But this--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But the scope question wasn't decided by the Kansas court, and they wouldn't get to it unless they held that, yes, you can have this rebuttal testimony.  Then the next question is, if you can have it, how far it can go?  But the anterior question, can you have it at all, is the question the Kansas Supreme Court answered no, you cannot have it.  And we can't send it back to them without -- I mean if -- if you can't have it at all, then it's irrelevant that the scope was too broad.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Katyal, would you -- you said, in answer to my question, that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12.2 violates the Fifth Amendment in small part.  Can you be explicit?  The rule, as I understand it, says if the defendant is going to introduce evidence concerning his mental state, then the government has a right to have the government's expert examine the defendant and rebut what the defendant's experts say.  That's what the rule is.  And then it says you can't go beyond the scope of that issue, of the mental state.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You think it's unconstitutional to say to the defendant, you have a choice; if you introduce this testimony, then the government can follow where you have led; if you don't introduce the testimony, then of course the government has nothing to rebut.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It says  ""on which the defendant has introduced evidence. ""  ""The evidence is the defendant's expert. ""   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Katyal, if that's your position, then you must disagree with the D.C. circuit decision which was already mentioned, United States against Byers, which took the position that where the defendant leads, the government may follow.  For the very reason that the defense expert has access to the defendant, you can't disarm the government by saying, we're not going to let you have a counter-expert.  All you can do is cross-examine the defendant's expert.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I didn't know that it was policy.  I thought it was -- it was saying it is just like the defendant gets on the stand; he's subject to cross-examination.  The defendant puts on experts; the government must be treated equally, must be able to put on its own experts.  And as far as waiver, that's a fiction, isn't it?  The defendant could say 100 times I'm going to testify, but I'm not waiving my Fifth Amendment privilege.  It wouldn't matter if he said that 100 times.  He will be exposed to cross-examination.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Katyal, you have conceded, I think, in response to Justice Alito's question that the rules could be changed to say, Defendant, you cannot put on these experts.  So how does that maybe help defendants who want to put on a defense of mental state?  You can't put it on unless the government can put it on.  That's the current rule, but you're saying the response to it can be this evidence is shut out entirely.  The government -- the government will have nothing to answer if the Defendant doesn't put on experts.  I'm not so sure that would be a rule that defense counsel would put on.   ",12-609X

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This is a change -- your position is -- is a change, at least in the position that the Government took in -- in the Seventh Circuit case that started all this.  The Government confessed error.  The Government said the district judge should have used the guidelines that were in effect at the time the offense was committed, and the Government came to the Seventh Circuit and confessed error.  So there was not even an argument until the Seventh Circuit and Judge Posner wrote the opinion that included all the hypotheticals that -- that were aired earlier about the victim impact statement and all of those are in that opinion.  So it was only after -- after the Seventh Circuit opinion that the Government changed its position.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The guidelines range gets a presumption of reasonableness at the appellate level.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you disagree with -- getting back to what this case is about, the D.C. Circuit, in opposition to the Seventh Circuit said:  ""It is enough that using the new guideline created a substantial risk that the defendant's sentence was more severe that it would have been if the guidelines in effect at the time of the crime were used. ""  And it said,  ""There is no doubt that this case fits that description. ""  ""There was quite a substantial risk that the elevated guidelines would result in a more severe sentence. ""   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  He's saying that -- the question is which guidelines in this case?  And he's saying it's the guidelines in effect at the time he committed the crime.  We are not dealing with other -- I mean, it's quite a simple choice.  Is it -- does the court start with the guidelines in effect at the time the crime was committed or does it start with the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Now, we know that this district judge, he didn't want to get into any philosophical things about what was better or what was worse.  He said, I want to follow the guidelines.  So the question for him was only which guideline.  He got his answer from the Seventh Circuit.  They said the guidelines at the time of sentencing.  A judge in the D.C. District Court will get the other answer, the guidelines in effect at the time the crime was committed.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's not -- it's not a question of whether the judge thought that the one guideline was better than the other.  He specifically said he wasn't interested in that question.  The question was which guideline does he follow.  What does he start with?  And you recognize that you do start with the guidelines.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the district court was following orders.  He was following the Seventh Circuit.  The Seventh Circuit had said: You start with the higher guidelines.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Was Judge Randolph wrong when he said, quoting the sentencing commission, that within-guidelines range, even after Booker, is the standard?  Indeed, the actual impact of Booker on sentencing has been minor, and for that minor, he cites the sentencing commission.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Bursch, can I ask you to go back to the very first thing you said, because I didn't get your -- your point.  The question: What impact has the termination of affirmative action had on Michigan, on the enrollment of minorities in the University of Michigan?  Do we have any clear picture of that, what effect the repeal of affirmative action has had?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Bursch, isn't--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --isn't the position that was taken in Seattle derived from a different view of the Equal Protection Clause?  I mean, strict scrutiny was originally put forward as a protection for minorities -- a protection for minorities against hostile disadvantageous legislation.  And so the view then was we use strict scrutiny when the majority is disadvantaging the minority.  So you do, under the Carolene Products view, you do focus on race and you ask, is the minority being disadvantaged?  If that were the view, then I suppose we would not be looking at this, well, the criterion is race and wherever the disadvantage falls, whether a majority or minority, it's just the same.  That wasn't the original idea of when strict scrutiny is appropriate.  So if we were faithful to that notion, that it is -- measures a disadvantage the -- the minority that get strict scrutiny.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You said that the district court found it was clear that there was no -- there was no discriminatory intent, but that wasn't reviewed on appeal.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You quoted -- you quoted from Crawford.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And there is an opposing quote in Seattle itself on page, what is it, 486?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  ""When the State's allocation of power places unusual burdens on the ability of racial groups to enact legislation designed to overcome the special condition of prejudice, the governmental action seriously curtails the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied on to protect minorities. ""  And it quotes Carolene Products.  So -- and then the following sentence is:  ""In the most direct sense, this implicates the judiciary's special role, not of treating the individuals as individuals, but the judiciary's special role in safeguarding the interests of those groups that are relegated to a position of political powerlessness.

I think we -- if the Court were to decide that issue, we think it probably should order further briefing.  But I would say three things about it, which I think are relevant both to why we think the Court shouldn't decide the issue in this case and relevant to our view of the merits.  The first is that, as we've been discussing, the 271(a) issue, I think, raises a very different legal question than the 271(b) issue.  271(a) turns on what the -- the content and application of well-established tort doctrines.  I think there's substantial disagreement about what the content of those doctrines are and how they would apply here, which would, I think, need to be decided by looking at treaties, state law, how these doctrines have been applied.  That relates to the second point, which I think is that these tort doctrines, properly applied, we don't think apply easily to the vendor-customer situation.  There is no agreement to circumvent the patent.  There's no common pecuniary interest of the sort that courts have looked for when they've looked at joint enterprise cases or conspiracy cases.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, Mr. Regan, aside from the position of the United States, which -- which has changed, you made that point, the determination that's being made at this stage is really one of venue.  It's where the main bout will be fought out.  And so we don't want that to linger for a long time.  We want that decision to be made with dispatch.  And as one of the amici brief informs us, many of these what you call kidnappers happen to be badly abused women and if you -- if they had to go under Article 13, then they would have this full-blown, was he really the abuser?  Doing it without equitable tolling, that question is reserved for the main -- for the main bout.

Certainly, if you just read the words of the Lanham Act, this is allegedly false advertising, and the false advertiser shall be liable to any person who believes he or she is likely to be damaged by such an act.  That legislation seems to envision a very broad standing, certainly enough to encompass the person who is -- whose product is being disparaged.

It may be that it should not apply in this case because the parties have consented to something else, but it's not a wrong venue.  I mean, suppose the question had never come up.  The -- there wasn't a claim that this was a wrong venue.  The -- the case could have proceeded, and it would have been a place of proper venue, right?

Both 1404(a) and 1406 provide for transfer.  This Court has emphasized that it's one Federal system, and within the Federal system, the result shouldn't be dismissed, bring the case all over again, pay a new filing fee; instead of that, just transfer to the appropriate forum.

If it's an affirmative defense, you have to raise it or you lose it.  You can't hold back an affirmative defense, and in the middle of the trial say: Oh, there's an affirmative defense here.  (8)(c) requires you to state it.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That would be taken care of simply by saying Van Dusen v. Barrack does not apply when a party is acting in violation of a contractual provision.  Van Dusen against Barrack was intended to give the plaintiff plaintiff's choice of initial forum.  If plaintiff chooses a forum in violation of the contract, there's no reason why Van Dusen should apply.   ",12-929X

Would that be any law other than Austria?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And I'm -- I'm asking you.  Never mind what the California court said. We have an accident in Austria, and it's based on -- the allegation is the boarding protocol was negligently designed, or the platform, the space between the train and the platform, negligently designed. What law would govern whether that platform was negligently designed, whether the boarding protocol, operating protocol was negligent?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that -- and that works, even though it's an adhesion contract, and it's small print --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, suppose -- suppose the Court simply said, buying a ticket from an agent in the United States is not enough, period.  We don't adopt any gravamen.  The question is, what does based-on mean. And the Court could say based-on is not based-on if all that happened in the United States is the purchase of the ticket.  We don't have to buy any gravamen or anything else.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What makes it commercial is it's a railroad doing the same thing a private railroad would do.

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is the -- is the word “ jurisdiction ” used?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's the Court.  Congress did not say jurisdiction.  And I -- I'm sure you are well aware that this Court, for some time now, has been explaining that “ jurisdiction ” is a word of many meanings, too many meanings, and has tried to distinguish jurisdiction, meaning subject matter or personal, from the rules, once a case fits jurisdiction, how it will be processed in the Court.  And it seems to me a time limitation, even a very stringent time limitation, is not jurisdictional.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But not the Tort Claims Act.  The Tucker Act, I think the -- the line that the Court drew, it said if we characterize these as jurisdictional in a prior case, we will stick with that.  But in the future, we're not doing that anymore.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What was different about 1972?  They were pre-Irwin.  So why wouldn't 19 -- a 1972 statute, the extension of Title VII to federal employees, why wouldn't that fall under the old regime instead of the fresh look that Irwin took of it in 1990 as applied to a 1972 statute?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Tucker Act doesn't have to the same extent, in the same manner and to the same extent as with respect to a private party.  That's new in the Tort Claims Act.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought Soriano was -- was a Tucker Act case.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if the sovereign immunity is what drives it, then the presumption would be overcome in every case against the government because government--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But, Mr. Martinez, what you said, it's as though the choice were statute of limitations or nothing.  To get equitable tolling, it's a pretty tough case.  In order to get equitable tolling, you must have a truly exceptional case, maybe the case that we're now -- that's now before us is such a case.  But it is not easy to get equitable tolling.  You have to be especially deserving.  So isn't that the answer to it?  Ordinarily, the statute of limitations will govern, but if there are equitable reasons, then there can be an exception.  But those reasons have to be very strong.   ",13-1074
1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Schnapper, what do you do with what I take to be the government's main argument?  They said here are these two statutes waiving the government's sovereign immunity.  The Tucker Act, no equitable tolling.  Tort Claims Act comes later, it uses a lot of the same language, it has the same object, so the Tort Claims Act should be interpreted in harmony with the Tucker Act.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Schnapper, I think we're getting off the track that Justice Breyer put us on, and I think you agreed with him, that there's no evidence that Congress ever thought anything about what was going to happen in a case like Ms. Wong.  They -- they enacted a statute, and it had a statute of limitations, a firm statute of limitations, but there's no indication that Congress thought about jurisdiction.  We all -- all that jurisdiction stuff comes from decisions of this Court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Schnapper -- Mr. Schnapper, I think that I heard a disagreement between you and Justice Scalia on how close the words were, and you said, yes, there are some phrases in common, but there are big differences, too, in the wording of the Tort Claims Act.  So you can pick out some words and say, yes, Congress adopted that language, but in other parts it didn't take the Tucker Act as the model used different language.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The government answered -- you're saying the difference is the district court has all kinds of equitable authority, claims court didn't.  But the government answered that argument and said there's a difference between equitable doctrines, which the claims court followed, it's just that the claims court can't give equitable remedies like injunction.  So the government's answer is isn't that divide, that equity is part of the jurisprudence of the claims court?   INTERRUPTING ",13-1074

This complaint is out.  It's a final judgment.  It's not appropriate for Rule 54 because Rule 54(b) is when one claim is done, but other claims are still pending.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There's one huge difference.  The district judge can say no to 54(b) if it's a final judgment.  In this -- in this very case, that's exactly what the judge said.  In the first round, he said, you have an appeal of right, and -- she said to the plaintiff who was dismissed.  And then when the Second Circuit said no, she refused to give a 54(b).   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I don't think this court of appeals said as a matter of its discretion, and that was one thing that puzzled me about your presentation.  The court of appeals said we have no jurisdiction.  That's quite different from saying we have discretion.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They said we had no jurisdiction.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Not any--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --Well, that's because the parties, either they get dismissed pretrial, or they settle, or the parties agree that the transferee court can be the trial court.  But at no -- no one in a multidistrict litigation can be forced into going before the transferee court for trial.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  She thought that she needed to the to do the 54(b) for the other cases that had more than one claim, not just the antitrust claim.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Waxman, the Second Circuit didn't think that there was a problem because the -- a judgment hadn't been entered.  They said in all of these cases when a consolidated or pretrial, there is no right of appeal, you have to get permission under rule 54(b).  They did not say anything about the problem in this case is that there was no judgment document.  And isn't there, I know that there -- there is a provision that says, if the judgment -- if for some reason you don't have the piece of paper, that's not fatal.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are you telling me that the Second Circuit doesn't have that rule if there is a piece of paper that says judgment on it?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, 1292(b) can't be applicable here.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  1292(b) is when you don't have a final judgment.  It's an interlocutory appeal, the typical case for 1292(b) is the court decides liability, but it hasn't decided damages yet.  You can't run upstairs at that point unless you get a 1292(b) order.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it's a different reason.  She said in the Gelboim case you have no antitrust injury.  In other words, you have no standing, out the door.  And you say the other cases are different from that.  Is -- they don't center on antitrust injury?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if the district judge had been right the first time, she said I have a claim that's totally been dismissed, it's out, then there are these other people that have antitrust claims and other claims, so what I'm going to do is this, final judgment for the one that has no other claims, 54(b) on the antitrust claims for the others so that the Second Circuit will then hear antitrust standing all at once.

You are saying it's the scope of -- the scope of the old and the new, and you can't use tacking to expand what the old would have meant.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if the answer to that is that of course you can't; if you are saying that the old one was the first use, then whatever the scope of the old one is, is it, and you can't add to it because of what you did later.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, why -- wait.  Explain why I was wrong in saying all they have to know is what was the scope of the original mark, the one that counts?  The later change can't expand what was the original.  So that seems to answer what you say -- you seem to say, this same continuing commercial, that's not it.

It seems to me that you were quite right to say before that this is most capable of repetition.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you think this is a matter of standing or ripeness?  The Sixth Circuit said ripeness.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that was a very special situation.  In Golden they were going out after a particular candidate.  It was not -- it was not a political view that an organization is taking, and they are not targeting this particular candidate, but they are targeting that issue, any candidate who supports that issue.     Well, with respect, Your Honor, in Golden the plaintiff clearly indicated that he was targeting that congressman because of the congressman's votes on -- for a particular care package.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But didn't the Court say that there wasn't -- once that congressman wasn't going to run for office any more, there was no suggestion that they wanted to talk about somebody else.     So he did have suggestions that he wanted to engage in substantially similar leafletting in the future, and the Court found them too speculative because he had only identified that one congressman.  And so I think that's significant because I think by analogy that would suggest that the only single forward-looking allegations in SBA List's complaint at JA-122 are that it plans to engage in substantially similar activity in the future, but they don't identify any other candidates, just like they didn't identify any other candidates in Golden, just like they didn't identify any candidates in the Renne decision, which was part of the reason why the Court found the decision -- that case right there.

Those, as I take your argument, all of those laws -- and there are more than half a dozen -- were unnecessary.  Once RFRA was on the books, Congress didn't have to do that any more.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Clement, this -- this was a law that was passed overwhelmingly, both houses of Congress.  People from all sides of the political spectrum voted for it.  It seems strange that there would have been that tremendous uniformity if it means what you said it means, to take -- to cover profit corporations, especially in light of -- there was an effort to adopt a conscience amendment, a specific conscience amendment in 2012, and the Senate rejected that.  That -- that amendment would have enabled secular employers and insurance providers to deny coverage on the basis of religious beliefs or moral convictions.

The question is: Does the domicile have to give a credit because somebody else is also taxing it?  Do you stop having the power to tax worldwide income because other States may tax on a different basis?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about we're dealing with an individual because it's a Chapter S corporation, but what about a corporation that is domiciled in Maryland?  I think Maryland, like all states, uses an apportionment formula for both domestic and foreign corporations.   INTERRUPTING ",13-485X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Perella, suppose we had a Maryland resident and all that resident's income is earned out of State.  And each of the States where the income is earned tax at or above the Maryland rate.  That would mean, I suppose, that the Maryland resident owes nothing to Maryland because he could take a credit for all what he's leaving the residents without anything, without a penny from this resident who may have five children that he sends to school in Maryland.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, Maryland does--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --But you recognize that there are jurisdictions, local jurisdictions, that impose a tax and don't give a credit?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Just like this one.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But before you said there were zero.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, Maryland does allow the credit against the State income tax.  It's just the county tax.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.  But they -- the lion's share of it would be this State part, not the county part.  And on that, Maryland does give a credit.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  A resident -- you're not disputing the proposition that the State of residence can tax worldwide income, can impose an income tax on its residents worldwide, wherever they earn it.  You're not questioning that proposition.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, as a matter of what?  Would you question it as a matter of a dormant Commerce Clause, that the State of residence can tax worldwide income?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, then what you're saying is they don't have the power to tax worldwide income--   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --if another State has a tax based on source.  So, going in proposition, they can tax worldwide income, is subject to what other States do, and if other States have a tax, then the resident's State has to recede.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You talked about what this Court has been doing for I don't know how many years.  Have we ever had a case under the Dormant Commerce Clause where a resident is complaining, an insider is complaining.  The Dormant Commerce Clause cases involved outsiders who are saying, this State where I don't vote is imposing something arbitrary on me.  Here we have an-in-state person complaining under the Dormant Commerce Clause that its State is discriminating against it.  Is there any other State where -- case where it's an insider complaining--   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  --rather than an outsider?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that the whole rationale behind this is we don't want to invade the jury province with information about what went on in the jury room.  And that's a pretty old rule.  And some people might think it makes no sense.  You can have an eavesdropper, and that's okay, but you can't have a juror itself.  So this, what's involved here is a juror reporting what she heard during the deliberations.  And it seems to me that's exactly the kind of thing that is not permitted.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it's too easy to convert anything that occurs into the jury room as reflecting on the voir dire.  So the judge instructs the jury.  Can you follow my instructions?  Oh, yes, I can follow my instructions.  In the jury room, that juror says: Oh, come on, let's just average it all up and go home.  Didn't -- didn't follow instructions.  On your theory that could come in, because it goes to dishonesty at the voir dire stage.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, perhaps if you prevail.  Why not?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But what is the strong evidence of intentional dishonesty in this case?  The woman says: I can judge this case fairly, I can award damages.  And one of the other things that the judge instructs the jury: You can take account of your own life experience.  What is so blatant about that?  How do we infer that she intended to be dishonest at the time of the voir dire?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you're taking a case that had nothing to do with a juror testifying about what -- what -- the deliberations in the jury room.  I think you're using the case for much more than it's worth, much more than the opinion writer put into it.  It just didn't present the question of what about a juror testifying about the deliberations in the jury room.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That was leaving out the conspicuous difference, there was no jury verdict impugned in the contempt case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can you explain the manner in which the jury reached its verdict?

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Maybe -- maybe because it thought there wouldn't be any controversy.  Maybe they thought the defendant thought the plaintiff would agree that the amount was over the jurisdictional order.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Do you pay any attention at all to the obvious purpose of the Class Action Fairness Act, which was to get cases out of the State courts and into the Federal courts?  Usually, we don't have that strong Federal policy of having the adjudication in the Federal court.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You said that you would argue that the amount in controversy was not satisfied and it seems to me that most plaintiffs who are bringing class actions are not going to be argued, oh, we can't prove $500,000.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there's a peculiar -- this State doesn't require the complaint to state the amount in controversy.  But if you were bringing this case in the Federal court in the first instance would you have said as plaintiff, the damages that we seek are under 5,000 -- 500,000?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If there's only one circuit then, I mean, that is so antithetical with the whole notion of the Federal rules that you don't plead evidence.  Plain statement doesn't include evidence and it is quite an extreme interpretation and counter to the whole thrust of the Federal rules, which you make a plain statement and then the evidence comes later.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But this is -- this is a provision for removal.  It tracks the language of Rule 8(a).  And so you're asking for -- oh, even though it copies Rule 8(a), which certainly doesn't require that you plead evidence, we do have to do it for notice of removal.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  If -- if the plaintiff wanted to challenge that, I could understand your position and then you would have the respective parties putting in their evidence.  But if the defendant makes an allegation amount in controversy is met and the plaintiff doesn't say no, doesn't say that we don't have the amount in controversy.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But when you bring a class action, you're looking for big bucks and the likelihood that it's going to be controverted, that the plaintiff who's brought a class action in the State court is going to say, oh, no, we can't -- we can't make the amount in controversy, that sounds very strange to me.  Most class action plaintiffs are not going to contest that their claim is worth at least $500,000.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, I don't follow that because ordinarily a plaintiff would state what the plaintiff's damages are.

It has to be, you say, fairly contemporaneous.  I don't see anything -- you -- you are inserting something into the statute that is not there.   Ann O'Connell Adams  The -- the primary reason why we're saying it has to come out at the same time is because otherwise it would frustrate the judicial review provision, where the applicant has 30 days under the statute to decide what action to take based on the denial.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But wouldn't it more sensible, then, to take a suggestion that has been made that we run the 30 days from when reasons are given, run 30 days from when the minutes are available?

It doesn't matter that town's council had good reasons for it, they weren't contemporaneous, that's the end of it.   Ann O'Connell Adams  I think one reason why, Justice Ginsburg, is because it's difficult to read the statute that way.  The 30 days runs from the final action of the local government, and the local government has to issue a decision in writing.  It would be difficult to say once you have a letter in hand that says, dear applicant, your application has been denied, that you don't have a written decision.  The applicant would be left to wonder whether reasons are coming at all, and if so, what those reasons are going to be.  And I think if you follow that to its logical conclusion, if -- if you didn't have reasons and didn't know if they were coming, I guess what you would do, then, is wait 150 days from the day you filed your application and then file a lawsuit saying, they didn't act on my application in a reasonable time, which seems not correct, given that they sent--   ",13-975X

And if we -- if Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private, to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why didn't it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it said --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But there's so many ways that you could -- if you want to make sure that this entity gets into Federal court all the time, what Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and removal purposes. Now, that is very clear.  It means it can come into Federal court to sue.  It means it can remove if it's sued in State court. This, compared to ""court of competent jurisdiction"" -- which, as I go back to competent jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and personal.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's because this Court's competence is general competence, which is subject matter, and it's specific competence, which is personal.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Carvin --   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Carvin, here's a -- you refer to the Medicaid example.  That's a familiar -- a grant-in-aid says to the State, here's the Federal money and here's the conditions, take it or leave it. That's one pattern.  But this pattern that we have says flexible State.  You can -- you can have your program if you want it, and if you don't, there's a fallback. There's the Federal program.  I mean, that's a typical pattern.  It's the pattern of the Clean Air Act.  You can have a State implementation plan, but State, if you don't get up your plan, there's a Federal implementation plan.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Clement, to take you down to the practical level, and we're not getting involved with war, take Nevada against Hall.  But Justice Kagan's point is, if California says that a Nevada truck coming on its California roads, injuring a California resident, so then Nevada is liable to the courts and the law of California, Nevada can say fine.  If a California truck comes into our State and injures Nevada people, we will do the same thing. That's what I think Justice Kagan had in mind.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that's what Hall said didn't exist.  Hall said the States, vis-à-vis each other, don't agree to respect the other's sovereign immunity.  Hall distinguished sovereign immunity where you are the king, where you are sovereign, a State's immunity.  And then said, but when another State is in the -- in the picture, equally sovereign, then both of them are sovereign, and neither has to respect the sovereign immunity of the other, that it's just -- well, when the -- when the nation was new, you will admit that there was no full faith and credit obligation.  If one State was going to respect the sovereignty of the other, it would be a matter of comity, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Okay.  So --   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So when did it change from comity to an obligation?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yeah.  The very concept of comity is a matter of grace, that's international law.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There is -- there is a certain irony, isn't there, that California is the State that gave us a Nevada against California, right? And California then was saying, oh, yes, we can sue the sovereign in Nevada in our courts if they come into our State and hurt our people.  It was California. So is California now saying they were wrong in the argument that they made?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, what do you --   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Clement, what do you do with -- I mean, one time we had -- had this issue, and the argument that you're making was -- was made in -- in Alden, and the Court spent over two pages distinguishing Nevada v.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What if --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Wouldn't the Fifth Circuit need to be -- I mean, the Fifth Circuit view was no equitable tolling, period.  The statute says 90 days.

We think this limitation period has no give, end of case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How do we make it clear to the Fifth Circuit? We say Fifth Circuit, you have jurisdiction.  They say fine.  We said before and we say again that this statute is not susceptible to equitable tolling and then we're right back where we are.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, it knew at the time it rendered its decision that the other circuits were taking a different position on whether the 90-day period was susceptible to extension.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, who was he --   William R. Peterson  -- Appeals.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  -- represented by at that stage? I mean, is -- this is a case involving ineffective assistance of counsel when he brought the -- at -- at what stage was there competent counsel?   William R. Peterson  Justice Ginsburg, my understanding is the Petitioner's current theory is that he was represented by competent counsel when he retained new counsel after the board's initial denial of his appeal.  That was October 10th, 19 days after the board's decision.  You'll see --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it's really -- you're taking a merits first.  You decide the merits and then we say, then there's no jurisdiction.  This is -- this is what -- whatever the rule is -- as you recognize, is a claim-processing rule.  You -- that rule needs to be interpreted whether it has any give. But it's -- it's -- there's jurisdiction to decide that question.  I think you agree that there is jurisdiction in the Fifth Circuit to decide whether or not this 90-day limit can be equitably tolled.   William R. Peterson  Your Honor, yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do agree the Fifth Circuit can decide that -- has decided it, and as a result of deciding that, did properly reach the judgement it reached in this case.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Wouldn't the --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They are saying --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  -- if the Fifth Circuit was right in saying we -- we -- so -- so we're going to give the Petitioner another chance, we'll consider it under sua sponte.  But the board said twice that its power to reopen on its own motion is not meant as a cure for filing defects or otherwise circumvent the regulation. So I think what they're saying is that if there's a -- if there's a flaw, if the 90 days -- if the 90 days is -- can't be stretched, then we shouldn't reach that same conclusion by saying, oh, but we can do this sua sponte. They -- they seem to be saying their exercise of the sua sponte authority is controlled by, do we have a rule that says 90 days and no more? If we do have such a rule, we shouldn't be exercising our authority sua sponte to get around that.  And that's -- that's in the Petitioner Appendix at both 5 and 9, when they say we shouldn't use our power to reopen on our own motion that way, to get around what is the rule.   William R. Peterson  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  We do think the Board of Immigration Appeals certainly uses its sua sponte authority to reopen sparingly and respectfully of the statutory deadlines.  As we see here, the problem is giving effect to a deadline that Congress set.  Congress certainly meant something when it required these motions to reopen to be filed within 90 days. And that means that the board's decision whether to reopen sua sponte, in order to exist alongside and not simply swallow that statutory deadline, needs to be in some way different in kind. And we think the way that it's different is that when the board is reopening sua sponte, when it's considering reopening on its own motion, that's a decision that is wholly in the board's discretion, and that is unreviewable in the courts under Heckler v. Chaney. And so when an alien properly invokes the statutory authority for reopening, the ability to reopen within the 90 days that we all agree under Kucana is reviewable, it's, of course, reviewable.  When the alien misses that statutory window, when he asks the board to reopen after the 90-day period is done, the board's decision whether or not to grant or to reopen is wholly in the board's discretion. So when an alien asks the board to reopen -- and I think this case is the best example.  When you look at the request for reopening, you don't see, please reopen using your statutory authority.  You don't see, please reopen using your sua sponte authority to reopen. You simply see, Board of Immigration Appeals, please reopen my case. The way you determine what the true nature of the board's authority is for the decision that it's denying is whether that motion was filed within the statutory time limit or without. So if the court of appeals looks at it and determines the alien asked for reopening after the end of the statutory deadline, the answer there is that the board's decision, its order that says, we deny reopening, is wholly within the discretion of the board and is unreviewable under Heckler v. Chaney.   ",14-185X

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's not -- it -- in the Nguyen case, the father could get the status of a parent.  He just had to do some things that the mother didn't have to do.  It wasn't difficult. Here it's a total exclusion.  And in the Nguyen case, the -- the father was complaining that he shouldn't have to do anything other than what a mother did, and the Court said, yeah, you do have to do something.  It's not much.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  We have changed our idea about marriage is the point that I made earlier. Marriage today is not what it was under the common law tradition, under the civil law tradition. Marriage was a relationship of a dominant male to a subordinate female. That ended as a result of this Court's decision in 1982 when Louisiana's Head and Master Rule was struck down.  And no State was allowed to have such a -- such a marriage anymore.  Would that be a choice that a State should be allowed to have?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  To cling to marriage the way it once was?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It is not to start an impact.  It's leaving a group out altogether.  It's not that more of this group and less of that group.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May we clear this one thing.  If the Petitioner prevails in the first case, then the argument is moot; right?     That's -- that's absolutely right, Your Honor.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you are supposing a situation where the Plaintiffs do not prevail, and so a State can retain its ban on same-sex marriage. The question is has -- does it have to recognize marriage from out of State? Would it make any difference if the couple came from the State where there is a ban on same-sex marriage, goes to a neighboring State that allows it, and then comes right back home again?     No, Your Honor.  I don't think that there would be such a distinction. And, in fact, none of these four States draws that kind of line that Your Honor presupposes.  And that's one of the points that's so important here, is that as the Court observed with respect to DOMA in Windsor, the nonrecognition laws here are a stark departure from the State's traditional practice of recognizing out-of-state marriages even though they could not have been celebrated within the State.  It's precisely that circumstance where the laws diverge that the issue arises. And the -- the three States that have this issue, Tennessee, Ohio, and Kentucky, are, between them, able to identify only 5 instances in which they did not recognize a marriage that was valid outside the State, even though it could not have been celebrated inside. And those instances are incest, which we think the State would have sufficiently important justification not to recognize, miscegenation laws, not a precedent on which I think the Court would want to rely in this instance, or other interests that I think probably would not survive today, such as the -- the rule against allowing a divorced person to remarry. So they're -- and -- and more importantly, the most recent of those cases is from 1970.  So the rule that the States cite about their ability to disregard, to effectively dissolve marriages that already exist, around which people have already begun to build their lives, is less applied than the Federal government's own authority to define the --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It would have to be shown, I think, the presumption would be in such a State that someone age 13 can't consent.     The age 13, I think probably you're right, but if it is a matter of 15 instead of 16, that the courts probably would recognize it, especially if, in reliance on their marriage, the -- the couple had already conceived of a child, it would do no one any good to destroy that marriage and the stable environment that it might provide for the children, just as it does no one any good -- it certainly doesn't advance the interests of the children of opposite-sex couples to destroy the marriages that provide stability to the children of same-sex couples who are already married under the laws of other States.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The State's rationale is we -- we treat outsiders the same way we treat insiders.     Well, thank you, Your Honor.  They -- they certainly have offered that, but what the State ignores is that these so-called outsiders are already married.  The State, it's true, says, well, we have same-sex couples in our State, and we don't allow them to marry, so we're going to -- to treat you the same way. Well, they ignore that our clients have already formed those relationships, and I think that it would be, in terms of the interests that distinguish between the two questions, it's -- it's helpful to think again, perhaps, about heterosexual couples.  We don't think that a State could limit marriage to only those couples who are capable of procreation.  We don't think it could preclude marriage by women who are 55, but it would be quite a different and distinct constitutional violation for the State to dissolve the marriages of opposite-sex couples when the woman reaches 55. I don't think that that's constitutionally permissible.  The States don't do that and, of course, they never would do that, because the essential protection against arbitrary laws is that the majority has to live under the same laws that they would subject the minority to.  And there is no chance that the majority would subject themselves to such a law as that. I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Because it is clear that if the law of the two States is the same, that was used against Fedder, the State cannot say we won't apply the other State's law, even though it's the same as our own.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You're --   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You're making a distinction between judgments -- full faith and credit applies to judgments.

But I think often what we're talking about is these cases on the margin, where the officer maybe had mixed motives or whatever.  And the idea behind the Eighth Amendment jurisprudence is that we're going to amp the standard up when you're talking about someone who is subject to the penological force of the State.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Bash, would you explain?

And the -- the jury was instructed to find four elements, three of them no one is contesting at this stage.  The third one is the key element.  This is on page 278.  And it said, ""Defendants knew that using force presented a risk of harm to Plaintiff, but they recklessly disregarded Plaintiff's safety.

And that's why I'm finding it very hard to distinguish what the university is doing, apart from the 10 percent plan. But let -- let me ask you about the 10 percent plan itself, because it seems to me that that is so obviously driven by one thing only, and that thing is race.  It's totally dependent upon having racially segregated neighborhoods, racially segregated schools, and it operates as a disincentive for a minority student to step out of that segregated community and attempt to get an integrated education.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it could work only in the background.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It is created because of race.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there any doubt that it was created to increase the number of minority students? Was there any other reason for the 10 percent plan?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the law of the United States, the law is directed to an actor.  The actor is the Border Patrol member.  And the instruction from the United States is very clear: Do not shoot to kill an unarmed, nondangerous person who is no threat to your safety.  Do not shoot to kill.  That's U.S. law.  And that's U.S. law that governs the conduct of the Border Patrol police. So I don't understand all this about Mexico.

I mean, there's no reason to think a man is less -- has less of a sense of U.S. belonging than a woman?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There are many cases, especially generations back when this law was on the books, where the mother -- the birth certificate came sometime after the child was born, and both the father's name and the mother's name might be on it. So it is -- it is not -- the moment of birth doesn't necessarily tell you who is the mother if she -- if there is no birth certificate, and then the child, when they get the birth certificate, both names are on it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Kneedler, you're -- you are giving a sophisticated rationale, but we're talking about legislation from 1940 and 1952. At that time, the statute books were just shot through with distinctions between children born out of wedlock and affiliation with the mother and the father.  So this was a piece with all that legislation. And it wasn't until when Ms. Trimble again scored a typical.  And the Illinois Probate Code said a child born out of wedlock can inherent to an intestate succession from the mother only, not the father.  The laws just put mothers and children not born of the marriage together and separated fathers from their children.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And nobody thought until the 1970s that that was a violation of equal protection. But in a whole series of cases in the '70s, the Court recognized that, indeed, there was a violation of equal protection.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  My point was that the laws that existed put mothers and children born out of wedlock together and separated fathers from their children --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  -- out of what the reality of their life was.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That was not a claim of citizenship.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And the father did -- this father -- didn't the couple marry?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It's not -- it's not citizenship.  It's excising the unconstitutional part of the statute.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The claim -- the claim --   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Kneedler, the claim is gender discrimination.  And married parents, they both have been -- mother and father have been treated equally badly.  But when they are unwed, the mother is given the preference and the father is not.  So we're -- we're talking about equal protection, not qualified immunity.  You have two people, similarly situated. They have to be treated equally.  The unwed father is equal to the unwed mother.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you're making a distinction between RICO when the government is using it as a prosecutorial tool -- tool, and RICO --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How do you deal with Judge Lynch's example? There's a foreign terrorist organization.  It operates only abroad, but it repeatedly cuts off the heads of U.S. citizens.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Operating only abroad but its targets are all U.S. citizens.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And doing bad things to U.S. citizens.  It's the example the -- the section that makes that a crime is 2332(a)(1).   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it -- so you're saying only the act itself you can't superimpose RICO, because there has been a whole pattern of these. They've cut of a hundred heads.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You -- Judge Lynch, in that -- in his opinion on the en banc, he said, ""Any interpretation that suggests the operatives of a foreign enterprise can't be held accountable under RICO for a pattern of predicate"" -- ""a pattern of predicate crimes that violate Federal statutes"" -- ""Federal statutes that have an express extraterritorial reach would astonish the Congress that made such violations RICO predicates.""   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So you would -- you would say -- I mean, the -- another example doesn't say the -- the -- the Sicilian Mafia commits a series of violent crimes in the United States that would violate RICO if committed by a New York-based Mafia family.  But -- so the New York-based Mafia family, RICO applies. Sicilian-based does the very same act; doesn't apply.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That is your position, right?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And not the pattern. It's just that the statute gets at after the individual instance.  RICO says when you have a pattern, things are a lot tougher for you.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's -- why isn't forum non conveniens the answer to that? If -- if -- the question is, where should -- who should provide a remedy to this conduct, and if it's -- really is centered in that other state, a forum non conveniens motion should be -- should be made to dismiss the action, because it's a far more appropriate forum abroad.   Elaine J. Goldenberg  This Court suggested in Empagran that going case-by-case with this kinds -- these kinds of comity concerns was too burdensome and too difficult for courts, and it would be better to make a blanket judgment about the comity concerns with respect to the cause of action as a whole.  And here, of course, we're talking not only about what court you're going to be in, but what law is going to apply. The courts in the United States are not being closed to RICO plaintiffs if they can't bring a private claim for treble damages under Section 1964(c).

Does -- does burglary qualify as -- as a crime of moral turpitude?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But Mr. Kneedler, if you're -- if you're making the distinction that Johnson was a criminal case and this is a civil case, this Court has had a number of decisions saying that line is not so rigid.  For example, MLB, taking away parental rights, is a civil proceeding.  And yet the Court said, as in a criminal proceeding, for an indigent party, the state must give the transcript free.  And so, if you had followed a rigid criminal/civil, then if it's civil, no free transcript.  Only if it's criminal. But the Court said the -- the line is blurred when there is such a grave consequence. It was a grave consequence to be denied parental rights.  It's a grave consequence to be removed from the United States.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Kneedler, does the government have another string in its bow here? I know we're arguing about 16(b) and its resemblance to ACCA, but you can be removed if you commit a crime of moral turpitude, and wouldn't burglary fall under that?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, hasn't it been determined whether burglary is a crime of moral turpitude?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Kneedler, did I get, correctly, your answer to the question about a crime of moral turpitude being an alternative that the government could have pursued? You say the immigration judge found that this was a crime.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Rosenkranz, can I ask you a simple question? If -- if, as this Court has held crime of moral turpitude isn't unconstitutionally vague, why should 16(b) fail to meet the vagueness test?     Your Honor, the answer is crime involving moral turpitude does not sit in a vacuum by itself.  It is a phrase that Congress adopted that has, at this point, probably two centuries' worth of law describing what is in and what is out. And, by the way, so what did the Court do in Jordan? What the Court did in Jordan was to say, You, Jordan, you committed a fraud.  One thing that has been clear, since as long as those words have been used, is that a fraud is a classic crime involving moral turpitude. That's why he lost that case.

And if that's so, then the defendant would benefit from being tipped off, and the government -- who I think you agree is the primary concern of Congress to be protected -- the government then would be left with the choice of either drop -- dropping the suit or expending its own resources on it. So the one that was really penalized, in addition to the qui tam plaintiffs, is the government.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And if it's a condition for the government's benefit, the government can waive it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But in Hallstrom -- Hallstrom, the plaintiff could re-file.  It wasn't -- it was -- it required notice.  So the plaintiff could then give the notice and bring the suit again.  But on your view, these plaintiffs are out irretrievably.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes, but that puts the government to the choice of not having the relator to go forward for it, and it has to either take up the reins itself or say, well, we have too many other things on our plate; we have to let it go.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But what about the point that I made before with respect to Hallstrom? Hallstrom didn't put the plaintiffs out of court.  It said they have to give the required notice.  They have to give the notice to the government, the alleged violator.  And I thought the purpose of that was to give the violator a chance to clean things up so there wouldn't be any suit. So those plaintiffs, if I understand Hallstrom right, just give the notice, wait the necessary number of days, and go forward with their suit again.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And I thought the question was suppose these plaintiffs didn't reveal the complaint at all, but they described on a radio show, on a TV show, what they understood to be State Farm's practice.  So the information came out, but not that they had filed the complaint.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can you -- can you tell me, just clarify what 3730(b) means when it says the action may be dismissed only if the Court and the Attorney General give written consent to the dismissal and their reasons for consenting.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  When would the government be hurt by a sealing violation?   John F. Bash  I think what Congress had in mind is defendants taking steps to thwart the government investigation; for example, destroying evidence, declining to cooperate once they know that there is a formal investigation of them.  I think that's what Congress had in mind. I'll note, though, that the Senate Report, for those who look at that kind of thing, said that they expected -- that the Senate expected that there would not be many instances where a seal violation would harm the government.  So I don't think it's surprising that this hasn't happened often. And Mr. Singh referred to the appendix in the petition that lists 48 cases that supposedly involved seal violations.  Petitioner put that together obviously at the cert stage.  Some of those don't even involve seal violations.  I think they said they relate to the seal requirement.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  In your brief, you did say -- on page 27 of your brief, you said that reputational harm to the defendant could be relevant to determining a sanction for seal violation.   John F. Bash  That's right, Justice Ginsburg, in an idiosyncratic case.  And the reason I say idiosyncratic is, as we discussed, lower courts have held and we agree that merely disclosing the allegations of fraud does not violate the seal.  So the sort of reputational harm you'd be talking about is the incremental harm from the disclosure that a suit has been filed.   ",15-513X

Is there any obligation, one, for him to register or deregister in Kansas, and does Illinois have an obligation to notify Kansas?

Claim preclusion -- there can never be a new trial on the travel or the conspiracy.  But we're talking about issue preclusion. And this jury, we don't know what it decided because of the inconsistency.  It said yes to bribery on one; no to bribery on the other.  And it might have just decided that conviction of the predicate offense, the bribery, was enough, and that the government had laid it on too strong by adding the conspiracy and the travel count. How do we know that's not what the jury decided?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But the Yeager case was -- the jury didn't reach any decision.  Here, your jury did reach a decision.  The decision was vacated because, in the court's view, the charge was erroneous. By the way, that's not -- it's not clear that the charge was erroneous, is it? There's a split on that issue.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The question is --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is it quid pro quo, or is it gratuity as well? As I understand it, there's a circuit split.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the jury was operating under the same charge with respect to the compound crimes.  So in order to convict, it would have had to find there was neither quid pro quo nor gratuity. That's what it would have had to find, which would be inconsistent with finding --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about the question I asked you before? If we're trying to find out what this jury did, isn't it a reasonable assumption that they convicted on the bribery for which there was much evidence? They thought that having the compound crimes, the conspiracy and the travel, was just laying it on too thick, so they weren't going to convict on those.  Why couldn't that have been?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that in Yeager, the Court said there was no -- there was no conflict because there was no decision.  A hung jury doesn't decide anything.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  This jury, we know, did decide something.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  When the acquittal isn't undermined in that it has claim preclusive effect, those acquittals are final.  They are done.  These people can never be prosecuted for the travel offense or the conspiracy offense.

That wasn't -- that wasn't passed on below, was it? The -- I think the court of appeals said it wasn't deciding it, that --   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  They didn't make that a holding.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How can it not be substantive when, under one rule, the sentence range goes minimum of 15 years up to life, and the other reading, it's zero to ten years? I can't imagine anything more substantive than five extra -- a minimum of five extra years in prison.   Helgi C. Walker  Because the government's articulation of the test, which is an effects-based test that they draw from a statutory construction case, Bousley, is not the proper inquiry for asking whether a new constitutional rule is substantive or procedural. Since Penry, which, after all, was the case that first extended Teague's first exception into the sentencing context in the first place, there, the Court looked for the existence of a, quote, ""substantive categorical constitutional guarantee."" And ever since, that's what this Court has looked for.  The foundation stone, as you said, just two months in Montgomery, is the existence of a, quote, ""substantive constitutional guarantee."" That must be the lodestar for whether a new constitutional rule is procedural or substantive.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And what is the substantive constitutional guarantees? Much of the Sixth Amendment is -- is all procedure, right?   Helgi C. Walker  That's true.  And that was Summerlin, Justice Scalia.  And that actually proves my point about the proper analysis.  In Summerlin, Justice Scalia looked to the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial, which was the underlying constitutional basis for the new rule announced in Ring.  And he said, well, it can't be substantive because the Sixth Amendment jury trial right has nothing to do with the scope of conduct that Congress can either punish or prohibit. And so, too, here, I don't think there's really any question.  I don't think my friends on the other side have seriously contested this, but Johnson is a case that is founded on the procedural due process right not to be put in jail under a vague law.  There is nothing in Johnson that suggests there was any concern, other than clarity, predictability, determinacy.  The void for vagueness cases that the author of Johnson shows appear to have been carefully selected.  None of them involved constitutionally protected conduct.  None of them involved any other constitutional interest in play. We have hornbook law that shows -- Professor Tribe's treatise that void for vagueness doctrine has always been understood to come under the procedural due process component of the Due Process Clause, not the substantive due process component.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How do you --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How do you deal with the argument that counsel made saying it would be passing strange if, when a law is narrowed, then it's substantive.  But if a law is invalidated entirely, then we put it on the procedural side.  That -- that, at first, at least, that seems to be a persuasive argument.   Helgi C. Walker  Well, I would submit it doesn't ultimately work at the end of the day for two reasons, Justice Ginsburg. First, the case of Bousley is a statutory construction case.  There was no new constitutional rule in Bousley.  So all the late Chief Justice Rehnquist said there, writing for the Court, is that when this Court interprets a statute, we are outside the Teague framework entirely.  And there, of course, the Court hadn't even reversed itself on the statutory question. So there wasn't even a new statutory issue there. When the court says what a statute definitively means, it is making a judicial determination that the conduct at issue falls definitively outside the scope of the relevant statute. Here, precisely because Johnson said that the clause was hopelessly indeterminant, we can't know with certainty that everybody's conduct fell outside the clause.  At the end of the day, it is a function of this Court's approach to statutory construction decisions on the one hand, which just aren't affected by Teague.  After all, the problem that Teague set out to solve was retroactivity in a world of changing constitutional rules.  And so statutory rules are to one side.  We should be looking here to the test for when a new constitutional rule is substantive. And I think it's quite revealing that my friends on the other side have not even attempted to argue that the rule in Johnson fits within either of the traditional standards for distinguishing substance and procedure in the constitutional context.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The Eleventh Circuit, as counsel said, decided the case on the basis of the residual clause.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But -- but now you're saying the -- there are assets, and the Court has to do something about the distribution of those assets.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, how can you have a -- a settlement if it can't be carried out? I mean, if you -- you're saying one thing is the settlement, and that's okay.  And the other thing is the distribution of the assets, but that's what the settlement provides for.   Sarah E. Harrington  Well, what the settlement should provide for is basically a liquidation of a claim.  And so if you have a claim by the estate against a third party, here a creditor, you basically reduce that claim to a dollar amount, and those dollars become property of the estate. If you have a settlement of a claim that's asserted by a creditor against the estate, then it's the same kind of thing: You sort of liquidate the claim, you reduce it to a dollar amount, and that becomes the claim against the estate held by the creditor.  But nothing in the Code would authorize -- and I think it's a -- it would be a violation of the priority system and generally of the system that distributes estate assets to have parties agree on the side of how estate assets should be distributed.  Those estate assets are not the property of the debtor once the bankruptcy starts. They're not the property of the creditors.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  May he -- may he complete his answer to my question?   Brian H. Fletcher  So Justice Ginsburg, on the second step, we urge the Court not to speak to that in a lot of detail because it hasn't been briefed in this case.

But we think that courts could sensibly look to the way that courts have handled other analogous questions, and I point to two areas of law where that's happened. The first is utility patent damages under the Patent Act, before 1946, permitted an award of the infringer's profits.  And in those cases, very often a patent would apply to part of a larger product sold in commerce, and the fact-finder would say you're entitled to the profits that are attributable to the infringing part, but not the whole machine.

So I agree that the question here is whether the fact that the out-of State plaintiffs have joined their claims in a single lawsuit with California plaintiffs makes a difference.  And I don't think that it does, if you looked at the interest that the Court has considered in its specific and its general jurisdiction decisions. Because I don't think that California has a greater interest in exercising control over the conduct of out-of-State defendants in another State just because those claims have been joined with in-State plaintiffs. I think the principal reason that respondents suggest that California does have that interest is an efficiency interest.  But this Court has defined general jurisdiction in a way that allows plaintiffs to bring their suit together in a single forum for efficiency purposes --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What about McKesson? There -- there are two defendants here.  McKesson is a California corporation or principal place.  Is there another place where these plaintiffs could sue McKesson as well as Bristol-Myers?   Rachel P. Kovner  So I think it's not -- it's not clear.  We agree that personal jurisdiction is defendant by defendant.  So there may be some cases -- and this may be such a case -- in which there's not one place where any group of defendants can be joined together. We think generally, there will be, because if the allegation is that two defendants have engaged in a course of conduct together, there's going to be some place where those defendants engaged in that course of conduct --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  So it's context with the United States as opposed to an individual State.  So if we -- if it's a Federal statute, then that -- and not hemmed in by State boundaries, it can create a nationwide claim.   Rachel P. Kovner  That's right, Your Honor, and the court -- courts of appeals have agreed on this. There are, you know, nationwide service of process provisions in which Congress has exercised that kind of authority.  And there's been no disagreement in the court of appeals -- courts of appeals, although this Court has reserved the issue itself in Omni.  We think it's a different sovereign, and so a different kind of context that would be --   ",16-466X

Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But we're told here that the -- that the -- the prosecution didn't have a partisan expert either, that there was this -- everyone who was appointed was a neutral expert serving the court, the prosecution, and the defendant.

The -- those at least are clues that what the decision writer had in mind was assisting the defense, just as a lawyer assists the defense.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Is there -- is there any jurisdiction that holds that today, that all that Ake requires is a neutral expert? I thought by now every jurisdiction recognizes that Ake requires an expert who will be, essentially, part of the defense team.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Including -- including Alabama, am I right, that in 2005, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals said Ake made it clear that an indigent defendant is entitled to an independent expert devoted to assisting his defense, not one providing the same information or advice to the court and prosecution.

What the statute did is it made more assets available because you didn't have to worry whether it was the state itself, an instrumentality of the state, an agency.

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It sets up a difference between intervening on the defendant's side and the plaintiff's side.  Intervening on the defendant's side under your scheme, that's easy, but not on the plaintiff's side.  And why should there be that disuniformity?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You're saying the intervenor must have the same standing as a plaintiff would have.  And that hasn't been the understanding in the courts or the commentators. You're probably familiar with the intervention commentary by David Shapiro in which he said, it should go without saying, it must be understood that there is a difference between the -- the question whether one is a proper plaintiff in the -- or defendant in an initial action, and the question whether one is entitled to intervene.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How about permissive intervenors?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Could Congress -- could Congress enact a statute that provides for intervention of right for someone who doesn't satisfy Article III? There are -- there are several statutes that do provide for intervention of right.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Can I ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Katyal? Could Congress pass a statute that said give someone a right to intervene, someone who would not have Article III standing?   Sarah E. Harrington  Yes.  I mean, I think Congress has done that in -- with a number of statutes. I think in those cases, the intervention would be -- and those intervenors would not be permitted to do something that would require standing without a subsequent assessment of -- of the standing of those intervenors. So, you know, in this case, as in many cases, I think the point of the intervenor that is attempting to intervene is that he -- it wants to get damages.  Well, you can't get damages if you don't have standing.  And so even if he prevailed here, there's going to have to be some showing at some point down the road that he has standing to get damages.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  There are -- there are several statutes.   Sarah E. Harrington  Yes.  So our view is, as a constitutional matter, again, you could have a system where you could easily get the label of intervenor, and then a court could later inquire into your standing if and when you did something that required standing. We think Rule 24(a)(2) is best read to require that standing upfront, and for some other reasons that Mr. Katyal was saying.  That's because the rule requires an intervenor to show that their interests are not adequately represented by existing parties, and that they're going to be injured --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Are there cases in which courts have controlled 24(a)(2) intervenors?

1,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Should we -- should we reach that question, Counsel?

So, are you suggesting that we should decide those questions in the first instance?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That was an attorney who simultaneously was asking to be relieved from representing her, right?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  We have one brief, an amicus brief in this case, telling us that we were wrong in drawing a distinction between what's in a statute, jurisdictional, what's in the rule, non-jurisdictional. And instead, anything that shifts a case from one court to the other, as notice of appeal does, that should be considered jurisdictional.  This is Professor Dodson's brief.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  We have drawn the line, I think it was in Justice Thomas's decision, between statute and rule pretty clearly.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What do you make of the argument that at one time it was in the statute and it was left out inadvertently?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  That's the part that was carried over the time limit in the case where the would be appellant didn't receive timely -- didn't receive notice of the judgment, that the judgment had been entered?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yeah, it --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  -- that was the requirement.  You could get an extension if you weren't notified of the entry of judgment.  And there was no provision for any extension, no time period attached to any requests for extension other than one where you didn't get notice of the entry of judgment.  Isn't that so?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And that's what's new, that was not in the original?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  It means if you raise it, it's mandatory.  But a mandatory claim-processing rule can be waived, so that's the difference.  What's mandatory is if the point is made, then the -- the mandatory rule applies.  But if a defendant doesn't or a opposing party doesn't -- doesn't range -- raise it, it can be waived.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But -- but if a court were by rule to say no waiver, no forfeiture, then it would be the same thing, in effect, as declaring the rule jurisdictional.

The defendant is well aware of that time extension and, if the defendant had read the rules, would recognize that they say 30 days, not 60 days.  But on your view, the defendant could deliberately say nothing and then, on appeal, when it's too late for the district court to correct the error, say, sorry, mandatory, and under your rules, Court of Appeals, I don't waive anything. It's -- it allows the defendant to create a trap.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you would have been able to if you got notice, even if you were not --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  -- you didn't -- weren't consulted in advance.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But you first -- you certainly, even in the court of appeals, you said no jurisdictional problem here, Court; we concede that the court of appeals has jurisdiction. So -- and that was long after you could have looked at the rules.  You said twice in your docketing statement that the court of appeals had jurisdiction.  And it was only Seventh Circuit, by raising the question, that then you latched onto it.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Well, the Second -- the Seventh Circuit said -- tipped you off to this.  You didn't tell the -- that you suddenly discovered this.  The Seventh Circuit interjected it into the case. But if the rule is mandatory, but not jurisdictional, then the Seventh Circuit had no business tipping you off.  We follow the principle of party presentation, and it was up to you to raise it, not up to the Court of Appeals to tell you.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And where -- I know that's a Seventh Circuit rule that you can raise it before the brief -- anytime before the briefing on the merits, but where else is it the rule?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But it was never in the statute with respect to a case like this. The only provision in the statute was when there was a failure to get notice of the entry of judgment. There was nothing in the statute covering a case where there was a reason other than failure -- just the statute was blank on that. It's no longer blank.  It gives permission for an extension.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Did excusable -- well, what was the text of the statute? I thought it was clear that it only applied in the case of a failure to receive notice of the entry of judgment.

Second, the whole point of the church plan exemption is that plans that qualify will not be regulated under ERISA at all.  They will be regulated under State law.

INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Under Brohl, don't --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  -- you think there's enough incentive in the system that if we did overrule Quill, that entrepreneurs would produce software that would meet the market need?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Why is it --   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But they say if they open a store within the state, then they're hit by these remote -- remote sellers, and so their store in the state is suffering. It is the small business person inside the state that's suffering.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But that would be really something that would appeal to Congress to fix, because the whole picture, Congress doesn't want to look like it's increasing taxes, but fixing something like that would not encounter the same hurdle.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  We saw today, from the announcement today, that Congress can sometimes act with -- with rapidity.   ",17-494X
0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Dupree, wasn't it -- wasn't it so that when the Act was enacted, compensation was in money, but over time, compensation in the form of stock has become more frequent.  And it serves the same purpose. So why can't one read ""any form of monetary compensation"" to include any form of compensation readily convertible into cash?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How common was stock at that time?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Yes.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought Judge Posner's main point was that there's no economic difference to the recipient, whether he gets $1,000 in cash in hand or a share of stock that he can easily convert to $1,000.   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But if you're right, then Congress did a -- an idle thing when it specifically excluded from compensation, subject to the tax, a qualified stock option.  If stock options were not money, then there was no need for that.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Was the government wrong in saying that at least for the last -- for 20 years, railroads have been paying tax, treating the stock option as equivalent to cash? There must have been, if they were paying for 20 years, there must have been something that triggered this inspiration to say there's no --   ",17-530X
1,Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How does it -- how does it work? When does the -- the railroad worker get the remuneration? When he gets the stock option or only when he cashes it?

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What is the standard of review that the court of appeals uses for sentence -- for sentences?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  I thought that what -- doesn't the statute say, 3742, ""imposed in violation of law""?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  The question is whether the sentence is imposed in violation of law?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  But how could that be if the -- the district court sentenced within -- within the guidelines? It wasn't the same range, and it wasn't the same point within the guidelines as the original sentence, but it was still within the guidelines.  So how could a within-the-guidelines sentence be imposed in violation of law?   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  How much of an explanation would -- would be required? Let's say -- and take this very case.  What -- what -- what explanation would have sufficed?   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  One aspect of this case, it strikes me as curious.  So this is an appeal from the resentencing; couldn't -- could this defendant, instead of going to the court of appeals, said: District Judge, would you please reconsider or clarify why the first time around you put me in the bottom of the range and the second time in the middle? You could -- could have moved for clarification before the district court.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  You -- you seem to be having some kind of a presumption that the reduction should be proportional.  So, if the original sentence was at the low end, the reduced sentence should be at the low end. But what statutory provision requires proportionality?   INTERRUPTING ",17-5639

0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Mr. Fisher, there's a -- there's an anomaly in the position you take.  That is, if the defendants involved here, if they were to appear for initial sentencing today, they would get the very same sentence that they got -- that the -- the sentence that they are now serving.  So that seems a little odd that -- that people who, if they were being sentenced today, would get the exact same sentence, should get the benefit of this scale-down.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  What is the function of the -- the mandatory minimum? Because it seems the guidelines have Sentencing Commission, and that's fine, but mandatory minimum, like it or not, is legislation, and it seems to be vanishing in your approach. Instead of being -- instead of trump -- trumping whatever would be the guidelines, it's out of the picture.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg  And why can't you tell --   INTERRUPTING Ruth Bader Ginsburg  -- why can't you tell that from reading the transcript?   INTERRUPTING ",17-5716
