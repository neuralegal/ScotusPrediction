So again, the Postal Office has defined itself through its actions as a person in comparable commercial tort situations.  It's only logical that if a Postal Service in the commercial world, saying that it's not like the United States for copyrights, for trademarks, then it's not like United States with respect to antitrust.  When Congress formed the Postal Service, Your Honors, and it took away the APA, the Postal Rate Commission for these non-monopoly actions, as well as the Federal acquisition regulations, certainly there was a quid pro quo.  If you streamline the operations of the Postal Service, launch it into business, you would expect the private commercial torts in antitrust laws to be the restraint to make sure that the monopoly is not extended to the other kind of operations.  And so I think that Congress' intent is quite clear that the Postal Service is unique, does not partake of the United States, and therefore, just as the Postal Service can be sued in tort law and under the Lanham Act, be it the old Lanham Act, the new Lanham Act, it can be sued under the antitrust laws as well.  The burden, therefore, on the Solicitor General to explain why Congress would have wanted the Postal Service's monopoly to be extended, and why Congress would have wanted the Postal Service to be sue...  to be able to be sued and to sue themselves without really being able to take advantage of the opportunity to sue in their own name under the antitrust laws or under trademark and copyright law, et cetera, and why they shouldn't be sued as well.

Albritton  That... that is incorrect, Your Honor.  What we allege is that it is not the focus on the sequence of the convictions.  When sequence is used, it is shorthand to describe the... when the second offense was committed, and the date of commission of that offense is something separate and apart from the fact of those prior... of that prior conviction.  So, Your Honor, we would respectfully suggest that takes this outside of Almendarez-Torres, and therefore the Court can... can determine that Mr. Haley is actually innocent of the enhanced offense of theft by habitual offender.  Finally, Your Honor, in conclusion, I would respectfully request the Court not to remand to the State of Texas... excuse me, to the courts below, unless it reaches the question presented and decides it contrary to the Fifth Circuit.  If the Court decides that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim should have... or cause and prejudice should have been reached first, since it was not presented in the question presented, the Court should not reach any issue in this case.  Mr. Haley should be able to go about his life and not be subject to a day more in prison that the state concedes is unlawful, and as the court advised... as the state advised the district court, if this Court were to reverse, it intends to put Mr. Haley back in prison for an additional 10 years that it specifically admits is unlawful and not authorized by the legislature, and a remand presumably would result in the same sort of injustice visited upon Mr. Haley by the state.  For those reasons, Your Honor, I respectfully suggest that the Court affirm the judgment of the Fifth Circuit and hold that Mr. Haley has sufficiently established that he is actually innocent, reach the merits of the claim, and... and that's the only issue the Court needs to resolve.

The... the point I'm trying to make is whether every cause of action was pled, if the conduct is extortion, which is what the judge implicitly found by findings 20 and 27, that conduct is not protected.  And whether we named the cause of action correct in the complaint or we sued for that specified cause of action, doesn't change what it is that we were seeking relief for, which is stopping this man from defaming Mr. Cochran until he was paid money.  We attempted to achieve that.  We thought we did a fair job in paragraphs 1 and 3, which they don't attack and I agree is not fairly included within the question which has been certified here, nor is an attack on the underlying finding.  But we attempted in paragraph 2, broadly I agree, to avoid a multiplicity of actions and to give Mr. Tory other channels of communication other than the public forum where he is engaged in a continuing course of repetitive conduct to defame Mr. Cochran.  He... and... and this is... one point that I want to stress.  We don't view this injunction as being violated if he went on TV, he went on the radio, he went in the newspapers.  We don't view those as public forums under the definition that this Court has provided.  Those are not public forums.  We are not concerned about that.  We do not believe that those events will occur.  We did not seek to protect them.  So we have given Mr. Tory an unlimited venue to speak, but we said you can't do this in the public forum because of your continuing course of repetitive conduct, 3 years, once a week, 52 times a year, over 150 times, 4 hours a day.  And with that, I would submit that while the injunction is broad, I don't believe it's a unconstitutional prior restraint, and to the extent this Court believes it is overbroad, I believe striking subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 2 would solve the problem, or alternatively, that in conjunction with a suggestion that it needs to be narrowed to deal with the speech and conduct in issue.

William H. Rehnquist  Under your--  --Can you--  --Excuse me.  Can you collaterally attack a plea before you appealed and sought to have it set aside?   William H.

INTERRUPTING William H. Rehnquist  Very well, Mr. Himmelfarb.  Ms. Mossman, we'll hear from you.     Myra D Mossman  Okay.  I'd just like to say that the Government's burden is... the Government's test, the prejudice test, the but-for test, is asking this defendant to go back in time and to prove a counter-factual.  It's not in this record, that if not for the error, he would not have pled guilty.  That's a very heavy burden here.  And we believe it emasculates the knowing requirements and makes awareness of the consequences of the plea irrelevant.  And the... a defendant, if he does not understand the scope of the prosecution's promise, he cannot evaluate the risks inherent in the type of plea agreement that he's signing.  We think that's critical.  The Ninth Circuit agreed that... that the rule 11(e)(2) warning and the type of plea agreement that this particular defendant entered into is highly critical and affords a higher risk to this defendant because it couldn't withdraw.  And it's counterintuitive to enter into an agreement when you understand that one party could withdraw, to think that you can't.  That's why the Congress has asked... has asked that this warning be expressly made in the rule 11 colloquy, that if we... if I... I... I'm not bound by the recommendation.  The judge has said I'm not bound by the recommendations, but you cannot withdraw if I do not give you the sentence that you bargained for because that's a counterintuitive understanding.  I believe Justice Scalia was getting at this when he talked to Mr. Himmelfarb.  And in closing, I'd just like to say this Court should adhere to the Olano prejudice test and reject the Government's invitation to adopt a but-for, highly prejudiced, highly burden... excuse me... strict bright line ruling test.

Dan Himmelfarb  --I agree he's making an argument about the requirement of intent which he thinks the word use encompasses.  He's also making an alternative argument, which is whether or not use requires intent, the crime does not have as an element the use of physical force because you could injure somebody by driving drunk without the use of physical force.  And he gives examples of how you could do that.  Our position is that even if those examples he gives, for example, swerving and forcing somebody off the road or falling asleep at the wheel and having somebody else crash into you, even if those examples do not, by themselves, involve the use of... involve physical force, it's our view that if you're driving drunk and you're doing those things, there's a substantial risk of physical force.

1,"William H. Rehnquist  Very well, Mr. Kneedler.  Ms. Dahl, we'll hear from you.     Christine S. Dahl  --Yes, Your Honor.  I was drawing a comparison between the situation with Mr. Zadvydas and Mr. Martinez.  Detention, of course, needs to be reasonably related to its purpose.  Here removal cannot be achieved.  So detention for that purpose becomes arbitrary and punitive, and we'd ask the Court to affirm the grant of habeas corpus and Mr. Martinez's release on supervision conditions.   William H. Rehnquist  Thank you, Ms. Dahl.  Mr. Mills, we'll hear from you.     John S. Mills  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  I think that we have lost sight of the statutory scheme that applies here.  Section 1182(d)(5)(A) is not a detention statute.  It's clearly not preserved as an initial matter.  It was not in the answer to either habeas petition.  The justification given in the district court in both cases was 1231(a)(6).  But, Justice Breyer, there is no need to remand this case because a clear, simple reading of the immigration statutes demonstrates that 1182 is not a detention statute.  You have to go through the process, and I attempted to do this in my reply brief, but I think I can do it a little bit more clearly for the Court this morning.  When an alien first arrives, he's an applicant for admission.  Section 1225(b)(2)(A) of title 8, United States Code says an applicant for admission... any applicant for admission shall be detained until the removal proceeding unless it is clear, beyond any doubt, that they are entitled to come in.  So all aliens, when they apply... that's the detention statute that initially applies, 1225(b)(2)(A).  They are to be detained until there is a removal proceeding.  The removal proceeding, which is governed by 1229(a)(1)... I'm sorry... 1226(a)... it is 1229(a)... is to determine whether the alien is admissible or not, whether they should come in or whether they must be removed.  So 1225(b)(2)(A) says detain until that point.  1182(d)(5)(A) then comes in to authorize the Government to stop that process for humanitarian reasons and parole an alien in.  We won't have the removal process.  We're going to... we... we're going to get out of the detention in 1225(b)(2)(A), and we're going to let you out on parole, which is discretionary.  That's 1182(d)(5)(A).  If at any time, we in our discretion think it is no longer appropriate to keep you on parole, we can revoke that parole, and the statute 1182(d)(5)(A) says once parole is revoked, the alien is treated as, quote, any other applicant for admission.  So you go back to 1225(b)(2)(A), which says detain them until the removal proceeding.   William H. Rehnquist  Well, you... you might wait a while if you went to the United Nations or--  [Laughter]  --or to... I take it the Government feels you need some sort of a rather immediate recourse.   John S. Mills  --Sure, and our Government has demonstrated that it believes in preemptive... preemptive action and we can go in and have regime change in Cuba if it... if it is such a threat.  If it's a political decision, the purely executive decision, that our national security is so threatened, they have all kinds of tools.   William H. Rehnquist  How do you explain, Mr. Mills, the language that the Court used, pointing out how different this kind of a case would have been from the... from the Zadvydas case?   John S. Mills  --Sure.  My reading of that... of that decision, there were two parts of the decision.  There was part one, which examined whether there is a... or it determined whether the statute is ambiguous, and part two is whether there's a constitutional error.  It was only in the part of the decision deciding whether there's a constitutional problem that the distinction was made.  The distinction makes the difference in whether there's a problem or not.  And maybe there's not a problem for inadmissible aliens.  So, the Court then concluded in Zadvydas that because there's a problem, we look at the statute.  This statute could be interpreted to authorize indefinite detention or not.  It's ambiguous.  Because we have a problem, at least with one category, we're going to choose the... a safe route.

Hurt  I think that... that that is a possible case, but I think that that's... the priorities for the Government and... and Congress in drafting this law was to get money back for the Government.  That's their number one concern here and to incentivize that whistleblower.  If it so happens that the whistleblower takes much... takes a long time to prepare his qui tam and brings his... his retaliation action at the same time and ends up getting some more damages, I... I think that ranks low on the list of Congress'priorities in drafting this retaliation provision.  It's the... getting the Government's money back, giving the whistleblower protection and an incentive to bring that qui tam claim is really Congress'core concern here.  And I think these other issues about damages mounting can be readily addressed with the mitigation defense and... and dealing with that that will take care of double damages so... so if the whistleblower is just sitting around waiting for that, then the mitigation defense would take care of that.  Also, I think the petitioner raised the idea that this is some kind of... the... the retaliator can bring some kind of nebulous fraud allegation if it doesn't... isn't really tied to a specific false claim.  I think that the courts are not interpreting it that way because this is a False Claims Act retaliation claim, not just a generalized fraud claim.  So in a typical case, there will be a claim that... that the whistleblower will... will be able to point to and say I think that this claim is false.  I have a good faith belief that it is false, and then it... and that's what the trigger would be based on.  I mean, in summary, if there's no further questions, I'd like to just summarize.  I think this Court should uphold the plain language of the statute.  While the limitations trigger is unusual, it is the one that Congress set forth in the statute.  It makes sense.  It reflects the unique considerations of encouraging... the goal of encouraging a whistleblower to bring his qui tam claim with his retaliation claim.  19 years of experience have shown that the plain language works in the typical cases that arise, and that none of the reasons given by the petitioners come close to providing a justification for this Court to discard the plain language of the statute.  None of the reasons... this statute does not rise to the level of absurdity that would justify this Court disregarding the plain language.  Thank you.   William H. Rehnquist  Thank you, Mr. Hurt.  Mr. Driemeier, we'll hear from you.       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Section 3731(b) provides the statute of limitations for, quote, a civil action under section 3730.

Rehnquist  Very well, Ms. Mahoney.  Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.     Michael R. Dreeben  --I don't think that it is that confusing, Justice O'Connor.  This is a statute that was enacted against the backdrop of Section 1503 in a well-understood meaning of the word ""corruptly"".  The same word appears in Section 1505.  When the D.C. Circuit concluded that that provision was vague, as applied to a particular case, Congress came back with a definition that legislatively overruled the D.C. Circuit decision and said ""corruptly"" means ""acting with an improper purpose"".  The ""improper purpose"" in an obstruction-of-justice case has traditionally been ""the purpose to obstruct justice"".  That definition logically applies to Section 1512, because Congress enacted the corruptly-persuades provision to remedy a deficiency in prior law, because it had not included non-coercive, non-deceptive witness-tampering in the statute, originally.  And some courts concluded that it was no longer punishable under Section 1503, either.  To fix that situation, Congress looked to the model of Section 1503 case law, where there had been a variety of acts that are covered that under Petitioner's test would not be, such as secreting a witness, or sequestering a witness, in anticipation of a subpoena so that the witness would be unavailable to testify, or destroying documents before a subpoena had been issued, but in an anticipation that the subpoena was likely.  Those kinds of acts were considered to be unlawful.  Similarly, giving advice, even as a lawyer, to an individual to assert the Fifth Amendment in bad faith, not to protect that individual's own interest, but to obstruct justice by protecting other members of a criminal organization, or, indeed, the lawyer himself, lower courts had recognized could be prosecuted; not uniformly had recognized, but they had uniformly recognized it at the time of the enactment of this statute.  And Congress specifically said,  ""We want 1512 to be able to pick up the kinds of cases that some courts have said are no longer prosecutable under Section 1503, and that had not been included in the original version of 1512. ""  So that there is history here that explains how these terms should be applied.  And as far as Petitioner's contention that the word ""corruptly"" does nothing and leads to a series of horrible hypotheticals, actually a sensitive and appropriate use of the word ""corruptly"" solves those problems.  Petitioners talk about how people should be able to urge each other not to cooperate with a voluntary investigation, that it's part of citizenship to be able to engage in those conversations.  But if an entity has subpoena authority and it doesn't invoke it, and it simply invites people voluntarily to cooperate, it is not going to be an intent to subvert, undermine, or impede that proceeding to invite them to exercise that right.  If the agency wants their testimony, it can get it through compulsion.  Similarly, Petitioners argue that document policies are, per se, made unlawful under the Government's approach.  But as the Court of Appeals specifically recognized in this case, a sound application of the word ""corruptly"" would look to whether there is a threat of some kind of specific proceeding that might trigger an obligation not to destroy the documents before the proceeding gets started.  And, as well, there are intents that are simply not intents to subvert the administration of justice, that may result in rendering certain evidence unavailable.  And if a person engages in that conduct, it may well violate another provision of criminal law, but it doesn't have to violate 1512.  And a sound use of ""corruptly"" prevents all of those hypotheticals from materializing and leading to the conclusion that the statute is unduly broad.  Now, Petitioner in this case, in addition to attacking the word ""corruptly"", also has advanced a number of arguments that there was inadequate instruction on some connection that had to be required between the Defendant's intent in a possible future proceeding.  But the reason that there was no adequate instruction on those issues is largely because Petitioner, itself, deliberately decided to ask for two instructions that were contrary to the statute, and never asked for what it's asked this Court to impose today.  It never asked that the Defendant must be shown to believe that some particular proceeding was likely to occur in the near future.  Instead, what it did is say that the Defendant had to have an intent to impair an object's availability for use in a particular proceeding.  And what the Court of Appeals said is that if there was any problem in that, it's not reversible error; it's harmless, because everybody knew that the proceeding that was anticipated was an SEC investigation of Enron.  And the other instruction that Petitioners asked for in the District Court is that the official proceeding must be ongoing or scheduled to be commenced in the future.  But that instruction is flatly contrary to the statute.   William H. Rehnquist  Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.  Ms. Mahoney, you have four minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",04-368X

There is one when the action depends on the meaning of Federal law, but not one where everybody agrees on the meaning of Federal law and all that's at issue is a dispute about the facts.  Now, this case, as I said, does fall within the Hopkins line of cases, and in each of those cases, the Court held there was arising-under jurisdiction in a quiet title action where the plaintiff's claim that it had superior title to the land in question depended on the meaning of Federal law.  And, of course, that's true here.  The quiet title action provides the mechanism for review of this question, but the question is entirely one of Federal law as to who has the superior interest in the land, the tax sale purchaser or the taxpayer.
