You have the principal activities in your... either preliminary or postliminary... and now you've got a third concept: integral.  But the statute... that's nowhere in the statute.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, unless they were saying those activities were, in fact, principal activities.  If it's integral, if it's embraced by the principal activity, it is a principal activity, and that at least is more consistent with the statute in keeping it in two categories rather than inventing a third.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, how does... how does your analysis apply?  Let's say these employees had to change their equipment several times during the course of the day.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, I mean, the--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --the equipment is only good for, you know, an hour, two hours, then they have to get new ones.  They have to walk back to the place--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --they have to doff the other equipment, don new equipment, and walk back.  Wouldn't your analysis say that that walking time is excluded?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What was--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --so unusual about the facts--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --What was so unusual about the facts in Steiner?  They're pretty common.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but the--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --the routine where you have to don, you know, safety equipment, and you have to shower when you're done, whether it's being... the meatpacking or the stuff at Steiner... that's a pretty common occurrence.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right, they don't say... I mean, they exclude, for example, the canine cases, where you have to walk and feed the dog in the morning before you show up at work.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --answer to Justice Kennedy said that the dog cases were distinguishable because there was a break in the principal activity.  So, if we were to rule in your favor, all the employer has to do is make sure that the donning and doffing station's far enough away from the production line so that there will be a sufficient break between the two activities.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you mean ""it would be""... that's my question.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Goldstein.  Mr. Gornstein.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Gornstein, do you agree that just because it's a compensable activity doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't going to be a break in the workday?  People have talked about the dog example, and there are others.  I mean, and... so, all you're talking about is the determination that this is a principal activity.  It seems that there's a separate... second question, such as, How do we tell if the space in time between two different principal activities, because they're two very different types of activities, is a break or part of the continuous workday?

Roberts, Jr.  --I was curious, though, which way that fact cut.  I can see the argument that the closer the relationship, the more reasonable it is to say that the one party more or less recognizes that their privacy interests are held hostage to the views of the other.  It's when you get the disrupted relationship, or their adverse interests, that maybe the expectations of privacy, or the reasonableness of one acting as an agent of the other, becomes a little more strained.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about the telephone call between a husband and wife, and the wife tells the police, ""Listen in on this call""?  She's consented to the monitoring of the conversation, the husband has not.  Maybe he even begins the call by saying,  ""I... don't let anybody else listen to this. ""  It's clear that that is admissible, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  She's consenting.  It's an intrusion, in the one case, on the conversation; in the other case, on the home.  In the telephone case, it's recognized, in the law, the consent of one party subjects the other to having the conversation monitored.  In this case, the consent of one party subjects the other party to the search.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --begs the question... it begs the question to say  ""it's a distinct individual right to privacy. ""  It's a little academic to talk about his individual right to privacy when he's sharing the home with someone else.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, all--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --reflects is the--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I was just going to say, it just reflects the expectation of privacy.  And when you do live with someone else, you compromise your individual privacy interest to that extent.  We know that you compromise it to the extent that if you happen not to be there, and that person says,  ""Sure, come on in and search. ""  that's going to bind you, as well.  Why is it... why do you not compromise the expectation to the extent of giving the other person the right to consent?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's not a fair reading of Rodriguez.  There, it was,  ""Come on in, he's asleep. ""  It was quite clear that if he were awake, he was going to say, ""Don't come in"".   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You talk about that tie.  Your approach applies in the case... a dormitory, you have a common room, there are ten rooms off of it, nine people say,  ""Sure, come on in and search. ""  and the one person says, ""No"".  That one person exercises a veto over a search of the common area?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What... well, what is your answer--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --to that case?  Your case is that, if one out of ten who share the common room says to the police, ""You may not come in"", that controls?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, can I just take the next step in my hypothetical?  The wife and the two adult children who live in the home say, ""Come on in"", and the husband says, ""No"".  What happens then?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Reasonably, the person realizes he would be outvoted?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, it does go to his presumably objectively reasonable views of what nature of privacy he has.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, if he thinks,  ""Look, I've been having a bad time with my wife. ""  ""I think she's going to consent and let the police in if I'm not.

A lot of your concerns talk about what's going to happen if this exception is granted.  Now, if some of those things come true, can't this issue be revisited?  I don't regard... maybe I'm wrong, but, under RFRA, you're not saying it's a compelling interest test.  It may be... may not be satisfied in this case, but if it turns out there's a lot of diversion of the hallucinogen or the membership of the church expands in a way that leads you to believe it's being abused, I mean, then you'd look at it again, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But your... but your approach is totally categorical.  If you had a group that had, once a year, one drop of the hallucinogen involved here, per member, and it was rigorously policed, your position would still be the same--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --even applying RFRA, which sets forth a compelling interest test.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I was a little unclear about your position on the Convention.  I thought, at some... one point, you said that it didn't really add much to your argument under the Controlled Substances Act, which implemented the Convention.  Is--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --there an independent--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --argument?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.  Ms. Hollander.     Nancy Hollander  --Well, we certainly have a great deal of more evidence, Your Honor, that we can put in.  We have substantial evidence on the Treaty, and evidence we haven't even talked about here, proving that this hoasca is not covered by the Treaty.  We have additional health and safety evidence.  We have additional evidence to show lack of diversion.  We have additional evidence that Judge Parker talks about to show targeting of the religion and selective prosecution.  We have a great deal more evidence we can put on.  But, of course, it depends on what the Government puts on.  Because, at this point, the Government has not met any of its burdens.  Now, you're correct about the Treaty.  None of that has gone on.  The Government resisted any evidence about the Treaty, resisted the very best evidence, which was the International Narcotics Control Board's opinion that hoasca is not covered by the Treaty.  And we now have... we now have more that we would put on.  And, you know, what the church and its members seek is just the right to practice their religious faith, as Congress guaranteed them in RFRA.  Because Congress guaranteed and recognized that religious liberty is a core value in this country.  Two courts below found, on a lengthy factual record, that the Government had not met the burdens Congress imposed.  This Court should do... even if this Court believes that it's a close question... should do then what it did in Ashcroft v. ACLU, affirm the preliminary injunction, remand this case for a trial on the merits.  If this Court were to do anything less than that, it's really to deny Congress's intent and Congress's policy here, because Congress's policy is that religious freedom, religious liberty, shall not be burdened unless, and until, the Government meets its burdens.  The District Court clearly found, and said, that the Government did not show a risk of harm, did not show a risk of diversion; and, therefore, he found that the Government did not meet its compelling interests in this case.  And we would ask the Court to affirm the preliminary injunction, remand this case to the District Court.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Hollander.  Mr. Kneedler, you have 4 minutes left.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But what... but what does that benefit you?  I mean... I guess this is Justice Scalia's question he asked earlier... the Treaty is... it seems to me if you're willing to override a duly enacted statute, the Treaty shouldn't have any greater status.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You think the Treaty gives you a more compelling governmental interest than the Controlled Substances Act?   INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, your theory would be if you had a religious group that... whose doctrine was that you should proselytize through hoasca, and they want everybody to come, and they're aggressive in doing that, and distributing hoasca, that the Government should be in a position of saying,  ""This religious group can use it, but that religious group can't? ""   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, they're the kind of the... the ones I just gave you.  In other words, if there's going to be a greater threat of diversion to... it's not limited to the members of a very cohesive and limited group, but it's... they're... they aggressively try to reach out, but it's all part of a sincere religious belief, that we should, in applying RFRA, draw distinctions between the group you represent and that hypothetical group?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm assuming they show--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --that there is--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Yes.   INTERRUPTING John G.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it has to be extracted at some point to be... to get into... I'm right here... to get into the tea, right?  It's extracted by the preparation of the tea.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess I... if I could just go back to the point.  You're emphasizing that the Treaty doesn't cover the importation of plants.  But you're not importing plants, you're--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --importing a mixture that must contain the covered hallucinogen or it doesn't have its effect.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, under your--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --theory, a marijuana tea would not be covered by the Treaty.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but they're not being imported, they're transformed into this tea.  And you... saying the active substance isn't there independently, so it's not covered.  And that seems to me to be a... an erroneous reading of the Treaty.   INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even though if... if... do you concede that if he had, for example, refused the testing and been fired and it was a major personnel action, he would have to go through the statutory procedures before bringing that... the constitutional claim on review of those administrative procedures?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, doesn't it seem odd... and this is sort of the logic of... in Fausto and some of the other cases... that when you have a major action, you have to exhaust before you can go into court, but if you have something that doesn't qualify as a major adverse action, you get to go to court right away?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms.... Ms. Karlan, you have a... a statutory claim that essentially mirrors the constitutional claim.  The statute requires the testing to be random and impartial.  If we think there's a difference between the constitutional claims and statutory claims with respect to their treatment under the CSRA, how do you handle that?  Does he have to exhaust the statutory claim but not the constitutional one?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I still don't understand how they proceed.  Does he have to bring... can he go right into court on the constitutional claim even if the statutory claim has to go through the grievance procedure?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the identical claims have to proceed under two different routes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Stewart.     Malcolm L. Stewart  Not... no, not that I'm aware of.  Obviously, in... in other circuits, we prevailed on the... the theory that the CSRA precludes review even of constitutional claims.  And again, if I could return just for a moment to the... the point I was making earlier about the grievance procedure.  Congress has clearly manifested a preference for the inclusion of grievance procedures in collective bargaining agreements, and... and given that express congressional preference, it doesn't seem right for this Court to assume that the grievance procedures won't work.  And this seems to be an ideal example of a case that potentially implicates constitutional issues but that still falls squarely within the expertise of the union, the arbitrator, and the FLRA.  That is, the dispute here concerns whether, in fact, petitioner was tested more frequently than his colleagues, and if so, what was the explanation?  Was it simply random deviations?  Was it potentially a... a glitch in the computer program that was used to generate a random list of names, or was there some invidious motivation as... as petitioner has suggested?  The resolution of those types of questions falls entirely within the expertise of the participants in the grievance process even though constitutional law per se is not what labor arbitrators are best at.  And so, I guess to... to return for a second to... to Justice Scalia's question about why shouldn't the CSRA be read to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims altogether.  I mean, we certainly think that if... in a sense, that's... that's a debate we would be happy to lose.  That is, the Government has not suggested that we have an affirmative interest in preserving judicial review of those claims, and if the Court were looking for a... the simplest solution to the problem, that solution would be... have just as much to recommend it as petitioner's solution, which is that you go straight into Federal district court.  However, we don't think that Congress has spoken with the degree of clarity that this Court's decisions demand to preclude all judicial review of constitutional challenges, and we think the best way of reconciling that presumption of judicial review with the comprehensive nature of the CSRA scheme is to provide that claims... constitutional claims are reviewable if, and only if, the plaintiff has made all reasonable efforts to utilize the available administrative remedies.

So, the overlap argument you're making may not really go to what Congress had in mind.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  When you talk about the text, though... and I understand that the ""may"" language here has been read by the Court in very different ways, depending upon the statute... but you have a statute that literally alternates sentences between ""shall/may"", ""shall/may"", and it seems to me that if your rule is closer to ""shall"" than ""may"", it seems that it was an odd choice of words for Congress to employ.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that's a general... you're... you seem to be arguing more generally for the British rule, rather than the American rule.  And I read our decision in Fogerty to say that when we're confronted with language like this, ""may"", you don't assume that Congress intended to overrule the basic American rule and apply the British one.

As soon as you get into a multifactor analysis, then you get briefs on both sides arguing their factors and the other side's factors, and the judge has to decide.  If there's a presumption that applies in most cases, you don't waste time over jurisdictional squabbles like this.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is your position on what fees we're talking about.

I... there's three aggravators and three mitigators, in equipoise.  And the... presumably, the individual jurors can give what weight they think is appropriate to the mitigating factors.

In other words, it would seem to me that that's an easy case to say that the State has not met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating factors don't outweigh the aggravating ones when the evidence is evenly balanced.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What... what is the statutory equipoise provision?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's my question.  There is no--   John G.

If you had an... a... a case that's litigated entirely on State law grounds and in the State supreme court opinion, they announce we are sua sponte deciding this on the basis of the Federal Constitution and you, State, lose, your argument is that the State is just out of luck.

They either think that the need to show mercy or, the one before that, that he's a talented artist, outweighs the fact of the aggravating circumstances, or it doesn't.  I just think it's an unrealistic supposition.  And there's nothing in the statute... they don't get an equipoise instruction.  So, how... I mean, is there any reason to think that jurors do come to that balance between such inchoate concepts in the first place?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think your--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I think your analogy took away what I would have regarded as the basis for my question.  I think it may well be true that people have difficulty deciding between two portraits.  I'm not sure people come to the sense that someone who's guilty of allowing a 19-month-old to burn to death and slashing the throat of her mother thinks it's equally balanced when they're inclined to show mercy, for whatever reason.  It seems to me they either make a determination that the circumstances of his upbringing, emotional instability outweigh the responsibility for what they have found to be aggravating factors, or they determine that the aggravating factors outweigh the fact that they may show mercy for other basis.  I just... I can see thinking two portraits are indistinguishable.  I just don't see a juror functioning and saying,  ""I just can't decide whether to show mercy or to convict for death. ""  And they're equally balanced.  I understand the idea they may debate it with the other jurors, but, to come and say,  ""You know, I just can't decide. ""  it seems to me that the... particularly since they can put as much weight into the mitigating factors as they want... they can say,  ""I want to show a lot of mercy. ""  they can say,  ""I want to show a little bit of mercy. ""  --but to say that,  ""I want to show just enough mercy that is exactly balanced. ""  I don't understand that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the verdict that the jury returns is a verdict of death.  They do not return a verdict saying, ""We're in equipoise"", and then the death sentence is imposed by operation of law.  The verdict imposed is,  ""We do not find... we find these aggravating circumstances. ""  ""We find they're not outweighed. ""  ""And, therefore, we sentence the defendant to death. ""   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, how is it--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --how is it... is there any question about how it's going to come out when they take it up again?  [Laughter]   ",04-1170
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, a... a national bank charter typically lists the national bank's principal place of business.  Correct?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Its main office.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, but you're... you're asking us to interpret a statute that they passed in light of events subsequent to the passage of the statute.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're saying that when they passed it, national banks were only in one place.  Well, they were only located in one place--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --even if you adopt the reading of the Fourth Circuit.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Srinivasan, we'll hear now from you.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could I... could I get your position again on exactly 1348?  You say main office is where the bank is located?   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Because I gather you don't have to amend your charter.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How... how do you tell where a bank's main office is?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So its main office would be... be where its articles of incorporation say, even if it has 90 percent of its branches in another State?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you can have these banks...

But I would have thought that a national association is distinct from a corporation in a way, for example, that a partnership is distinct from a corporation.

If you ask somebody where Ford Motor is located, they're likely to respond by saying, well, what do you mean?  Do you mean their headquarters?  Do you mean the... the plant down the street?  Do you mean the dealership?  It does suggest that located doesn't have the clear meaning that you rely on.   INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You... you concede, though, that if... if the challenge to the underlying contract implicates the arbitration clause as well, that that is for the court and not the arbitrator.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, you know, you put a gun to the person's head and say, sign this contract, and the person does.  It contains an arbitration clause.  They don't have to go to arbitration to challenge that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What... what's wrong with the argument that when you're dealing with a void contract, as opposed to a voidable one, that the State policy is that you don' t enforce any aspect of it?  I mean, if you and I had, you know, a contract for murder and it had an arbitration clause, it' s pretty strange to send that to an arbitrator and enforce part of that contract as opposed to saying that the contract as a whole is void.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But we don't do that with other provisions of void contracts.  I mean, if our contract had a liquidated damages clause... if you didn't go ahead and murder somebody, you'd owe me $1,000... we don't say, well, that part is enforceable even if the contract as a whole is not enforceable.  We treat it as a whole.  Because the subject matter of the contract is illegal ab initio, the whole contract is... is void and illegal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do we usually... do we usually ask arbitrators to enforce broader notions of public policy as opposed to the specific agreements of the party?  In other words, if the reason the contract is void or voidable has to do with broad State public policy, do we... what... what's this... the best you case you have for the notion that arbitrators enforce those types of constraints as opposed to figuring out what the parties agreed to?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no, that's not true.  There may be dozens of other subsidiary issues apart from illegality.  They may say, well, once you determine that it's legal, we think that we're entitled to these damages or those damages or... or the rate should be this or that.  Just because there's a threshold issue doesn't mean there aren't other issues that an arbitrator might decide.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Landau.  Mr. Bland.     F. Paul Bland, Jr.  I think that the question of whether or not this is illegal will be something that's decided by the Florida Supreme Court, but that question... first of all, if this case is sent back to arbitration, the arbitration clause, of course, is on an individual basis and this case could never be pursued on an individual basis.  If it's not done as a class action, it would be the end of the case.  But moreover, the arbitrator is basically free to ignore what the ruling of the Florida Supreme Court is.  You know, there was a ruling from the Third Circuit a few weeks ago that said that glaring errors of law are not grounds for overturning an arbitration decision.  So the Florida Supreme Court could come out and say this is plainly illegal, and then a row of arbitrators could come in and say, seems okay to us, and there's really not going to be a court challenge to that.  So I would not agree with that as a matter of... as a matter of practical reality, Your Honor.  This State law that we're talking about is not about hostility to arbitration.  The rule that distinguishes between void contracts and the small universe of cases that are void ab initio is a rule that goes back something like a hundred years in Florida and it goes back hundreds more years through... it's come up in decisions of this Court.  It has come up in decisions of English courts that go back that were traced by the contract professors.  At the time that the Congress wrote the Arbitration Act in 1925, this distinction was set out in Corbin and in the First Restatement of Contracts.  This is basic, core common law of contracts.  And the idea that in 1925 Congress wanted to throw out all of the basic core rules of contracts and, instead, replace them with some new Federal rule of contract, when they didn't define contract, and when they put it as a precondition before the act applies, the idea that general rules of State contract law are going to be tossed overboard is really going to be a dramatic change for this Court... for this Court' s jurisprudence.  In case after case, this Court has said arbitration clauses are as enforceable as other contracts, but no more so.  And that was the basis of this Court's ruling in the EEOC v. Waffle House case just a few years ago.  Just like petitioner here, the Waffle House was saying arbitration clauses are sort of super contracts.  They are something so many businesses have relied on, as Justice Breyer says, that they are... that they are treated by a different and better set of rules.  These are contracts which are just better and more important than other contracts.  And this Court stopped and, in Justice Stevens' opinion in the Waffle Case, said slow down.  First, you just have to treat these like other contracts.  And here, there's no signature line for the EEOC.  The EEOC didn't sign on.  We're going to treat this like another contract, and by a 6 to 3 vote, this Court found that you couldn't enforce it.  They want to put the cart before the horse.  They want to enforce this Arbitration Act before its terms were met.  That is not what this Court did in Prima Paint.  Prima Paint did it right.  They said section 2 first and only if section 2 applies, then do we jump to the next point, you know, sort of dinner before dessert.  And that was the appropriate approach because you have to find out if section 2 is there and cross that threshold before you start saying now that we're in the Federal Arbitration Act, how much fun would it be to apply section 4, the part that keeps talking about the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to cases in State court proceedings and apply a decision that was based entirely on language in section 4 to State court proceedings.  That is simply an enormous expansion of the law in this area, and we urge the Court strongly to affirm the decision below.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Bland.  Mr. Landau, you have 4-and-a-half minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But State law... the supposition is that State law provides that in this case, the usury context, whatever, you do not have a contract.  That's the difference between void ab initio and voidable.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I... his answer would be, well, you only get to do that if you're under the Federal Arbitration Act in the first place, and if you don't have a contract, then you're not under the Federal Arbitration Act under State law.   ",04-1264
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess what they would say is that there... they insist only that the agreement be to arbitrate, and to the extent there is an agreement to arbitrate, they can enforce section 2, and the arbitrator can decide whether the broader agreement is enforceable.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But almost every State--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --almost ever State will... has an exception for contracts that are void against public policy.  And it's just left to the creativity of the lawyer in any given case to explain why a particular contract is contrary to public policy.  And you would allow that to be shifted from the arbitrators to court presumably based simply on an allegation, well, the contract is void, it's against public policy.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But there's no... but... but why do you assume that that underlying illegality taints the arbitration clause?  I mean, take the arbitration clause that you would find in a perfectly normal contract, and if you put it in the... the contract of the sort that you're hypothesizing, I don't see why this underlying substance of the contract taints the enforceability of the arbitration clause.

And yet, the Court reached the opposite result there.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  One that requires the court to raise it sua sponte, even if it's not raised by the State.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  One that requires the court to raise it sua sponte, even if not raised by the State, correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it wouldn't--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --be an abuse of--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --It wouldn't be an abuse of discretion for him to suggest an amendment if he's got the opportunity to rule on the amendment later on.  And then presumably the ruling would be reviewed for abuse of discretion.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then why doesn't that same standard apply to the decision of the Court to raise it sua sponte?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Kise.     Christopher M. Kise  --moves in the other direction.  And it is only recently that they have done that.  If the Court has no further questions, thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Hallward Driemeier, we'll hear now from you.       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--  There is nothing in either the habeas rules or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that deprives the District Court of its authority sua sponte to recognize the untimeliness of a habeas petition.  To the contrary, to the extent the rules speak to the issue at all, they confirm that in light of the significant social cost of Federal review of State Court convictions, the Federal Courts have a unique responsibility to weed out unmeritorious claims and to enforce the limitations on habeas review.  Rule 4 imposes an obligation on the court to dismiss unmeritorious petitions without even calling for an answer by the State.  Now, Rule 4 is not applicable here, but the absence of an obligation to note the deficiency sua sponte does not connote a prohibition on acting sua sponte; rather, it suggests that it lies in the court's discretion.  That is exactly how this Court addressed similar question in Granberry, where it rejected the two extremes... one, recognizing the limitation as jurisdictional, that the court was obligated to raise it sua sponte, but also rejecting the opposite extreme, that the court was prohibited to address an issue that had not been preserved in the District Court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But with respect to some--     --was asserting--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --of those, of course, AEDPA specifically promulgates new rules about when they're waived, and not.  And they... Congress hasn't done that with respect to the statute of limitations.     --That's right.  And obviously, as the State suggested, if the State didn't want to stand on the statute of limitations defense because, for example, it was particularly messy, there was going to be a lot of litigation about equitable tolling, it would in inappropriate for the court to insist on litigating that issue.  But if, for example, the State said,  ""Well, you know, if we didn't stand on this defense, instead this Petitioner would go back to the State Court, and the State's Courts are going to be very hospitable to this claim. ""  ""We think you're more likely to deny relief, so we'd rather have it litigated here. ""  it would inappropriate for the State to try to force the Federal Court to litigate that issue instead of the State Court.  These are all fact specific, case specific considerations.  And that's what the Court did in Granberry.  It remanded... after setting aside both extreme positions, it remanded to the Court of Appeals for a case specific application of discretion.  As to the question of whether the Eleventh Circuit here believed that there was an absolute obligation, I think that it's relevant to note that, although there was one point at which it said,  ""The court was obligated to enforce the statute of limitations. ""  --and, of course, that's true if the State has preserved the defense... there were three other points in the Court of Appeals opinion where it used discretionary or nonmandatory language.  For example, at petition appendix 4(a), the court said that the District Court ""may dismiss"".  At the petition appendix 5(a), it said that the State's failure to raise ""does not bar"" the court from acting sua sponte.  Again, at petition appendix 6(a), the State's concession, quote,  ""does not compromise the authority of the District Court. ""  All of those are phrased in more permissive language--   ",04-1324

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, can they have it... would it be an abuse of discretion in an express waiver case as opposed to a forfeiture case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why doesn't your position on the underlying merits of the timeliness question create an incentive for every habeas petitioner to file a cert petition?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --you only get the extra 90 days if you actually file, under your explanation for why this cert petition is... why this habeas petition is untimely.  In other words, if this individual had filed a cert petition with us, his petition... his habeas petition would be timely.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, where... where in the record is the testimony of the FBI agents that you were referring to?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where... where do you think it says you have to overcome the prosecution's case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's a... it's a factor that's considered in weighing the admissibility and relevance of the third party guilt.  They don't... you don't have to prove and rebut and overcome, as you've said a couple of times, the prosecution's case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you say you don't object to the... the Gregory standard, and the Gregory standard is the one Justice Souter just quoted, raise a reasonable inference as to his own innocence.  Now, how can you tell whether it raises a reasonable inference in a vacuum without regard to the evidence on the other side?  If the evidence on the other side is... I understand you dispute it in this case, but let's say unobjectionable DNA evidence that your client was the person there, and his third party guilt evidence is it wasn't me.  How can you tell whether that creates a reasonable inference or not without looking at what's on the other side?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, not at all.  What you're saying is that the evidence has to be... the admissibility of evidence has to be assessed in light of the circumstances.  If your claim of innocence is, as it may be in this case, that the DNA evidence doesn't show what you think it shows, fine, that evidence comes in.  If the evidence you're trying to get in is somebody in the jailhouse said he heard that somebody else did it, and the... and you don't challenge the DNA evidence that places your client there, then maybe that doesn't create a reasonable inference, while it might in a different case, depending on the nature of the prosecution's evidence.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's the... that's the problem.  That's why this is a special category of evidence.  It's not any evidence.  It's third party guilt evidence because that's evidence that any defendant could try to introduce in any case.  In any case, the defendant can say somebody else did it and compile whatever kind of evidence he can get, whether it's jailhouse informants or... or whatever, where the person who did it was often somebody who's just recently died and... and is not there to present an alibi of his own.  In every case the defendant can come up with this evidence, and so you have a special rule that's designed to deal with that.  And all, it seems to me, that the State court decision is saying, when you look at the prosecution's case, is if... if the prosecution's case makes that an... unreasonable under the Gregory test that you agree with, the reasonable inference, if it's unreasonable to suggest that somebody else did it, doesn't mean that you're guilty.  You may have all sorts of other claims that you can make, but you just don't get to present that type of evidence because of the susceptibility of prejudice and the susceptibility of fraud and all that kind of stuff.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You mean on... in your case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you say in... you cited us to footnote 8 in the court's opinion, and it says that your claims do not eliminate the fact that 99.99 percent of the population, other than your client and the victim, were excluded as contributors to the DNA evidence that was found.  Do you... is... is the court wrong in saying that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Blume.  Mr. Zelenka.       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--  The Constitution guarantees criminal defendants under the Due Process Clause, Compulsory Process, and Confrontation Clauses a meaningful opportunity to present a defense.  A defendant's right to present relevant evidence is not unlimited, however, but is rather subject to reasonable restrictions.  State courts as rulemakers have broad latitude to establish rules excluding evidence so long as they are not arbitrary or disproportionate.   ",04-1327

Roberts, Jr.  If your... if your arguments are right, isn't that going to typically be the case?  In which case, why do you need a presumption at all?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are you conceding that the presumption makes no sense outside of the requirements metering context?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, didn't they do that?  Didn't they do that in the Patent Misuse Reform Act?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But isn't it logically inconsistent for Congress--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --to say that a patent is insufficient evidence of market power in the misuse context and then just turn around and say, but if you're having a straight lawsuit under antitrust, it is sufficient as a presumption?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it gets back to how important you think and how... whether it's true or not that the market power is the heavy lifting, as far as all these screens go.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But isn't... it's in fact easier for you here.  You can go down to the Patent Office and see what they've distinguished as... the sense in which their product is an innovation and why it's not just like the other products that might be available that you could use.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of course, the reason that the Federal Circuit has devised this additional test or gloss on Graham is that they say obviousness is, it's deceptive in hindsight.  In hindsight everybody says, I could have thought of that; and that you need... if you don't have the sort of constraint that their test imposes, it's going to be too easy to say that everything was obvious.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't have a motive to answer that question right away.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Dabney.  Mr. Hungar.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you understand motivation to refer to in that test?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well when you talk about the statutory focus, your innovation test... I mean, do you regard that, is that a legal conclusion of nonobviousness?  Or is it an additional test beyond what the statute requires?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Hungar.  Mr. Goldstein.     Thomas C. Goldstein  That would be a motivation.  That's absolutely right, why you would want to improve on the part.  The Federal Circuit said that you would never do it in the way that was described here.  You may be able to prove it some other way on a remand.  This was a very specific motion, and the Federal Circuit faithfully addressed the claim of obviousness that was presented to it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you.

Roberts, Jr.  It adds a layer of Federal Circuit jargon that lawyers can then bandy back and forth, but if it's... particularly if it's nonexclusive, you can say you can meet our teaching, suggestion, or motivation test or you can show that it's nonobvious, it seems to me that it's worse than meaningless because it complicates the inquiry rather than focusing on the statute.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, which way does that cut?  That just indicates that this is profitable for the patent bar.  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where in claim 4 do you say it's putting it together in a particular way?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right, page 8.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Exactly.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's because the Federal Circuit's approach focuses narrowly prior to our grant of certiorari, allegedly more flexibly after, on prior art, as opposed.  To I would say common sense.  And so they say we have to find something in prior art to show that this was non... that this was obvious.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And just... what makes it nonobvious is that it's attached to a nonmoving piece?   John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So wouldn't it be more accurate to say that it's protected the right to be free from unreasonable entry as opposed to unreasonable search and seizure?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Moran, how... how long do you think the officers had to wait before they could have entered?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What would... if they had done that, what would have been different from what happened in this case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why do you presume that?  Someone sitting in a chair with gun... with a gun and the drugs you say would have gotten up and said, oh, it's the police.  Let's see what they want?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't a good sign of what might have happened what actually happened when the police came in, which was there was an effort to hide the evidence?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought... where... where were the drugs found?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where was the gun found?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In the chair?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there any reason to suppose that if the officers had waited 15 seconds instead of the 3 to 4, that they wouldn't have found the same evidence?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the only... the only reason they wouldn't have found the same evidence, I take it, is if they... if... if the defendants had had additional time to dispose of it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's not true.  There are cases where the violation of the knock and announce rule gives rise to evidence that may be admitted and that would presumably be excluded if you can show that the seizure is related to the violation.  The problem here is that the evidence that is being suppressed, as... as you've suggested, that there's no question that it would have been available if the officers had waited 15 seconds as opposed to 4 seconds.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The Solicitor General hypothesized one in the amicus briefs.  If somebody... you know, they... they burst in and someone screams, you know, run away, it's the police, that excited utterance caused by the absence of a knock and announce would presumably be related to the violation and could be suppressed.  That doesn't mean that the gun and the drugs that are found in the room is in the same category.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What it is is recognizing that if there is a fruit of the illegal act, it is suppressed so that there is a cost to the illegal act.  What it's saying is that not everything that happens after the illegal act is a fruit of the illegal act.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  A particularized showing of what?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I'm vaguely recalling cases from the court of appeals in the D.C. Circuit that accepted a presumption that if there are drugs around, there are likely to be firearms around.  Are you saying that that's inconsistent with the Richards decision?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But those doctrines that you're talking about would be overridden on the hypothetical that you want us to be concerned about.  In other words, you're saying if you don't suppress the evidence, there's going to be no incentive to comply with the law.  So they're going to deliberately violate the law.  Well, if they're deliberately violating the law, qualified immunity isn't going to help them very much.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Moran.  Mr. Baughman, we'll hear now from you.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You think there... you think there was a violation of the knock and announce rule in this case.  Correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do you draw a distinction between two cases?  If they illegally entered and they suddenly said we waited 4 seconds, it was supposed to be 15.  They say, never mind.  They go back out.  There's another knock.  They wait 15 and they come in.  Then it's all right.  Correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  But you're saying it's a world of difference if, when they go in and enter and they say, we should have waited 10 more seconds, we're the police, we're here to execute a search warrant, let's count to 10, then all of a sudden, it's invalid from there on.  Those are the... they're two different cases in your mind?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.                                    Hudson v. Michigan Oral Argument - January 09, 2006   John G.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you don't dispute that the purpose of the knock and announce rule is not to allow the targets of the search to dispose of evidence, or anything of that sort.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it's a limited privacy right, of course.  These people have a warrant, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, how would you describe the privacy interest that the knock and announce rule is protecting?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, it doesn't go at all to the items that are the target of the warrant.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And so, why should the remedy for the violation be to exclude those items?  The privacy that's protected isn't the cocaine, the weapons, the other items that were discovered.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, it's to protect privacy in the possessions and papers and effects.  And these are possessions, papers, and effects.  It goes right to what the police are trying to seize, and you have an independent magistrate make a determination that there's probable cause to believe it, et cetera, et cetera.  The knock and announce rule is an entirely... concerned with entirely different things.  And yet, you're enforcing it by excluding the papers, effects, and possessions.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You mean, if you had a case where the reason you were arresting the guy is because he's shot through the door the last three times somebody knocked and announced, you still have to knock and announce, under Michigan law?

Roberts, Jr.  Yes, so it's a old hydroelectric plant, it uses a simple waterwheel.  I mean, is that... does that fit your definition of a ""discharge""?  In other words, it restrains the water temporarily.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And then it releases it again as it passes by the wheel.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, if you put a waterwheel in a flowing river, under your definition, that's a discharge into the navigable water.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that doesn't... but that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --But that doesn't matter to your analysis.  It's the one post, right?  I mean, if you have just sort of a foot indentation on either side, would... the flows, in... under your view, suddenly becomes a discharge.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --we're trying to--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --define--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --a statutory term that's going to apply in a wide variety of cases.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then... but your focus... in response to my question about what would constitute release, you focused on the fact of impoundment, a restriction of the flow.  It seems to me that the ladle analogy that the Court has made part of the law of the land is... refutes that, because if it's hold... you're holding it up in the ladle, that's like an impoundment.  You've separated it, to that extent, from the other body, and the Court said, when you pour it back in, that's not--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --that's not a discharge of a pollutant--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --and there was no dispute that there were pollutants, so it must mean it wasn't a discharge.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --you don't... you don't value it as much as FERC does, though, do you?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, isn't one way to look at this... I mean, the concern is that your constituents probably have a higher priority and a greater concern with the environmental consequences of generating power, while FERC's priority is to make sure that we have sufficient power.  And you're likely to weigh these competing uses in very different ways.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Thank you, General Rowe.  Mr. Minear.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I was--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --surprised, in a case involving a FERC license condition, that no one from FERC signed on to your brief.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if it's a case involving a FERC license, and FERC isn't there, I think it says a great deal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you know what FERC's--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Do you know what FERC's position is--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --in this case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm sure of that, and it involves a reconciliation of--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --competing positions.  Is there anything that FERC has issued that is illuminating with respect to their view?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you agree that a State could adopt water quality standards that would, in effect, preclude hydroelectric power in the State?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Saying,  ""It is of utmost importance to us to provide habitat for spawning salmon, whatever, dams interfere with that in a way we find objectionable, so we're going to go a different direction, as a matter of power policy for the State of whatever, and not allow hydroelectric power.

We believe that under almost any system, incumbents are going to still have advantages and no campaign finance system can fully address that.

I'm reading from page 13... that the record convincingly shows that the ties among donor groups and elected officials often determine the positions officials take.  Can you give me an example of an official who took a position because of the ties to donor groups?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your position is that that official's official positions were determined by the donor groups, as you say in your brief.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, your brief says determined.  And did... did you--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --So it should say influenced rather than determined.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How many prosecutions for political corruption have you brought?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you think that political corruption in Vermont is a serious problem?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Would you describe your State as a clean State politically or as a corrupt one?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And they can... and presumably they act accordingly at the polls.  If they think someone has been bought, I assume they don't reelect the person.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is... is an affidavit from the candidate enough credible evidence in your view?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. Wright.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I thought--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --when you look at the... the record, Vermont would be the last place that you'd be worried about it.  The political culture, as we just heard, is that it's easy to go door to door, and that's what the Vermonters expect.  And it doesn't take an arms race to get on your feet and go door to door.  And it seems to me that there's a real dilemma on the respondents' side of the case between justifying low limits by saying you don't really need money to run effectively and at the same time suggesting that there's a serious problem with too much money.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you did file a challenge to the probate of the will, didn't you, in Texas?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And wasn't the ground for that that it would be inconsistent with the inter vivos trust that you are asserting in the bankruptcy court proceeding?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But... but this case involves a lot more than convenience.  It involves a substantial amount of assets that is either going to pass to one person under probate or is not going to be available for passing to that person because of the inter vivos gift.  That seems to be more closely related to the core probate matters.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. Maynard.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Except if it's a will... will-specific.  In other words, you... it seems to me you're in for a penny and in for a pound.  You recognize the existence of this exception in certain cases, and then you argue against it by saying, well, Congress wrote the statutes broadly.  The latter argument disproves your first point.

Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I don't... I don't see how the interference with the probate court that you're articulating is any greater than the interference in Markham.  In Markham, it was a decision by the Federal court that these claimants were not going to claim under the will.  Why is... isn't that even greater than the interference you're complaining of?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but she's not... she's not even going after the assets in this case.  She's asserting an in personam claim against the individual.  Correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The... the only court I've heard of that can do that is the Federal bankruptcy court.   INTERRUPTING ",04-1544
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought your point was that it was not an issue after the election.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Were you taking a position on this issue prior to the election time frame?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Had you taken out advertisements prior to that time frame?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Souter.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does the... does the FEC draw... distinguish between sham ads and genuine issue ads?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Bopp.  General Clement, we'll hear now from you.     Paul D. Clement  --Absolutely, Justice Stevens.  And of course, an even position one step intermediary from that or one step backtracking from that would be to say that all Congress can do in this area is regulate those ads that are unambiguously election oriented.  And, of course, what's the class of those ads?  Well, that would be express advocacy.  And the one thing that I think is clear from this Court's decision in McConnell is this Court made clear that express advocacy is not a constitutional line.  Congress is not disempowered to go after mixed ads that are... yes, they have a component of issue ads, but you bet you they're intended to influence the election.  Those ads are what are at issue here, and I think in order to be able to regulate those in a way that makes sense, the key is to regulate in a way that's not vague, that's not overbroad, but is not so under inclusive that it can be easily evaded.  And I think Buckley shows how hard that is.  It's a tall order.  In Buckley, this Court had a provision of FECA that prohibited independent expenditures related to a candidate election.  The only way the Court could save that provision from the vagueness concern was to limit it to express advocacy.  But having done that, the Court said, well, it's so limited, it's so easy to evade, we're going to find that it fails strict scrutiny.  In McConnell, this Court said that in BCRA, after careful study, Congress had actually found out a way to avoid those three pitfalls.  All of the proposed alternatives of... of appellants run headlong into one or more of those obstacles.  Look at the tests they've proposed.  They've proposed looking at 16 factors, 4 details.  They disclaim any interest intent, but any of those tests I think would be vague and unworkable.  In contrast, they pluck a definition from the IRS regs that is designed to deal with 501(c)(3) corporations in a completely different context or a modification of a proposal by BCRA's sponsors, and they... and they put those tests out there.  And those would be very, very easy to evade in practice.  In fact, I think if you use some of the tests that they propose or their amici proposed and you look at the body of ads that were before this Court in McConnell, you'd end up finding that a substantial percentage of them were grassroots lobbying.  Well, if one thing has to be inconsistent with this Court's decision in McConnell, it's the conclusion that a substantial amount of the ads covered by this definition are unconstitutionally regulated because this Court clearly rejected a substantial overbreadth claim.  The one thing I would say in... in closing is to understand that Congress, having sort of voided these very difficult pitfalls of vagueness, overbreadth, and easy evasion, came up with this definition in title II.  But as this Court recognized in McConnell, title II of the statute does not stand alone.  It is part and parcel of the broader regulatory regime here.  And without title II, title I's limitations on soft money contributions to parties will succeed only in taking that soft money and directing it to corporations that are closely aligned with candidates or with the parties themselves.  This statutory as applied challenge that you have before it... you strikes at the heart of the McConnell decision and at the heart of BCRA's title II.  This Court should reject the invitation to revisit the McConnell decision and should give Congress' effort in this area a fair chance at success.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.  Mr. Bopp, you have 4 minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",04-1581
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  In McConnell against FEC, you stood there and told us that this was a facial challenge and that as applied challenges could be brought in the future.  This is an as applied challenge and now you're telling us that it's already been decided.  It's a classic bait and switch.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there any other case that you can cite where we've upheld a facial challenge and then later said that an as applied challenge was barred by our ruling on the facial challenge?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Like Justice Stevens, I think that's a yes or no.  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, that's a very different question.  That's interpreting the scope of Congress's power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The issue is whether it's limited to the constitutional violations or sweeps more broadly.  If you conclude that it sweeps more broadly, it's not suggesting that an as applied challenge can be brought by someone who's covered by the broader sweep.  That's a very different question.  Is there any First Amendment case where we've said this is facially valid and then said as applied challenges can't be brought?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it would be like in any of those cases where you have a... a broad prohibition and you say, yes, there may be situations where it's unconstitutional, but the statute is valid on its face.  And then someone comes in and says, well, my situation is one where it's unconstitutional.  We've never said, well, it's too bad because it's valid on its face, have we?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So let's say you had an organization that every month of every year it took out an ad the first week of every month, and it said the same thing and it said, contact your Senators.  This issue is important to us.  And they do that every month.  All of a sudden, their ad's nature changes because an election is... happens to be coming up and it's illegal the month before the election, even though it was clearly something that they did without regard to the election.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If we want to place an ad in October, the solution is to place an ad November through September, and then we're okay.  And the only reason we're going to do it November through September is so we can do it in October?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's a pretty broad definition of a sham.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But on an issue like this, the filibuster, it's the Senators who are doing it, and their ad referred to not only the Senator who was up for election, but the one who was not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That may be because the people who were doing the filibuster were the Senators.  It's not... it's not a surprising thing to link the Senators to that issue.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The fact that it mentions both... the fact that it mentions both Senators strongly suggests to me that it's concerned about the issue because one of the Senators wasn't up for election.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if you're trying to influence the Senators who are presumably or possibly in their home State during a recess, that's perfect timing to influence the Senators who are the ones engaging in the filibuster--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --without regard to whether they're running for election or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I've lost track of it.  Your... your answer to Justice Breyer's hypothetical about Bread for the City and the hurricane and all that is that that would be an illegal ad?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Both of those examples, of course, are quantities, and once you... I think it was Holmes who said, once you admit the necessity of drawing a line, you know, you can always find something on one side or the other.  It's quite different between $1,000 and $2,000 or 100 feet and 75 feet and advocacy with respect to an election and advocacy with respect to an issue.  It's an entirely different quality of a distinction, it seems to me.   ",04-1581
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I assume it's... I assume it's sort of a... a case by case inquiry.  In other words, the county could be an arm of the State for some purposes but not others.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's just a... it's just a close textual reading of the Eleventh Amendment.  Right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It says a State.  It doesn't say county.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Himmelfarb.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't doubt that a county could have sovereign immunity if it qualified as an arm of the State in a particular instance.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your... your friend in the... in the red brief, though, reviews a lot of old cases, suggesting at the time of the founding, that counties were not subject to suit.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb.  Mr. Hart.     R. Jonathan Hart  Well, it's a function that historically in the Constitution was recognized would be a function on behalf of the State with the counties.  And... and it has traditionally historically been a function of the States to build roads and run bridges.  And in regard to that, you're talking about navigable waters, and the State has an interest in its own navigable waters.  They're delegating a function of the government to build a bridge over their navigable waters and the soils thereunder.  So we would take the position there that... that that is a core sovereign function, that the navigable waters are a sovereign interest of the State, and that should have the dignity and respect of that.  The design of the Constitution was that there would be dual sovereignty created both in federalism and under State sovereignty.  There's not a single case you all are going to have that's going to be able to define all the principles of general sovereign immunity, but we think this is a situation in which the Court, by making a holding in in personam actions, can recognize the State's residual immunity, not so much focus on the Eleventh Amendment and the cases thereunder, but try to come up with a set of principles that you can begin talking about the whole of general sovereign immunity.  And we do not necessarily agree that the... the State... the arm of the State test has to apply in all situations.  We think this is an exception.  It's a narrow exception.  Core sovereign functions are going to be narrowly defined, especially when a county is acting.  You're going to have to support it with some history.  You're going to have to support it with some State dignity where the State has given a clear indication through their State laws that it's a function that the county ought to do, and... and that needs to be respected from the standpoints that States are given wide latitude in the way that they set up and run their government.  And we respectfully request that you make a finding that we have the right to have sovereign immunity in this particular narrow set of circumstances involving navigable waters as... as it stands.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Hart.  Mr. Estrada, you have 8 minutes remaining.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're... are you suggesting that the... the State would enjoy sovereign immunity in proprietary activities?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I would have thought, particularly when we're talking about the arm of the State doctrine, that the... the nature of the activity is one of the key questions we look at.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maintaining bridges is one thing.  You know, operating a for profit activity would be something else.   ",04-1618
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  That was... in many of those cases cited in your brief, it was because the duties they were performing they were performing pro bono publico.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And the doctrine extended immunity to them on that basis, not... not as sovereigns.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm not sure that operating bridges at the time of the framing was a core sovereign function.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  There are an awful lot of private bridges.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the... the court of appeals has said that you weren't asserting that you were an arm of the State.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  All that establishes is simply that if the State were operating this bridge and if the State were on the hook for any judgments and if the State had control over the people who were making the decisions, that there might be an issue of State sovereign immunity.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The whole problem is that it's the county that's doing all that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the State doesn't pay the damages.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The State doesn't tell you how to do it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's a different question.  The immunity looks to where the money is going to come from to satisfy a judgment.  I don't think it looks to where the funding came from in the first instance.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's the claim on the treasury of the judgment that raises the sovereign immunity issues.   ",04-1618

Roberts, Jr.  So, if you want us to piggyback, we... and if it is an Article III question... we would have to decide that issue before we can decide whether we can piggyback your current claims onto it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  And you agree that the--   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, that--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --would seem to present the same Commerce Clause problem that you're posing for us today.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Some States... Counsel, some States have homestead exemptions to property taxes for people when they're buying homes in the State.  That... those would be invalid under your theory?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --that person may have another piece of property in the... in the other State.   INTERRUPTING John G.

""  It would seem to me very similar to what you're challenging here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, it's imposing tax on property in the State at a higher rate if it's not the person's homestead; in other words, if they don't live in the State.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Let's say he gets out of the prison 1 hour every other day.  Should they have taken that hour out?  I mean, not out of the prison.  Out of his cell.  Should they have taken that hour away, or what... what other options do they have?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right, and I want you to tell me--   John G.

I mean, yes, they could... maybe they could prohibit religious journals as well, but they... for various reasons, they decided not to do that.  Maybe they could have eliminated legal materials as well, but again, they decided not to do it.  They take a more circumscribed approach.  So I'm not sure it's a very effective response to say, well, they let religious materials in and that can be used as well.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  --What if, instead of the half hour or so, 24 hours had passed and they got a call from the defendant, said, ""I want to talk now""?  Still, is that... is that initiation on his part?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --if you can--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I would have thought--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I would have thought you would have said, then, 24 hours doesn't make a difference.  If there can never be a cure, if there's a violation because the question from Reese constitutes interrogation, and you're telling us there's no cure, it doesn't matter how long it is.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, assuming--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --there was--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --assuming there was overreaching on the part of Officer Reese, my question is, Is there any circumstance in which that overreaching can be cured?  And I thought your answer is that, yes, that with the sufficient passage of time, it can be cured.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, once Officer--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --once Officer Reese made his comment, there was no circumstance, even a week, a month... relatives come in and say,  ""We think you ought to talk. ""  no intervening circumstance... once there is that one sentence of overreaching, he can never initiate contact... discussion with--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --the police.

Roberts, Jr.  --to me that it's a bit much to say that the problem is that the... he didn't talk to Blake directly, because that gets into another extended dialogue with the defendant that the defendant has not initiated.  It seems it's much better, in the defendant's presence, to do what Johns did here, which is to rebuke Reese for the interrogation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, there's no dispute about the historical facts found by the judge.  Everybody agrees this is the dialogue that took place, this is the time that it took place.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Those are factual questions.  It's a very different question of what the significance of that is under the Edwards initiation rule.  So, it's not an issue of deference to the trial court judge.  We know what the facts are.  We're deferring to those findings of fact.  It's a question of what the legal significance is.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, just to... stop there.  Why is the trial court better suited to apply the Edwards rule to a set of facts that we would... we accept based on deference to the factfinder?

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Frederick, I understand how your arguments work under section 1962(c), but how... how do they work under 1962(a)?  It seems that that gets around many of the causation and reliance arguments that you make.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But 62(a) gets to the reinvestment of the illicit proceeds in a... in an enterprise, and here you have the opening of the facility right next... not right next door... nearby the other facility.  And it seems to me all they have to show is that the proceeds used for that were illicitly procured.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it's not--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I think the reason Justice Breyer's test is a little more administrable than you're willing to admit is that it's not a question of motive.  You're not asking why they did it.  You're asking where the predicate act is directed, and if the predicate act is directed to lowering the... the firm's taxes so that it can compete more aggressively, that's one thing.  If the... the predicate act is directed to, you know, blowing up the other firm's warehouse or... or, you know, something like that, it's a different matter altogether.   ",04-433X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if they're tax free they might.  [Laughter]  I mean, that's the whole point is that the--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --the fraud gives him a competitive advantage not just over the, you know... his... his brother in law's company that he's trying to get at, but over everybody who's in the business.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  They're'... they're one more step removed.  I don't know if they're one step removed.  I mean, if there were no allegations of motive or family feud or targeting and all we know is that there are two competitors there and the one underpaid its taxes, is your case still viable?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it doesn't depend on motive or targeting or anything at all.  It just depends on the fortuity of there being two competitors in a particular area.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you've cited the Solicitor General's brief--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --earlier.  The Solicitor General says it's inherent in the concept of proximate cause.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  The Court--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --the Court of Appeals did--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --the Court of Appeals specifically did not address the Mexican American Bar Association speech.  It focused only on the memorandum, correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Lee.  Mr. Kneedler.     Edwin S. Kneedler  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Much of the work of public employees is performed by speaking or writing, and much of that work concerns matters of public interest.  Under the Ninth Circuit's decision, public employees engaged in such work have at least a presumptive first amendment right to perform their jobs as they see fit.  That conclusion rests on a fundamentally mistaken view of the first amendment.  When the Government pays for somebody to do its work, it has an absolute right to control and direct the manner in which that work is performed.  That is a basic rule of agency law, and insofar as Federal employees are concerned, it's a basic rule of our constitutional structure.  Article II of the Constitution gives the President the power and responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.  Effectuation of that power, and effectuation of the principle of accountability that it embodies, requires that supervisors in the executive branch be able to control and direct the work of their subordinates.  The first amendment, which was adopted just a few years after the Constitution, was not meant to interpose the first amendment in that relationship between supervisor and subordinate or otherwise to regulate the internal affairs of the executive branch.  That is the function of civil service laws adopted by the legislature and internal executive branch directives taking into account the relative costs and benefits of certain types of regulation.  And finally--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.  Ms. Robin Vergeer.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Ms. Lee.                                    Garcetti v. Ceballos Oral Argument - October 12, 2005   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We'll hear argument now in Garcetti v. Ceballos.  Ms. Lee.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you do if a public university professor, who... is fired for the content of his lectures?  Certainly, in the course of his employment, that's what he's paid to do.  That has no first amendment protection?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  ""Should not be entitled, presumptively, to first amendment protection. ""  what does that mean?  That there might be first amendment protection, in light of the particular context--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --of the speech?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I would have thought you might have argued that it's speech paid for by the Government, that's what they pay him for, it's their speech; and so, there's no first amendment issue at all.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Ms. Lee.  Mr. Himmelfarb.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it's going to be clear that that's violating your job, and it has an adverse impact on your job related duties, because you're going public, instead of going through the channels.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How comfortable are you that this line you're trying to draw is one that's going to be workable in practice?  I mean, suppose the employee writes a memo, and the boss comes and says,  ""If you don't promise me you're not going to talk about this publicly, you're fired. ""  And he says,  ""Well, I'm not going to promise that. ""  And so, he's fired.  Now, is that internal, or is that external?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --required by his job.  But  ""promise that he's not going to talk about it. ""  is not required by his job.  And this case, kind of, raises the question, because the only reason it's squarely presented on the memo is because the court didn't reach the Brady disclosure or the talk to the bar association that were related to the memo.   INTERRUPTING ",04-473X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think it's probably a bit much to say that the core of the first amendment is internal employee grievances or speech.  And I think the concern on the other side is that you may... as a lawyer, you may have a view of what the... what Brady requires.  Your superior may have a different view.  And just because that disagreement exists doesn't mean that you have a constitutional right to continue to voice your view when your superior has reached a different decision.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but you're just hiding behind the fact that they claimed that it wasn't in retaliation.  Your assertion still puts them in the position of having to defend a constitutional claim on a case by case basis every time there's a disagreement between a subordinate and a superior about, as in this case, what Brady requires.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  There was a disagreement about whether or not his memorandum accurately reflected, in an appropriate way, what was at issue there.  There was a disagreement about the content of the allegations.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that because--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --they're addressed... is it... they're addressed under State and Federal whistle blower laws, or--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --But if--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --none of that were true... if none of that were true, he could still file his complaint.  Presumably it survives a motion to dismiss, and it goes at least to summary judgment.  And that's true in every case of a disagreement between a subordinate and a superior.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --was my point earlier.  They can't make short shrift of those cases, because they're not going to be thrown out at the pleading stage.  They're going to have to progress at least to summary judgment, probably in every case in which an employee is terminated, because now one of his defenses against termination is,  ""You're violating my first amendment rights. ""   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's not--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --the context in which this law developed.  It developed, originally... if you were a public employee, you did not have free speech rights as a citizen.  As Justice Holmes said, you know, you might have the right to speak, but you don't have the right to be a policeman.  So, the ""as a citizen"" part didn't come out of happenstance.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It was recognizing that when you are speaking ""as a citizen"", juxtaposition to ""as an employee"", then you do have first amendment rights.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Robin Vergeer.  Ms. Lee, you have 3 minutes remaining.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  But in Justice--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, if the employee filed a lawsuit claiming a violation of his first amendment rights, you would say that could not be thrown out, on summary judgment, on the ground that the speech was within the scope of his employment.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that would--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --be a dispute of fact, so it probably wouldn't... so it wouldn't be thrown at summary judgment at all.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why doesn't--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --why doesn't Rust answer this question?  I mean, there, it was really... this issue was just outsourced by the Government.  They paid for the speech there, and we said that if you pay the piper, you get to call the tune.  And this is just an insourced... the same question.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  He was writing a memo about why the case should be dismissed.  Wasn't--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --that part of his job?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why is that?  In the... in your hypothetical, the doctor is... it's not his job to challenge the restriction on the Government grant, but that's what he's doing, so that's not part of his job.  Here, it's part of Ceballos's job to explain why the case should be dismissed, and that's what he wrote in his memo.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you do with your friend's response to that, that in Connick the Court characterized Givhan as involving a case of a citizen complaining about a particular practice?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you think he should have lost under the Pickering balance, in that case, if he went public right away?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But Government misconduct... if I get a memo from a law clerk that says, ""Justice So and So's jurisprudence is wacky"", that goes to--  [Laughter]  --that goes to Government misconduct, under your theory, right?  And I fire them, because I think that's not appropriate to put in a memo.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They have a first amendment claim, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I disagree with it.  They think it's... whatever... unprincipled, wrong.  They write me a memo, and I say,  ""Don't write me a memo like that. ""  And they write me another one, and then I fire them.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And they think it's Government misconduct because of the way cases are decided, and that they have a first amendment interest.  What could be more important than how the court decides cases?  And that violates their first amendment rights.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But there was--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --a dispute about that in this case, too.  I mean, it... under the supervisor's view, it may come down to simply whether there were tire tracks or tire rim tracks.  And that's not as serious, in one view, as your client thinks it's serious.   INTERRUPTING ",04-473X

Roberts, Jr.  Well, it is... it is a little unusual to have under your view two different sections, both addressed to the question of the appropriate standard of review in a particular type of proceeding.  They seem either redundant or overlapping.  The theory on the other side at least distinguishes them and argues that they apply in different circumstances.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about the contention in the particular proceeding that the district court... or the State fact finder did not, in fact, make a determination, but simply gave the benefit of the doubt to the prosecutor?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Kennedy, I frankly didn't read it that way.  It just seemed to be he was stating the fact, that it would be an obligation to report.  Clearly, it has some impact on how people feel about the judicial system and the particular lawyer's reputation if the judge were to affirm the motion.  But I... I would expect the judge was doing his job and performing his duties correctly.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.  Mr. Drozdowski, we'll hear now from you.     Mark R.

In other words, the... the trial judge made a credibility determination that that was the reason, the person rolled her eyes, and you're saying, in light of the other explanations, you think the prosecutor is just making that up.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you're saying you don't believe it.  You think there's a different reason, and the rolling the eyes is not the real reason.  And we have a factual determination that the judge believes that that's the reason or a reason.  And under the... the statute, at least that... that's... that either has to be shown to be unreasonable or, under the State's reason, that's presumed to be correct, and you have to show it by clear and convincing evidence.

Roberts, Jr.  Juror 19... you just said earlier the fact that the one juror's uncle had an alcohol problem was... was a legitimate factor.  Juror 19's daughter had a... a cocaine problem and this was a cocaine case.  Isn't that a perfectly legitimate reason for exercising a peremptory with respect to a juror?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe I'm... what... what is the inference you try to draw from the treatment of juror 19?  That the prosecutor wants to... was striking people on the basis of their race or that she had better reasons for 19 than 16?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  But that's just a subsequent deduction.  I mean, if we get income, we're taxed on it.  If we make a charitable contribution, we get a deduction.  But that doesn't mean we don't have to pay and are subject to the income tax.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Your Honor, this would be a very different case if the State had... if the legislature had passed a tax that said,  ""This is a tax on receipt. ""  and we were trying to argue that these... that somehow these exemptions made it not a tax on receipt.  But the legislature has said it is a tax on the  ""use, sale, or delivery. ""  And if I could point to two provisions that I think make this crystal clear, that it is not a tax on receipt, but on the subsequent use, sale, or delivery.  The first is 3417, which provides--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where is--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --and that is--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --where is it?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --at 10(a) in the appendix your honor, that provides that a distributor after he has received the fuel, if he subsequently loses the fuel... has it lost or burned... gets a refund of the tax, if it's... if that happens before he uses, sells, or delivers.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  The other thing that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --works with the income tax, too.  You have casualty losses and things like that.  It turns out you were subject to the tax, but you don't have to pay it, because you get a deduction.  But that doesn't mean you're not subject to it in the first place.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Your Honor, there are... there is literally nothing in the statute except for the incidence provision, which is what the State relies on, that makes this a tax on receipt.  And, if I could, in Central--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the statute says--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --that was, therefore, preempted.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --the statute says it's a tax on the sale, but then it goes on and says it's the first sale, and the first sale is to the distributor, and that's why the incidence of the tax is on him.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  With respect, Your Honor, what part (c) says, which is what you're reading from, it says,  ""the incidence of the tax is imposed on the distributor of first receipt. ""  That is the ""who"".  That is not the ""what"".  The 79-3408(a), and it is clearly imposed on the use, sale, or delivery of the fuel.  If I could, another provision of the statute that also--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But nobody... but it's not sold... it's not taxed twice.  If it's sold to a distributor, that distributor has to pay the tax.  The distributor then sells it to someone else.  That someone else doesn't have to pay the tax.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --That's right, Your Honor.  But the question is, What exactly is the State purporting to tax?  This is a situation in which the State is not being unambiguous... is being unambiguous about what it's taxing.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, did I understand your earlier discussion, about the department store, to suggest that if the tribe had the tanker truck, and they picked up the fuel and then brought it back, that, in that case, you have no objection to the tax, even though the economic incidence and effect is going to be the same?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Your Honor, at that point, Central Machinery wouldn't apply.  I think that would be a closer case for the balancing, in that situation.  The... so, we wouldn't... we wouldn't concede that.  But, in this case, it's much stronger, because the tax is on the reservation.  If I could also just point to one thing that Justice Breyer raised about the... about the exemptions for other States.  What this... what Kansas has done is provide an exemption for every other sovereign that's implicated... for other States, for other countries, for--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Kneedler.     Edwin S. Kneedler  --It could.  But here, the tribe has asserted a sovereign interest in its tax, and that is what is being substantially interfered with.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.  Mr. Olson, you have four and a half minutes left.     ",04-631X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why isn't it the sale between whoever is selling it to the distributor and the distributor?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But none of this... none of this mattered to the tenth circuit, though, did it?  I mean, they didn't care where the incidence was.  They just went right into the balancing, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you think that was wrong.   INTERRUPTING ",04-631X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, I take it your answer to Justice Souter is yes.  In other words, if the mistake that the court made was relying on 1441(b), it was a similar mistake for you, in your opening brief, to put such weight on that language in 1441(b).   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Frederick, earlier you made the point that Lincoln was a proper ""real party in interest"".  I take it that's not critical to your position.  Your argument would be the same if they weren't a real party in interest, wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if they... if they don't have a proper defendant, they should do that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I presume, then--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --that the plaintiff loses, not that you get to have the court find the proper defendant for the plaintiff.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What... I know you contend that's not the case, but let's say there is a in State subsidiary that's completely responsible for all the challenged actions, and the in State plaintiff sues an... only the out of State parent.  What happens in that case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Frederick.  Mr. Joseph.     Gregory P. Joseph  --There is no doubt, Your Honor, this is a Hail Mary pass, because the court had made clear what its decision was going to be.  But Hail Mary passes connect.  And the question is whether or not a real party to the controversy was, in fact, litigating.  And we believe that it was not.  And that... we basically come to the argument that limited jurisdiction means the limits must be respected.  ""Real party to the controversy"" doctrine is an established limit.  There are federalism issues involved, and we submit that the fourth circuit's judgments should be affirmed, because we did not have the real party to the controversy.  Thank you very much, Your Honors.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Joseph.  Mr. Frederick, you have nine minutes remaining.     ",04-712X

That would be a whole different situation, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --good would the... what good would the presumption do if it's just a presumption?  Presumably, if it's a presumption, the prisoner is--   John G.

""  just as, if it looks like he's waited a long time, he's going to say,  ""Well, here's why that delay was reasonable.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, how can you... how can you say that?  We do have a Federal rule and a limitation, and (d)(2) is an exception for time that it's pending before the State Courts.  And if the State Courts aren't going to bother to tell us whether something's timely or not, or pending, giving them a blank check does undermine the Federal interest behind the 1 year limitation period.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why do you think the Federal statute necessarily imports a State standard?  It says that the State postconviction proceeding must be pending.  And California presents an unusual situation, but we interpret that pending is a question of Federal law.  It's not a State standard.   ",04-721X

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't there always a private... I mean, we're talking about tort law... isn't there always a private analog, which is, you know, exercising reasonable care under the circumstances toward people to whom you owe some duty, and you just apply that general principle?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, all right, so if it's a police officer stopping somebody on a highway, it's the same as a private security guard stopping somebody at a... you know, the driveway at a plant or something.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Maynard.  Mr. Cotter.     Thomas G. Cotter  It went off primarily under discretionary function, but then in addressing the Arizona... the Good Samaritan doctrine under Arizona, it relied on the Myers case, which is a case in which... the sixth circuit said that when you have the case... or safety inspections like the Federal... like MSHA, that court would adopt a actor, slash, monitor dichotomy so that there could never be an assumption of duty under... because the Government was only in a monitor function.  And, to the extent that that's at issue, Your Honor, I would think that that would be a question, under State law, of whether the Government had assumed the duty.  And if not under State law, it would be a question under the Federal Tort Claim of whether an... there is an exception that has been met.  And there is no exception.  I think that this Court, in Berkovitz, said that regulatory conduct can be actionable under the Federal Tort Claim if it... the discretion isn't met... or the discretionary exception isn't met.  And in this case there was an absolute obligation to make these inspections and an absolute failure to do so.  Your Honor, if there are... or the Court... if there's no further questions, I'd like to--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Cotter.  Ms. Maynard, you have five minutes left.     John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  In the... in the face of a district court opinion that applied the Good Samaritan statute and threw the case out because no allegation could be made to come within the Good Samaritan statute.  So, it seems pretty clear that they're doing something quite different from what you're suggesting.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But, doesn't that approach... it doesn't make any sense, because you're only looking at half of the equation.  Presumably, if you have a special set of principles for governmental actors, they include immunities and defenses and all that.  And you just want the benefit of the liability, but you don't want, I take it, the immunities and defenses that go along with it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, doesn't that make it a contract case? If you're talking about the party who's contracted with, say, a private inspector... I mean, I have a contract, somebody comes and inspects the house for termites, and I assume, if they don't do a good job and the house is damaged, they're liable.  But that's under contract, and this is a question of tort liability.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but only... presumably, only if they meet the requirements of the Good Samaritan law.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which... they would have to show that there was an increase in the risk of harm, which I think it would not be true in your hypothetical, or that there was a duty owed to the third party... the scaffolding inspector is presumably hired by the contractor, not by the employees... or there was reliance.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, we're just debating now whether or not you've satisfied the requirements of the Good Samaritan statute.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Did you argue... I mean, you lost in the district court on the Good Samaritan statute.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  On your appeal, did you argue that that was wrong?   ",04-759X

Roberts, Jr.  Well, in the Citizens Publishing case, it wasn't a necessary predicate of the Court's ruling there to find that the joint venture was unlawful, was it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the two parties obviously don't compete within the terms of the joint venture, but they compete more generally.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you couldn't have two companies say we're not going to... we're going to have a joint venture on this corner, but in... you know, down the block, we're going to compete, and then it's all right to set prices on this corner but not down the block.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if it's correct... if... if that's correct, what is the difference if the joint venture decides that it's going... they're going to make more money having two separate brands and even though it's Equilon gas, the people are going to think it's different because some people have always bought from Texaco and others from Shell?  It's not going to affect how the profits are distributed.  It's still going to be the same whether it's Equilon gas or Texaco and Shell.  Why does the joint venture lose the authority to set the price of its product?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I concede that it would have been perfectly legal for them to do that if they called all of their gasoline Equilon gasoline because they owned all the gas and the profits are going to be distributed to the owner the same way whether they call them Texaco or Shell.  Why is it suddenly different because they put different labels on the... keep different labels on the gasoline?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't understand that.  I mean, now you're backing away from your concession.  If you have a lawful joint venture that's marketing a product, the joint venture has to be able to set the price of the product.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No. No, if it's... if it's a lawful joint venture and it's selling gasoline... there's no retaining of prior brands... the joint venture sets the price.  And if the... and all those people you said suffered when Equilon did this, those same number of people would have suffered if they're selling Equilon gasoline at a price determined by the joint venture.  It seems to me a very artificial hook that you're trying to hang your case on, which is they retained for presumably legitimate brand competition reasons their separate brands, but that was the decision of the joint venture.  And again, the joint venture has to be able to price its product whether it's sold as Equilon or whether it's sold as Texaco or Shell under... under the same... same joint venture.   ",04-805X

I take it if the... if the postal worker throws the package to the house and there's something in it that gets broken, that's covered by the exception?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  But if... now, if they throw the package onto the porch, and it lands in a place where somebody's going to trip over it, you say that's not covered by the exception.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Or miscarried, like handled in a way that it's damaged, or put in a place where it's going to be damaged.  It seems to me that... I'm not sure what additional weight ""negligent transmission"" covers if you have a reasonable reading of ""miscarriage"".   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, that doesn't work.  I mean, if you deliver it to the house next door, you haven't lost it, you've misdelivered it or miscarried it.  I don't... I don't think ""miscarriage"" is redundant.  But you... your construction of ""negligent transmission"" is so narrow that I'm not sure it adds anything to ""miscarriage"", which suggests it might--   INTERRUPTING John G.

I... following up on Justice Stevens' question, your theory with respect to negligent transmission is that the Postal Service should be liable in the same way that private parties are.  But that theory doesn't hold up when you're talk... that's not your theory.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then, what is your--   INTERRUPTING John G.

They didn't focus on the portion of the preference statute that says you can get the transfer back, you can get the property back.  And as this Court recognized in Bowen versus Massachusetts, just because it is monetary relief doesn't mean that it's money damages.  And that's how we distinguished the Nordic Village case, Your Honor.  The... this Court, I believe, would be extending the Article... its jurisprudence if it permitted the bankruptcy estate not to be able to sue the States.  This Court has recognized that a private citizen, Indian tribes, and foreign sovereigns cannot be sued.  But this Court's never recognized a Federal entity cannot pursue a State.  And this Court... this is a situation where there is no alternative remedy.  We aren't in a situation where we have the ADA, the ADEA, where the EEOC can bring an action on behalf of the Government and on behalf of the individuals to enforce a Federal law.  We have no other enforcement in bankruptcy, other than the collective bankruptcy process, the bankruptcy code.  And the bankruptcy code assigns to the debtor in possession, or to the trustee, the ability to collect on behalf of the estate.  Bankruptcy is unique in its very in rem application and its very narrow and specialized enforcement of the bankruptcy system.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your waiver argument is... is it under 106(b) or 106(c)?  It's beyond both of those, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's an abrogation, that's not--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --a waiver.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, my question would be, How can you argue in favor of waiver when you have a statute with a much more limited waiver, the limits in 106(b) and 106(c), and you're saying,  ""Well, they waived it much more broadly? ""  It would seem to me that the most you can argue is that there was a waiver under 106(b) or 106(c), but that doesn't get rid of the whole case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do we interpret the statute to establish that Congress intended the States to waive their immunity with the filing of the claim?  I don't see that anywhere in the statute.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're arguing that by filing the claim, the State has waived all of its immunity, but I don't see where in the statute it imposes that kind of waiver upon States.  I see where they abrogate the immunity, but that's different than saying that there's a waiver.  Is your argument that just because they abrogated immunity, and it turned out they didn't... may or may not have that authority, they necessarily imposed a waiver?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Well, then where is the waiver of sovereign immunity in this statute?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I thought... you're not relying on 106(b) and 106(c).   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, how do you... how do you have an informed waiver if the argument is over the authority to abrogate?  In other words, the Federal Government is saying, under your theory, that we're abrogating your immunity.  And the State's saying, ""You don't have that authority"".  And how do you get an informed waiver, simply because the State participates in a bankruptcy proceeding, on the basis of the legal theory that they're asserting here today, that Congress doesn't have the authority to abrogate the immunity?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand that.  But your theory, as I read in your brief, as an alternative argument, is that there was a--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --waiver.  The State waived its immunity by participating through... in the--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --bankruptcy proceeding.  How is there an informed waiver if the argument is over the authority to abrogate?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but all the... all the statute does is abrogate.   INTERRUPTING John G.

If you ask me, outside of the context of this case, would I defend that argument?  I probably would try to defend the argument.  But it's obviously much tougher when you only have one head to head.  It's completely different when you're talking about 102 sales to sales comparisons over years, with significant differentials, that clearly caused the kind of injury we have here.

Roberts, Jr.  I thought the Volvo policy was, if you had two dealers competing for the same sale, they gave the same discount to each dealer.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But there's never... but, in those situations, there's never two purchases, there's always one... there's only one completed purchase.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that was for a resale to... that was for resale to different purchasers.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Nobody's buying two--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --nobody's buying two trucks from two different purchasers.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Phillips, when you lose--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --If I may.  When you lose a sale, it's because Volvo didn't give you a big enough discount.  It's not because they gave another Volvo dealer a bigger discount.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, sure, but, I mean, that's... I mean, long term... of course, Volvo can terminate you, as a dealer, tomorrow.  And--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --well, what... but it... under the Robinson Patman Act, it can.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The classic--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --case that the Robinson Patman Act is directed to is when you lose sales because they're giving bigger discounts to other sellers.  And that's just not the case here.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But Volvo's interest may be in as... making as much money off of sales this year, and they may not be terribly concerned about whether you, as a reseller, are making enough profit to last 3 years or 5 years.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're not at the whim of a monopoly seller.  You mentioned to me just a little while ago, you've got a contract with them.  You can put in that contract whatever you want about pricing.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you do with the policy argument... at, sort of, the level of the forest, rather than the trees... that the antitrust laws are designed to prefer competition in interbrand... in the interbrand market, rather than intrabrand, and that, therefore, to the extent there's ambiguity, that supports an interpretation that allows the manufacturer to strengthen his interbrand position, as opposed to protect the intrabrand position?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your argument that focuses on the dealer's profits, I guess, doesn't depend upon you losing those sales at all.  I mean, if you... you had made all the sales, but you still thought you should have gotten a bigger discount that would have allowed you to make more money, you'd have the same argument, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no, you just go back and look again, 7 months or a year down the road, and if somebody else was getting a bigger discount... if you had gotten the bigger discount, you would have made more money on those sales, and then you would have had more capital, and you'd be able to be a dealer for a longer time.

Mr. Wolf.     Richard L. Wolf  And so, the convictions are affirmed.  The jury is going to be instructed,  ""The defendant stands convicted, has been found convicted beyond a reasonable doubt. ""  It is to decide these four questions, did he act deliberately?  Does he constitute a future danger?  And, to the extent the Government puts on evidence that addresses those concerns, we believe we have the right to respond to that.  And also... we also have to remember that the... that the alibi in this case was... really was offered as impeachment of the codefendants.  The codefendants are really the only evidence that links the defendant to these crimes.  And so, to the extent that... it's impeachment by contradiction.  So, while they may find that if the codefendants say,  ""He did A, B, and C. ""  and mom says,  ""No, he was with me. ""  it doesn't necessarily mean that he was with mom, only that they should disbelieve the codefendants.  And that is a... although it seems incongruous, that's standard impeachment by contradiction.  The jury is given an instruction that they're to consider it for the limited purpose of whether or not to believe the codefendants, but not necessarily as substantive evidence of alibi.  And that happens in trials every day.  So, we don't think it's that unusual for the... if the evidence relates to the sentencing questions the jury must consider, then it should come in.  So, the other point that I think is important in this case is that the... you know, the... it's really not unlike this... cases that this Court has held, Sumner versus Shuman, and Skipper.

Roberts, Jr.  You argue in... an eighth amendment case in the Supreme Court, you win on the eighth amendment, then you leave the courthouse and say,  ""Well, I don't want it anymore. ""  and you think that moots the case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's still a decision, binding in this case, giving you the right to admit any evidence on residual doubt in the retrial.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you don't question, or doubt, that the State Supreme Court decision was based on the eighth amendment.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It said that your alibi defense, that had been rejected by the prior jury, was relevant under the eighth amendment.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --that brings up a question I have.  Particularly under the resentencing provision, it looks like the sentencing trial is going to be just a rerun of the guilt trial, because your main evidence that you want to put in is alibi evidence, ""I didn't do it"".  So, you're going to say, ""Here's""... the mother is going to say,  ""I... he was at home. ""  And then, presumably, the State gets to put on all of its witnesses, saying,  ""No, here are the people who saw him do it. ""  and blah, blah, blah.  And so, it's just the same trial all over again.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You want to put that in?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, then what was all the discussion about the mother's having... then, when you go back, you can put on anything, whether it was presented before, or not, right?

Roberts, Jr.  What about the argument, though, that when you're talking about a threshold question like coverage, who the statute covers, that it's quite different from the cause of action cases, many of which you rely on in your brief?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's more a question of... of whether or not the... there's been a violation of title VII.  It seems to me that the number of employee issue is whether you're covered at all, whether you have to conform your conduct to that law.  Your question... your... your case of whether someone has been discharged or not just goes to whether there's been a violation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But in City of... in City of Kenosha, of course, the Court went beyond the jurisdictional grant and it said that the definition of the term person in 1983 raised a jurisdictional question.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But... but maybe... but that doesn't sound like a reasonable agreement.  All you... so you file one sentence saying this person violated title VII.  Are you impliedly including all of the allegations of what constitutes a violation of title VII because if you didn't allege every particular element, it wouldn't be a violation of title VII?  That's not how pleading works.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's true in a lot of areas.  I think of admiralty.  If there's an issue of admiralty jurisdiction that questions whether an injury is caused by a vessel in navigable water, you often have extended litigation over that jurisdictional question.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if 15 years earlier a discriminatory decision was made to give a pay raise of 4 percent rather than 5 percent, and that over the 15 years became the basis with other raises, you think you can challenge the discrimination 15 years later and say well, this was discriminatory because 15 years ago I didn't get a raise and that, carried forward, had a ripple effect into the current 180-day period.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, Congress could have specifically provided for the Equal Pay Act rule under Title VII, but it didn't do that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose all they'd have to do is allege that sometime over the past... I mean, it doesn't have to be 15 years.  It could be 40 years, right... that there was a discriminatory act, in one of the semi-annual pay reviews I was denied this, a raise that I should have gotten.  It may have been 20 years ago.  It may have been 40 years ago.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is that if they just discovered it?  I just learned about what happened 30 years ago at this company and it's... I filed right away.  There's no laches.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But then they have to go back and litigate what happened 30 years ago.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's not your theory.  I mean, if it happened once 20 years ago you have a case that you can bring, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You've got a memo that says we're going to pay, 20 years ago, we're going to pay males this much and we're going to pay females this much, and she says that obviously affected my pay over the ensuing 15, 20 years.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And it's not enough presumably for somebody to come in and even up everybody?  I mean, if you see that the women are making 20 percent less than the men you don't escape liability by paying everybody the same going forward, because perhaps if nondiscriminatory decisions had been made the women would have making 20 percent more than the men.  You have to go back and revisit every pay decision or you're exposed to liability for current pay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is that true?  I mean, it depends.  I suppose it may be harder for the company to mount a defense over time, so it may be to her advantage to wait.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Lorance?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you counsel.

In other words, if you've challenged EPA's refusal to apply a particular level of greenhouse regulation to a particular model of car, can you say, well, they're following the same approach to a coal powered... coal fueled power plant, and so we get to establish a broader injury?  Or, aren't you limited to the specific legal challenge you're raising here?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Don't you have to show injury from their decision here?  The fact that other people, or you presumably as well might be injured by their decisions that you are not challenging here, that doesn't help your standing here, does it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Those affidavits talked about the fact that if the government starts to regulate, the technology is going to change, if the technology changes, other governments will adopt it, and all that, and that strikes me as sort of spitting out conjecture on conjecture, the sort that we disapproved of.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Same argument if the automobile emissions were 1 percent contributors?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is that consistent with our taxpayer standing cases where the argument is that a taxpayer doesn't have standing to challenge an illegal expenditure as a general matter simply because his contribution, the benefit that he's claiming is so small and so widely dispersed?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That assumes everything else is going to remain constant, though, right?  It assumes there isn't going to be a greater contribution of greenhouse gases from economic development in China and other places that's going to displace whatever marginal benefit you get here.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not if your harm is the alleged loss of coastline.  Not necessarily.  It depends upon what happens across the globe with respect to greenhouse emissions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What's your strongest case from this Court to support your standing allegation?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Laidlaw was a specific citizen suit provision, wasn't it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So doesn't that make it somewhat analytically distinct from this case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Moving from your authority argument to the exercise of authority, the clause 202(a)(1) requires EPA to prescribe standards which in their judgment cause or contribute to air pollution reasonably anticipated to endanger public health.  And they say they haven't made that judgment yet, so they're not in violation of that statutory command.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let's say the first day this law is passed, there are a lot of air pollutants that come out of motor vehicles.  I mean, is EPA immediately in violation of this statute if they don't issue emissions regulations for every one those air pollutants on day one?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And presumably the principle that they want to deal with what they regard as the more serious threats sooner.  They want to deal with lead first and then they want to deal with other stuff.  I mean, what is the... when did they... I guess... move into an abuse of discretion in not exercising a judgment with respect to a particular pollutant?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's not all they said.  I'm looking at A-85 and they said establishing emissions now would require EPA to make scientific and technical judgments without the benefit of studies that are being developed to reduce the uncertainty in the area.  That's different than saying they disagree with the regulatory approach.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  There's a difference between the scientific status of the harm from lead emissions from vehicles that... when you have lead in the gasoline, to the status, the status of scientific knowledge with respect to the impact on global warming today?  Those are two very different levels of uncertainty.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Milkey.  Mr. Garre.     Gregory G. Garre  --May I answer the question?  No, Your Honor.

Roberts, Jr.  So it states... would it state an antitrust violation if had you a grocery store on one corner of the block and a pet store on the other corner of the block and you say, well, the grocery store is not selling pet supplies and they could make money if they did, therefore that's an antitrust violation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's all the facts that are alleged.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So then when we get back to the paragraph 51, let me start with your statement at the bottom half of that paragraph, that plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that they have entered into a contract, is a conclusion based upon your prior allegations, it's not an independent allegation of an agreement.  It's saying because of this parallel conduct, because we think it's contrary to their self interest, therefore, they have agreed.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  It's not a statement that independently there apart from all of this, there's an agreement.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But how do you tell?  I mean, companies get proposals all the time.  Here's a way you could make more money.  You could all enter the market in some foreign country.

They keep changing the laws, the regulatory environment.  That's why I didn't jump in and compete?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you don't think you have to prove that either?

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, Mr. Shapiro, you're doing a good job of defending the SEC's interests but your position goes considerably beyond their position today.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Shapiro.  General Clement.     Paul D. Clement  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The United States has responsibility for enforcing both the securities laws through the SEC and the antitrust laws through the Justice Department and the FTC.  It thus has a critical interest in ensuring that these laws can be reconciled in a manner that gives effect to both, and completely ousts neither.  Any effort to try to reconcile those laws in the specific context of the underwriting of IPOs has to begin with an understanding of the particular regulatory context and scheme.  The SEC obviously carefully regulates both the registration and the underwriting process for individual IPOs.  There are two aspects of that regulatory regime that are particularly important: First, the approval for all sorts of collaborative conduct that is the hallmark of the underwriting syndicate.  And second, the very fine nature of the distinctions that the SEC draws between permissible book building activity and impermissible market manipulation.  And in that regulatory context, the kind of collaborative conduct that would in many other contexts raise yellow or red flags of an antitrust violation is innocuous, because it's a hallmark of the underwriting process.  Equally important, the SEC does make certain conduct like tie-ins and laddering unlawful, but very closely related conduct is not only permissible, but is considered beneficial to the capital formation process.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  They might, but they haven't yet.  A couple of times you've used this phrase cutting across IPOs.  Are you saying there should be an absolute immunity from antitrust prosecution within a single IPO?   Paul D. Clement  --Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, I would warn you off of sort of saying absolutely no.  I think as a practical matter, though, it is going to be... I mean, I can't conceive of a ready example of where an allegation that is specific to an internal single IPO would really be practically inseparable.  So I think the role of the antitrust laws will largely be in allegations that cut across IPOs.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General Clement.  Mr. Lovell.     Christopher Lovell  I agree, Your Honor.  I think that the presence here of the SEC complaints, the SEC's fact-finding, saying that things got out of hand during this time and the law was broken on a widespread basis, indicate that we are not coming forth with weak facts.  And I also agree that in the securities context, primary jurisdiction has not had the basis it's had in other legislative contexts where uniformity was desired.  Thank you.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, if the same underwriters get together the next month, they've got a different IPO and they say, you know, let's do the same thing we did last time because seemed to work well in terms of the issuance and the capital formation.  All of a sudden that's an antitrust problem?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your test is it has to be prohibited by the securities laws?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you say to the... sort of stepping back from the trees to the forest, to the general suggestion that Congress has been tightening up the requirements for private securities litigation over the past few years; and you're bringing this now as antitrust claims as a way to circumvent Congress's regulation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the problem... the problem is that, of course, these people are to some extent under the securities laws in the business of fixing prices.  They get together as a syndicate, a syndicate, and say well, you have to figure out what price we're going to charge for this initial public offering.  It looks, if you didn't understand the context, it would look an awful lot like an antitrust violation.  And the problem is, I guess, that... that when you take that type of evidence, the type of evidence you're going to be relying on to show that there's price fixing, it is exactly what the SEC wants the people to do.  They want them to get together.  They want them to agree on an appropriate IPO price that's going to contribute to capital formation and everything else.  And how do you at, as Justice Alito pointed out, at the 12(b)(6) stage, how is a district court supposed to say well, this is the bad price fixing, this isn't the good price fixing?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How did they applaud them?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The SEC which is the agency charged with supervising those markets, thinks otherwise.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  They don't think these, the antitrust actions are good for the securities markets.   ",05-1157

They can wait until the day before the statute of limitations runs.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then they can wait a long time.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the point, the whole point of Heck was to avoid 1983 becoming an end run around habeas.  But here you don't have that problem because you don't have any available relief under habeas under Stone versus Powell.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, it would require overruling our cases that say for tolling, your borrow state law--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --So then you deny the officers the purpose you have for the reason you have statutes of limitation, which is repose.  They are going to wait ten years instead of the two years to find out if they are going to have to answer any claim for damages.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But he's never going to know, in the case where there's no statute of limitations, he's never going to know when his criminal case is going to be over because he may never know when it's going to start.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what happens if he files a suit after one year and then after one year and 350 days he's prosecuted?  His action accrued but then it didn't accrue?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So his action accrued and maybe it's even over, but then it turns out when they bring the prosecution, it should have never have been brought because it never accrued.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Flaxman.  Ms. Solomon.     Benna Ruth Solomon  --A number of courts have reached that result, Your Honor.  Footnote 25 recites five court of appeals decisions to that effect.  But our primary submission in this Court is that regardless of the damages that are available on a Fourth Amendment claim, that the mounting of damages did not delay accrual, and without a timely claim, it doesn't matter what damages the plaintiff is seeking.  The reference in Heck to a claim for damages for unconstitutional conviction, we take to be a shorthand for a claim of some sort of constitutional violation that can be brought through the vehicle of Section 1983 that would enable the plaintiff to recover damages for the incarceration.  1983 of course itself does not create any substantive rights.  The plaintiff needs an underlying claim and in this case of course the plaintiff only has the Fourth Amendment claim.  We do have, in our brief and argument why the Fourth Amendment should not be regarded as allowing those damages, but our primary submission and we do think the Court can decide the case without... without reaching that issue.  The only date to delay an accrual in this case was the date that the charges were nol prossed.  But that date is meaningless for the Fourth Amendment and it is therefore meaningless for accrual.  We would the judgment be affirmed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Solomon.  Mr. Flaxman, you have four minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",05-1240
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose it would make a difference to the officers, a principle of equitable tolling.  They don't know if they're going to be sued for 10 years, 12 years, however long.  Under an accrual rule with a stay, they know whether they're going to be facing a civil action or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  They're not going to waste a lot of time figuring out whether to grant a stay or not when you have a criminal prosecution pending in state court.  I think in most cases... I mean, it's not like they're looking for cases.  They're going to say in most cases: Stay granted, come back when this is over.  They don't have to be... unlike perhaps the situation with an equitable tolling rule, it doesn't matter whether they're precisely right or wrong.  I mean, if it's close enough just stay it, and it doesn't seem to me there's much prejudice from that.   INTERRUPTING ",05-1240

Roberts, Jr.  --based on the conduct to others.  Why wouldn't a normal juror think--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Excuse me.  Why wouldn't a normal jury view that as punishing the defendant for the harm to others?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Frey, I suppose your theory here depends on the nature of the underlying tort, I suppose, in that there are, you argue, defenses that might be available with respect to other, other individuals who are harmed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So this argument wouldn't apply in a case if the underlying tort weren't susceptible to those sorts of defenses.   ",05-1256
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  --you object to in this instruction.  I mean, and I thought our cases clearly established that you can consider the harm to others in assessing the reprehensible nature of the conduct.  You don't disagree with that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  On the other hand, you cannot... on the other hand you cannot punish the defendant for those harms particularly in a case where the defendant might have defenses available with respect to those others.  So I understood what the instruction sought to do is simply try to draw, it's a fine line but the reason it's a fine line is because of our prior cases, and it tried to draw that distinction between assessing reprehensibility and punishing for harm to others.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, because the instructions indicate and juries often do this that punitive damages are certain multiple of the compensatory damages, and therefore that's what they are saying.  In determining what that multiple should be you consider whether they have harmed others.  And this instruction would make all the difference to the world in terms of what lawyers are going to be arguing about.  If you're allowed to punish for harm to others, you say, well, there is however many, a thousand other people in the plaintiff's position, so a thousand times would be perfectly reasonable but you wouldn't say that the conduct is a thousand times more reprehensible.  There is a more, there is a more natural limit on the multiple when you get this kind of instruction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  One way to look at what it meant is what you argued below, I'm looking at the joint appendix page 199(a), the plaintiff's counsel in Oregon to the jury:  ""How many people do you see outside driving home smoking cigarettes? ""  Now, that type of argument is perfectly appropriate to assess reprehensibility.  On the other hand, with the instruction that was offered the defense counsel could have warned the jury keep in mind you can't punish for those other people.  We only have one plaintiff before us and we are assessing the reprehensibility with respect to that plaintiff.  But without the instruction you're allowed to argue how many people do you see in Oregon smoking cigarettes?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That has no--  relevance to the question of the extent to which the defendant is being punished, does it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if they can understand that distinction, why wasn't the defense counsel entitled to argue to the jury just as you argued, you can consider the harm to others in assessing reprehensibility, why couldn't the defense counsel say, but, you can't punish for the harm to others, if as you answered to Justice Alito, a jury can understand that distinction?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think it would have been, putting aside what they proposed, if they had proposed an instruction that said, you may consider the harm to others in assessing how reprehensible the conduct is but you may not punish Philip Morris for the harm to others, you would have had no objection to that instruction?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I make, just to get the ground rules here, you're not asking us to reconsider either State Farm, BMW, any of our punitive damages precedents?   ",05-1256
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  It wouldn't have to have anything to do with pondcrete at all.  The statute just says the information on which his allegations are based.  They don't say the allegations that eventually give rise to a recovery.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's one way to look at it.  Another way would be you would allow a relator in a situation who alleges a particular fraud that causes the government to examine the books and uncovers a different fraud to recover on that basis.  It's an unusual situation to have a jurisdictional prerequisite determined only after the case is over.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you only show that it's wrong at the end, you still say that they should be thrown out.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, his allegation was that this, the design is not going to work.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's not an allegation that's... I mean, it is either true or it's not true.  The fact that you find out after he's left, after he's been terminated, that it doesn't work, I don't see how that should affect the validity of his allegations.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  They were certifying their compliance with the applicable laws--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --based upon their pondcrete design.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The whole purpose, the whole purpose of this legislation is to ferret out fraud on the Government.  I mean, if he makes an allegation that this design is not going to work, the pondcrete is not going to work, and the Government, prompted by his lawsuit, investigates it and finds out that because of human error they're not making it the right way, even if the design does work, he get no credit for that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what about the hypothetical?  Are you suggesting that in a situation like that... we'll talk about whether the facts comport with it later... but in a situation like that, he's not entitled to share in the recovery that the Government eventually receives?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You would, you would change that to say direct knowledge of the information not on which the allegations are based, but on which recovery is eventually... eventually ordered?

Ms. Vullo.     Malcolm L. Stewart  I mean, probably that question would raise no public disclosure issue to begin with, because if there had been no... at least if there had been no public disclosure of the fraudulent conduct that was revealed through discovery, there would be no need for him to satisfy the original source test with respect to those new allegations.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Stewart.  Ms. Mahoney, you have 4 minutes remaining.     ",05-1272
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it is worse than that, though.  This information was not even provided to the government, which the statute requires.  He not only has to have direct and independent knowledge, he has to voluntarily provide that to the government.  And I understand that the Tenth Circuit, to have relied solely on the document at joint appendix page 605, that's the only thing he provided to the government.  And all it says is that this design will not work.  There are a lot of things that don't work, but that doesn't mean there's fraud on the government.  You don't know if they're going to fix it, they're going to change it, use a different design, not make a claim based on that design.  Why is that enough to satisfy the statute?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But he has to... if the information that he provides isn't direct and independent information of the allegations, it would seem that the statute is not satisfied.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't want to get off my question here but did you... do you agree that this page JA 605 was the only information that he provided to the government?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, maybe I'd better phrase it differently.  Do you agree that that is the only information on which the Tenth Circuit relied?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but this... he has to provide this information before filing an action.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I would have thought the allegations referred to the public disclosure.  It talks about public disclosure of allegations, and then says he has to have direct and independent knowledge of the allegations.  So I would assume that's the important linkage.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Vullo.  Mr. Stewart?     John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you mean by connected?  Is it... I got... I'm getting the sense that you think it's enough that he says, look, Rockwell is just lying to the Government in this area, and you say well... what if what if you added a count in your complaint when you intervene on tax fraud?  You found out also that they didn't pay taxes.  Would he be able to recover for that, because, you know, if they're going to lie about pondcrete they're going to lie about taxes.  Is that sufficiently connected?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And it doesn't matter to you if he just, if he's completely wrong?  Let's say he says... you have special interrogatories to the jury and his allegation has always been the pondcrete's going to fail because you're putting in the wrong kind of cement.  And it turns out it has nothing to do with that at all.  The jury says, no, that's not the reason it failed, it failed for another reason.  Is that a sufficient connection?   ",05-1272
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's perfectly all right for them to adopt a new method of testing tar and nicotine that yields numbers that are far lower than the Government's method, and to publish an ad saying these are our tar and nicotine figures, and the FTC would have no problem with that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not just the preferred method, but presumably the only one they would allow.  If you used another one, they would bring a deceptive trade practices action very quickly.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They still might--  have gotten it right.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I understand you have a dispute about whether that is this case, but there are many areas where the Government requires testing of products.  You know, the strength of seat belts and stuff, and they specify very precise means to which those tests have to be conducted.  And if someone, a manufacturer is complying with those requirements, and a challenge is brought, saying something to the effect that that test doesn't give you a good measure or something, in that situation would this removal provision apply?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if the Government says you've got to test your cars, you know, every three months or something, and you've got to send us the results of a random... random test?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that doesn't seem to be a distinction.  The drug companies... the Government wants to make sure that drugs are safe and effective and so they issue regulations saying here's how you have to test it.  They're just, you could say, delegating the testing to the companies.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  There's a difference between you are providing products and complying with testing.  In other words, and if, in fact, the Government specifies precisely how the testing is supposed to be done to determine whether it, the Government, will approve the marketing of a particular drug, and the challenge, the litigation is to the testing.  Somebody sues as drugs company and says you know, you tested this drug wrong, we think you should have tested it some other way, and the drug company says the Government told us how to test it... why in that situation aren't they acting under a Government official?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Frederick.  Mr. Gornstein.     Irving L. Gornstein  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.  Manufacturers of cars, drugs, medical devices, pesticides, home appliances and numerous other consumer good market their products in accordance with detailed and specific Federal Government regulation.  If that in a colorable preemption defense were sufficient to trigger removal, then it would create the potential for a very major shift of traditional State law litigation from State to Federal court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What's... what's your conclusion?  That those are not people acting under Federal officers--   Irving L. Gornstein  --They are not people acting, because if they--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Because policing sounds like--   Irving L. Gornstein  --The Government's policing is enforcing the law.  People who are, who are regulating their products in accordance with detailed and specific Federal Government regulation are acting on their own behalf in marketing the products in... on... in compliance with Federal law.  They are not acting under Federal officers... within the meaning of the Federal... within the meaning of this statute.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --What about... what about USDA food inspection?  Isn't a lot of that delegated to the producers rather than the Government officials?   Irving L. Gornstein  The Government--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you still get a Government stamp.   Irving L. Gornstein  --You can have different situations.  And I'm not sure about the precise one you're talking about.  But you can have situations and the FAA is one, where the FAA has a statute which says you can delegate to third parties inspecting aircrafts, and the Agency certifies through regulation that this person is inspecting as a representative of the FAA.  Now that's a varied situation.  In that kind of situation the person would acting under.  But if the person is simply complying with Federal requirements about how to test, that is private behavior, acting on their own behalf, in order to further the marketing of their products.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you are a federally certified inspector you are acting under--   Irving L. Gornstein  Certified as a representative of the FAA, yes, you are.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --What about private transportation of mail?  Is the private contractor who's carrying U.S. mail, is that person... could he remove a case under this provision.   Irving L. Gornstein  The standard for contracts is some contracts are in and some contracts are out in our minds, depending on whether the... they are subject to the guidance, supervision, or control of federal officers.  And so if they are performing a service on behalf of the federal government and they are subject to control or supervision, then they could be acting under federal officers.  Now the situation here, the test that the court of appeals used, simply acting in conformity with detailed and specific Federal regulation, is one that would lead, as I said, to a very substantial change in where State court claims have been litigated up until now.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't care what kind of testing they do?  They can change the method and change the way to resolve--   Irving L. Gornstein  --Actually, the Federal Trade Commission cannot require the particular testing method.  But even if you assume it could, Mr. Chief Justice, that would simply be a regulatory condition on the marketing of a product.  And acting in accordance with a regulatory condition on the marketing of a product is not acting under a Federal officer, for the reasons I've discussed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.  Mr. Olson.     Theodore B. Olson  --It's a facility of the tobacco industry.  The FTC perceives it as... these industries... and these companies, and as I said, even the petitioners in their remand petition are challenging the low tar and nicotine rate measured by the company's testing procedures.  So yes, I'd like to have it be something different but it isn't something different.  It is what the companies have done, and through this mechanism.  This case comes down to the fact that the FTC wanted certain things done.  It decided how certain things would be done.  It calls the results of those the official FTC ratings.  It wants those ratings delivered to the people.  And the tobacco companies have done that and they're being sued because they say... because that information which they're delivering, that they're creating and delivering at the request of the Government, is alleged to be deceptive.  This is the perfect case for a removal under the federal officer removal statute.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Olson.  Mr. Frederick, two minutes remaining.     ",05-1284
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Olson, you've been talking a lot about testing.  But when you look at the complaint in this case, testing is a small part of it.  They're complaining about the modification of the tobacco blend, the weight, rod length, the circumference, use of reconstituted tobacco sheets.  In other words there's a lot going on here in the complaint here besides the testing.  And if the Government is in no way specifying the tobacco blend, the weight, the length, all these other things that are allegedly part of the manipulation to affect the figures.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't understand your response to Justice Kennedy.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that's clearly covered.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Strain.  Mr. Verrilli.     Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  No, because the employer doesn't have the obligation to provide unemployment compensation.  That's a State run system in which the State has the obligation to provide the benefit, and the State does in fact provide the benefit.  It's usually funded through a tax.  The key difference is this is an employer obligation to provide these benefits, and I think that's why this is an employee benefit plan.  The employer is obligated to provide it to employees by virtue of the fact that the employees are working for the employer.  Not true about unemployment compensation.  In conclusion, if I could just focus on the... the point that it really is the case that enforcing this priority, as it is written, will advance the purposes for which Congress included it in the code.  It will protect the interests of workers, millions of whom have no employee benefit plan other than workers' compensation, because it will increase the prospects that that money is there to pay workers' compensation claims.  It will also advance the code's purpose of better rehabilitation because it will give insurance companies a reason not to pull the hair trigger, to hang in there with these companies, and to allow them to have a chance rehabilitate rather than forcing them into liquidation by canceling coverage which the law allows.

Roberts, Jr.  Their argument, they haven't argued... I realize this was a hypothetical, but they haven't argued that the subsidiary should be treated as a national bank.  They're arguing that they're entitled to say that the same preemption that applies to the national bank applies to the subsidiaries.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Presumably, if they said it's treated as a national bank they would lose the benefit of the separate corporate existence when it came to issues of liability.  If they said this subsidiary is a national bank, then presumably the separate corporate existence they're seeking to take advantage of would be obliterated.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And if they don't want to, they don't have to set up a separate subsidiary, right?  They can do this business directly as a national bank and they're not going to be subject to any visitation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  And I would have thought your answer to Justice Breyer was yes, that they get to regulate to the extent they want to, and the state does, and if there's a conflict, the federal regulation will prevail, but what's the problem here is that they're issuing a categorical regulation saying the state can't regulate at all.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Their position is not that it only preempts in cases of conflict.  Under 12c apart, 7.4006, it says, state laws apply to national bank operated subsidiaries, which is what we're dealing with here, to the same extent that those laws apply to the parent national bank, which is to say not at all.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's not a case of conflict preemption.  They're trying to preempt state law whether it conflicts or not, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Or environmental regulation where just because the Federal EPA doesn't take a particular action against a polluter, doesn't mean that the state can't take action against the polluter.

Roberts, Jr.  How does it conflict with Federal banking authority for the State to audit the books of the mortgage subsidiary?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Take my earlier case about the consumer disclosure.  Michigan has a law, I assume, that any mortgage lender has to tell the consumer all this information.  Would that conflict with the authority of a national bank?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think any regulation would conflict with the national bank status?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Long.  Mr. Srinivasan.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's field preemption when it comes to regulation.  Yes, if the bank is sued the normal rules of contract are going to apply for enforcing a contract.  But you're claiming field preemption with respect to regulation, correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  State laws generally... State agencies generally don't regulate national banks at all, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That was an effort of the State to prohibit the national bank from engaging in the activity, correct?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's an obvious case of conflict preemption.  Here we have a question of whether or not the State can regular the operating subsidiary to any extent.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why should we assume that they wanted to preempt state laws to that extent.   ",05-1342
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but you don't even have to get into the theory.  What happens in a lot of municipalities of course is that they decide, well, we're going to run the waste treatment facility and we're going to tax the people in the municipality to support it and the service is going to be free.  Now, is that a violation of the Commerce Clause?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, so, you say formalistic as if it's a bad thing.  But the, the distinction, say in the First Amendment, if the private contractor the day before the municipality bought the facility for a dollar had fired an employee because of his or her political views, you wouldn't argue that that is state action just because the next day it was going to be controlled by the public entity.  And yet the next day, that type of action would be subject to First Amendment scrutiny.  It may be a formalistic distinction but in many areas of the law it makes all the difference.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It is kind of formalistic on the other side because you, I thought you agreed that if the municipality did it through tax revenues and there was no formal flow restriction and yet it only made sense to dump your waste at the free facility, you seem to suggest that would be okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Cahill.     Caitlin J. Halligan  --Yes, Your Honor.  I'm saying you should look as you have... and I see my time is up.  If I may continue... you should look as you have, in all of the dormant Commerce Clause cases at the context that is presented.  So if there is 100--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you.

They charged outrageous amounts to give the cable franchise and then grant a monopoly in exchange.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  To get back to the public-private distinction, what is the answer to Mr. Tager's point that that's difficult to... what if you have a 50 percent publicly owned, 50 percent privately owned company?  Is that covered by the Commerce Clause cases or not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So then, the Commerce Clause would become the vehicle by which we would develop federal law about what's appropriate for municipal governments to do and what's not appropriate?  We could decide it may be appropriate to run waste facilities but not to run milk pasteurization.  I don't know how we would do that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if we accepted that argument, we would treat the public services just like we treat, you know, the legislation favoring private companies.  You're the one that's arguing for special treatment based on public ownership.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the whole point is these are not unique.  The whole point is there are private companies that provide these kinds of services.  Maybe water, maybe electricity, maybe those are or are not unique.  But you can't say that this is a unique service being provided by government.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Cahill.  Ms. Halligan.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, there is an allegation that you charge above market rates to pursue particular economic goals that the municipality has.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If only facilities on your side of the case that are traditional municipal services, but then this seems to be at the borderline.  I mean, on the other side, they have the hamburger cases or the milk processing cases.  How do we decide whether this is one of the traditional governmental services, the police, the prisons, whatever, or is it one of these that looks more like regular market participation?   ",05-1345
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, in that case, are you saying that routinely the lawyer recovers fees in the bankruptcy case even if the debtor, the debtor was insolvent?  And we're assuming insolvency in the hypothetical, although it may not fit this case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, there may be no briefs from them because it isn't the question on which we granted cert, is it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Rosenkranz.     E. Joshua Rosenkranz  Your Honor, that's what they argued.  The bankruptcy court explicitly held otherwise and the Ninth Circuit agreed with the bankruptcy court.  The bankruptcy court said, none of your interventions were reasonably necessary to reach... excuse me... to advance your interests.  Therefore, you are absolutely wrong when you argue to us that you are on the State law side of the Fobian rule.  Now if you ask me, Your Honor, where in the bankruptcy court decision does it say that, I would refer the Court to page 24a of the... of the cert petition appendix, where you see asterisks for a missing paragraph right in the middle of the opinion.  That, and just to orient the Court, we're looking at the first paragraph that says first of all.  Then there's a... there is an asterisk eliminating a paragraph.  Look at page 140a, 141 of the joint appendix where the missing paragraph that Travelers eliminated is filled in, and there the court summarizes a 15-page colloquy with Travelers about why it is completely wrong in claiming that its steps were reasonably necessary.  And on page 141, just to orient the Court again, you see that it begins, second paragraph, first of all.  That's the same paragraph.  The next paragraph refers to Mr. Brunstad's arguments.  It says,  ""I just simply don't by it. ""  ""I don't think you can sort of say, you know, we thought there was a thief hiding under the bed so we had to clear out under the bed. ""  ""I don't think there was a risk there. ""  And that was the gist of 15 pages proceeding the joint appendix, where the court methodically demolishes each of the argument Travelers presents here.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not sure I agree, Counsel, that the Fobian rule is both narrower and broader than the question you try to present.  For example it applies to the claims of a secured creditor for attorneys fees on a secured claim as well.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why... it doesn't?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you're an oversecured creditor with a claim for attorneys' fees arising under solely issues of matters of Federal bankruptcy law, the Fobian rule doesn't prevent that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, not everyone.  I'm not clear on it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If it is a rational predicate, we might have expected to hear about it in the opposition to certiorari.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, it's an ambush and it is smuggling in the sense we don't have a court of appeals decision one way or the other on that question, do we?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And if that's true... and the reason for that I suppose is that doesn't impair the rights of the general creditors at all.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  It's quite unlike the situation, for example in Timbers, where had you in 502 a disallowance of post-petition interest.  There is not in 502 a disallowance of attorneys' fees.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, your brother in his reply brief said that no court of appeals has endorsed your theory, and I... earlier you told me one had.  Which one in particular?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you really want us to reach out and decide a question that's not presented when there has been no holding of the court of appeals one way or the other on the issue?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you thought the Fobian rule was wrong, you could have said that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's an added complication.  There's another case on which the Ninth Circuit's based its decision in your case, DeRoche.  Your proposed solution here doesn't address the issue in DeRoche because there it's the debtor that's seeking attorneys' fees.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So we still have to decide the Fobian issue.  And your failure to defend it here means that we're going to have to decide in on that inadequate record.  If you have mentioned that in an opposition to certiorari, perhaps we would have granted cert in the DeRoche case and had an argument about the rule that we have to decide.   INTERRUPTING ",05-1429
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I thought your argument was, once you make a decision to terminate, there are various rules that are triggered, you just can't take the money and run with it.  You've got to make provision.  And that merger was not one of the permitted ways of terminating a plan.  Is that wrong?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the point is the $5 million is not going to these employees, it's being thrown into this vast sea of all these other employees, whose employers have not done as good a job of funding their plans.  This is to the benefit not to the beneficiaries of this plan, but to other union members who don't have the luxury of having an employer who has overfunded their plan, and are trying to get that five million to help them, not your beneficiaries.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Roberts.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Ms. Clark.     Julia P. Clark  Precisely, Justice Ginsburg.  Now, I have... my time is up.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I thought we just heard that the PBGC might look at it a little differently, that they are more comfortable with the annuity insuring that these beneficiaries get their benefits as opposed to just throwing the beneficiaries into a pool with your other union members.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Doesn't this put you in an awfully difficult position?  I mean, you're representing the union, which has other members besides these beneficiaries, and you're saying even though under their plan the beneficiaries are fully protected with irrevocable annuities, we think they're going to be better off if they're thrown in with our other members and we get the $5 million to spread out, not to these beneficiaries but among all these other members.  Isn't that an awkward position to be in?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And beyond as well?  I mean, let's say we have 5 million extra dollars here.  See, that's what I don't understand.  If you're saying it's a fiduciary, I mean, how can they make a decision ever to do anything other than just give the five million to the beneficiaries?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the terms, the plans terms here, did not provide for merger in the event of termination, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even though the district court decided it?  Usually in a waiver situation it's whether you argued it or whether it was addressed by the court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you're... if you prevail here... I mean, the reason we have a case is because the employer overfunded the plan to the tune of $5 million.  If you prevail and they cannot get that back even after fully insuring the benefits for the beneficiaries, employers in the future will be very careful not to put in one penny more than what's required to fund the plan; isn't that right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What possible equitable basis does the union have to claim this extra $5 million?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not for these beneficiaries.  It's for all the others.  It's spread out among this pool in the multiemployer plan.  These are the employer excess contributions.  What... looking at it as an equitable matter, what claim do they have to the extra money?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are there a lot of plans that look like that, that if there's extra money, we've overfunded that it goes back to the union, not back to the company?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The union plan.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, your little--  (ii) that you're relying on begins by saying in accordance with the provisions of the plan, the other solution otherwise provides.  Where in the provisions of the plan does it say that they will consider merger?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you know, is there a particular provision in the plan that says that?  Or--   John G.

I was surprised there wasn't more discussion of that in the briefing and maybe it's, it's because of some reason I'm unaware of.  That says that the Secretary in making this determination can take into account particular types of LEAs where there is extra, additional costs.  I would have thought for example if you had a very small LEA with only 20 students and the cost is particularly high because you don't have economies of scale, that you haven't... that would, could be knocked out for that reason.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What's the case that says ""unambiguously foreclosed""?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You begin with an argument that directly cuts against your position.  They knew how to do it under the... I assume you're referring to the education finance and incentive grant program?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they did it there, they didn't do it here.  To me that suggests the opposite of the inference you're trying to draw.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which they did not say in this act.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But for different purposes.  In the one case, in this act we're worried about an extensive Federal presence that has an effect on the tax base available for schools and under the EFIG program it's an entirely different question of equalization.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, maybe let me ask it directly.  If they could so easily just say we incorporate the Secretary's regulation in EFIG, why didn't they do it here?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They instead went to the trouble of mimicking part of the regulation, but not mimicking the appendix, which is where your calculation methodology is.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I ask, is there a difference legally between a regulation and an appendix to the regulation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you say ""incorporated"", though.  What it did was it took the language and it did not take--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --No?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In the EFIG statute?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But in this statute the regulation says look to the, look at the appendix.  Congress as I understood when it enacted our statute, it took language from the regulation; it didn't take the part that said look to the appendix.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And it didn't do that here?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I have a conceptual difficulty, and it may be my limitations with the way you do it.  You take students and you assign a per-pupil number to each individual student.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I would have thought the per-pupil concept only makes sense if you're dealing with LEAs.  They have a per-pupil number because they've got a bunch of pupils.  You take individual students, and you know for example in that school district you don't spend the same amount of money on the kindergartner that you spend on the eighth grader.  And yet, you give the kindergartner a per-pupil number and the eighth grader a per-pupil number that is the same.  It's an artificial association.  It makes sense to speak of per-pupil numbers when you're referring to the LEAs because they have so many pupils, they get so much money, you can do the calculation.  It doesn't make sense to say, you know, John Smith the kindergartner has a per-pupil expenditure of a thousand dollars.  He may have $200 and the eighth grader 2,000, so why are you creating this artificial association and then using, using that methodology?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And it's only... the reason is to rank them if you have an entity that has a swath of students, the district, that's the way it should be ranked.  When you're ranking it by pupils, maybe if you ranked them by pupils and you have the actual numbers of course, which nobody does, your methodology would make sense.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, because it's an absurd hypothetical.  What is the--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --What is the smallest number of districts, what is the smallest number of school districts in a State?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which State has one school district?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In the, in the hypothetical you posed why couldn't the Secretary address that disparity under (b)(ii)?  In other words, the school district which has only 57 students, it seems to me could be taken out of the calculation under (b)(ii), and then you would be dealing only with more representative school districts, not the special case of the particularly isolated school district or whatever.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why do you have to do that?  Why do you have to do it first?  It says you can take into account this... extent to which the program reflects additional costs in particular districts.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Wouldn't the statute have told you, though, to, to disregard pupils according to the ranking?  It does tell you to disregard LEAs, which suggests the ranking... at least to me, that the ranking ought to be of LEAs and not pupils.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I would have thought your office had answered that question in countless briefs where it tells us to be guided by the language of the statute and not some unexpressed intent.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Manasevit.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't it... I'm sorry.  Go ahead.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  See, that's my conceptual difficulty.  It is only per pupil when you're dealing with an aggregation of the pupils.  If you're going to break it down pupil by pupil, which is what you do, you don't have a per-pupil number associated with each pupil.  You have a number.  Nobody knows what it is because nobody knows how much you spend on each individual.  We know how much you give to this district, and therefore, the district has a per-pupil number, and therefore, I would have thought a reference to per-pupil numbers suggests you're grouping according to district.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Go ahead.   ",05-1508

And when you have a waiver on the broader statute, but shouldn't you read them together with the specific to suggest that they weren't waiving sovereign immunity when a more specific statute governed, except to the extent of the provisions in that more specific statute.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but there may be situations where the Government, having levied, doesn't feel the need to pursued other remedies available to it.  And if you then allow a challenge to the levy to come in later the person they would have proceeded against if they didn't have the levy may have left the country, may have dissipated the funds that they would otherwise go after.  They need to know early on that they are barking up the wrong tree if they have levied on the wrong property, and that's why you have a short statute to clear that up as soon as possible.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the prior paragraph says it's because of the history of his biological grandfather, biological brother, and biological child.  That suggests to me it's a genetic claim and--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, but he knew about that.  He knew about that mitigating evidence at the trial because his biological mother was there.

Is he correct that you concede that merely because the statute extends to aiders and abettors that is not sufficient to take it out of the categorical treatment?   John G.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your argument isn't limited to theft offenses, correct?  That would cut across all of these areas in which the federal law refers, in which a Taylor analysis would apply?

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does it matter exactly what the nature of the escape was?  Are we supposed to evaluate whether this was reckless enough?  Well, let's say the driver did not go off 90 miles an hour.  Let's say he obeyed the speed limit.  He just wasn't going to stop.  Does that make it a different case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it reasonable for him to suppose that there might be something more going on if the guy is trying this hard to get away from a speeding ticket?  That presents he presents a danger to the community quite apart from the driving?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that a factor that goes into the analysis?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Garre.  Mr. Jones.     Craig T. Jones  --Well, the rule simply says you don't kill him just because he is driving unsafely.  And if, it simply says that if the choice is between killing him and letting him go, you have to let him go if the Garner factors aren't present.  And we find nothing in the law and no reason to create a new exception in the law that says that Garner doesn't apply if you're fleeing by vehicle.  Thank you.  We ask that the Court of Appeals be affirmed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Jones.  Mr. Savrin, you have four minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",05-1631

Roberts, Jr.  We are not talking about driving in violation of traffic laws.  We talking about 90 miles an hour on a two-lane highway, swerving past cars in the incoming traffic--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Hitting... after hitting Officer Scott's car and continuing on.  That's a little more than just unsafe.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The Eleventh Circuit gave the exact opposite answer in the Adams case, which if you're looking at what the... was clearly established law from the point of view of the officer that provides him guidance that the Garner case does not dictate a result in the use of deadly force in the police chase case involving an automobile.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So when Officer Scott was trying to figure out what the law was, he should have relied on the dissent in the case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Go ahead.  Finish your--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --If I could just get back to an earlier point.  You think what the officer should have done in this case was to let Mr. Harris go.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even though he doesn't know at that point that he will ever be able to arrest him later.  He doesn't know if it's a stolen car or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And he doesn't know why he is being pursued, whether it's for mass murder or terrorism or anything else.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Once they have gotten away, I assume.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And aren't you concerned that that creates an incentive in every case for anyone who, that sees the blue lights behind them to know that all they have to do is keep fleeing and the police are going to have to give up eventually?

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But this is a fairly indirect way of establishing a Federal cause of action.  I mean, it... it's a preemption provision.  Why isn't it reasonable to assume Congress thought there was no need for a Federal cause of action?  Because it's a contract action.  State courts handle those every day, and they assumed they'd be handled by a State court.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I noticed you referred in your brief to the Jackson Transit line of authority.  Do you know how many times Jackson Transit has been cited in the last 20 years by this Court?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not been cited.  I think it's never been applied and it's not been cited once in 20 years.  So what's the line of authority?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We're not talking about the contract between you and the Federal Government.  We're talking about some other agreement between you and an individual employee.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that may give rise to a separate agreement, a related agreement, if you will, between you and the employee.  But it's not... it's not a... you're not the Government.  The employee is not the Government, at least not for these purposes.  So why is it a Government contract?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if the Government says... Congress says, we think OPM should have a recreation center for its employees and it should have all these things, and then OPM enters into a contract with a company that runs recreation centers... okay... that's a contract with the Government.  And then that entity enters into a contract with somebody else to supply the basketball hoops.  Would you say that that last contract is a Government contract?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even if the provision... even if at some point Congress said, and besides, you know, the basketball hoops should be... you know, made in America as opposed to somewhere else and, you know, specifies the terms of the subcontract.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could you... following up on Justice Ginsburg's question, could you intervene asserting rights of subrogation in the underlying tort suit that your covered beneficiary brought in State court?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, wouldn't it be more efficient for you to intervene in the pending State suit and get it all resolved at once rather than waiting until your beneficiary gets a recovery and then starting a whole other Federal suit over this somewhat subsidiary subrogation point?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, at that point, you'd be able to assert your argument under the Federal preemption provision that says, in my view somewhat surprisingly, that these contract terms preempt State law.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That would have been a good time for them to say we want a Federal... Federal court jurisdiction over these causes of actions if that's what they had in mind, but they didn't do that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, there sure was.  For those who like to look at the legislative history, the House report said that... again, it's very curious language.  It said, this change will help strengthen the case in favor of Federal jurisdiction, or something like that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, since when is Congress trying to strengthen... they either decide it's going to be Federal jurisdiction or not.  They don't try to make arguments.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Is there any comparable situation where a contract between two private parties has the effect of preempting State law?  Suppose all you have to do in our service benefit plan is agree with your beneficiaries that in the case of subrogation, you're entitled to, you know, 10 times actual damages, if they don't pay up right away or something like that.  And... and that would override all sorts of State law.  You could specify you're entitled to interest at 20 percent and that would preempt State usury laws?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Srinivasan.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't there... isn't that a big leap?  I mean, even if we agree with you that there are Federal rights and duties, is it irrational for Congress to determine, since they arise in a normal breach of contract action, we're going to assume they're going to be brought in State court?  The cause of action is for breach contract that every State recognizes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But wouldn't it have been the easiest thing for Congress to say, as it does countless times when it creates Federal rights, that Federal courts have jurisdiction to enforce these rights?  And they didn't do that here.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, ERISA has a very clear preemption provision too, and that's generated a fair amount of work for us.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan.  Mr. Stock.     Thomas J. Stock  It could.  But in this particular instance, the contract provisions that Blue Cross are... and Blue Shield are seeking to enforce, as regards reimbursement, are markedly different.  I mean, it's... it's not a small variation.  It's a very substantial manner in terms of, first, the procurement costs and, second, in terms of what kind of a cause of action Blue Cross Blue Shield can take the money from.  But that's an... an incidental.  That goes to the heart of... of the matter.  If there's no other questions, Your Honors, thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you very much, Mr. Stock.  Mr. Shelley, you have 4 minutes remaining.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  I wonder if you could focus on one question for me.  If you have a State law cause of action and the law to be applied to some aspects of that cause of action is Federal law, is that sufficient to establish Federal question jurisdiction or not?   INTERRUPTING ",05-200X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  And I suppose that the preemption provision would apply equally if this were brought in State court or Federal court.  Correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But... but the preemption provision, at least with respect to the rights of Empire, would ensure uniformity.  In other words, if the contract terms preempt State law, then any impediment to recovery by Empire that varies from State to State would be overridden.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I understand that.  But to the extent people are concerned about disuniformity from the point of view of the Federal recovery, the preemption provision is going to apply whether this action is in State court or Federal court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the only question that we're considering today is whether or not Federal question jurisdiction exists to authorize bringing this suit in Federal court.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they've already said that.  I mean, there would be Federal jurisdiction there because the Federal Government would be a party to the case.  Right?

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your... your statement that it was for one reason only means it wasn't for any discriminatory reason on the grounds of race or ethnicity?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which... which motivation?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How... how does that make any sense to say that what you're objecting to is the consideration of race in one situation, but if it's compact and the predominant motive was the consideration of race, that doesn't bother you?  That seems to me to be a back door way to get into a more extensive judicial review of the compactness and based on racial considerations that are, under your view, the predominant factor in each case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you can take race into account if it's compact as a predominant motive.  You can't take race into account if it's not compact.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  As a dominant motive.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, isn't it correct, though, that a result is... focus on results is not sufficient if the challenge is an equal protection one and not a section 2 one?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm talking about district 25.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's why I asked earlier that your... your statement that all of this was done with a political motive... I wondered how that satisfied the equal protection requirement, not the section 2 requirement.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, counsel, just take it in... in an abstract way.  If you think that the prior system has been gerrymandered by the party in power, are you saying that when that shift in power in the statewide offices changes, that the new party in power cannot redress the gerrymandering of its predecessor?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let me give you another parallel.  Let's suppose that districts have been gerrymandered for racially discriminatory purposes for years.  Can you take race into account in drawing new districts to remedy that racial discrimination?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, now, counsel--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Is that the reason these lines were not redrawn at the beginning of the decade, because the majority party sat on its hands?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --What was the percentage of the African American voters in the district as a whole?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that if you had a situation where it's 40 percent one group, 40 percent another group, and 20 percent where the 20 percent controlled who was elected by siding with one group or the other group, then you would say that that was an influence district for that small... the smallest group in the district?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Smith.  Ms. Perales.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does that undermine the assumption that there's... they're voting as a bloc?  30 percent of the group is voting for one candidate.  Is that sufficient to establish a voting bloc?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I... can I... I don't understand... I think your argument is at cross purposes.  I mean, the one point... and you're making the point that the Democrats do not vote overwhelmingly for the Democratic candidate.  They voted as much as 30 percent for Bonilla.  But the Voting Rights Act is concerned with whether or not a group voting ethnically as a bloc can vote for candidates of its choice.  Well, if they're 30/70, it's not... it's hard to think of them as having a clear candidate of choice.  So what does it matter whether they're in or out?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, the percentage goes up, the percentage goes down.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It depends on who's running against him.  At the low point, there was a popular Hispanic candidate running against him in some of those elections.  But it seems to me that the predicate for coverage under the Voting Rights Act that a particular group is being denied the opportunity to elect a candidate of its choice doesn't even come into play if you're right that the... the vote is split over time, depending on the circumstances in a particular election.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then... well, but then... and this is why I say it's an argument at cross purposes.  If you're right about that, then the assumption that the Hispanic voters are going to be voting Democratic is not one that was unfounded, which I thought was your... your first point.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not just the State that's saying it, though.  You have a district court finding that ethnicity was not the predominant factor, that politics was the predominant factor.  Maybe... as Justice Scalia suggests, maybe they were right, maybe they were wrong, but the point was that it was being done for political purposes not for ethnic purposes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that... and what relevance does that have?  What provision of the Constitution prevents you from leaving a majority of one group in a district to create the impression that the district supports a particular candidate?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's what the Fourteenth Amendment was passed for, to avoid creating the impression that a particular group supports a particular candidate?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And how many... what percentage would they have shifted from making it look like a Hispanic opportunity district with about 51 percent to when it would actually be one?  What percentage does it shift from being looking like one to being one, both above a majority?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But what's the number?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that your number?  It has to... anything short of 63, it's just looking like it?  I mean, really, you're asking us to draw a very fine line between a... in each case a majority Hispanic voting age district, but in one case, it's a constitutional violation and in the other case, it's... it's required by the Voting Rights Act.  So what is the magic number between 51 and 63?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What's the number?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if this district were drawn with 60 percent, you would say that's just to make it look like a Hispanic district?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  So what's the number?  It's... it's somewhat more than 51 percent because you're saying that's a constitutional violation, and I want to know how many more it takes before it becomes what's required under the Voting Rights Act.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm just trying to get the number.  If you're asking us to rule on a constitutional violation, I'm asking to find out what the number is that changes it from a political nuance to a Hispanic opportunity.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Would it have been better--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --would it have been better in your view if they had excluded more Hispanics so it didn't look like a Hispanic opportunity district?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Do you have a... a section 5 argument with respect to district 25 as opposed to a section 2 argument involving district 23?   John G.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, can I move you south and west again, back to district 23?  How do we tell... as redrawn, it had what?  50.8 percent.  And I gather that that's not considered a Hispanic opportunity district because of lower voting turnout, registration, participation?  How do we tell when something is being done to make it look like a Hispanic district and, instead, when it's being done for the opportunity of providing a Hispanic opportunity district if voter turnout and registration are increased?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Jump in whenever you want.  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're talking about district 25.  Right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why did they have... why did have just 50.3 percent?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, in... in the absence of any suggestion that the collective bargaining process is also infected with sex discrimination, why can't we rely on that process to give some basis to the job descriptions?  In other words, forklift operator was not a separate job from rail yard employee, and if the union wanted to make them separate jobs, they could negotiate that, but they didn't.  So why... why do we regard that as a material change when you're doing one part of a job as opposed to another part of a job?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the difference there is that's an employer unilaterally.  We don't have that here.  The employer is dealing with the union.  If the jobs really were that different, the union would categorize them differently and negotiate for that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Doesn't your approach require an employer to keep shuffling the employees around so they don't get a sort of adverse possession of particular types of job responsibilities?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  With respect to the suspension, what... what if she had been... during the process of investigation, she had been allowed to stay on the job with pay?  In other words, the facts are the same.  It's just that the... the sort of stay process works the other way and she's not relieved until the end of the company's investigation.  Is the initiation of that an materially adverse employment action?   INTERRUPTING ",05-259X

Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you said earlier that the act... one of the protections against trivial charges was that the act had to be the act of the employer.  If the employer sets up a review system in which the final act of the employer is the decision, why is a preliminary charge, initial suspension, review... why are those also considered acts of the employer?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What does that mean, it was not covered by the collective bargaining agreement?  Presumably you paid... the person who did that was paid wages pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your position is that it would be an... it would be a covered employment action even if none of that were true, she didn't lose pay, she didn't lose benefits, so long as there was the initiation of the disciplinary action.  You regard that as sufficiently adverse under 704.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Other than eligibility for punitive damages.   John G.

Is it a possible distinction of that case that that involved a contingent fee arrangement, and in other words, the lawyer's labors generated the... the asset, while in this case, the claim depends upon the... the contractual provision?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you may not... you may not rely on the distinction, but I would have thought your answer might have been that the lawyer had an equitable claim apart from the contractual provisions so that when you enforce the contractual provisions, Justice Holmes would have thought of it in equitable terms, while here, there's no equitable claim apart from the particular provisions of the contract.

Your... your friend on the other side cites the many common law cases not allowing subrogation in this sort of situation, or if it does allow it, subject to the make whole doctrine.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, instead of looking for an equitable counterpart, this is an action for money you think is owing to you under a contract.  Why isn't that a classic form of legal relief?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So why did you cite the contract in your complaint?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If equity... if the equitable subrogation claim were subject to the make whole doctrine or... or these other equitable doctrines, and your contractual claim is not, which relief are you entitled to?  The... the one subject to the equitable doctrines or the relief that's specified in your contract?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is your claim subject to the equitable doctrines or subject to the legal contractual claim?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, it seems to me you... you must be biting your... your tongue here.  There's an easy answer to Justice Stevens and to Justice Scalia, and it's that we get all the money first because that's what the contract says.  But you can't give that answer because then it starts to look like a legal claim.  Instead, you get mired in all these obscure equitable doctrines because you're... when there's a simple answer there in black and white, but it's in the contract.  And as soon as you say that, it starts to sound legal rather than equitable.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your theory is that your argument would be exactly the same if you did not have this provision in your contract.  It's an equitable claim.  It's an age old subrogation right.  You just sue in equity saying, look, I paid the medical expenses, I'm entitled to it.  You don't need the contractual provision at all.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Coleman.  Mr. Feldman.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is this... to go to your first point, how is this specifically identifiable?  No court has said that there's this... you only want the medical expenses, and no court has said there's this much for medical expenses.  You have to figure out how much of the recovery is allocable to medical expenses.  In fact, already did that.  They cut out some percentage for attorney's fees.  It's far removed from the traditional sort of res that we deal with in equity.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So we... how enforced?  I mean, if you're enforcing a contract, you do that legally not equitably.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are these claims subject to the qualifications that go along with the equitable lien, the make whole, whatever the applicable rules are?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that wouldn't apply here because you're relying on the contract.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what if the plan said... you know, this is an insurance company.  They don't like litigation... we are subrogated to double whatever the medical expenses are that we contributed?  That's our recovery.

And if... your personal autonomy interests have been quashed.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It wouldn't be harmless under your theory because your theory is that this has given expression to your personal autonomy.  It's not simply for your defense.  If it were harmless, it would say that it's totally wrapped up in the defense.  But there's another constitutional interest under your theory.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I suppose this... this right applies on appeal as well.  Right?  Somebody says, I want Mr. Fisher to argue my case in the Supreme Court.  I don't want anybody else.  And... and yet... and we get motions for admission to our bar pro hac vice.  If we deny one of those, does that violate the Sixth Amendment?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That... that happens all the time.  That happens, for example, in the case of incompetent counsel.  There's a right to... to competent counsel.  If you... if that right is violated, the defendant still has to show prejudice--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --before he'll get relief.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Some of the--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Some of the concerns about the evidentiary presentation were addressed by the Seventh Circuit and the reason they adopted a... a lesser standard than the prejudice standard in... in Strickland.  Why isn't that adequate to meet those concerns?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but then you wouldn't... I'm sorry to interrupt you.  But at that point, the defendant would be well advised to go ahead with trial with his second choice lawyer.  Right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Take his chance and then if he... if he loses, he gets automatic reversal.  So why would he do mandamus?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In the government, you're including the court in that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's not always true in a Strickland case.  It's often the court that's making the mistakes that the lawyer should have objected to and was incompetent in not doing so.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  General, do you understand the scope of this statute to be different than the scope of the statute at issue in Stenberg, focusing in particular on the deliberate and intentional language?   ",05-380X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  We have no evidence either in the record before the Court or Congress as to how often that situation arises?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We'll give you an extra 30 seconds.  Proceed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess that gets back to the point earlier.  I mean, do you agree with the discussion earlier that this act is not going to prevent abortions?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What degree of marginal impact on safety do you think is necessary to override the State's interest?  I mean, if you have complications under the D&E procedure in say 10 percent of the cases, complications under D&X in 9.99 percent of the case s, is that marginal benefit in safety enough to override the State's articulated interest?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I thought your submission earlier is that we don't have any record evidence about how often the complications arise, so it's hard to get a handle on exactly what the difference is in terms of safety under your submission.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought the evidence was that you're looking for a different degree of dilation if you're intending to perform D&E than if... and you're looking for a greater degree if you're intending to perform a D&X.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is your submission that there aren't dilation protocols if you're intending a D&E and if you're intending a D&X, they're the same?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you think the, on the same issue I think, that the addition of the deliberately and intentionally language in the congressional act addresses that concern?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could I ask you just one thing?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The statute, of course, refers to both feet first and vertex deliveries.  How common is the vertex delivery in the D&X?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And in giving your arguments toward the safety benefits of the D&X, I couldn't understand why they wouldn't also apply to the total delivery of the fetus in a vertex delivery situation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, my understanding is that the vertex, the skull and head are already outside the mother.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And the objection in the feet first is that you want fewer instrument passes and so on.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But in that case, it's not the skull itself that is preventing the delivery of the fetus.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your arguments about why the D&X is safer than feet first, wouldn't that apply in the case of total delivery of the fetus as well?  In other words, if you want as much of the fetus intact and out as possible, why wait, stop it halfway?  Wouldn't the safety argument suggest delivery of the fetus?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In the case of a vertex delivery, where is the obstruction?   ",05-380X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's a little different here in that in the Brooke Group cases, of course, the alleged anticompetitive conduct was pricing too low, which has at least a direct benefit to consumers either in the short term, certainly in the short term, and arguably in the long-term as well, while here that is not the form in which the anticompetitive conduct, that's not the form the anticompetitive conduct takes.  So isn't that a reason not to think that we should apply the Brooke Group test to this situation?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Have we ever identified that as a benefit that the antitrust laws try to achieve, people get higher prices for what they sell?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So in Brooke Group, we said it's a benefit when prices are low to consumers, and in this other case we said it's a benefit when prices are high to suppliers.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Pincus.  Mr. Shanmugam.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Would you describe the hypothetical Justice Stevens posed to your, your brother, would you describe that as just aggressive bidding?

Roberts, Jr.  What about the fact that the woodsmen in Justice Breyer's story are rational actors as well, and they don't have to be geniuses to realize that they are in a better shape having two buyers rather than just one.  So maybe they forego the extra 50 cents a log, or whatever... tree, it is in the short term and sell enough to keep the other company in business?  I mean they can make that decision themselves.  Or they can make the decision as rational actors that they are better off having more money that they can then use to buy more alder saplings that they can plant for the future.  And either way it benefits the consumers.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well if he is, if he is that rational and foresighted, why isn't he rational and foresighted enough to know that he ought to be selling some to the other, the other processor even if that processor is not bidding as much?

We have not only the... the reference there, but we have the final sentence of that clause where we say after removal, after the court establishes that it has removal jurisdiction, it shall subject the action to subsection (b).

Roberts, Jr.  And... and I understand your submission... and perhaps it's distinct from the Seventh Circuit holding in this respect... to suggest that those are different standards, the standard for removal and the standard for preclusion.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that under your view at least, it's possible that you could have removal jurisdiction and then determine that the... the case is not, in fact, preempted.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And so that an entirely State law case would proceed in Federal court.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there another instance in which we've upheld Federal court jurisdiction over a purely State law cause of action, apart from the Federal officer situation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But those are the only two.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So this would be a pretty unusual creature that you're asking us to sanction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the reason is there are two separate questions.  They just happen to be identical.  But I mean, the State court isn't going to worry about whether removal is appropriate or not.  It doesn't have to answer that question, but it may well have to answer the question whether it's preempted.  It happens to be the same analysis, at least under a reading of the statute, but that doesn't meant that you... that just because a review of the removal decision... the remand decision is... is precluded, that review of the preemption decision is precluded.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Counsel, if you... on the removal question, if there's a dispute about whether it's a covered class action, dispute about the number of people involved, the dollar amount, I take it that is litigated at the jurisdictional stage?

But you say that when it gets to whether it's a... there's a... involving a covered security, for some reason that can't be litigated at the jurisdictional stage.   INTERRUPTING John G.

What you can remove is a covered class action involving a covered security.  So why do we have such different approaches to the different prongs?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  And--   John G.

",05-416X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes it is.  Because the whole... one of the reasons you have reasonably short time is that you get the witnesses there, they remember it.  If you have to file within 15 days with the prison, the prisoner does that, the guard is there, ""Do you remember what happened""?  ""Yes. ""  ""This, this, and this. ""  ""Who else was there""?  ""These people were there"".  You wait 3 months, the prisoner files a complaint, they ask the guard, ""Do you remember""?  ""Not really. ""  ""It was 3 months ago. ""  ""I'm not sure"".  Then he has... you know, the evidence against him is much weaker when he files his claim in Federal Court.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, the point is that if he complies with the time limit, it's going to hurt his claim; therefore, he doesn't want to comply with the time limit.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you were suggesting that the prisoner had no incentive not to comply and go through his State grievance procedure.  And it seems to me that the reason you have the short procedures are to maintain a fresh record that more accurately reflects the truth, and, since Congress was acting against the backdrop in which they thought there were too many frivolous cases, they thought that might be one way to limit those.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  There may be no dispute about it, but it does seem kind of strange to encompass them under the term individuals when the same statute uses individuals and corporations separately.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's not defined in the statute, but the prior list in the same sentence says individual, partnership, corporation.  So you assume whatever an individual is it's different than a corporation or they wouldn't have had to say corporation again.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is there different about your proceeding to treat this as a RICO enterprise that isn't covered by normal corporate criminal conspiracy law?  What does RICO add here?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So they hire more than one person.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is that different than a normal contractual relationship that a corporation is going to have with any number of suppliers, vendors, agents?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but I'm trying to see what RICO adds to the normal conspiracy law--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --that would otherwise be applicable.  So we're assuming that the arrangement is there and that they're engaging in illegal activity.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But Congress didn't... to be fair, Congress did not enact RICO because it was concerned that criminal conspiracy law, applied to corporations, didn't adequately touch interstate commerce.  The whole point is that they had something significantly different in mind, and your allegations in the complaint seem to be fully met by application of criminal conspiracy law.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm trying to give you a chance to explain why this looks like RICO rather than just criminal conspiracy.  And you've come up and you said interstate commerce.  There's got to be more than one.  Well, none of that really suggests a distinction.  What... what is it that makes this a RICO case rather than just a criminal conspiracy case?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  This Court, in Payton, said that it was not unreasonable to conclude that evidence of remorse extenuated the gravity of the crime.  So, why wouldn't an instruction to the jury along the lines of Justice Stevens's hypothetical have been perfectly constitutional as extenuate the gravity of the crime that's interpreted in Brown versus Payton?

Roberts, Jr.  --don't you have to address the Teague question a little bit?  You... you're entitled to this new rule adopted by the Court of Appeals only if it was dictated by precedent at the time the judgment became final.  Isn't that kind of a hard argument to make in light of our subsequent decision in Brown v. Payton?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of Boyde?  It's straightforward application of Boyde?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, Penry was considerably tightened by the subsequent decision in Graham versus Collins, though.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I know Payton was an AEDPA case, but it, nonetheless, concluded that it was not unreasonable for the California Supreme Court to read instruction (k) in a way that allowed this evidence to be considered.  And I would have thought, if it was not unreasonable to have that reading, that the contrary reading that you're proposing, and that the Ninth Circuit adopted below, could hardly be said to have been dictated by existing precedent.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because if it was--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --because, even if incorrect, it was, nonetheless, reasonable.  And I'm just having trouble understanding how, if a contrary position is dictated by precedent under Teague, a reading 180 degrees the opposite of that could be regarded by this Court as reasonable.

The reason that the possibility of psychiatric treatment couldn't be considered is because neither party had put evidence on that question before the jury.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  It's a question of what mitigating evidence was put before the jury.

General McNulty.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if there were no punch in this case, would they have had a sufficient basis?  3:00 in the morning, loud shouting.  Can they conclude, based on their experience, that's likely to escalate into violence and enter on that basis?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, counsel, let's suppose you have a police officer who knows there's evidence in this house, but he doesn't have probable cause to get a warrant.  And he also knows that the family is going to be reenacting the murder scene from some movie as part of the family reunion.  And so he's there just at the time where the... in the scene the one guy says, and now I'm going to kill you with this knife, and he says, ah, and he goes in.  Now, subjectively we know that he has no basis for fearing violence, but a reasonable officer on the scene, hearing somebody say I'm going to kill you with this knife, would have a basis for entering.  So under your test, is that entry permissible or not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Really.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no.  He knows.  He heard this is what they do at the family reunion.

Michael Patrick Studebaker  --No, it was not, Your Honor.  That's correct.  What we have, Your Honors, is a situation where under the exigent circumstances, it did not rise to the level which would require the... the officers to enter the home without getting a warrant.  And in the alternative, if they look at emergency aid, to enter the home under the emergency aid doctrine, which would be the equivalent in our opinion to a special needs assessment, then we have to look at probable cause.  We have to look at their intent to enter because there's no probable cause to enter if they're performing that caretaking role to protect people.  Obviously, the ultimate concern in... in any type of situation is somebody's sanctity of their home.  It becomes a weighing situation where trial courts are... are being charged to weigh the evidence, weigh the credibility of the people who testify, and then also take into account the constitutional protections which the parties are awarded.

Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Kneedler.     Edwin S. Kneedler  Yes.  We think it is wrong, be... under this Court's decision in Spencer versus Kemna and other cases, that, if the possible consequence turns on a discretionary judgment that may be made by someone else, that is too speculative to constitute a real live case or controversy.  And that's what I understand Toledo-Flores to be arguing, is that if he applied for discretionary relief in the future, that it might... it might matter, because his sentence might be reduced slightly.  I should point out that in the District Court Toledo-Flores conceded that if he didn't get an eight... level sentence enhancement, he would get a four-level sentence enhancement, because this is at least a felony, within the meaning of the adjacent provision of the guidelines.  That would result in a guideline range of 24 to 30 months.  He would then have gotten 24 months, under that guideline range, the very same thing that he got here.  And, under the guidelines at the time, a term of supervised release was mandatory.  And a 1-year term of supervised release was mandatory in those circumstances.  He would have gotten exactly the same term of supervised release if he had been... if he had gotten only the four... level enhancement, rather than the eight-level enhancement.  I also think that it is somewhat farfetched to think that, given the fact that Toledo-Flores had more than 12 illegal entries into the United States, and various State offenses, that the determination of whether the attorney general would actually grant discretionary relief would turn on a marginal difference in the sentence on that particular offense.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Kester, would it--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --would it... would your position be different if the contract contained a specific... the license... a specific provision specifying that the licensee may not sue?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You... do you think such a provision would be enforceable?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let's look at what might be a matter of jurisdictional law.  I take it, from your position, there's nothing preventing Genentech from suing, either, is there?  In other words, to establish the validity of their patent.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Against licensees?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, but the patentee would just say,  ""Look, we have a license. ""  ""I think the patent's valid, and you owe me a dollar a unit. ""  The licensee said,  ""Well, I don't think they're... it's valid, so I owe you nothing. ""  And they settle on a license for 50 cents.  Why can't the patentee say,  ""You know, if I get a judicial decision establishing that the patent is valid, I can charge a higher license, either when this agreement expires or for other licenses? ""   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm trying to see how far you want... are willing to push your argument that just because there's been an agreement, or perhaps even a settlement, that that somehow or another doesn't moot the controversy, the underlying legal dispute.  And it... I gather your answer to me is that Genentech, or a patentee, can sue, even though they have an existing... they're getting royalties from the licensee, they can still sue the licensee.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, there's no way, I... under your view, that a patent holder can protect itself from suit through any license arrangement or any agreement of any kind.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if you don't--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --think--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --if you don't think--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, then why are you paying it, if you... if you don't think you owe it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because of the threat of treble damages--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --and injunction.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If we're trying to figure out where the public policy is here, why don't we give some weight to those congressional enactments that obviously fortify the strength of the patent?  In other words, Congress passed these provisions providing for treble damages for attorneys' fees.  And--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --and to respond that there's got to be a public policy to counterbalance that, Congress can always do that, if it wants; but it didn't... it thinks that you need these provisions to protect the patent holders.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Kester.  Ms. Maynard.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do you ever end these things?  Let's say they have this dispute, they bring the litigation, and they settle it.  They're saying,  ""Okay, we're going to settle it. ""  ""Instead of paying a license fee of 50 cents, it's going to be 40 cents, and we'll go on. ""  Then they can sue again, I take it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can they settle that, by the way?  Is it all right to settle it, or is... that interfere with the policy that patents have to be open to challenge?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Either one.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I think you overread Pope.  All Pope said was that they're not going to grant specific performance.  In fact, they've said,  ""Whatever you may think of the policy here, we don't... specific performance calls on the equitable discretion, and we're not going to do it. ""  But, I don't read Pope as holding that the clauses are otherwise unenforceable.  In--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --other words you're maybe entitled to damages.  And that may be measured by the license fee that you agreed to pay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you don't think that matters, though, do you?  I mean, even if they all agree there's no dispute about what the license agreement means, your position is still the same, right?  There is an Article III controversy because they challenge the validity of the patent?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --that always the case?  I mean, could... can you enforce a license agreement based on an invalid patent?  You thought it was valid... parties had a dispute about it... whether it is valid.  You entered into agreement, say,  ""Well, let's split the difference. ""  ""We'll... you know, 50 cents rather than a dollar or nothing. ""  It's determined that the patent is invalid.  Can the patentee then still say,  ""Well, you still owe me the money. ""  ""We've, kind of, cut... split the difference. ""  ""That was part of the agreement? ""   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that... it's been pointed out that was pursuant to an injunction.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you think--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Do you think there would be a case or controversy if Genentech were suing to establish the validity of its patent?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Ms. Mahoney.     Maureen E. Mahoney  --I think that an additional factor that bears on this analysis is also the fact that Congress has never created an implied right of... has never created a right of action--  Thank you, Your Honor.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, isn't there--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --true adversity?  I thought the assumption underlying the... everybody's hypothetical is that, if the patent is determined to be invalid, that the license... then the license agreement is also invalid.  Is that... is that right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can you... can you--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --can you collect... can a patentee collect license fees based on an... patent that has been determined to be invalid?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It would--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --It would be pursuant to the agreement.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Collective--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Even if--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --the royalty agreement says, you know,  ""We have a dispute about the validity of this patent. ""  ""We don't know. ""  ""We disagree. ""  ""And so, we've entered into a compromise royalty rate that reflects the uncertainty. ""  But once it's determined to be invalid, the license fees are not collectible.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought your argument... I'm sorry.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about the fact that it's under protest?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, their concrete right is, as I thought you conceded earlier, that if the patent is declared invalid, they will not owe license fees.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's what--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --a declaratory judgment action does, though, isn't it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. Mahoney, you argue, in the alternative, that we should dismiss it on the basis of equitable considerations under the Declaratory Judgment Act.  We can't reach that argument unless we rule against you on the Article III question.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We would have to be assuming that we had jurisdiction, wouldn't we?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Under Article III?   INTERRUPTING ",05-608X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  In your answer for why they can't, Justice Souter's comment is a classic, this is what administrative agencies do all the time in typical rate regulations.  They make a determination that utility shareholders have to bear this cost.  The rate payers can bear this cost.  And at the end of the day, it is a determination that a rate is reasonable or unreasonable.  And it seems to me that that is just what is involved here.  I don't know why their determination about how to allocate who has to collect the rates, and whether they can pass them on or not makes it an impermissible interpretation of what's unjust or unreasonable under 201.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  When you say it was always thought of as being triggered by 276, did the FCC reference 201 in issuing its determination that a failure to follow these regulations was unjust and unreasonable?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It doesn't cover certain practices in connection.  It covers all practices in connection.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you are saying that, putting aside 276, it would clearly be impermissible for the FCC to say one way that long distance carriers provide service to their customers is when those customers use pay phones; and, therefore, we're setting up this rate regime in connection with that service.  You would say that would be outside the scope of 201(a)?   ",05-705X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but reasonably criticized for it.  I would have thought your answer would be unjust or unreasonable has, for generations, been given a very expansive reading.  And you don't need to say that the FCC has to do what typically I would have thought was a job for a court, which is to determine whether there's a private right of action to bring its action within a boilerplate term like unjust or unreasonable.  I would have thought the contact point was what I was talking about with Mr. Fisher earlier, which is whether or not this is such communication service under 201(a), which is... which is, again, I suppose, something that the agency gets deference on.  But it would seem to me, that's where the limitation would come.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I think that's right, but that's also why I guess I don't regard it as particularly helpful that the FCC opines on what the consequences of its determination that something is unjust or unreasonable under the statute are, with respect to a private right of action.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I saw that argument.  I have to say I don't understand it.  Why is it so difficult?  I get a bill every month that easily sorts out which are interstate and which are intrastate.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Englert.  Mr. Feldman?     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you have a position on whether or not Chevron deference is owed to the Commission's determination of whether or not their action creates or gives rise to a right of action?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  There are two different, it seems to me, two different Chevron questions.  The one is the deference on its interpretation of what's unjust and unreasonable.  The other is the question of whether or not they have anything to say about whether that means there is a private right of action in court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it's never gotten deference, at least I guess from this Court, on whether or not there is or is not a right... whether there is a right of action to enforce its regulations.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you would have a different position here if 276 said something like, we think there ought to be more pay phones; in order to promote investment in pay phones, we're going to have this scheme.  In other words, it has nothing to do with whether it's fair or not, it's a subsidy.  Then you'd say that could be something that's not covered by the ""just and reasonable"" provision?   ",05-705X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Phillips, I may be lost a bit here.  But I mean, which... I'm looking at the instructions that were given.  And it seems to me it is hard to take issue with the instruction on the railroad's part because it tracks the statutory language.  The statute says in whole or in part, and the instruction says in whole or in part.  So if you're pushing the doctrine of equivalence, your objection seems to be to the directly contributed language with respect to the employee, the plaintiff.  Now, but doesn't directly contributed, isn't that a typical proximate cause instruction?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  But on the other hand, you're also arguing in favor of proximate cause.  You are saying Rogers didn't change proximate cause.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you would have us announce a decision on the doctrine of equivalence without saying which way it should be made equivalent?  Raising the railroad's standard or lowering the employee's?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Phillips.  Ms. Perry?     Mary L. Perry  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Phillips, you have two minutes remaining.     ",05-746X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, doesn't there have to be a doctrine of equivalence when you're running a comparative negligence regime?  Because, you know, you talk about the plaintiff's negligence causing the harm to a certain degree and the defendant's negligence causing it to a certain degree.  And if you're not dealing with apples and apples, it seems to me you can't conduct the comparison.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  But we're talking about comparative negligence here, where there's negligence on both sides.  And I just don't know how you say one party's 20 percent... contributed 20 percent to the harm and the other 80 percent, if you're using different causation standards.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't have any conceptual difficulty with adding in whole or in part to instruction 13, which is the employee's instruction, because it's comparative negligence.  It seems to me that necessarily implies in whole or in part.  If you can reduce his recovery because he's in part negligent, what would be wrong with saying in whole or in part in instruction 13?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  I thought Justice Souter's point was that taking it out of the railroad's instruction might cause confusion because of it.  But I don't see how adding it to both of them when you're dealing with comparative negligence, and it's necessarily the case that partial negligence on either of their parts can enter into the verdict, I don't see how that can be confusing.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You can answer it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Under that scenario, then, what objection could there be to a recognition that the negligence of the plaintiff can contribute in part to the accident?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's what Justice Souter has identified, right?  That's not because they're adopting different standards.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you just told me, a good reason for not putting in whole or in part in instruction 13 is because it doesn't make sense, the whole part doesn't make sense with contributory negligence.  That's a good reason not to put it in Section 53 either.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't have to say that.  I mean, you know, when in doubt, we ought to follow the words of the statute.  And so whole or in part makes sense with the railroad, but directly doesn't appear in Section 53.  Why don't we just... why shouldn't the instruction just say,  ""such negligence of the plaintiff contributed to cause his injury. ""  It's not going to be a complete bar because we know the immediate... the next instruction talks about reducing the award by the amount of the negligence.  Why wouldn't that be preferable to introducing extraneous terms?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, no, but he requested that the instructions be the same, and the directly is what causes the problem, and directly doesn't appear in the statute.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you think they raised an objection based on the doctrine of equivalence?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's what Rogers might have said, but the statute doesn't say anything about slight cause.  It only says in whole or in part.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why isn't ""in whole or in part"" simply the logical corollary of introducing comparative negligence?  Why do you have to read that as departing from proximate cause, instead of simply recognizing that under 53, negligence on the part of the employee can reduce recovery which... without barring it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's why you don't have 53, not because they wanted to depart from proximate cause there, but because, as Justice Stevens pointed out, you wouldn't have it in whole or in part.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  We're looking under AEDPA at an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.  What do you do in a situation where you think the state court has incorrectly articulated Supreme Court law, but nonetheless reached the correct result?  In other words, correct understanding of the established Supreme Court law would have led to the same result as their incorrect articulation of it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  My hypothetical, and we'll debate later whether it is this case or not, is let's say that the state court wrongly articulates Supreme Court law.  But under the correct articulation, it leads to the same result.  What happens in that case under AEDPA?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It misarticulated them.  I guess the question of application is... I mean, I assumed they reached what we would regard as the correct result under the correct standard, they just articulated the wrong standard.  Your answer, I take it, is that it would then be reviewed without AEDPA deference?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't need to establish that rule, do you?  You just need to establish that what the Supreme Court determined was not an unreasonable application of this Court's law?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How different is it from the victim's family sitting in the second row behind the prosecution every day of the trial?  And I mean, I'm... the hypothetical correctly focuses on the question, at least for me, of whether or not you can have specific applications of general rules that are clearly established.  I'm just not sure your agreement with it is advisable because it seems to me that simply having... how many people have to wear these buttons?  One person shows up with a ""Hang Musladin"" button, does that mean it is a mob-dominated trial?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  All right.   ",05-785X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't understand your point about the state court focusing on Norris.  The question under AEDPA is still whether or not it is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  To wear any buttons?  It says, ""Fair Trial"".   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, most... I don't think... a typical jury will understand that the victim is going to have a family, and they're going to be sorry that he's dead, and they might be there at his trial.  And they may not like the person accused of murdering their son.  That is not... that is sort of like in every case.  That's not... the buttons don't seem to add much to what the jury will derive from seeing the family seated behind the prosecution bench.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what about... what if the issue was mourning?  The trial is being held and the families appear and they're all in black because they're still in mourning.  Does that violate this clearly established rule?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, my question is under AEDPA, if the state court said, you know, I'm not going to keep the family out even in mourning, that would violate the clearly established rule that you've just articulated?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't want to put your... hang your hat on the ""contrary to"" prong, though, do you?  Your argument, I thought, was an unreasonable application argument.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, we've never even had a case involving spectators.  So it's not contrary to clearly established law.  We have cases stating the general principle on which it relies, so maybe it's an unreasonable application.  But ""contrary to"" seems an awful stretch.   ",05-785X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is the jury given a copy of the information?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Millett.     Patricia A. Millett  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--  In Neder, this Court held that the failure to submit an element to a jury... an element of a crime to a jury is subject to harmless error analysis because it is a nonstructural trial error.  In Apprendi and Blakely, this Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury recognizes no distinction between elements that set a maximum punishment, sentencing elements, and elements of the underlying offense.  For that reason, the failure to submit an element that sets the sentence to the maximum sentence available should be subject to exact same harmless error analysis that was applied in Neder.  The exact same constitutional value and constitutional right is at stake.  The exact same analysis of the effects of the error will be applied by the court, and the same sort of discrete error in time that you had in Neder.  There's no functional distinction between Neder.  In addition, in Schriro v. Summerlin, this Court held that the failure to submit a sentencing element to a jury is not the type of error that calls into question the fairness, accuracy, or reliability of the underlying proceeding.  In Cotton, this Court held that that same type of error does not impugn the integrity, public reputation, or fairness of judicial proceedings.  And in Mitchell--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The assumption of the hypothetical is, I take it, that the Washington State judges would deliberately violate our holding of a matter of constitutional law in imposing the enhancement.   Patricia A. Millett  They would, and I think that's not a fair assumption and it's certainly not the way to decide whether harmless error analysis should apply.  I mean, Blakely has been on the books for a couple of years.  Neder has been out there for 7 years, and we haven't seen people deliberately trying to get around people's Sixth Amendment rights.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Millett.  Mr. Link.     Gregory C. Link  And both as a matter of double jeopardy and as a matter of Washington law, I don't think that... that would... could occur.  The Washington Supreme Court correctly held that harmless error analysis could not apply where the trial court has set aside the jury's complete verdict on a lesser offense in favor of a judgment on the greater, both as a matter of State and Federal law.  And Mr. Recuenco would ask this Court to affirm that decision.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Whisman, you have 4 minutes remaining.   ",05-83XX
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you asked for an instruction on the lesser offense of aiming a firearm.  Under that provision of Washington law, does the firearm have to be operable as well?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you ask for an instruction assuming that the firearm at issue in this case was operable.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if the firearm were not operable, you would not have been entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser offense of aiming a firearm.  Correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, what your trial counsel said was that the... I'm quoting from the joint appendix, page 30... the allegation and the basis on which this case was tried was under the theory of firearm.  It seems inconsistent with your representation that nobody had an idea that they were trying this under the theory of a firearm.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. Millett tells us that that only applies on remand under... under the Hughes case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, doesn't... isn't that true in Neder as well?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the special verdict form still was.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And do you know if the information went to the jury in this case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the other way of looking at it is it's based on trying to understand what the jury meant when it said deadly weapon when the only evidence of a deadly weapon they were presented was a firearm.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And in Neder, even if the jury had been asked to rule on materiality, it could have decided not to rule according to the evidence.  The same argument applies in Neder.   ",05-83XX
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's a disputed point, I gather, central to the case, whether or not the regulations measured PSD emissions through that device rather than the hourly emissions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's an audacious statement.  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If the regulations are ambiguous, then the agency can interpret them in different ways and can change its interpretation over time.  Of course, what your friend argues happened here is that the agency changed its interpretation in the context of an enforcement program.  Now accepting that premise, what is the... what should Duke have done when that interpretation was changed in an enforcement program?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you,--  Mr. Donahue.  Mr. Hungar.     Carter G. Phillips  --I don't know how that's a final action.  The filing of a complaint, as this Court held in Harrison, is not a final action.  So that doesn't trigger it, and I don't know what else is out there for us to serve as a hook.  I would think at a minimum the Court would want to be very, very loathe to jump on a expansive interpretation of 307(b) where it operates in a context like this as a pure gotcha.  You adopt regulations that nobody has a quarrel with, you change the regulation afterwards and then you come back and you say you can't challenge it at this point.  That just cannot be a sensible interpretation of that statute.  If there are no further questions, I would ask the Court to affirm the Fourth Circuit.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Phillips.  Mr. Donahue, you have 3 minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Major... when you say the statutory term, you mean ""modification""?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So then why weren't those proposed regulations saying just that, adopted?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's a tough sell, isn't it?  I mean, the idea is you propose regulations saying major modification means modification.  Those regulations are not adopted, and then the industry is supposed to be on notice that that's still what you mean?   ",05-848X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Should a challenge to that have been brought in the D.C. Circuit at that time, or would you have argued that's too late?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, presumably Duke could say, we looked at the Reich memorandum and we were following that and all of a sudden this new 1988 thing came up and they are surprised by that.  Now you're saying it's already too late because somebody else challenged it in 1980?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  To be fair to them, that very same argument was more a product of the Fourth Circuit than of Duke.  They had a somewhat different approach before the Fourth Circuit and then the Fourth Circuit came up with this insistence on the parallel construction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In the midst of the enforcement action that's being brought against them by EPA?  What's supposed to happen in the enforcement action, if that's the vehicle through which EPA is implementing its new interpretation--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Thank you, Mr. Hungar.  Mr. Phillips.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Just a pause, under your view or the Fourth Circuit's view?  If you read Judge Tatel's opinion in New York versus EPA, he suggests... suggests, he says that EPA adopted different interpretations of modification from the outset.  And so if what you are saying couldn't have been challenged, was the Fourth Circuit's view, that may not be accurate.  But if you are saying what couldn't have been anticipated was the argument you actually made to the Fourth Circuit, that might be a different story.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your answer is you are not relying simply on the general principle.  It is not just that they used the word modification in one place and the word modification in the other.  It's that in the latter place, they said modification as defined in the first place.   ",05-848X

Roberts, Jr.  But stare decisis on the basis of statute is kind of a weak basis when the statute's been changed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's purely... pure question begging.  I mean, the whole issue on the merits is whether it's a foreign sovereign or not.  And you can't assume that you're correct when the remand provision or the provision barring appeal when it's been remanded doesn't care whether you're correct.  The idea is, you can get a correct determination in State court through up to review by this Court eventually, as you can in Federal court.  There's no reason to assume that the Federal court is the only place you would get a correct determination.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Frederick.  Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  This Court has recognized repeatedly that the bar on appellate review in 1447(d) applies only to remands under 1447(c).  This Court has held that the courts of appeals have authority to decide whether a remand order was, in fact, one within the authority of 1447(c).  In fact, just this term in Osborn, the district court remanded the case on the basis of 1447(c) for purported lack of subject matter jurisdiction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, what... what do you do about 1447(e) which says that if after removal joinder might defeat subject matter jurisdiction, the court can deny joinder or permit joinder and remand the action.  In other words, you have got subject matter jurisdiction but the statute contemplates it may... later... later you may lose subject matter jurisdiction and you can remand it there.  And I suppose that that needs to be interpreted in pari materia with (c) so that the remands would not be subject to review.  It seems to me the same situation here.  You have got allegedly subject matter jurisdiction.  It is later defeated, and it is remanded.  Why shouldn't that be covered by (c)?     What, what's notable is that Congress enacted 1447(e) at the same time that it amended 1447(c).  It provided in 1447(e) for an authority to remand in a particular instance where the court lost subject matter jurisdiction post-removal.  It had of course been the rule since this Court's decision in St. Paul Mercury Indemnity, that post-removal events did not defeat the removal court's jurisdiction; and in the statute it was made explicit that 1447(c) authorized remand only when the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction.  And when Congress amended the language in 1998 to make clear that non-jurisdictional defects in removal had to be raised immediately or were forfeited, it at the same time... and added the language, or changed the language in the second sentence that raises problems for our argument; at the same time, it added 1447(e) to provide, as I said, a particular authority to remand based on post-removal events that would have been unnecessary if, as Respondents urge, 1447(c) was intended to confer general authority to remand on the basis of post-removal events.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you don't have any doubt that a remand under 1447(e) would be covered by 1447(d), do you?     No.  And the courts of appeals that have considered that question likewise hold that a remand under 1447(e) is right in pari materia with (d) although the courts seem to be split on whether the decision to allow the joinder is a separable decision appealable under Waco or not.  But... but that issue is not presented.  But what is significant is that had Congress intended by the amendment of 1447(c) to authorize for the first time remand on the basis of post-removal events, 1447(e) would have been unnecessary; and yet, the legislative history, the 1447(e), makes clear that Congress believed that in the absence of that provision, the Court would have been limited to two alternatives.  Authorize the joinder... or deny the joinder, or dismiss the case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.     Mr. Simon.     Leonard B. Simon  --But I think, Justice Roberts... I think, Mr. Chief Justice... I apologize.  Because my time is running short, I would say the key point in this case came when we sought to have a prompt dismissal in the Ninth Circuit of the appeal prior to full briefing and argument, and it was denied.  That was the point at which if a litigant simply parroted the phrase ""this is patently wrong"", would likely in most circuits before most panels have lost.  And this matter would have gone back to the State court 2-1/2 years before it got affirmed by the Ninth Circuit and five years before today.

I would have thought your answer to Justice Alito would be, the statute says if it's remanded, it's not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.  And if it's remanded for a silly reason, that will be corrected on review of the State supreme court by this Court.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That certainly changes the argument.  So the notice of appeal that's filed or the brief on appeal says not only was the court wrong, it was patently wrong, and the court of appeals has to consider that before determining whether it has jurisdiction to review the remand order.

It was not a follow on to a choice system.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Would that be unconstitutional?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The same... the facts are otherwise the same, except you conclude that private choice contributes to further division rather than integration and so the assignments are made on a 60-40 basis.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I still don't have your answer.  Is strict assignment 60-40 without regard to choice constitutional or not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And how does this not present narrow tailoring problems if... if the... when you get to the fact of choice, the sole criteria at that level is the same as would be the case in a 60-40 assignment.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  One of the, one of the factors our prior cases looked to was whether the plan has a logical end point.  What is the logical end point in this plan?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Nothing under the plan requires that, does it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't defend the choice policy on the basis that the schools offer education to everyone of the same quality, do you?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is that different from the separate but equal argument?  In other words, it doesn't matter that they're being assigned on the basis of their race because they're getting the same type of education.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even though in the individual cases the students, including minority students, and I gather 89 to 100 of the cases are being denied admission on the basis of their race?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They are being denied admission to the school of their choice?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the reason that our prior tests have focused on individual determination is that the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to ensure that people are treated as individuals rather than based on the color of their skin.  So saying that this doesn't involve individualized determinations simply highlights the fact that the decision to distribute, as you put it, was based on skin color and not any other factor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you're saying every... I mean, everyone got a seat in Brown as well; but because they were assigned to those seats on the basis of race, it violated equal protection.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you say they're the co-architects.  I mean, are you saying anything more than they are given the procedural right to participate in the hearing?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't there a bit of... there's a leap from saying they have these various procedural rights and they're are a party aggrieved by the decision rendered after the hearing, that's a different question, isn't it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which just begs the question, doesn't it?  I mean, you're assuming that the parents are a party to the case in Federal court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought it was the unanimous view of the circuits that parents, as a general matter, do not have the right to represent their children in Federal court, that the provision of the judicial code that you cited does not confer on parents, generally, the right to represent children.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The statute already allows the shifting of fees to a prevailing party.  So presumably attorneys can be found to take the meritorious cases.  And What we are probably dealing with are cases that can't attract attorneys, even though the attorneys know that if they win, they will get their fees.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if they had that overriding intent, it would have been easy enough for them to make clear that this was an exception to the normal rule, that parents don't have the right to represent children in court.  They did that with respect to the administrative proceeding, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out.  They perhaps conspicuously did not do it with respect to the proceeding in court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know, but 14... is it 1415(f)?  Specifically says that parents have the right to participate in the due process hearing.  I'm looking at 1415(f)(1)(A).  In other words, parents have the right to participate in the due process hearing.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It doesn't say they have the right to participate as parties.  They have... it says they have the right to... for an impartial due process hearing.  I would suppose if you're trying to figure out who is the party to that case, you would still think of it in terms of the child and not the parents.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Andre.  Mr. Salmons.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That argument proves a little too much.  If you have a child who is the victim of a tort, for example, and suffers a serious injury, it is the parents who are going to have to bear the costs of accommodating that injury.  And yet in any tort action, it's still the child who is the party and not the parent.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So their, their rights... so their right to proceed in Federal court should be limited to the rights that you've identified under the statute as opposed to the right to proceed on behalf of the child?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, you think... you think their... their, their rights... the rights they can assert are only ones they can identify as their own as opposed to the child's?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It is not... it is not just party aggrieved.  It's party aggrieved by the findings and decision, as opposed to party aggrieved by a denial of the procedural right, and those strike me as two different things.   John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does a parent have a right to bring a 1983 action if their procedural rights under this statute are interfered with by the state actors?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think I understand your argument based on 3(E), but when I look at 21a of my blue brief there's another provision on attorneys' fees and it's phrased in a very curious way.  It says that fees are allowed to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.  It seems to me that's the most difficult express language for you to deal with.  It doesn't say attorneys' fees happen to be allowed to parents, it's to a prevailing party who is a parent.  And I understand your argument to be that a parent can never be a prevailing party.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are attorneys' fees allowed to a parent who is bringing one of these cases on behalf of a child pro se?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's a convoluted question.  Okay.  So there's no issue under the spending clause that a non-attorney parent would be able to claim some sort of attorneys' fees?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So how is the spending clause issue very significant in terms of the exposure of the school boards?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's where I have a little bit of trouble.  It's not... the underlying right is still the same.  It's the right of the child to a free and appropriate public education.  And that can be vindicated in court actions by attorneys who get their fees paid if they prevail, and all we're talking about is a situation where the parents can assert that same right when an attorney won't.  And I'm just wondering how significant additional exposure we're talking about?  And what turns on that is whether to take the spending clause argument seriously or not.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  But you would have had to do that if they had gotten a lawyer to take the case.  What, what your spending clause argument is, the State agreed to undertake this liability, that they would have to provide a free and appropriate education, that if they litigated, they would have pay the other side's attorneys' fees.  But if they knew that in the case where an attorney wouldn't take it, the parents could prosecute it, and that might result in overturning their decision and that might result in greater expense, well, in that case they would not have bought into this deal at all.  That seems a little implausible.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not disputing that it results in additional exposure.  I'm just disputing that it affects the voluntariness of their agreement to undertake the program.   ",05-983X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Baker, as I understand it subsequent to the grant of certiorari in this case, your client filed for relief under Chapter 13 and that relief was denied.  You're now seeking under... your petition seeks a conversion to Chapter 13 and I guess I wonder what relief is still open to you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What relief is open to you in this case?  In other words, you're trying to get a conversion to Chapter 13.  Subsequently, you've tried to apply for relief under Chapter 13 and that's been denied.  Why isn't the case moot in the sense that that relief is not available to you now?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  When cases are reconverted to Chapter 7, is that typically done before or after the filing of the Chapter 13 plan?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Creditors... under Chapter 13 one of the prerequisites to approval of the plan is that the creditors get at least as much as they would have gotten under Chapter 7, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So presumably the creditors might want to see what the Chapter 13 plan looks like themselves.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you,--  Mr. Baker.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Brunstad.     G. Eric Brunstad, Jr.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We'll hear from Ms. Blatt first.  Mr. BAKER: I beg your pardon.  Ms. Blatt.     Lisa S. Blatt  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  A bankruptcy court has the inherent authority to sanction a debtor who has acted in bad faith by denying his request to convert a Chapter 7 case to Chapter 13.  Courts have the inherent authority to take appropriate action to prevent an abuse of process.  Nothing in the Bankruptcy Code or section 706 purports to impair or limit the bankruptcy court's power to police the integrity of its own proceedings.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what are the odds that that's going to happen if you have a judge who's exercised enough by the fraud to exercise inherent authority to deny relief?  He's not going to let it languish under Chapter 13.   Lisa S. Blatt  Well, he may or may not.  Bankruptcy courts have thousands of cases, and if there is an absolute automatic right to convert, a court with thousands of cases may put off that Chapter 13 reconversion to another day.  Moreover, there may be individual creditors without a sufficient stake to raise the issue, and the Chapter 7 trustee who typically will uncover the fraud cannot oppose conversion if there's a right to convert in bad faith, and the Chapter 13 trustee or the United States--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why wouldn't that trustee recommend to the bankruptcy judge that he reconvert it to Chapter 7?   Lisa S. Blatt  --Well, the Chapter 7 trustee is, he's terminated on conversion.  It doesn't raise Chapter 13 issues.  The much more likely scenario is the Chapter 7 trustee will tell the United States trustee or the Chapter 13 trustee, but they may or may not learn about it until after the case converts.  In jurisdictions where there is--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I wouldn't call it a right to convert in bad faith.  If it's a right, it's a right to convert despite the allegation of bad faith.  It's not a right to convert in bad faith.  No one is arguing for that.   Lisa S. Blatt  --Well, I think that our point is that the absence of bad faith is implicit in the statute because there is this background rule.  When a litigant comes to a court that's already abused the court's process or seeks relief of bad faith, it is a core element of a court's inherent authority to simply deny relief.  You can toss out an entire complaint when a litigant seeks it in bad faith.  If there was an apparent benefit to this, go to 13 first or deny it, the United States trustee wouldn't be here.  We see no benefit to the debtor to require the court to convert and then reconvert.  All it is is an unnecessary waste of everyone's time, and this is a core element of an inherit authority.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about the idea that the debtor can come in and say under 13, look, whether the facts bear this out in this case or not, I've got a job now.  I can pay off my debtors... my creditors according to this plan, and, as the statute requires, the creditors get more under 13 than under under 7.  That's a benefit to everybody.   Lisa S. Blatt  Here's why.  I don't think there's any dispute under--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And he says, I'm sorry about that bad faith business.   Lisa S. Blatt  --Sure.  Right.  And there's nothing to stop a debtor who truly converts and has found religion and wants to come clean for arguing: Let me convert, it's in the interest of everybody if I do convert.  This is a discretionary right to deny relief.  The court is free to allow conversion.  But under the plain terms of section 1370(c), the court has the power to dismiss or reconvert a case to Chapter 7 without waiting for a plan to be filed.  There's no requirement that the court has to sit there for 15 days and see if there's a plan.  A Chapter 7... excuse me--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If the statute didn't provide that a Chapter 13 plan could be reconverted to a Chapter 7, would the court have the inherent equitable authority to do that?   Lisa S. Blatt  --To reconvert to Chapter 7?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure.   Lisa S. Blatt  I don't know if that would be an appropriate remedy.  It might be because you can have an involuntary Chapter 7 case.  But on this point about a court sitting in Chapter 13, if on day one a Chapter 13 debtor files a plan in bad faith, the debtor can say: Please wait, I've got a plan, I'm working on it, give me a couple extra weeks, and the court can say: No, I have the authority to throw it out.  And what's particularly odd about this proposal is that in 2005 a court is categorically prohibited from allowing a Chapter 13 debtor to proceed under Chapter 13 if the petition is filed in bad faith.  The court can't confirm a plan.  So Congress had no interest in protecting bad faith debtors after 2005 and they didn't before 2005.  There's no policy preference in the code for bad faith debtors or allowing a debtor either proceeding in Chapter 13 or moving from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13, and we think this is a modest exercise of a court's inherent authority simply to deny relief when the court is already confronted with a clear case of abuse while the case is in Chapter 7 or the debtor has otherwise abused the bankruptcy process.  The last thing I'd like to say is--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what about the difference in language under 706(a) and the other provisions?  706(a) says the debtor may.  The other provisions call for action by the court, which suggests at least that the authority to convert is greater under 706(a).   Lisa S. Blatt  --I think section 706(a) is fairly read as granting a statutory right to convert absent the two statutory exceptions or the court's proper exercise of inherent authority.  But the 706(b) and (c) just explain that the court may do something or the court may not, or the court shall do something.  So we think our position... section 706(a) isn't even addressed to the court at all.  It just gives the debtor the right to convert, and it doesn't purport to limit or speak to the situation when the debtor seeks that relief in bad faith or has otherwise abused the bankruptcy process.  And I'd just like to end by saying that a debtor's bad faith concealment of assets or misrepresentation of financial affairs is really the most serious abuse you can have in a chapter 7 case.  It threatens the very structural foundation of the code and its integrity.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess I've been assuming... but the eligibility under Chapter 13 even under the present case is a present day question, right?  In other words, we don't go back and see if he was eligible for Chapter 13 when the conversion was denied?  The question would be whether he's eligible now?   Lisa S. Blatt  We have not compared the two, the two chapters... well, there was never a Chapter 13 petition.  We have not compared the Chapter 7 petition with the... after this case, this Court granted certiorari, then the Chapter 13.  But it is on appeal to the district court, so it's not presently moot.  We would ask for those reasons that the First Circuit's decision be affirmed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Blatt.  Now, Mr. Baker.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  You have--  two minutes remaining.   ",05-996X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Under... you think 105 is an affirmative grant of power?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  105(a) is much more limited than that.  It is only if you take the second clause of that out of context and quote it, as has been done, that it looks like an affirmative grant.  It says:  ""No provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a party in interest shall be construed to preclude the court from taking sua sponte other action. ""  That's a much more limited, narrow provision telling you not to imply a negative pregnant from a requirement that a particular party raise an issue.  I... as a source of sweeping powers to, to basically act as a roving commission in equity, I think that's a mis-citation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you do about the different structures, wording between 706(a) and 706(b)?  I mean, this provision says debtor may.  The other provisions say that a debtor may ask a court to order, and it suggests a difference in who has the primary responsibility, whether it is a motion of the Court or whether it is an independent action.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think under those other provisions the court doesn't have this inherent power or the implicit power from 105(a) that you're arguing for here?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you, if given that the court has express statutory authority to reconvert from 13 back to 7, why should we take the leap of conferring inherent equitable authority to do something, when the statute addresses it in a much more specific way?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, maybe, maybe not.  I mean, they convert.  He comes up with a plan under 13 that looks better to creditors.  I mean, just because there's fraud that offends the court and prompts it to take action prior to conversion doesn't mean that that's going to be the same situation after conversion.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even if it might injure the creditors.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What limitations would you recognize on this inherent authority to take action?  Where do they come from?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The sense it makes is that that's what the statute provides, and rather than relying on this alleged inherent power that apparently is not boundless, and that the bounds of which will have to be articulated in case after case after case, the statute provides a very clear mechanism to address the issue of fraud which allows him to reconvert it back to Chapter 7 promptly.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I still haven't gotten an answer, I think, on what the prejudice is.  Who is prejudiced by the procedure set forth in the statute?  The conversion takes place.  The judge then says, because of this fraud, I'm going to reconvert it to Chapter 7.  Who suffers under that?  You say sit idly by, but I don't see the long passage of time.   ",05-996X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  That doesn't necessarily make sense.  You can imagine a situation where the probable cause and the eventual evidence that supports guilt is adduced after the indictment and the prosecutor says, you know, we're going to find that evidence once we get into it, we don't have it now, but indict anyway without it.  In other words, what's your response to the situation where there's no probable cause on an element at the time of the indictment, but that evidence is later adduced and is a sufficient basis to convict?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it sits to decide whether people should be indicted, and yes, they're supposed to determine whether there's probable cause, but historically a significant role for the grand jury has been not to indict people even though the Government had the evidence to indict them.

You take the two bank robbers in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, the one that robs the bank, the other in the get-away car.  If before the robber gave the money to the person in the get-away car, he said, now, you know, I'm keeping $100 because I had to buy the gun and that was $100, so you only get 400, so it's only the profits that they're splitting, you'd have the same problem, wouldn't you?

The orange one is what we have before us when we decide whether or not to grant certiorari.  And there you don't have a different question presented.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If we adopt your position, we will have to decide a question like, for example, if the argument is I didn't have any profits because I had to pay $10,000 for a hit man to kill somebody, we would have to have a judicial decision that, yes, paying hit men is the ordinary and necessary business expense in carrying out illegal gambling operations, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let's take two illegal gambling operations that are identical in every way except that the one pays the runners, you know, $200 a week.  The other pays the runners $500 a week.  And the one that pays $500 doesn't make any profits because he's paying too much to the runners.  The first one, the more successful operation, you say, can be prosecuted for money laundering because its has profits.  The other one doesn't.  So incompetence is rewarded.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --No, I'm focusing on the question presented... that was the only question presented when we considered whether to grant certiorari by either of the parties, and that focuses solely on the question of whether ""proceeds"" is considered gross revenues or profits.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So someone who simply paid off whoever it is that ships in, you know, a ton of heroin, you'd say is not guilty then?  Same thing.  I mean, you're just paying off the people who engage in the activities that are necessary for the continuation and promotion of the illegal enterprise.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, how do they know even what the fiscal year of these enterprises is?  I mean let's suppose you have some costs.  They have to buy the poppy field or wherever, but, you know, over 3 years, they're going to make a lot of money.  You're saying you can't prosecute them in year 2?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well that's... but we don't try to solve every case.  We look at particular questions presented.  And maybe there's going to be another case coming up in which the issue of how broadly you should construe promotion is, or whether you should have a different definition when the offenses are merged or not.  And we'll confront that when it gets here.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Hallward-Driemeier?       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  In Steel Company the Court held that it is impermissible to adjudicate the merits of a case over which the Court may lack jurisdiction.  But it is another thing entirely for the Court to decline to exercise jurisdiction that it might well possess.  In Ruhrgas clarified, in language that counsel has already quoted, that a court may choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits.  Now, the dividing line between a threshold non-merits ground and a merits ground may in some cases be difficult.  And the Court has... members of the Court have disagreed in some cases; but there is an easier set of cases and that is where the Court is declining to exercise jurisdiction and especially where as here, it is doing so in favor of litigation of the substantive dispute in another forum.  And this Court has... has decided already that it is permissible, for example, for a court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction before deciding a difficult question of whether it would possess subject matter jurisdiction over the supplemental claims at all.  Forum non conveniens is in the nature of an abstention extension doctrine.  In Gulf Oil, one of the first cases of this Court to describe the forum non conveniens doctrine and its factors, analogizes forum non conveniens to a Burford abstention.  The Court even in Steel Company acknowledged that abstention on grounds of Younger, for example, would be permissible to decide before resolving a disputed question of jurisdiction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can a district court do both?  Can it say I've reached personal jurisdiction, I conclude that I, we do not have jurisdiction over this case?  And in the alternative be dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds if it turns out we do?     --I think they could do both.  The second would be really superfluous.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But not if there's, I presume, if there's an appeal.     If... if... an appeal, the court could, the court of appeals could affirm on either ground.  Again, to emphasize the point that counsel has made, the argument here is not that forum non conveniens must necessarily be decided before jurisdictional questions.  In fact, the natural order would be to decide jurisdictional issues first.  But as the Court held in the analogous circumstance of venue in the Leroy decision, there are circumstances that counsel in favor of reversing that order, such as avoiding a difficult constitutional issue or, as in Mr. Papandreou, avoiding imposing the burden of jurisdictional discovery on a foreign sovereign or foreign entity when a case going to be dismissed in the end in any event.

I think what you're saying is we should view this as a retirement plan and there are a number of ways you can be eligible for retirement: Age plus years of service, but another way you can be eligible is disability.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the effect of this litigation is that policemen or firefighters who are injured and become disabled now get lower benefits for disability?   INTERRUPTING ",06-1037
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's fine for them to use that, but you're saying it's not fine for them to use any element of age in making that computation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even though, under the Federal law, they can use age as the exclusive requirement in determining retirement?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You prevent the State from taking into account the fact that younger disabled workers have not had the same opportunity that older disabled workers have.  And it results... if we adopt your system where you can look only at years of service, what it, in effect, is going to do is to prevent Kentucky from giving disability benefits to older workers who become disabled.  For example, if you have two workers, one who starts work at 18 and acquires years of service, say, 12 years of service and becomes disabled, you would say, well, you can take those years of service into account.  The older worker who begins at age 30 and is disabled in his first year on the job, you say, well, you can only look at years of service.  You can't impute to both of them retirement age.  So the 30-year-old who becomes disabled has to get less, fewer benefits than the 18-year-old who becomes disabled.   ",06-1037

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I thought it's questioned in your footnote 13 in your brief.  You seem to suggest that the exclusionary rule is not at issue in this case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So... so we should write an opinion saying we're not saying that it was correct to... we're not saying that it was correct to exclude the evidence in this case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, it says the laws of the 50 States are pretty variable on this question as well.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do we have to look at both of those varieties?  Let's say the State has a rule that, yes, you can arrest people in a way that we would say you can't, but you don't have to have probable cause.  You just have to... they're just arrestable.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --is probable cause to arrest.  The State has a law that says you can arrest in these circumstances whether or not you have probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought you were telling us it has to be sufficient cause to arrest, not sufficient cause to believe that a crime has been committed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it is, as your friends on the other side put it, you are advocating a two-step process.  There has to be probable cause to arrest and there has to be probable cause to believe a crime has been committed?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, they're different here.  They had probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, but you say they didn't have probable cause to arrest because State law makes it illegal.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if the State makes a trivial offense arrestable, as in Atwater?  You're suggesting in that situation the common law rule we have doesn't apply.  It's a trivial offense, but it's made arrestable and therefore it doesn't violate the Fourth Amendment to search incident to that arrest.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what if the legislature... this was the hypothetical Mr. Dreeben posed.  What if the legislature says yes, you can arrest for this offense but you cannot search incident to the arrest, because we think that's too much of an intrusion given the fact that it's a relatively trivial offense?  In that case, would our doctrine saying under the Fourth Amendment you can search incident to a valid arrest be reversed preempted, preempted by the State law?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the State can define the circumstances under which you can have an arrest, but the State can't define and limit the consequences of the arrest?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, can I get back to your discussion of Cooper?  In Cooper, you said that if it violates the State law for an inventory search, then you can't search incident to that.  But that's because it is then not an inventory search.  Here there's no doubt that this was an arrest, whether it complied with State law or not.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but just... it gets to... I mean, if you don't follow the State rules, it doesn't comply with the rules for an inventory search.  But here you're saying if don't... you're not saying if you don't follow the State rules, it's not an arrest.  It's not a lawful arrest.  But that's a different question than whether or not it is an arrest.  Our precedents say if it's an arrest, you can search incident to the arrest.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, if we assume, contrary to your footnote 13, that the exclusionary rule is implicated in this case, could you explain why, under the Federal Constitution, there should be imposed on the State an exclusionary rule for a violation of State law when State law does not impose an exclusionary rule for the violation of its law?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess the question would be: Why doesn't our jurisprudence on whether there's an arrest also look to something else, rather than whether it's permitted or violated under State law?  In other words, the State doesn't... the State law does not provide for the exclusionary rule, but we say the Fourth Amendment does.  Under... this is not a valid arrest under State law, but your brothers say under the Fourth Amendment it is because there's probable cause to believe a crime has been committed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think your friend agreed that the cases didn't establish whether our references to probable cause meant to probable cause to arrest or probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed.  You don't agree with that?  Do you think that the cases foreclose their position?   INTERRUPTING ",06-1082
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are you asking us to, or you think we have to, to rule in your favor overrule our decisions in Kendall and Soriano?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of course, Irwin involved Title 7 and not this 2501. And we hadn't addressed Title 7 before, but we have addressed 2501 before.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, in, in the more recent case of Kontrick -- I'm looking at footnote 8 of that opinion -- it used 2401 as an example of the jurisdictional bar and 2401 has pretty much the same language as 2501.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, just, just to get all the cases out on the table, our more recent decision in Bowles suggested that there may be a difference between statutory and rule limitations and also suggested that the prior history of the interpretation of a provision was highly relevant.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's a pretty risky business, though, to rely on a dissent in determining whether a majority overruled the prior precedent or not, isn't it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Irwin. I thought that was the one Justice Ginsburg posed to you --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- where Justice White in dissent said that Irwin overruled Soriano. But the majority certainly didn't say that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it hasn't recodified 2501 in the past 17 years, has it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think we do have to overrule Kendall and Soriano?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Or at least say that we already did in Irwin?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's exactly what I think we said in -- in Arbaugh; and that, certainly, going forward from that point on, Congress has more or less specified that it's jurisdictional, or we're not going to read it that way. But I'm not sure that was the rule in Irwin and I'm pretty sure it wasn't the rule in Soriano and Kendall.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I know, but it seems to me you're arguing that if Kendall came up today, it would be decided differently, and maybe that's right.  But the point is it came up 100 years ago and it was decided, and the question is whether we should overturn that decision.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I think your argument is more strongly supported by Irwin than Franconia. Franconia simply involved an accrual rule, which doesn't go to what the jurisdictional effect of the bar on commencing a case is.  The government there was overreaching and arguing for a special accrual rule, and the Court said no. That's different than saying whether the actual time for commencing litigation is jurisdictional or not.   ",06-1164

Roberts, Jr.  You know, I don't -- it's -- we've found it difficult enough to figure out which statutes are jurisdictional and which are not.  And now you want us to say, well, even if it's jurisdictional, the consequences may be different for jurisdiction and for equitable tolling and for waivibility. I mean, it seems to me that's a very difficult argument.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose Franconia would be a case where the Irwin logic not only would but did apply.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1164

This is kind of an intramural dispute between two Guamanian officials about what Guam's position should be with respect to the Organic Act and I'm wondering why that's a justiciable controversy under Article III.  The cases you cited in your petition all involved on its... only facially intra... interbranch disputes within the Federal Government; but the agencies in those cases always... were representing a real party in interest.  United States versus ICC, the ICC was actually the railroad in whose favor the had commission ruled.  Why shouldn't we just let Guam figure out its position on its own and then when a private party with standing challenges something then we'll have a case or controversy.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no.  Guam... presumably, some state courts issue advisory opinions.  We don't... that's their business.  It's just a question of whether we have jurisdiction to address the question in that context.   ",06-116X

Parties that are out of time in this Court going to a lower court and saying well, just vacate and re-enter, and then I can start all over again?  We've discouraged that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But don't you know that your interpretation reads the word tax out of this statute?  I mean your position would be exactly the same if it just said 10 percent of the value of the property in Guam.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  With respect to much of the tax exempt property, that could be changed by the legislature as well.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And what was the appraisal practice?  I mean, in a lot of these jurisdictions you have appraised value that turns out to be 30 percent of the actual market value.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But doesn't it... who is this provision designed to protect, just the Guamanian taxpayers or Federal taxpayers more generally?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If the Guamanian government runs a deficit, where is the difference made up from?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know that any taxes from Guam are returned to Guam.  Are additional tax revenues given to Guam other than those that are derived from Guam?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that if the Guamanian Treasury runs into difficulty, it's made up not just by Guamanian taxpayers, but by all Federal taxpayers?   ",06-116X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  How many of those are... are granted?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What percentage of motions to reopen are granted in favor of the alien?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So how many... do you know how many are filed on an annual basis?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So there would be no reason not to file one of these if you were subject to voluntary... if you elected voluntary departure, and it extended your time to stay, right?  Seemingly, everybody would file one of these if we rule in your favor.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We're dealing with people who have already broken the law.  So you're saying they are likely to follow the statute that says only file a motion to reopen under these circumstances?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, another way to reconcile the two that I think would be beneficial to your client, but I'm not sure it's open to us, is to address the Government's view that, when you voluntarily depart, your motion to reopen is automatically withdrawn.  That is, as I gather, set forth only in a regulation and not the statute.  Now, it seems to me that if I were... if I thought it important to reconcile the two, I would be much more concerned about that interpretation... that the motion to reopen is automatically withdrawn... than I would suggest we start incorporating equitable tolling rules and all of that.  But, I take it, the vulnerability of that regulation is probably beyond... beyond debate.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if we don't address it here, there's going to be another case in a year or 18 months where that's going to be raised?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, in all these cases, if you think you have a good case on the motion to reopen, all you have to do is give up the benefits that you have availed yourself under voluntary departure, and then the motion to reopen is not automatically withdrawn.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I mean he... you should not elect voluntary departure in the first place.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What were those circumstances here?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, presumably it doesn't take them much time because when someone elects voluntary departure they don't have to address it.  I mean, this would obviously increase the volume of motions to reopen.  As I said, I don't see know why anybody... why everybody wouldn't file one, because it extends their stay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, is your position that the right to appeal is taken away, just as under the current regime the motion to reopen is taken away?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you have to argue that the... my understanding is that once the... let's say it's the government's proposed regulation and the motion for... or the voluntary departure is withdrawn to enable you to consider the motion to reopen.  They can proceed with deportation at that time, correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you... you almost have to be arguing that the motion to reopen tolls the time for deportation as well, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, under your position, I guess, is what your position is on that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, the government cannot enter a deportation order during a voluntary departure period.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Meade.  Mr. Kneedler.     Edwin S. Kneedler  I do not.  I asked that question, and I do not know the answer to that.  I would like to come back to the fundamental automatic tolling rule that... the fundamental inconsistency of that automatic tolling rule with what Congress did in 1996, because it shortened to 60 days the time limit in which an alien can depart.  It also eliminated a prior exception that had been the law that allowed an exception to the consequences for somebody who overstayed even the much longer voluntary departure period for exceptional circumstances.  Congress repealed that exception.  Prior to 1996, the Board in the case we cite in our briefs called Matter of Shaar, held that if an alien is granted voluntary departure and files a motion to reopen, it rejected two arguments.  One is that the filing of a motion to reopen was itself exceptional circumstances that eliminated the deadline.  It rejected that.  It also in an en banc decision rejected the automatic tolling rule that Petitioner is arguing for here under a situation in which Congress had granted a long time for aliens to voluntarily depart.  We think it defies common sense to suggest that when Congress compressed the time to 60 days, it meant to at the same time reverse what the Board had done in Matter of Shaar and granted an automatic tolling rule, not even one under the control of the immigration authorities, but an automatic tolling rule as a matter of law simply by the unilateral act of filing a motion to reopen.  And the Board in Matter of Shaar addressed all of those things.  The Board of Immigration Appeals has filed, followed Matter of Shaar, in the intervening years since 1997... and importantly, I would like to point this out, too, when Petitioner sought a motion for reopening, he relied on a Board decision called Villarde, which recognized that in some circumstances an alien may file a motion to reopen to try to get adjustment of status if there has been intervening development with respect to an immediate relative petition filed by a spouse.  The Board adopted that rule in this en banc published decision Villarde, but said one of the qualifications for being eligible for that relief is that you not be barred under Matter of Shaar, which means you not be barred by having overstayed your voluntary departure period.  So, in the very procedure that Petitioner invoked in this case, there is a published Board decision post-1997 that relies on that... that relies on that rationale, and the Board has followed that consistently.  It is at the very least a reasonable interpretation of the act for the Attorney General not to allow the undermining of this tightened voluntary departure system by providing for reopening.  I should also point out that this is not tolling in the normal sense.  Tolling usually arises where a person has a claim and there is a statute of limitations for filing a claim before a forum.  Petitioner here was already granted voluntary departure.  The 60-day time limit is not a procedural statute of limitations.  It is a limitation on substantive immigration relief.  And we think it's particularly odd that the filing of a procedural motion to reopen would have the effect of changing the statutorily limited time in which an alien could voluntarily depart the United States.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.  Mr. Meade, you have five minutes remaining.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you have any estimate about how many more motions to reopen will have to be considered if your client prevails in this case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I don't understand that, because my... as I understand it, it would in every case grant an effective extension of the time which you would have to depart if you had filed a motion to reopen.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You answered my question with respect to the government's proposed regulation.  But under your position that would allow the voluntary departure option to remain open, then anyone who exercised that option would want to file a motion to reopen because it would extend their time?

Roberts, Jr.  So that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --So our judgment in this case depends upon whether we agree with you or the government that the procedures available under the DTA are meaningful under Hamdi?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your argument wouldn't be any different with respect to the availability of habeas if these people were held for one day, would it?  We don't look at the length of detention in deciding whether habeas is available, do we?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let me just stop you there.  Do you want this Court to rule on whether or not there are military exigencies that require the holding and detention of these enemy combatants?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Putting aside the battlefield hypothetical, we're talking about Guantanamo.  Your argument is that somebody held one day in Guantanamo has the right to habeas.  So the extent of detention is irrelevant to your assertion.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is the relevance to your... this line of reasoning to the recent enactment by Congress of section 1005(g), which says that the base at Guantanamo is not part of the United States?  There is a judgment by the political branches that we don't exercise sovereignty over the leasehold, and it seems to me that, if we're going to adhere to our habeas corpus cases, we would have to reject that determination.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So to determine whether there's jurisdiction, in every case we have to go through a multi factor analysis to determine if the United States exercises not sovereignty, which you've rejected as the touchstone, but sufficient control over a particular military base?  Over the Philippines during World War II, in Vietnam, and it is going to decide in some cases whether the control is sufficient and others whether it isn't?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that is a judgment we the Court would make, not the political branches who have to deal with the competing sovereignties in those situations?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We'll give you your rebuttal time.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Waxman, this determination, whether it's sovereignty or subjugation or control of non-sovereign territory, would, I expect, have diplomatic consequences.  It is, I think, typically an act of war for one country to assert authority and control over another country's jurisdiction.  And here we have Section 1005G where Congress and the President have agreed that Guantanamo Bay is not part of the United States, and, yet, you would have this Court issue a ruling saying that it is subject to the total, complete domination and control, or whatever the factors are.  What is the reaction of the Cuban government to be to that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We... there are... am I wrong that there are Cuban workers who come on to the base and work?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you have two of those workers and they get into a fight over something, one can't sue the other in Cuban courts?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What authority... what authority do you have for that: That such a suit would not lie in the Cuban court?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Waxman.  We will give you five minutes for rebuttal.  General Clement.     Paul D. Clement  --I think that's right.  I would say, though, that our only baseline is not 1789 because, as we read this Court's decision in Rasul, Rasul is based on the predicate that until 1973 and Braden's overruling of Ahrens, that the habeas statute would not have gone to Guantanamo.  And unless this Court is willing to say that there was an inchoate Suspension Clause violation until 1973 when Braden comes along, it seems like the tradition in this country too, based on the immediate custodian rule and the territorial jurisdiction of the courts, was that habeas in Guantanamo is a novelty.  It's... 1973 at best.  If I could finish with just bringing the Court's attention to one thing.  This is in an amicus brief that is in support of us, the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation brief.  But there's sufficiently little precedence for the Court to rely on, and I want the Court to have this: The Schiever case, which is one of the prisoner-of-war cases.  There's not... in the Rasul case, Justice Stevens, and the parties, we both cited to volume 97 of English Reporter and the report of the case by Burrow... there is in the English Reports an alternative report of that case, from Kenyon.  And the report of that case which is 96 English Reports 1249 is actually longer on the law, shorter on the facts, but longer on the law than the report by Lord Burrow.  So I wanted the court to have that available to them.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General Clement.  Mr. Waxman, we'll give you five minutes.     INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  2243 doesn't specify the availability of release, either, but it has certainly been interpreted to authorize that by habeas courts in this country.   John G.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.  Mr. Swift.     Robert A. Swift  --Well, let me... let me take you on, on that point.  We have one other remedy, and that is execution.  Execution doesn't require joinder of all parties.  It's a singular proceeding that people can join in, but we would have the right to execute, and you can bet that that is exactly what we will do.  So, to some extent, what is being argued here is somewhat besides the point because if that money goes back to Merrill Lynch, we can, and will, execute on that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Rothfeld, you have three minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",06-1204
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So there might be a different situation in your hypothetical with respect to bankruptcy.  In effect, there's an administrator against whom the Philippines could proceed, unlike the situation here, where you have a class and which the prospect of the Philippines proceeding later is not realistic.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because aren't those issues that could be addressed when the Philippines attempt to enforce a judgment they would get in the Philippines if they do in fact get such a judgment?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, before you sit down, you haven't mentioned anything about your argument that the Philippines don't have the right to raise this.  Are you throwing in the towel on that one?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the Philippines National Bank and Arelma were, and of course they've appealed.  And I understand the law to be they can raise these arguments.  We don't have need to have an independent basis for the Philippines.   ",06-1204
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You agree that it has to be a case-by-case determination?  There's no absolute rule either way?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So I assume it would be addressed as it was here, in a motion in limine, the plaintiff would say here are the witnesses we intend to call; the company would say we don't think they're relevant because, as you say, there's no connection between them, and then the judge would decide.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's on the issue of relevance.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Would that be done typically at the motion in limine stage?  I mean, do you establish whether or not there was discrimination in the ""me, too"" cases at trial or prior to the trial, outside the jury's--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --What about the spreadsheet evidence?  I thought there was some effort to show a connection through the spreadsheet showing the age of the dismissed employees?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your theory doesn't depend on where in the hierarchy the other supervisors are located, I take it, if there's a connection?  In other words, if there's a lower-level supervisor who discriminates and that is somehow communicated to the supervisor in question, and whatever... that you know, the point is that the other one wasn't disciplined or something, that would still... under your theory that would be admissible, correct?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I'm talking about a situation... let's say it is a lower-level supervisor outside the chain of command who commits another ""me, too"" act, but that is communicated to the other in a way that suggests, for example, that the company tolerates it or accepts it.  I take it that that would be potentially admissible subject to 403 under your theory.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Cane. Mr. Garre.     Gregory G. Garre  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Evidence of discrimination by other supervisors within the company is sometimes but not always admissible in a disparate-treatment case to help prove discrimination by the plaintiff's own supervisor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --That's under... under 401, it's not always admissible, or do you need 403 to reach that conclusion?   Gregory G. Garre  I think you need to look at the evidence under both rules, the first question being whether it meets the minimum-evidence threshold in 401.  And that is a very low threshold set by the Federal rules.  The second question being whether it may be excluded under Rule 403, which would--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But do you think there are situations where other-supervisor evidence is not admissible under 401 itself?   Gregory G. Garre  --Yes.  We do think that there are some instances where other-supervisor evidence is not admissible under 401.  For example, if you have a large company and you have a plaintiff in the Chicago office claiming that her supervisor had it out for her and she wants to put on the testimony of an employee in the Seattle office who two years ago complained that her supervisor had it out for her, we think that that would not be relevant under 401.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The determination of the relevance of the 403 status... needs to be made at the motion in limine stage, or is it a question for the jury?   Gregory G. Garre  --Well, the district court serves as a gateway.  District courts have tremendous discretion under the Federal rules to determine whether or not evidence is relevant, and whether or not it should be excluded under 403.  So that determination is made by the district court.  In some cases, as happened in the Huddlestone case... that was a 404(d) case... the court acknowledged in some cases the evidence may go in and then the jury may instruct that that evidence is allowed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if it's... if on the ""me, too"" evidence it's a ""he said/she said"" type of case, does that get admitted to the jury?  Or is that excluded at the motion in limine stage?   Gregory G. Garre  Well, if you're pointing to other acts of discrimination by other supervisors that are relevant, then that would be allowed in, and the employer would come in and present their counter evidence--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they're only... it is only relevant, of course, if it is true; and if the company denies that the ""me, too"" episode even took place, don't you have to have a separate trial on that before you can determine whether it's even admissible?   Gregory G. Garre  --In our system we put that evidence before a jury.  If it is relevant under the Federal rules, it is admissible.  We put before a jury--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I get back to my... the predicate to my question.  It's only relevant if it happened.   Gregory G. Garre  --And--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And it seems to me we've had a lot of discussion whether it is relevant if it happened, but we don't know how we determine whether it happened or not.   Gregory G. Garre  --In the Furnco case, the Court said that... that the evidence doesn't have to conclusively demonstrate the fact.  It simply has to be relevant.  We put relevant evidence before juries, we instruct them on the consideration of that evidence, permit the defendants to put that evidence into context, and then we ask juries to draw a conclusion--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So an allegation... an allegation of discrimination in a ""me, too"" context is automatically relevant?   Gregory G. Garre  --No.  I think you'd look at it under the relevance threshold, and I think you'd look at it under 403.  403 is going to exclude a lot of this evidence.  It is going to exclude the barely evidence, the barely relevant evidence.  But it... we would expect a trial court in this kind of situation to make some kind of findings as to why this evidence is excludable, and we would expect the court of appeals not to undertake a de novo 403 balancing in its own instance.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Garre.  Mr. Egan.     Dennis E. Egan  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Cane, you have five minutes.     INTERRUPTING ",06-1221
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, what if you have a situation that's been referred to earlier, where you have four other supervisors that are presented as ""me, too"" evidence.  They are in the Los Angeles office.  The defendant's supervisor is in the Fresno office.  Is that evidence relevant?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It is just that they... they are alleged to have fired people for an impermissible basis under the age discrimination act as well.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  All right, let's take it and say yes.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but doesn't that beg the question?  We don't know.  This isn't a pattern and practice case.  You don't have evidence of a company-wide policy of discrimination.  Take my hypothetical.  There are just four people who are alleged to harbor age-based bias, and they... in the Los Angeles office.  No connection to the Fresno supervisor at all, other than that they work for the same company.  Is that enough for relevance?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It might not be relevant.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  404.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are these episodes that were necessarily communicated to the supervisor at issue here?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't make the... you don't suggest that he was even aware of these other anecdotes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you're conceding that we don't even know that that comment was communicated in any way to the supervisor at issue here.  He may not have been aware of it.  The supervisor... he may have been in Fresno and that supervisor in Los Angeles.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I assume there's no dispute over any direct evidence you have that the supervisor was being guided by a company policy or statement or the RIF program that was discriminatory.  The issue here is whether or not you can bring in testimony that... which has no demonstrated connection to the supervisor.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But what--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --What happens in this case?  Let's say there are five ""me, too"" situations presented, and the court make a determination in each one, and the jury finds for the plaintiff.  And then it's appealed, and the argument on appeal is, well, in three of those five cases there wasn't age discrimination and here's why.  And that evidence is... well then the court of appeals agrees, yes, those three cases shouldn't have been admitted.  Is that reversible error?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, under my hypothetical, in the three cases, the court of appeals, let's say, determines that the alleged statements did not occur.  That's the argument.  And this was admitted to the jury in three of the five cases, and those statements did not occur.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that reversible error on appeal?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Five gets you cases when the court of appeals determines that three did not occur?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if I assume your rule cuts the other way?  Let's say in this company of 70,000 or 17,000, or whatever it is, there are a thousand supervisors.  Four or five are alleged to have discriminated on the basis of age.  I assume the company can call the other 995 and say: Are there any allegations against you?  Did you fire people?  And did you in some cases keep the oldest one?  And then they have to... you know, they say yes.  So the, ""me, too"" evidence works both ways, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you are talking about culture, what is the culture of the company if 995 supervisors don't supervise... don't discriminate in their decisions and 5 do?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if company can admit evidence to show the opposite of your ""me, too"" evidence by other supervisors and you say five shows the culture of discrimination, how many are they allowed to admit before... to show the opposite culture?  Certainly more than five if they say this isn't representative.  You have to look at these 15 others.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  There are 15, 30, or however many is equally relevant.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think the court of appeals erred as well in ruling that the evidence was admissible?  Because as I understand your answer to Justice Souter, it is that there should be a 403 evaluation and the court of appeals didn't allow the district court to undertake that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And if on the remand that you conceded is necessary, that will take place in the context of a motion in limine and not in the context of a new trial?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think a new trial is required for the district court to make the 403 determination?   ",06-1221
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'd like you to address the distinction between the medical device area and the drug area because in the medical device area, of course, you have an express pre-emption clause, while here in contrast you don't.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If that's true you would have expected the Federal Drug Act to have a similar express pre-emption provision.  And one reason perhaps that it didn't is that when the Drug Act was passed you had an established background of State actions; when the Medical Device Act was passed you didn't.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Kneedler.     ",06-1249
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about the various portions of the label in the record that Mr. Waxman addressed and Mr. Kneedler, representing the FDA, said they specifically considered IV push risks?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they have to.  When they determine that it's safe to use it under those circumstances that necessarily includes a consideration of the risk.  People can say it's safe for you to walk down the sidewalk.  That doesn't mean there is no risk that you get hit by lightning or something else.  It just means in evaluating them together, they determine that it's worth the candle in particular cases where a physician determines that that's the indicated method.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought your -- I thought your theory was that this type of administration of the drug should not be allowed.  The label should not say here are the risks, here are the benefits.  You -- your jury theory was you cannot suggest in the labeling that physicians should have this available.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it simply says that if you go ahead with the label like this, you don't have to pay $10 million whenever it goes wrong.  That's having the effect, as our case has established, imposing a limitation on the label.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your case depends upon us determining that the risk at issue here that was presented to the jury was a new risk that the FDA did not consider?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Suppose--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --So now, your friends on the other side said there was specific consideration of IV push as opposed to simply arterial exposure, and that that is laid forth in the labeling.  So, as I understood your answer to be, all we have to do is simply look at the record, and if we think the FDA considered specifically IV push risks as opposed to general arterial exposure, then you lose, and if we determine that they did not, then they lose.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I don't know if the Vermont Supreme Court was emphatic about it.  I mean, the record is either -- addresses the FDA -- I'm more interested in what the FDA was emphatic about, and they either address IV push separately or they don't.   ",06-1249
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you agree that as a taxpayer seeking an exception to a general rule, you have the burden of proof in this case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We can't take... I guess it's not judicial notice, but we can't assume that individual investors with several million dollars of liquid assets might hire investment advisors?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do they usually hire investment advisors?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess you'd concede, wouldn't you, that you're not entitled to all of the investment advice that you receive but perhaps only that that is related to the trust status?  In other words, if your investment advisor charges you $50,000 and, you know, 10,000 of it is unique to the trust, but 40,000 is the same sort of advice he'd give an individual, you'd only be able to get the 10,000 outside of the 2 percent limit?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But they don't have to hire investment advisors.  There is a standard that they may think they can meet on their own.  They may... you know, it may be an investment advisor that is the trustee.  He doesn't have to hire somebody else.  So it's not something that necessarily inheres in the nature of the trust.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why... if I could pause you on that, why is that the case?  Let's say it's a... the trustee understands perfectly his obligations under the law.  Let's just say he is supposed to preserve capital and invest conservatively, but he wants advice on which is the best conservative investment.  You know, is it railroads or is it utilities?  And that's the investment advice he seeks... just that.  He says: I know how I'm supposed to invest as a fiduciary, but there are options in there, and I just want advice on the options.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, isn't that just like an individual investor?  If you have an individual investor with $10 million in liquid assets, he or she might know what he wants to do, either capital appreciation or preservation, you know, whatever the option is, but just wants some advice on how best to go about that.  That sounds exactly like the trustee in our hypothetical.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  You see, that's my difficulty with your position.  It's not uniquely trust because you certainly have individuals who may want income rather than capital appreciation or, you know, preservation of capital.  They may have exactly the same objectives as a trustee.  It's not unique to the trust.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Well, then let's take that.  Let's suppose that the trustee goes to an investment advisor, doesn't tell him that he is a trustee, just says, I need to know, I can't decide, should I invest in Union Pacific or CSX?  I'm going to invest in a railroad; which one do you like better?  He doesn't tell him he's a trustee, gets some advice and gets a bill.  Is that subject to the 2 percent floor, because presumably the advice has got nothing to do with fiduciary responsibilities?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no.  It's a reasonable... let's say a railroad stock is a reasonable investment for a trust.  He just wants to know which one is the best one.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How can it be distinctive if the advisor doesn't even know that the person's a trustee?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, when it's filled out--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --he knows it's on Form 1041 rather than 1040.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Rubin.  Mr. Miller.     Eric D. Miller  No.  It wouldn't be.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Miller.  Mr. Rubin, you have four minutes remaining.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it could also be tailored to an individual with particular circumstances that are similar to that of the trust.  So an individual could incur it.  An individual with the same amount of money involved probably would incur it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So an individual might have more than one child he wants to provide for and as far as a remainder, there may be more than one grandchild.  It could be exactly the same... an individual could have exactly the same objectives as a trustee.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1286
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You didn't think much of this argument before the Second Circuit adopted it, did you?  You didn't argue this before the Court of Appeals?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you have a fallback argument.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, now might be a good time to fall back.  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So how does your customary or commonly incurred test work?  Let's say you have two trusts, one $10 million, the other 10,000.  I think an individual with $10 million might well seek investment advice, but an individual with only 10,000 might decide it's not worth it.  Would you have a different application of the 2 percent rule for those two trusts?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How many... how many individuals do you need?  Let's say it's $3 million in the trust, and we think maybe 60 percent of people would hire an investment advisor; 40 percent would think they can do just as well on their own.  Is that customarily incurred by individuals?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your answer to both questions is ""might well be"", and that's a fairly vague line when it comes to taxes.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Or, even worse, advisors are going to break themselves up into different advisors.  There's going to be somebody who says I'm a fiduciary advisor whenever a trustee calls, but, I'm a normal advisor, when it's an individual.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What's your best case for that proposition?  Your colleague resisted the notion that he had the burden and what's your best case for that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I thought that rule applied to the applicability of individual exemptions.  Here we have a different question.  It's how to read an exception to the general rule.  Do you have a case for a proposition that the taxpayer has the burden in those cases?  You said that in your brief, but it didn't have a case cite with it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if you get a bill from the investor advisor, and it's $50,000 and it's broken up, 30,000 is general stock picking advice, and 20 percent is specialized fiduciary advice?  In other words, they figure out what good stocks are they pushing these days and they go down and say, well, you're a trustee, you can't buy this you can't buy that.  You would... would you agree that the $20,000 is not subject to the 2 percent floor but the 30,000 is?   ",06-1286
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, it's not.  I mean, a company could have a policy of firing everybody who complains about anything and the fact that a worker is over the age of 40 and is fired does not mean that he is being fired because of age.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of course the statute that covers age discrimination in the private sector does have an express provision addressing retaliation.  The one that governs Federal employees does not, and that's the government's main argument, that it's expressed in the private sector, it's not there in the public sector and so you shouldn't imply one.  What's your answer to that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The Federal employee, though, has all of the remedies under the Civil Service Reform Act for any type of employment practice.  Those remedies are elaborately reticulated and almost impenetrable, and yet this would add complication.  In other words, despite all the remedies under the CSRA that says in some cases you go here, in other cases you go here, and you get different types of review depending on the facts, all of that would be wiped away if you can bring a direct action under the age discrimination statute.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But not retaliation claims.  In other words, although the direct claims, as you put it, may or may not be carved out, a retaliation claim fits under the employment practices provisions of the CSRA, regardless of the basis for retaliation.  In other words, you took personnel action against me for an impermissible basis and therefore I'm entitled to the various civil service remedies.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it does that for a reason.  We have a lot of cases in the Federal Circuit and the D.C. Circuit that addresses a lot of these problems say that when the CSRA excludes certain types of claims of employees, they do it for a reason.  In other words, it's not simply that they didn't cover them or inadvertence, but they make the decision that the remedies that they've provided don't apply in a particular case.  And to say that those people who are excluded under the CSRA nonetheless have remedies for employment practices seems to me to undermine that... that judgment.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  When you qualified your answer by saying that the employee can control, was that a way to dismiss the collective bargaining rights?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about review under... by the Merit Systems Protection Board?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So when you're talking about the Office of Special Counsel--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, another reason it's not that simple is that under the Age Discrimination Act you have a private remedy that specifically provides for retaliation.  And that is noticeably absent from the Federal remedy.  And I thought that was the strongest argument on the government's side.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought there was a more express incorporation in Title VII of the private anti retaliation remedy, and you don't have that in this case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that makes it not precisely the same situation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Garre.     Gregory G. Garre  --I think, at least with respect to congressional employees, I'm not sure that they would have been protected by the Civil Service Reform Act protections that existed for executive agency employees, but... but look at the statutes... and we cite them at page 36 in the appendix and our brief... in those two statutes, Congress used the same substantive prohibition that is in section 633(a):  ""All personnel actions affecting these employees shall be made free from discrimination based on age. ""  But they explicitly included a separate anti retaliation provision, which, again... that's a subsequent statute, but that's... again, that's another indication that Congress doesn't think that this kind of general prohibition in section 633(a) covers discrimination.  When it wants to cover retaliation, it passes an express anti retaliation provision Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Garre.  Mr. Guerra, you have four minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that because they may not engage in collective bargaining, or because they have chosen not to?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose that's consistent with whatever prohibition it is that precludes them from engaging in collective bargaining.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think we do have to decide the Title VII question if you are to prevail.   ",06-1321
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you agree with your friend that this employee has no remedy under the Civil Service Reform Act?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is that?  I mean, if you have the private... the private sector remedy is not so limited, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if we imply or incorporate into the Federal anti discrimination remedy an anti retaliation provision, I assume it would be in the same scope as the private anti... the private antiretaliation provision.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't this an unusual retaliation case in that the person allegedly retaliated against also has substantive anti discrimination claims?  And I gather... I think it would take a particularly incompetent lawyer that couldn't phrase retaliation in those cases as underlying discrimination.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are those, are those mostly witness cases?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, it's a witness saying I think so and so was fired because of his age.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That does bring up Justice Alito's point.  I mean, tomorrow you're going to argue the exact opposite, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Or else that distinction between conduct and status would require you to lose.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I would have thought the answer to Justice Breyer's question would be: This is an unusual situation where you have the employer writing the law about what the employees can do, and Congress realized, perhaps unlike the situation in Title VII, everybody over 40 would be covered; and every time somebody over 40 was fired or disciplined or didn't get a raise, they could claim that it was age discrimination; and Congress decided that they as the employer didn't want to face that disturbance, particularly since they have the Civil Service Reform Act already.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I think... I think you're right about that.  I mean, once the lawyer's involved and they're in litigation and all that, they're not going to take conciliation efforts with the same light as before.  But the question is whether the remedy for that, which is some unfairness to you, is to throw the suit out or try to fix it as much as possible, such as through a stay or dismissing without prejudice or something.  Why should the Plaintiff... it's not his fault that the EEOC didn't notify you.  Why should he suffer the categorical sanction of dismissal simply because it's a little unfairness to you?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do we know... perhaps this is a question your friend on the other side will be able to answer better than you.  But do we know where she got the form, why she filled it out?  I couldn't find in the record whether this was given to her by someone at the EEOC or whether she downloaded it from the website or what.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I agree completely with everything you said.  I just don't understand your leap from government incompetence to saying the plaintiff loses.   INTERRUPTING John G.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Did you undertake conciliation efforts after her formal, her filing of the Form 5 charge?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, the Government relied in its brief very heavily on the Chevron case, saying we should defer to the agency's regulations, and on the Auer case, saying we defer to the agency to tell us what its regulations mean.  And you didn't cite either of those cases in your reply brief.  So I wonder what your answer is to that argument.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you're only... when you say you're hurt, the only prejudice that you rely on is the fact that you didn't have an opportunity to go through prelitigation conciliation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But... but my point is, you're not alleging prejudice from the lack of prompt notice.

Roberts, Jr.  I thought that the Department submitted a good brief on this issue, but in 1985.  What do you do with all the arguments... I'm looking at page 12 of your brief in the Englewood case, which you argued that these liens were interests in property.  Are those arguments no longer valid?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The other reasons you gave, the holder of a lien can bring an action to enjoin waste, holders of liens are entitled to compensation if eminent domain is exercised.  All of those reasons are still as valid as they were in 1985.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, how can the, how can the lien holder then bring an action to enjoin waste of the immovable property?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Cardozo.     Michael A.

So I'm not quite sure how that international practice reflected in or arising out of the convention is terribly pertinent.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Why couldn't you equally say this is a data processing company that happens to own a paper company?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, and Lexis/Nexis has been a data processing company since whenever.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not the oldest... whichever is oldest isn't the one that gets to be regarded as the dominant partner, is it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is General Electric a light bulb company or, since it owns NBC, a media company.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's because they sell paper in Illinois?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, Lexis sells data services in Illinois, too.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why doesn't... I mean, you just said, as I understand it, Illinois has the right to tax Lexis under business activities in Illinois.  Illinois would argue the reason it has a capital gain is partly because they were doing business in Illinois and so we should be entitled to part of that capital gain.  Almost... I mean, it seems to me it would be pretty easy if they get to tax 2 percent of Lexis's business, well then maybe they should get 2 percent of the capital gain when it's sold or tax 2 percent.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, isn't it kind of like futures hedging?  I mean, you've got a paper company and then you've got something that is sort of the paperless aspect, and they can look at it and say, well, we're kind of hedging our paper business by investing heavily in something that's supposedly going to take away the need for paper.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. Brinkmann, one thing that concerns me is how this will complicate the process.  I think, with respect to ordinary income, the States work this out, and they figure we get 5 percent because we have 5 percent of the presence or business, whatever.  Now, they're going to have that, and they're going to have an overlay on that.  They're going to say, well, it's 5 percent; but, you know, we sold this asset that doesn't have any connection to Illinois; and that's part of the income we've got.  So you don't get quite 5 percent of all.  And another... Illinois is going to come back and say, well, yes, but you sold this other one; and, as to that one, you've got sufficient connection with Illinois.  It seems to me it's going to be impossible to sort this out.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann.  Mr. Barov.     Brian F. Barov  --Your Honor, this is... but Your Honor, International Harvester is the perfectly precise fact pattern where this Court upheld a tax on a... on investors, on the shareholder's investment in a State in which they were not present, so... but in this case Mead had an independent tax presence also in Illinois.  So that issue just doesn't arise in this case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Ms. Brinkmann, you have three minutes.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. Brinkmann, your final point.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1413
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, why isn't your friend correct that you have waived any argument based on the presence of Lexis in Illinois?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that's... they are very different from your current argument, which you emphasize that whether they are unitary or not, Lexis/Nexis was in Illinois.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Now, as to that argument, at least I am very reluctant to overturn a State court on an argument that they didn't have an opportunity to consider.  And whether it's technically waived because you raised it in the trial court or not, it certainly was not an argument you made to the Illinois appellate courts.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it wasn't in Allied-Signal.  In Allied-Signal the asset that was sold was in New Jersey, and that was totally irrelevant to how we treated the issue in that case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's why it's even more dramatic to me that you didn't raise the argument based on the Lexis connection to Illinois.  That's the basis on which your auditor is claiming these taxes; and, yet, you don't even raise it before the Illinois appellate court as a ground for being able to reach the Lexis/Nexis income.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We couldn't do anything more if we said you haven't waived it, we couldn't do anything more than send it back.  You're telling us Lexis has this presence in Illinois, but we have nothing in the record about that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where is that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I just... usually appellate courts don't make findings.  That's why I'm curious--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I thought... I've been looking, too.  I thought 18A does say that they had $46 million of sales attributable to Lexis/Nexis.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, only 46 million.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It said 46, not hundreds of millions.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1413
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, is your position that in that situation a retaliation is not covered by 1981?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I would have thought that you could argue that it's direct discrimination.  In other words, if you're fired, whatever form the retaliation takes, that, as Justice Ginsburg suggests, that that would be on the basis... basis of race.  And I thought your position, or at least your position could be narrowed to say it's only when the individual against whom the retaliation takes place is not the individual complaining of the direct discrimination that your position would be pertinent.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's right.  That's why I thought the person directly discriminated against would be able to phrase the retaliation claim certainly as a discrimination claim.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We do have those recent cases, but we also have the Sullivan case interpreting... interpreting 1982, which arose under the prior approach to these questions.  And my question for you is: Under principles of stare decisis, which body do we follow, the earlier case interpreting 1982 under the more freewheeling approach to statutory interpretation or this later body of law that says we're not going to do that any more?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Hyndman.     Paul D. Clement  --I think you have to apply its reasoning.  That would be consistent with decisions like Runyon and Tillman that say that you apply 1982 cases and 1981.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.  Mr. Hawkins, you have three minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",06-1431
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, if we rule in your favor, why would anyone ever bring a Title VII action if they could bring a 1981 action?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  All right.  So if you bring... you'd at least bring them both, right, because--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --1981 allows you to get out of the Title VII cap on damages?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Or isn't that rendering Congress' careful... I mean the 1991 legislation was a careful compromise.  In exchange for the expansions of Title VII, they put caps on the damages.  You would allow them to keep the expansion, but do away with the caps.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you're just begging the question.  You're assuming you have the right that's at issue here today.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well then, why do they put the caps in?  I mean, I do think that is a limitation on the remedy they provided.  They provided a damage remedy with a very clear cap and it's not a particularly generous cap, either.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you would allow them to completely obliterate that cap under any case that could be brought under 1981.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  When you agreed with Justice Breyer that we're looking for a word that couldn't be there, you said yes, but it is in fact a word that is there in about 37 other statutes, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The word could be there.  I'm not saying whether it has to be there or not.  But it certainly could be there, and it's not here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But they provide a specific cause of action for retaliation, correct?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is this... the question I asked your friend and I'll ask you as well.  I think you have a case under Sullivan, which recognized, although it's 1982, this type of action.  But Sullivan would not come out the same way today given Alexander against Sandoval and our new approach to statutory interpretation.  So if you're concerned about stare decisis, which body of law do you give effect to, the Sullivan case or our more recent cases on how to read statutes?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of course, by 1991 our new approach to reading statutes was pretty clearly established.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if Congress were looking at both of those bodies of law, then wouldn't the normal care be for it to put in a retaliation provision?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  To the extent your argument relies so heavily on Sullivan, I went back and read it, and rather than an implied right of action case it looked to me like a third party standing case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I think... that's right.  Now I get back to another stare decisis question.  Do I rely on what Sullivan actually said, or I do I rely on Jackson's reinterpretation of Sullivan?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You agree, though, that the language in the opinion focuses on it as a third party standing question.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  General Clement.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, if you have--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --If you have an employer who fires everybody who complains about practices at work, that would not be covered retaliation?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you think it's unusual for employers to have a practice that anybody who alleges that I've committed a violation of Federal law, I want to get rid of them?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't have any doubt that Sullivan would come out differently today under our current analysis?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The correct reading of Jackson or of Sullivan?   ",06-1431
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, It wouldn't eliminate it.  Your friend on the other side says it the simply delays it, because you get to arbitrate de novo after the commissioner's decision.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess I could let him answer, but I suppose he would say you go to that court, and you get a motion to compel arbitration.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I have to confess I've never understood these choice of alaw provisions.  You incorporate California law.  I assume California law is interpreted consistent with Federal law.  If Federal law preempts California law, that's what you're incorporating.  It always struck me as kind of circular.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  When you say California law applies, you don't mean to the exclusion of Federal law?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, would you have any problem with a California law that said you can arbitrate but the arbitrator must allow the Labor Commissioner to file an amicus brief?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if it goes on and says, and you must allow the Labor Commissioner to appear at the arbitration?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, what if it says you've got to wait for 30 days to allow the Labor Commissioner to consider whether or not to intervene?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How was the arbitrator chosen?  Does he or she have any particular expertise in this area?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Brunstad.     G. Eric Brunstad, Jr.  It is disputed whether he was acting as a talent agent or not.  I wish to clarify that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Mr. Schleimer, you have nine minutes remaining.     ",06-1463
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Normally we say that those types of disputes are for the arbitrator to decide.  The theory is that the arbitrator can apply the existing law as well as a court, and if that's the theory, couldn't the arbitrator apply the existing law as well as an agency?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right, so you at least have that additional step.  It is... particularly since you only have 10 days to appeal from the labor commissioner, someone who wants to arbitrate has to appeal, has to go to superior court and get a motion to compel.  You can't even wait to see if your opponent goes to superior court and... well, if he has won, he wouldn't go into court.  But you have to go to the court to get a motion to compel?  You can't just go ahead and proceed with arbitration.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And if you... and if you are successful and get from the superior court an order to compel arbitration, your opponent can then appeal it, I assume.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, do you--   ",06-1463
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  We don't... and this may be the point that you just made, but I want to clarify it.  We don't have to decide whether this diversion was with respect to stock, because you put that at issue, and you weren't allowed to make that--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I suppose it would be open on remand for the Government to argue it was not with respect to stock for the reasons that have come out, that it was just a diversion?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Cline.  Ms. Maynard.     Deanne E.

And where is it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Breyer's point is that that isn't directed to that issue.  It's directed to the issue of whether he was using the funds for a corporate purpose.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that evidence came in after the proffer, didn't it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, this is a motion in limine which is before the trial.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's kind of hard to say it's with respect to stock when the other stockholder doesn't get any.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What page in your brief did you say?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of your reply brief?   ",06-1509
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the court didn't let the taxpayer submit evidence.  He came forward and said: Look, there's an issue here despite the return of capital.  I would have thought at that point the burden shifted to you again.  That burden... having met that burden of production or at least tried to, the burden would shift to you to show, no, it's not a return of capital, it's a dividend.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  He said in his proffer that he would present expert testimony that this... the corporation didn't have profits and earnings, and therefore it was a return of capital.  And the district court said no, you don't get to do that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  I mean, the district court... the district court said that's not relevant, it's not relevant whether they could be classified as dividends.  I'm quoting from your brief on page 8:  ""It is not relevant whether the funds could have been classified as a return of capital or a dividend at the time when they were diverted. ""  because, he said, what was relevant is... is the intent, whether they were in fact treated as return of capital.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but if he is making a profit and it depends upon whether or not there's adequate earnings or not, isn't he plainly saying that that means it's with respect to my stock?  Because if he were getting it, for example, as an employee for consideration, it wouldn't matter whether there was sufficient earnings or not.  But when he says it depends on whether there's sufficient earnings, it seems to me that that's clearly notifying you that he's saying it's with respect to his stock.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  This is a criminal case.  He's presented the argument, but don't you have the burden of showing as an element of tax deficiency that what he's proffering there is not true?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's not right.  He says right here that it may or may not be income depending on a fact, not an expert's opinion, whether or not HIE had earnings and profits for the years when the moneys were obtained by Boulware.  That's a question of fact.  You look at the corporate books.  You get the accountant on to testify.  It's not an expert's view on what's legally relevant.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not totally relevant if the question he is trying to submit, whether they are earnings or profits or not, which will affect its treatment.  It's only relevant if it's with respect to stock.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1509

Roberts, Jr.  There wouldn't be tax... taxpayer standing, but of course there would be regular Article III standing in the sense that in a party claiming to be injured because they didn't get a grant, and a religious organization did, and the reason was religion, can bring any kind of claim they want under Article III.  It's just they wouldn't qualify for the special exception to the general rule that there is no taxpayer standing for establishment clause cases.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Any, presumably any other denomination that is not of the established church could bring a challenge that they're being discriminated against, because they're favoring a particular church over them.  Your proposition is simply that somebody... somebody in Oregon can't challenge the fact that they're building a church in Florida simply because the person in Florida pays taxes, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Under that, under that approach, when a U.S. Marshal executes a search and there's a Fourth Amendment claim that the search is illegal, that's really a challenge to the appropriation of the Marshals Service on an as-applied basis.   ",06-157X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's... I guess that's my first question.  I don't understand under your theory why any taxpayer couldn't sue our Marshal for standing up and saying  ""God save the United States and this honorable Court. ""  Her salary comes from Congress.  You can trace that under your traceability requirement.  So any taxpayer under your theory could bring that lawsuit.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's very... I can identify it.  It's the appropriations that Congress extends to this Court that pay the salary of the Marshal.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Take Justice Breyer's Pilgrim church.  Under your theory, if the grant was to erect a memorial and suitable museums or whatever at Plymouth, Plymouth Rock, then there wouldn't be an identifiable sum if the Government said, hey, let's use some of this money to build a church?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The Government singles it out.  By that you mean the executive who's implementing it, as opposed to Congress?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do they... in other words, if they spend the money are they singling it out?  If it turns out it costs a million dollars to build the little Pilgrim church is that an identifiable sum singled out that would satisfy your requirement?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it doesn't have to be a grant, just that you can say it costs so much money.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if we rule in your favor, then every Government agency has to make sure that whatever activities they undertake are part of a broader office?  They don't set up a separate White House office.  They just run it out of the White House office.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's purely... a purely formalistic distinction.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that would decide whether it's central or not.  If you have a White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, then you can say it's central to it.  If it's just the White House office, then the argument would be, no, that's not central.  They do a lot of other stuff as went.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the Marshall in both--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --We're trying to decide whether it is central.  You have to decide what unit you're looking at before deciding whether the activity is central.  And you're just saying well, just look at the people who are doing the offensive activity, and it's obviously going to be central to what they're doing.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If Justice Stewart agreed completely with what the Court said, why did he write a separate opinion?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And just to add to the question, before you answer, at the jurisdictional stage.  In other words, this would be litigation over whether the individual taxpayer has standing.  The Court would first have to determine whether the activity you're challenging is incidental or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe they're reading Flast different than you read it.  There are not a lot of these challenges because you don't have standing under Flast.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what would happen if--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well then, five meetings isn't enough.  How many?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  20?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Again... I asked this before, and I think you were cut off before you had a chance.  Incidental with respect to what?  All of the money for a particular meeting, a particular breakfast, a particular whatever, is it incidental to that, or is it incidental to however many times the President has breakfast if he goes to a prayer breakfast?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So even if the expenditure is very small, but to take a particular religious symbol that might be offensive to some other people, is that incidental because the meeting went on longer and cost more than the particular religious symbol?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if it was 2 dollars, you would say it's not incidental because it covered the whole cost of purchasing the religious symbol?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of course.  But the point is that makes--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --But that shows how totally manipulable your incidental test is.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess the question I was asking earlier, you have overlapping but not concentric categories, so the ""opposing"" may be broader than the ""participating in"" depending upon how we define either one.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what more could Ms. Crawford do to make it clear that she opposes what was alleged in this case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, how can the fact that what led to the statement change the characterization of the statement?  She can initiate it, go in and say, ""I oppose what's going on"", or if somebody just asks her, you know,  ""how do you feel about what's going on. ""  she says she opposes it.  It seems to me in either case you look at the statement and not what led to the statement.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's why my hypothetical uses the word ""oppose"".  In the first case, she goes in of own volition and says, ""I oppose""; in the second case, she says ""I oppose"" in response to a question.  Congress used the word ""oppose"", and my hypothetical in both cases used the word ""oppose"".   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  Well, is it real a magic word?  She comes in and says, ""you won't believe"" -- you know --  ""you think that's bad, wait till I tell you what he did to me. ""  and goes on tells -- it's quite obvious from the context that she opposes it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  Please finish your answer.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought Faragher and Ellerth--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I thought Faragher and Ellerth were limited to the hostile work environment cases.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well -- well, that's a different question.  Is the defense we recognized in Ellerth and Faragher in the hostile work environment case or in the specific action case as well?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're not going to win -- you're not going to win this case; you're going to settle if you lose up here, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  My point is simply that the incentive system is skewed because if you lose you pay not only your attorneys' fees but the complainants'.  If you win, you have to incur yours.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not saying it shouldn't be.  But in terms of the pressures towards settlement, it is a very strong incentive.   ",06-1595
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You seem to... you seem to flinch from the natural consequences of your position in not looking at the maximum for a particular offender.  For example, you know, under some guidelines, if he was the ringleader his sentence can be enhanced beyond what would otherwise be the maximum for a first-time offender, but you say you don't take that into consideration.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is that different from your position here, where it is the fact that the individual is a recidivist that causes you to look to a different maximum?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that's the reason you sort of pull back from a more aggressive reading, because it's not as broad a category?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but only if they're subject... only if they have some characteristic that had caused the State legislature to give the higher maximum, such as being the ringleader or some other enhancement.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Surely not, Mr. Shanmugam.  You were talking about broad categories earlier.  It seemed that the broad category in the situation you posit would be the normal offender rather than the recidivist, and that's the one we ought to look at.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I know, but you began your discussion by saying we had to choose one maximum.  You were accepting that requirement.  It seems to me, if that's the case, it's clear that we ought to pick the maximum for the particular offense without considering additional enhancements.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you don't accept that approach when we're talking about enhancements under State guidelines.  You know, if the normal sentence is whatever it is, 10 years, and you get an extra 2 years if you're the ringleader, you say no, you don't look at that; you just look at the 10 years.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Rothfeld.     Charles A. Rothfeld  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Shanmugam, you have three minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",06-1646
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't it pertinent, Mr. Rothfeld, that in trying to decide whether a maximum term of imprisonment encompasses recidivists, we're dealing with a statute that itself is directed to recidivism.  You're asking... you've got three previous convictions and then you get a particularly harsh sentence.  If recidivism is what you're trying to address, it would seem to me in deciding what a maximum term is that it would be natural to assume that they would take recidivism into consideration in that context as well.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it just seems to me that if you have Congress addressing what they regarded as a very serious problem of recidivism, they would think that that's a problem that should be taken into account in determining what maximum sentences you're subject to under State law.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, we know it was focusing on the particular problem of recidivism.  That's what the overarching Federal statute is directed to.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And I think, following up on Justice Kennedy's question, that you would assume that this Congress thought that recidivists presented particular problems that were different from the one particular offense.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the flip side of that hypothetical is somebody selling a ton of marijuana.  It's the same offense as somebody who's done it and been convicted of it three different times.  I mean, I don't think your hypothetical helps advance the argument.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, if you were representing a... a defendant who has two prior convictions for something that has a sentence of 8 years, and on the third one he is subject to a sentence of 15 years; and your initial meeting, the first thing he wants to know is what's the maximum that I'm facing?  Would you tell him it's 8 years or would you tell him it's 15 years?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, the Government of course responds to your rule of lenity argument by saying it loses a lot of its force when we are talking about how... the degree of sentencing rather than whether conduct is subject to a criminal sanction in the first place.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But someone who is, you know, we are trying to decide whether he is subject to 20 years in jail or 30 years in jail, invoking the rule of lenity is a little bit... it's not the same as somebody who comes in and says I didn't know this was a crime at all, because it's so vaguely written.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, we know... we know that someone's liberty is going to be taken away in a case like this; it's just a question of for how long.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It is... it is a fundamental verbal embarrassment for your argument that you would say in a particular case that the maximum to which someone is subject is say, 5 years, and that person is in fact sentenced to 15 years.  It's just the... the words don't fit together under that argument.   ",06-1646
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Did General MacArthur have effective jurisdiction and control in Japan?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So a habeas court here has to look at all those different factors and come to a determination of whether it has jurisdiction?  There's no bright line?  It has to look at whether hostilities have ceased or haven't ceased?  It's got to look at how far the prisoners have been removed from the zone of hostility?     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the control in the middle of a zone of hostilities of a foreign national allows... creates habeas jurisdiction?  That's your bright line?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then it's not just control.  It looks to citizenship, which brings up the questions Justice Stevens was raising.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that's pretty far removed from the bright line.  I mean, now you've got to decide whether it's in the zone of hostilities or not.  You've got to decide if this is within the time period that the Court should not exercise jurisdiction or not.  And what's going to happen, of course, is that the district court is going to look at this and say, I can't decide all of that right away.  Let's enter an injunction, a preliminary injunction such as at issue here, while I decide these questions.  And that's going to have the effect of intruding quite extensively on the exercise of executive authority.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let me try and move you to the merits.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I had thought that the historic purpose of the Great Writ was to challenge custody.  And it seems to me that the last thing your clients want in this case is to be released.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't want the district court to say you win, you can be released tomorrow at noon.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I thought you wanted to block the transfer.  I mean, the Iraqi authorities can pick him up at the gate.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought the relief that was awarded by the district court also enjoined prosecution.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You want... I'm sorry.  I just want to make sure I understand.  You want the relief in both of these cases to be, okay, we will release him tomorrow at noon?  And by the way, we're going to notify the Iraqi authorities because we think we're releasing a dangerous criminal and want to make sure they have the opportunity to do whatever they want?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And don't tell--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --And don't tell the Iraqis where that's going to be?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's within the executive's discretion.  I want to know if you are saying that the district court in this case can require the custodian not simply to release the person, but to release them somewhere else and to keep the point at which they're going to release someone whose been determined by the MNFI tribunal to be a dangerous criminal, to keep the point of his release secret from the Iraqi government.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Now the determination that the transfer would be unlawful, I... again, I get back... maybe I'm repeating myself.  I have always understood habeas to be concerned with custody, rather than this broad range of determinations about what's lawful and unlawful, other than as are necessary to rule on the question of custody.  In other words, of course, if there's been a Fourth Amendment violation, you bring a habeas action, you determine whether the custody is lawful or not.  Here you want a determination whether the transfer is unlawful or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Whether it does or does not, I just question whether habeas is an appropriate remedy in that situation, again because it's not concerned with the legality of transfer; it's concerned with the legality of custody.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you had filed it... if you had filed it six months rather than a year after, would there be habeas jurisdiction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You see where I'm going.  Three months?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The bright line is getting awfully fuzzy, as far as I'm concerned.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Margulies, let me make sure there are no other questions.   ",06-1666

Roberts, Jr.  Is there a limit to your proposition?  In other words, let's stipulate that the individuals are going to be released in a situation where you know that they won't receive anything resembling due process and will be subject to abuse.  What happens in that case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And do you agree that... do you concede that habeas is concerned with the safety of the individual as opposed to his custody?

Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  ""Traditionally subsumed in the lawyer's rate. ""  are you suggesting, when this statute was passed, they weren't billed separately to the client?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's... I saw that analysis.  This Act only applies when the government's position is not substantially justified.  People are not going to structure their billing arrangements assuming the government's position is not even going to be substantially justified.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That point makes some assumptions about the relative abilities, say, of junior associates and senior paralegals, and I'm not sure are well founded.  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that pertinent... is that pertinent on the cap questions we've been discussing too?  I mean, if you're representing a disabled veteran, is the lawyer typically charging more than $125 an hour?   ",06-1717
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You say the relevant one was of course on a legislation that wasn't passed, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well and it might be quite different for private practitioner.  Your benefits for health care will probably cost you a lot less than private practice and doesn't that make the paralegal fees quite different than the other items of expenses that are listed?  You know, expert witnesses, you get a bill, that's how much it costs the lawyer.  Studies, analysis, engineering reports, you don't have to figure overhead benefits with respect to any of those.  All of a sudden you throw in another item, paralegal costs, you put those under costs, and now you've got to go through this elaborate calculation that is going to be not worth it, almost, for a typical firm representing a small client.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, in most firms an engineering report would be outside the--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, but that wasn't Justice Kennedy's question.  His was the outsourced paralegal is better at a particular task.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, your... this question only arises when the position of your client was not substantially justified.  Now under those... and it was designed, to some extent, to penalize you because... because of that fact.  Why should we adopt a construction that, in effect, penalizes the client who has had to face the Federal Government when the Federal Government's position was not substantially justified?  They are going to have to pay the paralegal fees at market rates, but they are only goes to get compensation at cost.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's kind of a stretch to suggest in a situation where they pass a law that only applies to individuals or small businesses where they put a cap in and so on, that another way that we are going to prevent damage to the fisc was to treat paralegal expenses as costs rather than at market rate.  I suspect that was not foremost in their mind.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it assumes that when they said ""costs"", that they meant costs to the firm as opposed to costs to the client.  And that, I think, is entirely an open question.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not to belabor the point it meant that the people who drafted the Senate report may have meant that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do we know what the President's view was on that question when he signed the legislation into law, which is what he was required to do before it became law and which he did not do under the prior bill?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, maybe this is the same question Justice Breyer asked, but I haven't... I didn't grasp the answer.  Under your system it would make sense for lawyers to charge separately for photocopy services, telephone services, so on because then they are not going to be subject to the attorney fee cap.  And they may think, look, the difference between cost and market rate is relatively small; the difference between our hourly rate and $125 is large.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm just saying if we adopt your position, isn't it going to be, I guess, worse for your client because firms will, as I've been told firms sometimes do, charge separately for things at a higher rate than their cost?  They will charge higher rate for photocopy services because they try to factor into it overhead and things like than cost.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I would say... I would say that it's now traditional for firms to charge, say, more for their photocopy services than it cost them.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I think you missed my point.  It was even if you're right, 50 cents and they can only charge 15 cents, they have an incentive to separately charge for photocopying, because they get the 15 cents, and otherwise it's going to... they are going to lose it over the cap if you say no that's part of the attorney's fees.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  I thought that was your... your theory was a little more nuanced.  In other words, they don't require you to market a particular catheter.  And you... what I understood you to be arguing is that there may be a better design and that it was negligent for the manufacturer to market a particular design, even though they're allowed to; they don't have to.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  They should have made the change to make it safer, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if that's--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, if that's what happens, what, as a... what's going to happen for patients at a time when your theory comes up, the manufacturer looks at it and says, well, maybe this is a better device; we don't want to risk these tort suits, so we're going to stop selling our old device that's been approved, but now we have got to get FDA approval of the new device and that might take forever or at least a year, let's say.  And what happens to patients in that year?  They've got no device.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But your theory is that although this device has been approved, here's a better one.  And it's negligent on the manufacturer's part to market a device, even though approved by the FDA, when there's a better one that would reduce the risks.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you want them to do if you think it's negligent for them to market the approved product?  Don't you want them to take it off the market?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not that it is not reasonably safe.  It's that another design would be safer.  And you think that's a basis for negligence because you say, yeah, the FDA approved it, but that doesn't mean they required the manufacturer to market that device.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that's just like a car speedometer.  I mean, the speedometer goes up to 120 miles an hour, but that doesn't mean you are supposed to drive it that fast.   INTERRUPTING John G.

In other words, did he win any of the trespass citations?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I... I think part of what's happening here is there is difference between the regulation on the books and how they are enforced.  Just as a hypothetical, let's say they don't... the Government doesn't get its reciprocal easement that it wants, and so it says look, we normally don't strictly enforce these cattle trespass things, but we are going to go by the book with this guy until he gives us the right-of-way.  Every time his cattle cross over the line we are going to hit him with a trespass citation.  They don't do it for anybody else but, they're going to do it for him because they want to get the reciprocal right-of-way.  Is that appropriate or inappropriate?   INTERRUPTING John G.

When your client has appealed, they've upheld the trespass citations.  When you've sued for malicious prosecution, the suit's been rejected.  Which of the government actions do you not have an existing remedy for, apart from the Racketeer and Corrupt... RICO Act or the, this new Bivens claim?   INTERRUPTING John G.

So long as you... and their position is you have a remedy for everything you're complaining about, and you invoked some of them and you lost, you didn't invoke others and so you didn't prevail.  But don't create a whole new remedy just because you're dissatisfied with having to pursue each one individually.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You say this clearly establishes.

If they go up to somebody and say, you know, we'd really like a right-of-way because we have some interest in lands that we need to maintain on the other side, and the person says, no and, you know, get off my property, do they have to shrug their shoulders and say all right?

Roberts, Jr.  But the point... the point is that it's the issuance of a permit under the program, whether administered by the Federal Government or the State government that has the potential for jeopardizing endangered species.  It is not the administration of the program.  And EPA has in place the procedures to allow them to review the particular permits, which what is what might jeopardize an endangered species.  And they don't need to leverage their limited authority, their non-discretionary authority to approve a transfer, to have that authority to review the actual act that might jeopardize an endangered species.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what is... is there any limitation?  Let's say that EPA says we're all set to approve this transfer, except OSHA sent us a letter and they don't like the occupational safety rules you have at the State environmental agency; so until you change those rules, or enter a memorandum of agreement that you're going to change those rules, we're not going to approve the transfer.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  But what would you cite to, in response to the prior cases that said you had no cause of action for abasement of interest?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the one I'm looking at just has (e)(1).  Did you have a page number?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, sure.  But... but that's just saying, if... you used to have the entitlement under (e)(2) and you're saying well, you could bring cases under (e)(2).  But 6404(h) allows you to bring cases under (e)(1).  It would follow a fortiori that you could bring them for (e)(2) as well, but that doesn't prove that you could prove them under (e)(1) in the claims court or the district court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if you went into the district court and claimed that the failure to abate interest was an abuse of discretion, what would you rely on for the... for the cause of action?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought the prior cases consistently, consistently said that there was no judicial review because it was 6404(h)(1) that there was a cause of action for abuse of discretion?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you want to look at 6404(h)(1) saying now we have a standard, but you don't want the other stuff that goes along with 6404(h)(1), which is it's in the tax court; you got to have less than ten million, blah, blah, blah?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of course, there's a fundamental difference on this particular question between pay and sue and sue--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --prepay, because if you... in the district court if you're paying and suing you're not really subject to the accrual of interest, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If I owe the IRS, 1,000 dollars and they send me a bill and I paid the 1,000 dollars, they've got the money, I don't.  So I don't owe interest on that, do I?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The initial bill includes the interest?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But still, in the tax court situation it's still accruing?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Redding.  Mr. Marcus.     Jonathan L. Marcus  That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.  It involves questions about administrative problems that might arise during the processing of the taxpayer's case.  A ministerial act, the failure to transfer a file when a taxpayer moves from one jurisdiction to another, or after, or notice of deficiency if the agent just delays in issuing the notice because he forgot about it and it just sat on his desk for a couple of days.  Those are the kinds of issues that, that come up in interest abatement actions.  If the Court has no further questions the court of appeals should be affirmed.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you Mr. Marcus.  Mr. Redding, you have four minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",06-376X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But what the cases said prior to 6404(h) when they asked for interest abatement was not that we don't have jurisdiction to consider that claim.  They would just say there's no standard to apply, so it's committed to agency discretion by law.  Then all of a sudden 6404(h) comes along and gives you a standard, so that removes that objection.  What's wrong with that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's because of the way that Congress enacted the language.  It doesn't say that the tax court and only the tax court shall have jurisdiction.  It says the tax court shall have jurisdiction.  That is a, in many respects a preferred forum and they're saying you can bring it there as well, but it doesn't take away the jurisdiction that the prior courts had recognized.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Don't you think it's kind of strange, though, if you have the interest abatement is available only for a particular category of taxpayer and not others?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you have a net worth of two million and one dollar you can't get any interest abatement, but if it's $2 million you can.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right, but you abate it in some cases, but you don't abate it in the others.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's what I thought, too.  But then your friend explained that in the initial bill is where the interest is contained in a lot of these cases and in this case in particular.  So it's not as if you have the opportunity to pay it in advance to stop the accrual of interest.  Just you get the bill and you find out, you know, you owe a 1,000 dollars and 300 of it is interest.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The difference... the difference is that the district court, the claims court already has jurisdiction for pay and sue claims, if you pay the IRS you can sue to get a refund.  And so this isn't as if we're looking at something that says the tax court has jurisdiction and trying to use that as a wedge to get other jurisdiction.  There's already a grant of jurisdiction.  The problem was, there was no standard of review for these may abate claims, and all of a sudden we find in this provision there is a standard of review, it's abuse of discretion, and that fills the void.  Why can't they just use that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I thought what you had argued before when people would try to seek this release was that there's no standard of review to hold the Secretary's exercise of discretion up against.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But one thing you never said was that there was no jurisdiction, because there is jurisdiction in the district court.  If you've paid money to the IRS and you want it back, you can bring a refund action.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can they bring it as additional claim after they get the final determination?  They start a whole separate action for interest abatement?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it part of the same proceeding or is it a separate proceeding?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're making the claim that it's no big deal that you have to go to the district court to get your refund and then go to the tax court to get the interest abatement, which does seem like a big deal to me.  And you say, well, in the tax court you have to do it separately, too, but it seems to me that if it is the same proceeding it is not much.   ",06-376X

Roberts, Jr.  One thing I couldn't clearly discern from your brief is the significance you attached to the defendant's, defense failure to object.  How does that enter into our analysis?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought Justice Stevens's articulation of Judge Kozinski's opinion was exactly right but I thought you would in response cite us to page 208a where the Washington Supreme Court said that those jurors' views, including Mr. Deal, would have prevented or substantially impaired their ability to follow the court's instructions and abide by their oaths as jurors.  It seems the court of appeals judge overlooked that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is this something particular under Washington procedure, this summary and conclusions section at the end of the opinion?

It is surely not the law that just, whenever a juror says sure, I'll follow the instructions, that he's automatically... has to be seated?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  After several times saying the only time he would consider it is if the person is going to reoffend.  I mean, if he just gets the right answer once out of six times and it's the last time, is the judge required to ignore the prior colloquy?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But look at page... look at page 262.  He says, you know, could... could you... when do you think the death penalty is appropriate?  If the person would reviolate if released.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  There are others.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if the... what if the voir dire... what if the juror said just what he said on a few occasions, that I would consider it if the person would reviolate?  And that was all.  That would be a basis for excusing him?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't go as far as Judge Kozinski?  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now on the that, just the language you just focused on, on page 75, if that was correct, you disagree with it, but if if the court concluded that the juror had not overcome the idea that he must kill again before imposing the death penalty, that would be a sufficient basis for excusing him?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah.  How many paraded by?  I mean, do we know?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In your view, do we look at this any differently through AEDPA than if we were looking at this on direct review?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that makes a difference in the standard of review that we apply in this case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, does that mean we give a greater degree of deference?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm just trying to get a handle on your view as to whether the standard of review with respect to deference to the State court is different in this respect than it would be on direct review?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought your brother made the point that there was a more elaborate explanation of the trial judge's determinations when there had been an objection.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Substantially impaired.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which is a lot different than irrevocably committed.   INTERRUPTING John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it's not like under the Sherman Act, where we have reason to think Congress intended the Court to go about the business of construing and developing antitrust law.  In fact, they have kind of taken over for us.  They are imposing certain limits on when actions can be brought, proposing particular specific elements.  In one of the provisions, 20(e), specifying the SEC can bring an action but private investors can't.  I mean, we don't get in this business of implying private rights of action any more.  And isn't the effort by Congress to legislate a good signal that they have kind of picked up the ball and they are running with it and we shouldn't?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's kind of my point.  We did that sort of thing in 1971.  We haven't done it for quite sometime.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not... my suggestion is not that we should go back and say that there is no private right of action.  My suggestion is that we should get out of the business of expanding it, because Congress has taken over and is legislating in the area in a way they weren't back when we implied the right of action under 10(b).   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it... is it a necessary part of your theory that the deceptive practice that Scientific-Atlanta went in, that they knew that that was also... that Charter would carry that forward?  I mean, let's suppose that there were benefits to this deceptive practice to Scientific-Atlanta, that it looked like it had more money to spend on advertising than it really did, but they didn't care what Charter did with it.  In fact, they didn't know that Charter was going to carry it on its books the way they did.  Would there still be liability for Scientific-Atlanta?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why shouldn't we be--  guided by what Congress did in reaction to the Central Bank case?  There we said there's no aiding-and-abetting liability, Congress amended the statute in 20(e) to say yes, there is, but private plaintiffs can't sue on that basis.  Why shouldn't that inform how we further develop the private action under 10b-5?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But they were... they were addressing a very specific decision from this Court, the Central Bank decision.  And the one thing they did not do is say that that decision was wrong with respect to private... or going forward they weren't going to overrule that decision with respect to private rights of action.  You're asking us to extend to non... I know you call it a primary violator, but not the person who--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --who put the--  deceptive conduct into the market.  You're asking us to extend that liability to them, which seems inconsistent with Congress's approach in 20(e).   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's... but that's not the fraud that was imposed upon the market.  The fraud that was imposed on the market was Charter's accounting for the transaction on its books.  Nobody bought or sold stock in reliance upon the way that Scientific-Atlanta and Charter structured their deal.

John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, certainly that may be true, but it certainly relates to the service of a carrier.  I understood your argument to be that we can't read that language literally.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It talks about what carriers have to do, so... in connection with delivery, so it relates to the service of the motor carrier.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It doesn't dictate what they have to do.  They can get out of the business.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, we also considered it in Morales, and I thought this law was enacted in the immediate wake of Morales, which adopted a much broader reading of ERISA cases.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Stern.  Ms. Brinkmann.     Beth S. Brinkmann  --What we are responding to is the cert petition from the State here.  I would point out that... an example that the Court itself gave is under their health and safety exemption, that means that the State could come and just put a surcharge, whether it would be on tobacco or junk food.  There is no line to draw between the position they take here and that kind of situation.  We point to the text of the statute, of course, and the findings about the burdens on interstate commerce of the interstate regulation.  The structure... there is a facie exemption for motor vehicles and even that has a Department of Transportation Federal backdrop against it.  And in the Morales opinion from this Court, they pointed to the Airline Deregulation Act, which is very important here because that statute is construed just as this is.  And in the Morales the Court pointed out that an earlier bill had had the kind of economic regulation that the State here seeks and it was rejected.  Then of course in this very case, the Congress... conference report embraced the Morales standard and in fact described it as a broad preemptive standard they intended apply here.  So we believe that that is the standard that should really apply, but in light of the effect that this has on the carrier services, we suggest it means any standard of or are related to.  There's certainly an immediate connection with... and there are express references in these provisions that we suggest means any preemption standard.  If there's... one other thing I would say, up the C(3)(C), the provision which the State suggests does not directly dictate services, first of all the Solicitor General reads the statute anew and suggests that there may be direct enforcement against the carriers, which certainly would changes our view of that, because there is an instruction requirement that the shipper give to the carrier and say, State law mandates this.  Moreover, we would like to point out, for example, in the Wolens case, the frequent flyers program that was at issue there was not a mandatory aspect of the services, and also in the Court's own recent Clean Air Act case, where there's also the ""relating to"" language used.  Engine manufacturers realize this, that you can't regulate the seller through the purchaser.  Thank you, Your Honor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann.  Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: I think there's no question that the State of Maine could not require carriers to obtain a license to deliver tobacco products and condition that upon the carrier's service complying with the mandates of State law, that that would be a law that relates to the carrier's service.  Now, Maine maintains that its law is saved from preemption because of two distinctions: One, it that is adopted with a health rather than economic purpose, and because it operates directly on the shipper rather than the carrier.  And we don't think that either of those arguments is consistent with the text, structure, or legislative history of the Act.  But I would want to point--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're talking about the Federal act or the Maine act?     --The Federal act.  That's right.  But it's worth noting that those arguments, in any event, only go to the provision in C(3)(C).  The provision that is under dispute in section D does not have either of those characteristics.  It operates directly on the carrier, and it is not adopted for the health concern but rather to support the State's licensing and tax purposes.  But if I could go back to the reasons why their argument is inconsistent with the text, structure, and history of the Federal act, as Respondents' counsel noted, Congress did consider an alternative version of this bill, one that was limited to economic regulation, and the Congress rejected the Senate version and adopted instead the House version that much more broadly pre-empted State regulation related to carrier services.  It added the provision of services and adopted the ""related to"" standard rather than regulation.  And so it has rejected this limitation that Petitioners urge.  Moreover, the argument that there is a general health exception to the pre-emptive force of the FAAAA is inconsistent with the structure of the Act.  There are specific exceptions in the Act related, for example, to motor carrier safety, but those exceptions correspond to other grants of authority to the Secretary of Transportation to adopt regulations and to pre-empt State regulations that would interfere with interstate commerce or impose too much of a burden on interstate commerce.  There is no similar back top, if the court reads into the FAAAA a textual general exception for any act adopted with a health purpose by the States.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could I follow up on Justice Kennedy's question, though, and specifically, do you think the New York settlement, if the carriers did not agree to it, that they would nonetheless prevail because the terms of it are pre-emptive?     I have not studied the New York statute sufficiently to speak to that, and I don't think the government has a position about that.  We do believe... the settlement agreement, though, is distinct from the Maine law in some very significant respects.  And the most important of those is that under the settlement agreement, the carriers agree to use reasonable best efforts; whereas the Maine provision... this is the second sentence of D... deems the carrier to have knowledge--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, see, you are... you are pretty familiar with the New York settlement then.  [Laughter]     --I have some familiarity with it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then I think you ought to be able to tell me whether you think it's pre-empted by the Federal law under your theory or not.     Well, I... Your Honor, we have not taken a position on whether the settlement is and, with respect... although I have familiarity with the settlement, I have less familiarity with the underlying New York statute that it was agreed to, in response to--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you have familiarity with the knowing delivery requirement here.     --Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that pre-emptive under your view?     In our view, where, as construed by the First Circuit... and we sort of accept that view... the First Circuit, on page 26 of the Pet. App., construed the first sentence of D as requiring that carriers do not act as knowing accomplices in the illegal sale of tobacco products.  So construed, we don't believe that that provision is pre-emptive.  It is akin to the general prohibition on furnishing tobacco to minors in 1555-B(2), and we don't think that that provision is pre-emptive.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  For a small dealer.  But as we've already heard, the dealers who engage in the discount policy are places like Target and Wal-Mart.  Those aren't small dealers.  Those are behemoths in the retailing industry.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I thought the Ping brief that was referenced earlier made a point that it made, the prices may be... resale price... the current Dr. Miles rule may result in increased prices because of the inefficiencies for those retailers, or of those manufacturers who want to establish a regime where something other than price is important, and they have to do that unilaterally, which increases inefficiencies.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is that?  Why can't... eliminating the rule, I thought the whole point was they would just put in their contracts, you have to sell it at this price, and they could enforce the contracts, rather than having to have these machinations of making sure they don't do anything that looks like an agreement with their retailers.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why would you argue that those are more efficient than resale price maintenance?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you can add the contractual provisions you were talking about to a contract that has a minimum resale price.  The minimum resale price is to take away the incentive from the retailer not to carry through on the non-price aspects.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your reference to the will of Congress, they haven't enacted legislation that supports the result you seek.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Underwood?     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's also been settled law for 90 years under the Colgate doctrine that manufacturers can achieve the same results, albeit more inefficiently.  Doesn't it make sense to allow them to adopt the most efficient means to an end that is already completely legal?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But of course, they could always pass a law saying that if their intent is so clear.  They didn't do that here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But they could.  I mean, you could easily write the agreement saying you have to charge this much and because you have to charge this much you also have to provide the training, the service, whatever the non-price inducements are.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're arguing the facts and the inferences.  You said the Seventh Circuit got it right.  As I read their articulation of the standard on page 20A of the petition appendix, it's the normal standard that would have been applied prior to the passage of the PSLRA.  Could a reasonable person infer... Congress passes a law saying they've got to give rise to a strong inference.  Shouldn't that have changed the standard?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't understand the Seventh Amendment argument here.  Congress can surely articulate the standard that's going to be applied as a matter of substantive law.  If Congress says, you have to prove by clear and convincing evidence, that doesn't interfere with the Seventh Amendment because a jury would be instructed pursuant to that standard.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought you told me that Congress could set a high level of burden on factual issues, and that that wouldn't intrude upon the Seventh Amendment.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are you saying that Congress can not set a fact burden on the merits that is different than preponderance of the evidence.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If I'm with you so far, why would you suppose that Congress would create a different standard on the motion to dismiss than they meant to apply at the merits standard?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then what was Congress trying to do when they said strong inference?  It seems to me that if you think the standards have to be the same at pleading and at proof, and Congress says strong inference at pleading, it means you have to show a strong inference at proof, and that's why there's no Seventh Amendment problem.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But all of those cases were before the PSLRA where Congress, it seems to me, established a very different standard.  They said they have to support a strong inference.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Strong inference was not the test that was being applied in Anderson, Liberty Lobby, in any of those cases.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How does that change how we should read strong inference in the statute?  Are you saying don't worry whether it's a strong inference or not because labor unions are bringing the cases and they're not going to bring a frivolous case?  No.  Congress said there has to be a strong inference.  And what concerns me is that the very standard that the Seventh Circuit articulated said simply could a reasonable person infer.  The notion of strong inference isn't in that standard at all.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Just okay?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay, you two are even now.  [Laughter]   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's one of the things that concerns me.  I mean in many of these cases you have fairly elaborate proceedings over the preliminary injunction and the event takes place.  I would not want to get to a situation where people feel the need to artificially keep a case alive simply to ensure their entitlement to attorney's fees.  So how do you protect against that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what do you do in a situation of mootness where there's... you know, they'd be happy to pursue the claim to establish that they prevail on a permanent junction as well as a preliminary one, but the case has become moot.  Are they automatically disentitled to attorneys' fees in that case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, there may be a point to pursuing it but I'm not sure it's one that the locality governments... I mean if you ask them the question, would you rather be liable for attorney's fees where you lose in a preliminary injunction but then the case becomes moot, or would you rather have to face individual officer liability to prevent the case from becoming moot?  Or would you rather face ongoing litigation to prevent the case from becoming moot because there's too much invested in the fees... they might choose the former.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the plaintiffs decided to challenge it to the end.  But I'm suggesting that if they know they might... it might result in a loss of attorneys fees, when all they really wanted was a particular demonstration, others might pursue it differently.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  We'll hear from Ms. Millett.  Ms. Millett.     Patricia A. Millett  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.  This Court has held repeatedly that liability for attorney's fees and liability for violation of Federal law go hand in hand.  A preliminary injunction does not determine that there has been a violation of Federal law.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are you on the all or nothing team this morning?  [Laughter]  Is it... can a preliminary injunction never be the basis for an award of attorney's fees?   Patricia A. Millett  I won't say never in this narrow circumstance.  And that is when, when a preliminary injunction results in a definitive and determinative ruling of law such as Thornburgh versus Obstetricians... College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or the steel mill seizure case from this Court.  It came up on a preliminary injunction but this Court made a dispositive and controlling ruling of constitutional law.  And assuming that that declaration is then followed up by a change in behavior by the defendant compelled as result of the ruling, that would be enough.  But--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I have never understood why that's an issue.  Can't the parties... it seems to me an exception that isn't consistent with the theory.  Why can't the parties just agree on attorney's fees in the settlement agreement and the consent decree and then it wouldn't have to be an issue?   Patricia A. Millett  I think, I think that in reality certainly a party can say, I'm not entering into a consent decree if we're not going to resolve attorney's fees now or if we're going to have a fight over them.  So they certainly have that power because it's largely a contract, although one enforced by courts.  I'm only trying to be candid with this Court's precedent, which is also recognized in Mayer versus Gagne.  For some reason, maybe they reserved the question there to be disputed in court whether you'd be responsible for attorney's fees.  But I do think That's much more of a side show because that can all be dealt with through the contract elements of the consent decree.  And really what you're talking about when a court is coercively imposing attorney's fees on a defendant is that the defendant has a right to not pay those unless they have been found to be a violator of Federal law or have agreed to through contract to deal with that issue.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. Millett, did I hear your legal test a while ago is an enduring change in the defendant's behavior?  Is that your standard?   Patricia A. Millett  Enduring more in... not in the transient sense of preliminary injunction.  Obviously, things change on the outside world.  But in the form of final relief and permanent relief, and that's what this Court's cases have said time and again.  Not only must the defendant be a violator of Federal law, but in Ferrari, in Texas Teachers versus Darwin, in Hanrahan and Hewitt, the Court has made clear that it is final, a resolution of a dispute, a final judgment, the settling of a problem that makes someone a prevailing party.  And ""prevailing party"", as this Court explained in Buckhannon, is a term of art.  As we say on pages 11 to 12 of our brief,  ""That term of art, as defined in the relevant dictionaries at the time, was not just that you won something, but that you won at the end of the suit. ""  And that's a question of basic fundamental fairness to plaintiffs.  Remember, there's going to be countervailing judicial economy concerns.  If you tell governmental entities that they're going to have to take... may I finish... have to take emergency appeals from every interlocutory order and resist stays to avoid liability for attorney's fees.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Millett.  Now we'll hear from you, Mr. Galanter.     Seth M. Galanter  Your Honor, those same regulations had been in effect the four previous times she had protested nude.  And it was consistent with the stipulation they had entered into that her nudity was protected by the First Amendment.  So again, she was certainly entitled to negotiate as she tried to do with the State.  She was told one week before that she wouldn't be allowed to do this.  She went to court.  She got the very relief that she sought and she was able to protest in the nude.  Now in the other cases, you're going to get someone who just finds they were denied the right to register or to get on the ballot, and that's going to be disposed of immediately.  It won't be capable of repetition by evading review because the person is now registered, the election is now over.  Maybe that candidate won't run again.  So we have a whole core of First Amendment cases that will be affected if Petitioner's per se rule that preliminary injunction is never enough goes into play, because then States have the unfortunate incentive of pushing the decisions very close to the actual event deadline so that even if they lose in court, they won't have to pay attorney's fees.  And I would add that in terms of the broader notion, here we have a midlevel state official sending a letter to an individual saying we don't think you have any First Amendment rights, and if you come, you'll be violating a law that's subject to criminal arrest, if you come and you're naked, you're going to be subject to criminal arrest.  Absent Section 1998, it would be incredibly difficult for persons in Ms. Wyner's situation to find attorneys.  Thank you, Your Honor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Seitz, you have three minutes remaining.   ",06-531X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  They left Federal court having lost on the permanent injunction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Their legal, their legal claim was that these regulations were invalid under the First Amendment.  And they lost on that legal claim.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they succeeded in filing their complaint as well, but they don't get attorney's fees for that, because they were successful at the filing complaint stage.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you would get attorney's fees for the preliminary injunction work, even though you lost on that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  All the work you did to show irreparable harm, balance of the equities, not on the merits, you're saying that's off the table?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, your approach, just as there are problems from the judicial economy perspective with your friend's approach, but doesn't your approach require the States to fight tooth and nail on the preliminary injunction because they're running the risk if they lose there, they're going to pay fees even if they prevail later?  As opposed to, as is often the case, they might say, you know, we consent to the entry of the preliminary injunction or we don't... you know, we're going to save our energy.  Doesn't it require them to fight every possible stage, including appeal and so on?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, he doesn't have to say he's wrong.  What often happens is as it is here, he say's I've got 24 hours, I don't have a brief from the other side, I kind of make the best guess I can.  And then later on after an adversary presentation and an evidentiary hearing, he issues a different ruling.  As here, he doesn't have to say I was wrong on my 24-hour off-the-cuff guess.  It's just that I'm better informed.  Is that repudiation or not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Did the court order provide for a screen?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the State prevailed to some extent as well.  They prevailed to the extent of getting in the order that they can do what they had done, which is erect a screen.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So they're entitled to some... I mean, if... this is not a reciprocal switching thing, but I mean, it does go to the question of whether or not you are the prevailing party when your opponents have prevailed to a significant extent as well.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You can't go into court with the objective of just getting preliminary relief, can you?  I mean, you have to have an underlying claim of illegality and, that seeks permanent relief, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Knowing that--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --preliminary injunction.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  On the February 14th, but your client sought further relief.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know you were asked this question and your answer may have just slipped by me.  Why, if you had asked for a TRO, why would you not be entitled to fees on that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  I thought you prevailed in the sense that you secured relief.  That's how you articulated it up to this point.   ",06-531X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but you--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well you've glided over the great difficulty which is it doesn't say that people identified in the statute shall be liable to other persons.  It says they will be liable to, under certain circumstances, the United States, a State or an Indian tribe and they are liable for... for other costs incurred by any other person.  And it just seems that the most natural reading of that construction is that the other refers to other than the United States or a State or an Indian tribe.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, how sure are you... how sure are you that it doesn't protect them still?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, when one responsible party has paid out the cost and is seeking a cost recovery claim from another responsible party, it's not too much of a stretch to call it a contribution claim, is it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're not worried about any of that when you're dealing with an innocent party, the person you say can bring this action under 107(4)(b).  Don't all those same concerns and objections apply in that case as well?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you don't know, you don't know, that you're dealing with an innocent party until the end of the litigation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you have another example of an innocent party who can bring an action under 107(4)(b) other than a governmental subdivision?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But they're somehow affected by the hazardous release.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But they're still somehow affected by the hazardous release.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But my point is that subsequent owner, EPA is going to start looking at him as a PRP, not as an innocent party.  In other words, there is going to have to be an awful lot of litigation before he can establish that he is not a PRP and is instead an innocent, innocent party.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Hungar.  Mr. Armstrong.     Jay D. Geck  State law is certainly a possibility there and that would of course be a stronger indicator that you could give a broader reading to contribution protection under (f)(2) and that's what several courts have done.  But the scope of whether a State law meets contribution protection has been debated in the courts and it's of course not before us today.  In the end, the last and most important point is that the Government's construction not only bars cost recovery from potentially liable persons even an innocent person who reads Section 107 would not step forward.  If you touch a site and you begin operating and moving waste... and Mr. Chief Justice, your hypothetical about a do-gooder organization that might come in and do cleanups.  There is a good likelihood that they would be receiving a counterclaim that would say that they had operated the site and become a liable party.  And that could litigate for years.  So in the end, in the end of the case, the United States leaves no incentive for private cost recovery and there are 400,000 sites that do need cleanup, and Congress did contemplate there would be two cause of actions, one under 107 for cost recovery when people had incurred costs, and the other one would be for contribution when people had been sued or had settled their civil suit liability.  If there is no further questions, thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Geck.  Mr. Hungar, you have four minutes remaining.     ",06-562X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but there's nothing, there's nothing unnecessarily unfair.  It turns out that the Union Oil Company is bankrupt and in part of the settlement they agreed to turn over all the documents listing whoever it was that gave them the chemicals.  And it's a very complicated thing because we're dealing with people often in these cases that don't have assets and only limited responsible parties have the assets.  So they're trying to recover what they can from the others.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  As you read the statute, you're talking about a PRP, but any other person doesn't have to be a PRP, does it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You could set up a company that cleans up these sites, right, and go traveling around the country and clean them up and then send people a bill and cite your reading of 1074(b), right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if we rule in your favor presumably there will be a lot more, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about non-PRPs?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thanks, Mr. Armstrong.  Mr. Geck.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that how it works?  They would have to, if you bring a 107 action, the defendant has to bring his responsive action under 113?  Or is it as, I guess your friend had stated earlier, equitable principles are going to lead to an allocation of responsibility under 107?   ",06-562X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm not sure.  I have the same question as Justice Ginsburg.  It seems to me, absent some precedents which narrows this definition, that that would have been the way to charge your client.  That's not what was charged; that's not the indictment; that's not what you're arguing.  So I guess the question is more appropriate for the government.  But, if, following Justice Ginsburg's question, this covers it, and it seems to me that it does, then we're not arguing about very much.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Koch, let's say that the parties to the transaction are concerned about avoiding exposure under the money-laundering statute, and so they got together and said: All right, we are going to have this deal.  What can we use besides money?  And they say: Well, let's use guns, or let's use a gun.  And the seller of the drugs says: Okay.  I'm willing to use that.  Isn't he using the gun in furtherance of the transaction?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's being actively employed as the consideration in the sale.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not being shot, but it's still being employed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I think it would be a natural, grammatical construction to say he's willing to use the gun for the consideration.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Subsection (b) is not charged in the indictment?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  But that was not charged in the indictment?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Section 2(b)?   ",06-571X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you have... sorry.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let's say... let's say you have a duel, and each person in the duel needs to have a weapon.  One person has a gun; the other person has the sword.  Would you say the person with the sword is using the gun in the duel?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because you can't have a duel without both people having weapons.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You wouldn't say that the person--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Each person in the drug exchange brings to the table what they've got.  The one has the drugs; the other brings the gun.  That doesn't mean that the person with the drugs is using the gun.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It cuts the other way.  Congress knows how to say involved in if it wants to reach that broadly, and it didn't do it under the provision in which... pursuant to which Mr. Watson was indicted.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if Congress passes a statute saying anyone who uses a gun in a crime of violence gets an additional sentence, the person who is shot is using the gun in a crime of violence?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So is that a necessary element of the offense: That the transaction be negotiated in advance?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't think... I don't see how your hypothetical advances the argument.  I mean, I don't necessarily agree that someone who sells drugs for currency is using the currency in the transaction.  They are accepting it.  It is what they want.  That's not the same as using it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's what weakens your hypothetical.  It's not the normal use of a gun as a medium of exchange.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It held that the person who does use the gun, which is the natural, grammatical construction, uses the firearm.  That's quite a bit different than the question of whether someone who receives it as the consideration is using the firearm.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I just... I don't understand the significance of the argument you just made.  Are you saying that because some people might be let out of prison if we correctly construed the statute, we should read it your way?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what was your point referring to the people who were convicted under this statute... under this construction of the statute?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought the argument you made earlier was that this may not be of particular ongoing significance because of the amendment.   ",06-571X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you Mr. Farr.  Mr. Salmons.     David B. Salmons  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.  The FLSA's companionship services exemption applies by its terms to any employee employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for the aged or infirm.  The Act imposes no limitation based on the identity of the employer.  And the Agency's regulation of 552.109 extending the exception to employees of third parties is entitled to deference.  The Department expressly invoked its statutory rulemaking authority in adopting Section 109,--  552.109.  It utilized ed notice and comment rulemaking procedures both in 1975 and each time it considered amending the regulation.  And States and care providers have relied upon it in devising systems to provide appropriate services to the aged and the infirm.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if the Department of Labor had enacted its regulations as originally proposed, those regulations would have been invalid?   David B. Salmons  No, I don't think so, Your Honor.  If you're referring to the initial proposed rulemaking that would have exempted only some third parties, we think that would have been a permissible reading of the exemption given the fact that the Secretary is provided very broad defined limit authority.  But we certainly think there's nothing in that exemption that precludes the construction that's been adopted here.  In fact, we think it is the most consistent with that language.  The language of 552.3 upon which Respondent relies does not change that conclusion.  While if read in isolation that language could require that domestic service employees have to provide their services in the home of the employer, it should be not... it should not be given that reading for the reasons explained in the Department's 2005 advisory memorandum.  The Department's construction of its own regulations contained in that memorandum is itself entitled to deference under Our and Seminole Rock and its construction harmonizes the various provisions at issue here far better than Respondent's reading of 552.3 does.   ",06-593X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  The same time that--  552.3 was finally promulgated.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  They came out together, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How... putting aside... putting 552.109 aside, how is 552.3 a plausible interpretation of the statute?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What employment would someone who's hired by a third party be engaged in if not domestic service employment?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ought not to get as much deference from the courts.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So why are you sure there's a conflict in the first place?  You know, 552.3 says that the term domestic service employment refers to services performed in the home of the employer.  It doesn't say it only refers to that.  And then you go down and 109 says it also includes employees who are employed by a third party.  I mean, can't they be reconciled in that way.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not the way the Agency has done it.  But you don't think we should defer to them, anyway.  So...--  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, but it says it refers to something.  It doesn't say as many of these regulations and statutes do, is, you know, it is defined as.  And particularly when you're confronted with what would otherwise be a conflict, maybe refers to should be read to mean includes rather than is defined as.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well it is interesting when you look at... I mean, they're... it's a good point.  It's interesting when you look at the other definitions, the babysitting, it says this provision shall mean.  Here it just says it refers to.  Let's see, the other ones... casual basis, shall mean.  Companionship services, shall mean.  This one doesn't say shall mean.  It says it refers to this.  I'm just wondering if that's something that suggests it's not intended to be as exclusive as the other definitions.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  There it says... there it says includes.  And if you're talking about 552.101, there it says the term includes persons frequently referred to as private household workers.   ",06-593X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if I could start with one of the more compelling hypotheticals on the other side.  Let's say I'm a movie reviewer.  I write a review saying this is an awful movie.  It portrays child pornography.  Aren't I presenting information in a way that would cause others to believe that the movie contains child pornography, and wouldn't that be covered by the statute?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's a very different thing.  I read your brief the same way Justice Breyer did and particularly footnote 4 of the reply brief, which I understood to be giving ""presents"", for example in this statute, a promotional meaning in light of the other words around it, ""advertises, promotes"" and simply telling your... you know, your neighbor, I got this, what should I do about it, isn't promotional.  It may be in a technical term ""presents"", but it's not promotional.  And, again, I understood your brief to suggest that you have to interpret all of those words in an advertising, soliciting sense.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  My understanding was not that it was limited to commercial speech.  That was clear from the footnote that I cited.  But that ""presents"" was limited to promotional activity.  It's one thing to present and say either whether to law enforcement or your neighbor; it's another thing to promote the child pornography.  And I thought your brief was adopting a limited construction of words like ""presents"" that would cover only promotional activity.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  I lost... in your answer, I lost a negative or something.  Are you saying that this type of activity frequently occurs or infrequently occurs?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Clement.  Mr. Diaz.     Richard J. Diaz  Correct.  I agree.  Thank you, Your Honor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Diaz.  General Clement, you have three minutes remaining.     ",06-694X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, there's a difference, isn't there, between beliefs and thoughts about... what, the legality of a particular type of pornography or something like that, and a factual matter?  I thought this was child pornography?  Saying this regulates thoughts and beliefs, those are two quite different questions, aren't they?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's an entirely different thing to say that this car is a great car and it turns out not to be a great car, and to say what you have is either... is not... is child pornography when, in fact, it's not.  Those are two different things.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The statute has an objective component.  To the objective observer, it must reasonably cause them to believe that it's actually child pornography.  So that... that would be... that would prevent sort of the vague puffery that you're talking about from being covered while still covering something that satisfies both the subjective and objective test.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  I don't think that is responsive to Justice Kennedy's point.  You wouldn't be carving it out of the First Amendment.  You would be saying we're going to treat this area like other areas, which would say that whoever is challenging it has to show that they're a problematic case.  In other words, your client is relying... he didn't produce Lolita.  You're relying on the effect on other people, and that is what our overbreadth doctrine allows, if there's a substantial amount of speech that's protected.  And what I understood the question to suggest is that we would wait basically for as-applied challenges when Lolita is being prosecuted and we would hear from them, but not in your case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it's the boundary between what is... what should be protected in relation to what's unprotected.  So what's the ratio between legitimate films like Lolita and illegitimate child pornography?  In other words, is, in fact, the protected material substantial in relation to the law's legitimate sweep?   ",06-694X

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't that a general election case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let me ask you about that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let's suppose the State doesn't think that direct voter election of judges is a good idea, that it thinks there ought to be some insulation to avoid the problems of judges campaigning and raising money and all that; yet, at the same time they want some participation by the voters in the process.  Is there any way they can achieve that objective, to have the nominees actually chosen not by the voters but by a convention, and yet have some role by the voters?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I'm just asking is there a way to have a convention with some role by the voters or the party--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, doesn't that seem kind of odd, that if a State can have no role for voters, it can have a pure convention, that they're penalized if they have some role for voters?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Being found unconstitutional is a pretty severe penalty.  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it's all right, I take it, if they don't prevail?  For example--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --the other side says that your argument is... is implicated whenever a convention leads to a different nominee than the primary.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't think there's anything wrong with the convention deciding that the nominee is going to be someone other than the person who would prevail in the primary election.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's all right to fence them out to that extent?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I take it, in evaluating the burden, we should look at how difficult it is for someone to be elected a delegate.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, is that because Mr. Dunne was not supported by the party members at the convention--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --for whatever higher office--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --What did he have to do to become on the ballot for delegate?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  500 signatures, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If we don't think that's a sufficient burden, do you lose?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you agree it's not realistic that one way they would address it is by having an entirely appointed system?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know they are entitled to it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  As a practical matter, is that a realistic option in New York?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm sure he has.  I mean that's in his interest.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought I read a representation somewhere in the briefs that it's unrealistic to expect that New York would move to an entirely appointive system.  So that the options, if you're successful, the options will either be direct election of judges or a pure convention with no role for the voters at all.   INTERRUPTING ",06-766X

That would not be willfully violating the statute?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it doesn't have to be actual knowledge?   INTERRUPTING John G.

It hasn't come up before.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  First impression.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Ms. Millett.     Patricia A. Millett  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that willfulness in the civil context, as is used here, includes a reckless disregard component or a recklessness component.  That is what this Court has held in a number of cases that have similar uses of willfulness focused on a departure from the law, have held.  Thurston, Richland Shoe and Hazen Paper are the three that have been most discussed in the case, in the papers here.  But where the Ninth Circuit misstepped here was in the application of that standard.  And in particular, we agreed with Petitioners that when it concluded that a creative but unlikely position constitutes recklessness, it erred.  Recklessness speaks an extreme deviation from an ordinary standard of care.  It requires that the defendant act in the face of or fail to act--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  You think if I have an insurance policy, I'm paying a certain rate, they look at my credit report and they say, you know, good news, we're going to lower your rates, that's an adverse action because they might have lowered the rates even further if they had notified me about the credit report and there were some errors in it?   Patricia A. Millett  Right.  It's a complicated answer, in part because that assumes that you have an existing account and you're not an initial account here.  And when you have an existing account, there's a definition of adverse action for insurance provisions, but in iv there is a separate, there's another definition, and this is on, on page... sorry.  Excuse me.  On page 3A of the appendix to our brief, iv under big I... I'm sorry, there's a lot of provisions... talks about reviewing an existing account, and it cross-referenced another provision which talks about reviewing an account for purposes of termination.  And that would include, in our view, not only completely canceling it, but terminating the existing and charging you more for allowing you now to pay a new rate.  So which would govern in that particular context is a little bit harder.  But it could, and here's logically why, because I think the understanding of ""increase"" that's at issue here is one that's very basic to the operation of this statute, and that is, did the content of your information in your credit report, if it had been better, could you have had a better rate or a better deal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   Patricia A. Millett  So have you been hit in the pocketbook.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if they lower, if they lower the rates, you still say that that fits the meaning of adverse action because they might have lowered them further if the information hadn't been erroneous?   Patricia A. Millett  It could have, and here... in this sense, it could be: In the same way that I, sort of the flip side, but in my office, if everybody in the hallway gets a 5 percent salary increase and I only get a 1 percent salary increase, I am certainly better off, but if the reason I got a lesser increase is because of my gender or because of my credit report, it's an adverse action.  So the fact that you're doing somewhat better doesn't mean--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Shorr.     Scott A. Shorr  --And with respect to the district court, we believe the district court here clearly erred, as the Ninth Circuit found.  And the guidance... that opinion certainly didn't precede the conduct that's at issue here.  The only guidance, again, available at the time supported our reading of the statute.  There was no guidance from and court or from the FTC, or from anywhere that would have supported Defendants' interpretation at that time.  So that's another aspect of inquiry, the subjective intent of the Defendants.  If there are no other questions?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Mahoney, you have four minutes remaining.     ",06-84XX
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, even if you're right about the standard, how can you suggest that it's willful here when you have no judicial construction, you have no administrative construction, you have the statutory language that at least the questions this morning have suggested is not perfectly clear?  How can you suggest that the action of the companies on this case even under your standard was willful?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if we don't agree with you on that, you would lose on the application of the willfulness standard?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, your, your, your conclusion that this was a willful violation depends upon your assertion that the statute is perfectly clear?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're talking about the Ball letter?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That wasn't even binding on the commission, so why would that be regarded as authoritative?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But this is not an antidiscrimination provision.  It doesn't say anyone who discriminates in the setting of race has to send out letters.  It requires an adverse action.  It requires an increase in the charge.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Don't you have that right independently, though, every year to look at a copy of your credit report?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  When you say you look at the increase with respect to the best credit rate, why is that?  Why wouldn't you look at it relative to say the average insured who walks in the door?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't understand what pertinence that has to my question which is, why do you get to pick the best credit report as the baseline from which you would measure your hypothetical increase?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Who's GEICO?  I mean, you're talking about particular lawyers at a particular level, an ongoing debate about what this law means.  If you get one lawyer who says, you know, I think you could read it this way, does that mean that GEICO reads it that way?   ",06-84XX
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if that's true then this case really isn't a big deal at all.  It just depends on exactly how you word the contract when the patentee sells it to a purchaser.  You can word it... in other words, you can word it in such a way that the patentee's rights extend further downstream and you're saying all this case turns on is whether the wording here was correct or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I understand your position to... to acknowledge that they could have structured the sale to Intel in such a way as to achieve the same result that you're saying is so bad under the patent laws.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the parties are unwilling to spell out exactly how this is going to work out in their contract, and each side, it prefers to take their chances on how the Federal Circuit's going to rule.  It's easier to sell these things if they're not encumbered by these additional license requirements and the manufacturer presumably gets a lot more, but there's a lot of uncertainty, uncertainty that could have been cured by how the contract was drafted, and people prefer to live with that uncertainty and litigate rather than clear it up in the contract.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Fine, and the person who wrote that provision knows that the question of how the patent-exhaustion doctrine applies is the subject of great confusion, so much confusion that the Supreme Court's going to have to decide it, and yet they put that in there rather than spelling out in the contract exactly which they had in mind, whether or not you could impose these further restrictions or couldn't.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it wasn't clear to the Federal Circuit, I guess.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Mahoney.  Mr. Hungar?     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Although you think it can be overridden simply by providing in the contract that the same rights and remedies would be available?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  A mere license can prevent the application of the patent-exhaustion doctrine?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And it would be patent infringement by the use of the product by the people that Intel sold to?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That would sound like your friend on the other side, the Respondent, had actually won in this case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I think that's an important question.  I understood the argument at page 16 of your brief to say that the patent-exhaustion doctrine doesn't apply in that situation and that you, therefore, can't have the rights and remedies under patent law.  You told me earlier that if the person to whom Intel sells the product uses it contrary to the license stipulation, they would be liable for patent infringement.  Your answer to Justice Breyer suggests to me that you're saying only that they're liable to... for contract infringement, and that's a very big difference.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sale from whom to whom?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But what you... well, but what you say in your brief is that in the situation we're talking about the licensee stands in the shoes of the patentee.  Now, if that's right it seems to me that you're telling me that the patent remedies are available and not simply contractual remedies.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, or, more pertinently, it can only sell if the person they sell to agrees not to use the product in a certain way.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Exactly.  That's the critical point.  You're telling me that if the buyer, in other words, the kind of third person in this chain, uses the patented article in a way that is contrary to the license that was given to the second person in the chain, then he is liable for contributory infringement under the patent laws and not, as I understood you to answer to Justice Breyer, only under contract law.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you sue under patent law or just contract law?   ",06-937X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but there's nothing to do with these chipsets other than use them in the computers.  I mean, you don't put them on your shelf.  They're not good for anything other than using in the computer.  So saying there's a separate patent for how you use them with the other systems doesn't seem to be very significant.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Phillips.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Phillips?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What in the world does clause 3.8 of the license mean?  It says,  ""notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its licensed products. ""  In other words, the patent exhaustion doctrine may not apply for all the reasons that we've been talking about, but it applies in the way it would apply if we just sold these licensed products.  That seems to me to give away everything you're talking about.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's what the notice says.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --That argument didn't prevail last year in the KSR case, right?  I mean, we're... we've had experience with the Patent Office where it tends to grant patents a lot more liberally than we would enforce under the patent law.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Phillips--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --And the way you achieve that result is to condition the sale.  What you're trying to do is expand what you get under a condition to what you get under a notice.  And the reason that troubles me is because if you had imposed a condition on the sale, Intel wouldn't have paid you as much for it.  But you say, all right, we'll take the money because... additional money because there's no condition, but we want to achieve the same result because of the notice.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they're happy with that because the notice says you can't... you can only use this with Intel products.  So they're happy with that solution as well.   ",06-937X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --That's not the State's fault.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they can do business with other entities beside the State.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  You've got a friend on the other side still.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Hungar.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about the spending clause question?  You... the Federal Government has a lot of programs where they use their own money and they come with a lot of conditions, and you... your office frequently argues that those are justified under the spending clause.  Why isn't what California is doing here similarly justified?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do we tell whether they are using their spending power to regulate as opposed to simply attaching conditions to what's done with State funds?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  On a case like Rust versus Sullivan, is the Federal Government acting to promote policy, or is it simply acting in a proprietary capacity?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm talking about spending power versus regulatory power in general.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, give me an example of a spending clause provision that would be acceptable, not necessarily in this context, but in general, because you would say, well, that's not trying to implement a policy at all.   INTERRUPTING ",06-939X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, so was anyone who hired a company to do any kind of work, right?  Because the Federal policy meant that they couldn't try to restrict what activities the company engaged in with respect to union organizing.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, that's not quite accurate.  They moved for summary judgment on the ground that what the State was doing was in effect regulating labor relations--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --and that that activity was pre-empted.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but the policy... the policy is they don't want employers to talk about unionization.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is that... how is that different from saying there's a Federal rule, an OSHA requirement you've got to have certain protective devices or whatever, and the State says, well, we want to get the most out of our money, so our money cannot be used to put in these federally required safety devices; you can use somebody else's money for that.  Why isn't that the same thing here?  You're saying there's a Federal labor policy that allows this, and we don't want our money to be spent implementing that policy or pursuant to that policy.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --You're saying it doesn't give favoritism to one side or another?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that depends, as a practical matter, on the view that there are at least some employers who would be arguing in favor of unionization?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but my point is that there are precious few who argue in favor of it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if there is a warranty for another year, say if these tables break you have to replace them?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I want to get back to your responses on the procedural costs of the case.  You said we don't know what the regulatory burden would be with respect to accounting rules.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does it make any difference if the argument is which is what I understood it to be, that you can't regulate at all?  It's not simply that you can't regulate so long as it's particularly burdensome, but you don't have the authority to regulate in this at all.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That gets to the--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --That gets to the spending clause question.  We're not... I mean, we can address that without deciding whether the regulations are particularly burdensome.  You were saying well, the accounting thing is not a big problem.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it doesn't mean that it's necessarily spending as opposed to regulation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That doesn't seem to me to be responsive to my question.  Your point was well, we don't know how burdensome a particular regulation is.  If you lose on the question of whether it's spending or regulation, we don't have to wait to see how burdensome it is if we think you're not entitled to regulate at all.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're getting back to the spending question.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm putting that aside.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Regardless of whether... regardless of whether it's burdensome regulation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If it's regulation why isn't that appropriate to deal with on summary judgment.  Not the spending question we have... that's a different issue.  But if there is no difference with respect to regulation whether it's burdensome or not, so we don't have to have further proceedings on whether it's burdensome.   ",06-939X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Who would enforce those constraints?  The thing that concerns me about your position is that it seems to leave no role for this Court in interpreting treaties as a matter of Federal law.  Suppose, for example, that the International Court of Justice determined in this case its judgment was the same, but they added: As a matter of deterrence, we think the officers who failed to give consular warning should each be sentenced to 5 years in jail.  That's the ICJ determination.  Would this Court have a role in reviewing that judgment?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even if we determine--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Even if we determine, even if we determine that that judgment is based on a legal error?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if the ICJ determined that the officers should each go to jail for 5 years, we would have no basis for reviewing that judgment?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  I'm still looking for an answer to the hypothetical.  What would be the basis for this Court's reviewing the ICJ's determination that officers should go to jail for 5 years?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The Court doesn't have executive power.  It has judicial power.  It's already exercised that judicial power in Sanchez-Llamas in determing the meaning of this treaty.  And I understood your position to be that we have no authority to construe the treaty in this case because a judgment was issued by the International Court of Justice.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Just to get back, you're conceding, I take it, whether the ICJ has done something like this before or not... and we can debate whether what they've done in this case is precisely that... there is a role for this Court in determining whether or not a judgment of the ICJ should be enforced.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Just enforcing the obligation to comply or, as we have in this case, determining the legal basis for the ICJ determination?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is the answer to--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Is the answer to either my or Justice Stevens's hypothetical then, yes, we do have to enforce an ICJ judgment of that sort?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, why don't... why don't you take 5 extra minutes?  And we'll give you your rebuttal time.  If the Avena judgment is binding as Federal law, is it your position, though, that the... this Court has no authority to review the content of that Federal law... the judgment?  Our choice is simply enforce it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So we have no--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --We have no authority to review the judgment itself, even though the judgment will have the effect as Federal law of preempting the State law in this instance?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Excuse me, but your position is not that we are applying the obligation to comply, because we interpreted that in Sanchez-Llamas and came to the exact opposite conclusion as the ICG here.  What you're saying is it's different here because the operative law is the judgment.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if he determines that the judgment should not be enforced and this Court determines, based on our construction of the treaty and the judgment that it should be enforced, which determination controls?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if we have the authority to determine whether the treaty should be complied with in the face of a presidential determination, why don't we have the independent authority to determine whether or not it should be complied with at a matter of Federal law without regard to the President's determination?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Donovan.  We'll give you 5 minutes for your rebuttal.  General Clement.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if the President had said, we're going to comply with this judgment, but in a different way than the ICJ determined.  We're going to comply by examining in each case whether there's already been a determination of prejudice, and if there has then there's no further review, but if there hasn't then there'll be further review.  Would that be binding as a matter of Federal law?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's the same as a memorandum just like... it's a memorandum just like the one we have here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It says that if there has already been... the State courts are to determine if there's already been a determination of prejudice in the case, and if there has there's to be no further review.  But if they determine there hasn't, there is to be further review.  That's different than the ICJ's judgment, which suggests there should be a new determination in every case.  Is that... does that have the same status as the memorandum here?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But he can... he can take action that's inconsistent with the determination of Federal law by this Court?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought we determined in Sanchez-Llamas that the treaty did not mean what the ICJ said it means in this case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you doubt that the judgment here is based on a determination of the Vienna Convention that's exactly the opposite of what we determined last year?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In none of those cases were we talking about a determination contrary to a legal determination by this Court concerning the scope of powers under the treaty.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.  Mr. Cruz, by my count we'll give you an extra 10 minutes.     R. Ted Cruz  Correct.  And that's part of a diplomatic treaty, where it's between nations is... is that it is not binding in the sense that the domestic courts will enforce it.  Indeed, if the ICJ had asserted the power it claimed to annul U.S. convictions, under the U.S.'s theory the President presumably could have issued an order effectively pardoning State prisoners despite the fact that the Constitution limits its pardon authority to Federal crimes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Cruz.  Mr. Donovan, you have five minutes.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  I read the Comegys case, however you say it, to be for the exact opposite proposition.  There they were saying, this is an international arbitration, there's no reason to go behind it.  But the question of whether or not that arbitration is binding in the bankruptcy proceeding that was at issue there was very much one for the U.S. Supreme Court to make.   INTERRUPTING ",06-984X

Roberts, Jr.  Well, the fact that they're on... on death row isn't at all significant because the judgment of the ICJ purports to vacate the convictions as well; isn't that correct?

I assume you have a normally enforceable contract that the district court can enforce just like it enforces any other contract.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you should lose.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you should lose.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  We should conclude that you don't fall within the Federal Arbitration Act and it's not a big deal because you can bring... you can have the contract enforced.  The district court as far as I can tell wants to enforce this agreement, presumably will enforce it as a contract.  So you don't need the Federal Arbitration Act, so why should we fly in the face of its plain language to accommodate your interests?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there a basis... well, the Federal Arbitration Act doesn't provide jurisdiction anyway.  So I assume you have a basis for being in Federal court--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --in the first place.  So you're just enforcing a contract in diversity in Federal court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, you're asking us to bring it under the Federal Arbitration Act and say that the district court must confirm it despite the fact that you've changed the standards under Section 9 to 11.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But my point--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --My point is that if you have an ordinary contract action the district court will, because your contract provides a particular standard of review, enforce that.  Right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But they have in fact.  On page 43 of their brief, they say that if you prevail the parties would be left to a State law contract action to determine the enforceability of the award.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  I--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --No.  Their citation is to an arbitration treatise.  The contract they're referring to is the contract to arbitrate.  And, unless I'm mistaken, what you want is for the district court to be able to enforce your agreement under the Federal Arbitration Act.  Right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it doesn't fall squarely within it because the Federal Arbitration Act sets different standards of review.  And all I'm saying is I don't see what the big deal is because you... okay, don't use the Federal Arbitration Act, which gives you kind of an express remedy the district court must confirm.  Use normal contract law and say to the district court: Well, you don't have the Federal Arbitration Act, you don't have to confirm it as a judgment, but we have a contract, it's perfectly valid, it sets a different standard of review, you should enforce it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The arbitration provision, the arbitration agreement is just a contract.  Right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then I don't understand why it's not enforceable as a contract.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if it's enforceable... I'm obviously missing something here.  If it's enforceable as a contract, what is the great benefit you get out of prevailing and saying this should be enforced under the Federal Arbitration Act?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you do if you have a contract, an arbitration agreement that's not covered by Section 2, it's not concerning a maritime transaction or involving commerce?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why in the... why is that the case?  I mean, this doesn't purport to occupy the field of arbitration and to preempt State law.  It provides that a very direct order... the district court must confirm the arbitration award as a judgment--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --if you fall within the criteria.  And all I'm saying is they'll say, okay, I don't have to confirm it as a judgment.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no.  You're in Section 2, I agree--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I agree that you're in Section 2, and the State court can't invalidate your agreement under some special rule that applies only to arbitration.  But you want to be under Section 9, and that says--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --that the district court must confirm the arbitration award if it meets certain standards.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  --Reading the Riot Act to the lawyer is protection against the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI after they're hauled in for discovery or subjected to depositions and the judge finds out--   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Reinert.     Alexander A. Reinert  The Petitioners were allowed to rely on the 9/11 context in making their argument about qualified immunity, about the objective reasonableness of their conduct, and about whether the law was clearly established.

It's saying, make the conditions of confinement such that they will not be able to communicate with alleged -- alleged -- other prisoners that -- that might be part of the same group connected with the activities on 9/11.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you agree that -- to follow up on Justice Breyer's questioning of General Garre, do you believe that the same pleading standards apply in the action against the president of Coca-Cola as apply to the actions of the Attorney General and Director of the FBI on the evening of September 11, 2001?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry?  Certainly or certainly not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the pleading standard -- let's leave the president of Coca-Cola out of it.  The local manager of the Coca-Cola distribution center, you can state that the same rigor required in the complaint that applies to him also applies to the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI in the wake of 9/11?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But your -- your response then focuses solely on the merits of the underlying claim, not any requirement of -- of heightened pleading.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well I thought -- and others may know better in connection to Bell Atlantic, but I thought in Bell Atlantic what we said is that there's a standard, but it's an affected by the context in which the allegations are made.  That was a context of a particular type of antitrust violation and that affected how we would look at the complaint.  And here, I think you at least accept, don't you -- or I understood from your answers to the question on Coca Cola that maybe you don't -- that because we're looking at litigation involving the Attorney General and the Director of FBI in connection with their national security responsibilities, that there ought to be greater rigor applied to our examination of the complaint.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you -- do you disagree with the notion that Bell Atlantic at least established that the level of pleading required depends on the context of the claim -- the context of the particular case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's also not the--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Absurd and bizarre is also not the pleading standard, and how are we -- to follow up on Justice Souter's question -- how are we supposed to judge whether we think it's more unlikely that the president of Coca-Cola would take certain actions as opposed to the Attorney General of the United States?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I was just going to say the -- the difficulty with wrestling with the case through the perspective of the hypothetical of the mice in the bottles is that it's -- it's by its nature particularly absurd, but what if the allegation is that the president of Coca Cola is individually involved in a particular price-fixing scheme?  Then does this case seem so terribly different from the level of specificity Bell Atlantic would require?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's easy.  I hope that the Attorney General and the Director of FBI -- of the FBI knew of and approved whatever the policy was.  What you have to show is some facts, or at least what you have to allege are some facts, showing that they knew of a policy that was discriminatory--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --based on ethnicity and country of origin.   ",07-1015
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could you articulate precisely what your test is, because you have been going back and forth between whether the raw materials are fungible and whether there is a fundamental transformation in the product?  So, how would you merge those two in an articulable test so that business people can know when they are going to be subject to this regime and when they were not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You would say your ultimate touchstone is whether there is substantial transformation, and whether it's a raw material or discretion, those go into that determination?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sure you're prepared for a wide variety of hypotheticals.  What about a diamond?  You have a chunk of rock that contains a diamond.  You send it to Antwerp and they carve it away into something that, I guess you could say it's been substantially transformed.  It's not just a rock.  It's now a glittering diamond.  Is that covered by--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Neither am I, and it's kind of -- it's sort of a bit of a concern.  It's a fluctuating test that is hard to determine how it's going to be applied in a wide variety of cases.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Stewart.  Mr. Farr.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  If we are to defer to the agency's interpretation, what -- how would you phrase its interpretation, apart from ""this is a sale""?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it doesn't matter whether there is a substantial transformation or not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that -- so that is the critical factor, whether it's made from their material, regardless of whether there is a transformation?  If the domestic entity provides wood, wooden two-by-fours, and the foreign entity coats it in a certain way, but they can use any two-by-fours, they are indistinguishable, you would say in that case there's still -- that's still subject to Commerce's position?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's got to be both?   ",07-1059
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you do about the substance versus formality question?  I mean, if you do have fungible raw materials, why should it make a difference whether the domestic company supplies those to the foreign company or simply says -- gives them money and says, buy them yourselves?  And in the latter case, you would say that's a sale, and in the former case you would say it's not a sale?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't -- you don't retain ownership of that.  And if you go to the bank and say: Show me my money, they are not going to say: Well, here's your money.  They -- they have title to it.  They own it, and you have a claim against the bank to what you gave them.   ",07-1059
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I take it your argument would be no different if this involved some other area.  It doesn't depend upon the deference under the foreign affairs--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --That is before the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: EWSAA section 1503 authorized the President to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq any provision of law that applies to countries that have sponsored terrorism.  The terrorism exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act falls squarely within the plain language of that authority.  But if there were any question about that, certainly the President's exercise of his authority under that statute would be entitled to deference.  Even if one were to add the atextual additional limitation that the Acree court majority tried to, that it only encompassed statutes that would stand as an obstacle to the funding of the Iraqi regime in the aftermath of removing the Hussein government, still the President's memorandum to Congress makes clear his determination that the threat of billions of dollars of judgments against Iraq and the seizure or freezing of their assets by attachment constituted an immediate threat to the foreign policy interests of the United States and our critical foreign policy goals in Iraq.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you don't doubt, in absence of the waiver, that this is a claim that could proceed under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act?     --No.  No, I don't.  And -- and Congress has established as a means to deter further acts of terrorism by states that have been so designated--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that claim could--     --the abrogation of immunity.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Putting aside the waiver, that claim could proceed despite the fact that there has been a change in the governing authority in Iraq?     That's right.  The -- the general rule that Congress established in 1605(a)(7) was that the jurisdiction of the courts would continue for any claim that arose from acts committed while the state was designated.  But the authority that the President was given in 1503 was to render those statutes immediately inapplicable to Iraq.  And, of course, it would not be inapplicable to Iraq to hold that today a court would have jurisdiction over Iraq and authority to enter a judgment against Iraq pursuant to 1605(a)(7).  It would be application of that statute.  So the only way that one can give full effect to the plain language of the statute, 1605(a)(7) became inapplicable, unavailable, as the basis of exercising jurisdiction over Iraq.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Goldstein.     Thomas C. Goldstein  --I have no -- I'm not aware of any provision of the 2008 NDAA that would have given the President any such power.  They say that on the day the President exercised his -- his powers that the Foreign Assistance Act, section 620A, became inapplicable to Iraq, that sanction, and that that inapplicability survived the sunset of the statute in 2005.  How it would come back -- how it would come back and continue to apply in Iraq in the case of a regime change in Iraq, I have no idea at all.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

I mean, he -- he has the authority here, and he -- although it may look difficult, he has to envision there may be people who challenge that -- his interpretation of the law.  So there's the other provision that will make it inapplicable under that as well.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If I could just pause--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --for a moment.  The -- the President in exercising this waiver purported to act not only under the statute but under the Constitution as well.  So if we were to accept your argument, we would have to decide whether or not he had the power under the Constitution.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's not presented because your friends on the other side think the -- on a narrower ground, that the statute applies.  But if we agree with you and disagree with that, it seems to me that he has an argument -- the President has the argument that he has this authority under the Constitution.   INTERRUPTING ",07-1090

Roberts, Jr.  Do you agree that there's a point in an interaction that begins with a traffic stop, begins with a seizure, at which the nature of that interaction is changed so that it's no longer -- so that it becomes a consensual interaction and--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Maybe I should rephrase the question.  Do you agree that it would be unconstitutional for an officer to conduct a pat down after an initial seizure while that same interaction still continues?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Heytens.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you agree that there is a point at which the encounter initiated by the traffic stop changes in some way that a pat down is no longer justified?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if the encounter is -- by ""the encounter is over"", do you mean that they separate; they're no longer together?  My question is whether or not it's a continuing encounter but transforms somehow in its quality so that the pat down is no longer justified.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose there's an argument, anyway, that even though the initial seizure is over, the consensual encounter continues.  And at some point the officer, as a result of whatever happens during that consensual exchange, becomes concerned for her safety.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if -- we've been talking about the officer approaching somebody on the street who has the bulge in his pocket.  What if the person with the bulge in his pocket approaches the officer?  Can the officer at that point, even if he has no suspicion that crime is afoot, conduct a pat down?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  This is -- this is like the rule in the Old West that the sheriff has to wait for the defendant to draw first?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So in response to my--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --One moment.  In response to my hypothetical, even though the officer reasonably thinks he is in a situation where he could be shot, he can't do anything about it, not even a simple pat down, even though he did not initiate the contact, somebody comes up to him?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, let's just say it's like this case: The guy coming up -- he's wearing the colors of the -- of the Crips gang, and he has a bulge in his pocket.  It's not a crime to wear that type of clothing.  It may not be a crime to have a bulge in your pocket, but he nonetheless has a reasonable suspicion that he's being -- he's in a threatening situation, even though he has no basis for thinking that a crime is being committed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're giving up a shield here, I take it?  Instead of -- if instead of a pat down, the officer said, where were you last night at 10 o'clock, without Miranda warnings, you would say, well, that's just -- that's just fine?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if you look at the first part of that, what somebody in Mr. Johnson's position would believe, how does he tell?  I mean, even if the other officer goes to the window and starts asking the driver,  ""Can I see your insurance papers. ""  there's no representation that's why we stopped you, that's all we're interested in.  They may have stopped him because they have reason to believe that that car was involved in criminal activity.  They don't have to disclose immediately what's involved.  So how can the passenger know why the officer is stopping the person in the first place?  Let's hypothesize that he has been involved in criminal activity.  He may think, well, they've caught me and they're just going through this charade to try to get information about it and make the people feel comfortable, whatever.  I mean, just because he says, you don't have insurance papers, that's -- I don't think it's reasonable for the passenger to say, oh, this is not about me.  I can get up and leave.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what else?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  He is supposed to assume that it's not about him because of her tone?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your hypothesis about why she -- why he was free to leave is because of the tone of the arresting officer?  The tone of the--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --And there's no finding about the tone of the officer, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why isn't the -- why isn't the ""seizure"" and the ""consensual"" aspect also mutually reinforcing but kind of blurring into each other?  It seems to me it's an awfully difficult decision for the officer to make: Well, I stopped this person.  I know under Brendlin that he is seized, and I'm engaged in a dialogue, and I have to worry that at some point he thinks he's free to leave.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you seem -- your argument assumes a fairly bright line between the point at which the individual is seized and the point at which the interaction becomes a consensual search.  And I'm just saying that in the run mine of cases, that line is going to be very blurry.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  The converse situation is that so long as the interaction continues, it is a seizure, and the officer can take reasonable steps, the pat down, to protect her safety.  That doesn't have a line-drawing issue.  Your position does.   ",07-1122
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, there's -- there's a little bit of an air of unreality about all this, because, of course, Congress didn't provide a cause of action in title IX to start with.  And the reason they don't have all these limitations and restrictions is because they didn't put in the cause of action.  We implied it from the statute, and so it seems kind of awkward to say, well, there are no limitations, as I said, when there was no cause of action.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Did we rely on that provision in implying the right of action under title IX?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We will give you an extra 10 seconds.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, of course, title IX is Spending Clause legislation, and that, under our precedents, imposes certain limitations on how we interpret it that would not be applicable under section 1983.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the point is that that would then allow 1983 actions to circumvent those limitations on the title IX remedy.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I take it they don't have to bring these actions together.  They can sue under title IX; if they lose, then they can start a whole new lawsuit under 1983?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even if you have different -- I guess you would have a different set of defendants, right?  You would have the school in the title IX case, the individuals in the 1983 action?   John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You are not arguing that the agency regulations have the effect of precluding a 1983 action?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- I'm sorry to interrupt.  So you seem to be saying that they're right, that 1983 actions are not always precluded, depending upon whether there's a difference in the issues that are presented or whatever.  So you should never say that title IX precludes an action under 1983.  In fact, you should say that sometimes the issues that are litigated under title IX may result in the fact that you don't have available -- you don't get relief under 1983, but there is still a cause of action.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's kind of odd to say that -- as I understand what you are saying, you are saying whenever there is issue preclusion, a consequence is that 1983 is precluded in the sense that actions were precluded in Smith.  Well, why don't -- I guess I'm -- maybe I am repeating the question.  Why do we have to decide that?  And we would just say there is a 1983 action, but you may not be able to pursue it, I guess is the way to put it, if your claims are precluded or the issues result in the fact that you don't recover.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's -- that's because we're still in the business of implying rights of action under Bivens.  It's different to say -- you know, if you say we are implying it, but as soon as Congress does something, we are not going to do that.  That's quite different than construing a provision, like 1983, that Congress has enacted.   ",07-1125

I mean, I think it's like you have two teams and you don't tell one of the teams when the game starts, and then you say, well, it doesn't matter because they would have lost anyway, there's no prejudice.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, usually, when you have an appellate court -- you know, it's a hard question, they're easily divided, the case is resolved on the basis of the standard of review.  What is the presumption, if it's a close case?  And why isn't that all sort of what we are talking about here?  It's a close case, and the judge -- the panel says, well, this side has the burden of persuasion, so we're going to come out the other way.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what if what they would have done differently is get a different medical test, or done something like that, or had the doctor in the prior testing who prepared the diagnosis look at something that they didn't have them look at before?  In other words, it's not simply the absence of documents that they know they can submit or could have submitted.  It's that type of question.  And nobody knows.  I mean, you don't know what would have happened if they had the doctor look at this issue that now turns out to be critical, but if they had gotten the right notice they might have had time to do that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You know, it's easy -- it's easy to look back and view this in sort of abstract legal terms, but we are dealing with lay people who are trying to get something from the government, which is always a difficult thing.  And they get one notice saying you have got to show that this was during the service.  Then they get another notice or decision saying it wasn't severe enough.  Why is it so difficult, when the government made a mistake in dealing with this layperson who is just trying to get benefits to which they are entitled, to say that the government has to show that it didn't make any difference, rather than requiring the -- the layperson to do that?

Roberts, Jr.  What's wrong with Mr. Miller's response that, at the very first level of review, you can start all over; at that point you know precisely why your claim was denied?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that was my question.  Is it -- is it -- I take it it's more than just a stamp saying ""denied"", right?  There's some explanation in every case?   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, you would phrase the prejudice in terms of what you would have done but you weren't able to do and what you can now go back and do if it's remanded.  You don't have to have the evidence that three people would say he was complaining about the vision loss at the time.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose one reason -- one reason to think it may not have been decided is that, unlike the other situations you have discussed, it would not have been a bar to our consideration of this case the last time because, just as you raised the question in your second question presented that whether the award complies with due process, we may have thought there might have been an adequate and independent State ground on a procedural question, but we were going to go ahead.  We granted cert on the substantive question of whether the damages award was unconstitutional.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Shapiro.  Mr. Peck.     Robert S.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you don't dispute that it's a Federal question whether that procedure is adequate and independent?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I -- yes, that's exactly right.  And I think the purpose for the rule is to avoid confusion about the ground of decision for the trial court.  If you have got two errors, and she says the instruction's no good, on appellate review you don't know which basis was at issue.  There's no doubt here the basis on which the trial court was ruling, is there?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  To move -- to move from the trial court to the appellate court, if you are correct that there's this routine, clear rule of State procedure, why would the appellate court say, in its head, well, I could rely on that, but I want to decide this complicated, difficult rule of Federal constitutional law instead?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think we just made a mistake in going ahead and reaching the Federal procedural rule that we reached because it was barred by this adequate and independent State ground that the Oregon courts had relied upon?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then I think your--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I think your answer -- go ahead with your ""but"".  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm sorry.  I still don't see that answer.  You are saying they said, yes, there was this rule of Oregon law, but you can still reach -- there might still be a Federal due process issue, so we can't just rely on that.  And if that's true, then that seems to me to be a concession that this is not an adequate and independent State ground that would bar consideration of a Federal constitutional issue.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess I think it's the more routine practice for a court, if you have a -- again, as you argue -- a clear procedural rule that bars addressing the substantive issue, to go ahead and rely on that.  Now, if the procedural rule is difficult and of uncertain application, maybe you go ahead and say, well, we we're going to decide the merits anyway.  But it seems to me, under your presentation, it's the other way around.  It's a clear and easy procedural rule, difficult Federal and State intertwined constitutional rule, and yet the court says, well, I'm going to do the hard work rather than the easy work.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  There is, of course, another way to protect our constitutional authority in this case.  We are talking about procedures for addressing the substantive due process challenge to a punitive damages award.  That's the second question presented here.  If we went and granted that question and considered that issue, we would have protected our authority to reach that question despite the procedural objections alone.  Why don't we just do that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not asking you to argue here today the second question presented.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if we have some concern, that there's something malodorous about the fact that the Oregon Supreme Court waited until the last minute to come up with this rule that was before it all the time, which was a State court rule that you would expect the State court to be addressing as a matter of course, then -- then we -- we can avoid having to address what we do in a situation, having to characterize the nature of that -- that consideration, simply by saying: Look, we are going to go ahead.  The question is presented.  We can decide it in this case, and to avoid having to reach that, we will go ahead and do it.   ",07-1216
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, weren't the facts merely cumulative evidence of his claim that was before the State court?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I think that supports my suggestion, which is that the evidence was cumulative.  There was a dispute on that issue.  There was evidence on both sides.  And now you say, hey, we've got more evidence.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Bress, your -- you're argument that this can't be brought up assumes that it is a new claim rather than the same claim, right?  Because if it were just the same claim then the question would be it is simply cumulative rather than new?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  And I guess it gets back to Justice Ginsburg's question.  We usually don't consider claims different if there is just new evidence, but here didn't the Fourth Circuit necessarily determine that this was the same claim in deciding to defer to the State court findings?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And if fact you got more than you were entitled to, because it did look at the new evidence, albeit through the guise of deference, but it shouldn't have even looked at that at all.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if we think that they were right -- and we are, I think we are getting away from the question presented -- if we agree that they are right, that this is the same claim and it's just additional evidence, then you lose.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know, but they're -- your underlying theory is that if you get a lot of new evidence, that somehow changes the claim.  And again, I think Justice Ginsburg -- I'm having trouble getting my arms around that, and particularly since it's problematic in this area where there is always new evidence.  You're looking at someone's childhood.  You can always find a new anecdote, a new concern going either way, that you know, this was unusual because he was a good child, or this is excused because he had such a bad upbringing.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  All right, well just -- we've got two but just to stop you on one.  The fact that they excuse your failure to raise and present the evidence in State court doesn't mean that when you get the evidence you have a new claim.  It just means that they are going to let you raise a claim you could have raised before.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I've gotten over it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Bress.  Ms. Burnett.     Katherine Burnett  Yes, Your Honor.  And as a collateral review; that's where they are closing the gate, not on direct review.  If there are no further questions, I simply ask to affirm.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You have three minutes remaining.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, it's a new claim if it is one on which you would have prevailed, but it's the same claim if the result would be the same.   ",07-1223

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's the temporary stay pending certiorari, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think what Justice Ginsburg was talking about -- and she can correct me if I am wrong -- were the modifications from the initial preliminary injunction and the modified preliminary injunction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let me follow that.  You concede that you have to prepare an EIS in light of the CEQ's emergency circumstances?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why didn't you -- I mean, you emphasize the level of detail and comprehensiveness of the environmental assessment that the Navy prepared.  Why didn't you just make -- why didn't you just go ahead and do an EIS from the outset if you were going to engage in such effort with respect to the environmental assessment?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But why -- I don't know if this is Justice Souter's question, but why CEQ?  I mean, NEPA doesn't really give anybody any regulatory authority -- EPA, CEQ.  And it seems to me that CEQ is an odd entity to be doing this.  They're more or less an office in the White House, rather than a free-standing agency.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  An environmental assessment.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Kendall.     Richard B. Kendall  That's very kind.  I think there's just one other point perhaps I should make, which is there was some discussion of whether NEPA actually authorizes CEQ to conduct this kind of examination of a district court's ruling.  I submit that there is nothing anywhere in NEPA and certainly not in the ""fullest extent possible"" language which gives that authority.  This Court has already decided that point in the Flint Ridge case, where it said that NEPA does not give way unless there is an irreconcilable conflict between NEPA and another statute.  They have pointed to no such thing.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Garre, have you one minute remaining.     ",07-1239
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, with one important qualification.  The question was the balance of those equities on a preliminary basis.  In other words, before we reach a final decision, we're going to prevent the Navy from engaging in the sonar exercises that they think are necessary.  Not even after we have decided they were wrong, just because we think there is a likelihood that they might be wrong.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I thought that would have been the whole ball game until I read your brief.  Your brief does not spend a page defending the decision on the merits of the lower courts.  Nothing about emergency circumstances or CEQ.  Instead, you raise other arguments on which the district court did not rely in finding likelihood of success.  So given that, I would have thought we would have a lot more to talk about when it gets to the permanent injunction on the merits.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, yes, yes.  You certainly raised those issues.  I'm not saying that.  What I am saying the district court didn't rely on those in finding likelihood of success.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's what the district court relied on.  Where in your brief do I see a defense of the district court's analysis, as opposed to the very coherent argument about Hayburn's case and everything else, issues the district court didn't reach?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It would have increased exponentially the area that the Navy had to scrutinize to determine if there were marine mammals there.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the increase -- you keep saying it's just 1,000 yards.  But it's 1,000 yards of circle.  And if I remember high school geometry right, that's a squared increase.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And there are people in airplanes?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not just straight ahead.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess my question was, that increases the area exponentially that has to be scrutinized.  And I don't see why, as you said, that was wrong.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's very unfair.  There were six conditions imposed by the district court.  The Navy didn't even appeal four of them.  They gave up on four out of the six issues.  That's not insisting on having it their way.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The other ways it struck me how the district court relied on the fact that the Navy had taken actions to protect marine mammals in the past to say well, there can't be any problem with adding more protection.  No good deed goes unpunished.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They had already taken actions unilaterally to protect marine mammals.  Now you say that wasn't enough.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But they were taking some actions.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I -- can I derail you a little bit to get back to the balance of equities question?  As I read the opinions most of the balancing here was done by the Ninth Circuit, not the district court.  I found the district court's balancing in only one sentence.  The court after all of its prior -- the court is also satisfied that the balance of hardships tips in favor -- favor of granting an injunction.  ""It goes on. ""  ""But it's just one sentence. ""  ""The Ninth Circuit talked about deferring to the district court but in fact it supplied all of the analysis for the balance. ""   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Suppose it's still fair to say that on all of those it focused most of its attention on likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm rather than a balancing of the equities.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think that's -- I think that's quite right.  My question, though, is that at no point that did the district judge undertake a balancing of the equities, putting on the one side the potential for harm to marine mammals that she found -- and that's your point about the record -- and putting on the other side the potential that a North Korean diesel electric submarine will get within range of Pearl Harbor undetected.  Now, I think that's a pretty clear balance.  And the district court never entered -- never went into that analysis.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even the district -- even the district court recognized, in the words of her opinion, that it would propose ""a substantial challenge"" -- that's a quote -- for the Navy to shift the regime that she imposed in the injunction.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So then you'd have an easy time before the jury.  And the same thing with respect to the individual.  All that's saying is that when you're dealing with one person, it's pretty easy to prove that he, you know, directs himself or, you know, has an ongoing plan, but that doesn't mean that it's not a separate element that the jury should have to find.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you say that it's not distinct from the underlying offenses.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But they don't have to be separately instructed that they have to find that, do they?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is the instruction that the Seventh Circuit and the Eighth Circuit give that you don't think is necessary?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought an individual could -- I thought an individual could be the enterprise?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  He's an independent contractor rather than an employee.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought your friend said the period that the jury found was just a couple of months.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not at all.  That would make a lot of sense, because RICO is not intended just to bring in the crimes.  They're looking for something else.  They're looking for an organization that is involved in these types of things.   INTERRUPTING ",07-1309
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Would that -- would that principle have to be clearly established by one of our decisions?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, isn't that -- the fundamental question is what level of generality you look to determine what law has been clearly established?  Certainly Strickland is clearly established.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But as far as I can tell, the ""nothing to lose"" issue has not been addressed by us and is not clearly established.  So why do we look at it at the latter level of generality as opposed to the former?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you -- you think -- I guess it's not open to us to issue a decision on the ""nothing to lose"" question, or we don't have to.  The only -- the way we have to decide the case is to determine whether the Ninth Circuit's determination on the ""nothing to lose"" question was clearly established by one of our cases.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is it--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I -- I don't understand why you keep talking about Strickland.  We sent this case back to the Ninth Circuit for further consideration in light of Carey v. Musladin.  In that case we said that the grant of relief was unreasonable because of the lack of holdings from this Court regarding the potentially prejudicial effect of spectators' courtroom conduct of the kind involved here, which seems to me a much narrower focus on the level of generality than Strickland.  I would have thought you would have said -- maybe you are saying -- that because we don't have a precedent from this Court rejecting the ""nothing to lose"" case, that that should be the end of it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Sevilla.     Charles M. Sevilla  Thank you very much.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Mercer, you have 4 minutes remaining.     ",07-1315
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you reject it as well, I take it--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --and concede it is an improper -- it is not a basis for ineffective assistance that somebody did not pursue a ""nothing to lose"" case argument?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I'm sorry.  I don't -- I didn't follow that answer.  You're saying if he does have nothing to lose, it is objectively unreasonable for him not to go ahead with it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Will we have to look at this counsel's performance under Strickland, I guess, and determine whether it was objectively unreasonable in light of Strickland, filtered through Yarborough?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, talking about -- in Strickland -- right here.  In Strickland, we said that if a decision by counsel is made upon, quote, thorough investigation, it is, quote, virtually unchallengeable.  Now, which of these facts in the Petitioner's brief is wrong: That Wager retained eight expert doctors to evaluate Mirzayance's mental health; he retained jury consultants; he conducted a mock trial in which he presented mental health defenses to two juries; he hired a private investigator to interview friends and associates; he consulted with Mirzayance's parents and their attorneys; he discussed the case with a retained expert doctor after decision and his co-counsel?  Now, that sounds like pretty thorough investigation of the defense you say he should have raised.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So all the points that your -- your friend began with, which shows his conscious deliberation, his knowledge not only about how to go about killing somebody, but also guilt, the recognition of the wrongfulness of what he had done -- all that under California law doesn't enter into a consideration of insanity?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand that, but counsel here at the time retained eight expert doctors to evaluate his mental health.  He conducted the mock jury trial.  He interviewed the parents.  He hired an investigator to interview friends.  What you're saying is, well, here's -- if he had hired a ninth expert, he might have come out differently.  That sounds like a thorough investigation under Strickland.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So isn't that -- aren't you back to the ""nothing to lose"" argument?  He conducted this investigation, which under Strickland we said makes the decision virtually unchallengeable, and you're saying, well, he has an obligation to proffer it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So he's got nothing to lose?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess that gets me back to what one -- what I thought the case was postured in, which is whether or not a case from this Court clearly establishes when you have nothing to lose, you've got to go ahead and present the defense, or it's a violation of Strickland.  And what case is that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I -- I understood your responses to the various questions here to, in effect, be arguing for that standard.  You're saying, look, he was going to get the same sentence anyway.  You know, all -- all your answers sound to me like nothing to lose.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, he made a determination -- he made a determination after thorough investigation, the various points I went through with you earlier, that it was not a credible defense.  Now, maybe that was reasonable or unreasonable, but it doesn't seem to me to be -- under Strickland, we said it's virtually unchallengeable, and it doesn't seem to me to be objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law from this Court.

I would anticipate that even if the -- if the Court were to adopt our position, these kinds of Sixth Amendment cases are still going to be litigated.  The issue is simply going to be whether or not the -- the States -- or the police agent is deliberately eliciting the statement or not.  So there -- there's likely going to be some kind of pretrial litigation regarding the admissibility of the statements, and it could be handled at that time.  If there are no further questions from the Court, I'll yield my remaining time.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. McAllister, you have 6 minutes remaining.     ",07-1356
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, do -- do I understand the first sentence on page 6 of your brief to concede that there's no deterrent value from prohibiting the introduction of these statements for impeachment?  The sentence says:  ""A Sixth Amendment exclusionary rule that allowed use of uncounseled statements for impeachment would not deter violations of the right to counsel. ""   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You -- you agree with the representations on -- from your friends on the other side that there's no case of ours where we've excluded a statement or evidence submitted for impeachment, even though it would have been excluded in this case-in-chief.  If you prevail here, it would be the first time that any evidence or statement has been excluded when submitted for purposes of impeachment.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you've -- you've emphasized that what distinguishes this case from the other ones where we've allowed evidence that would be excluded from the case-in-chief and for impeachment purposes is that this is a trial right.  But the Sixth Amendment says in criminal prosecutions you have the right to the assistance of counsel.  Well, he had assistance of counsel here, and -- and one of the things that counsel did was point out the problems with relying on the snitch's evidence and all the bad things that he did.  But -- but just like in the case of a Fourth Amendment violation, where we allow the evidence to be admitted at trial, this Sixth Amendment problem, you know -- it doesn't -- I just don't see the -- the strength of that distinction.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it seems to me you're getting away from the basis for your distinction then, saying, well, it's not just at trial.  Well, these other constitutional rights where we've allowed the evidence to come in for impeachment are indistinguishable from the Sixth Amendment right outside of trial.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Just to pause on that, it affects his decision to testify because it makes it more likely that he'll testify truthfully if he is going to testify.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The focus -- the focus on the trial context is at least a double-edged sword since the harm that we're facilitating under your rule is to allow -- allow perjured testimony.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, and if he has the assistance of counsel at trial, consistent with the Sixth Amendment, those -- those problems could be pointed out.  He wasn't -- he was -- he's not lying now.  The reason he said something different then was, you know, he likes to brag in prison or whatever the basis is.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, I think it would.  That's -- I think that's quite right.  But I don't see how excluding the evidence, even on impeachment, helps that.  I mean, they've still got the statement, and they -- you know, I guess your point is, you know, maybe they'll get some leads from it even if they can't use it.  But excluding the evidence for impeachment purposes doesn't eliminate that harm.   ",07-1356
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.  Mr. Jay.     William M. Jay  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Three binding Federal laws make clear that the State of Hawaii has absolute fee title to the lands in the Federal trust.  It also has the power to sell those lands for the purposes Congress set out in the trust instrument.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you think on the question-presented issue?  Are all of the Federal laws on which the Hawaii Supreme Court relied to say there was a cloud on the title before the court?   William M. Jay  We think that they have been in the case from the beginning.  They're -- they were clearly pressed in the State supreme court.  And we think they are fairly encompassed in the question presented partly because, as General Bennett said, the -- the question's reference to the State's sovereign authority, which necessarily includes consideration of the act which made Hawaii a sovereign State, the Admissions Act, is -- is a necessary antecedent to resolution of that question.  But also because the Admission -- the Apology Resolution, itself, in the preamble on which the Respondents rely extensively, goes into great detail about the Newlands Resolution and the cession of absolute fee and ownership by the Republic of Hawaii to the United States.   ",07-1372
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, they relied on Federal law to create a fiduciary obligation.  So if we think that Federal law did not create a fiduciary obligation, what should we do?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  All Federal law?  In other words, not simply the Apology Resolution but the other Federal provisions?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you think those -- yes.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you think you would -- you would object to that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about the--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --What about the Newlands Resolution, the Admission Act, and the Organic Law?  Do you acknowledge that if the Hawaii Supreme Court relied on those, that also would be inappropriate?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They relied on them the same way you say they relied on the Apology Resolution, to give rise to a fiduciary duty under State law.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you would have no -- just to carry on the opinion-drafting process, you would have no objection to an opinion that said no source of Federal law gave rise to a duty under State law, fiduciary or otherwise; that any further proceedings on remand should be based solely on State law?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but it's not simply a question of the source of the fiduciary duty.  It -- presumably, in the course of saying what the Apology Resolution, the Newlands Act, the Organic Act, and the Admission Act had to say, we may well say something to the effect that, because it conveyed perfect title, it's inconsistent with the cloud of that title, under a fiduciary obligation created by State law or anything else.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if we told them that these various Federal resolutions, including the Apology Resolution, conveyed title to the State in a particular way that precluded the burdening of the State's title on the basis of Federal law, then they would have to find a basis under State law that was not inconsistent with the Federal law's conveying of perfect title.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But then it would also have to just -- the opinion we're drafting would go further, I suppose, and since we are interpreting all these Federal provisions, it may not be sufficient to say that it did not create this obligation and the Hawaiian Supreme Court was wrong to do that, but that it precluded the creation under State law of this type of obligation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And if the Hawaiian Supreme Court wants to create, under State law, a particular type of fiduciary obligation grounded on the status of the land prior to admission, then it has to run -- under the Supremacy Clause, it has to be consistent with the Federal provisions.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I'm not saying they did.  That's the first question.  I'm not saying they grounded it on Federal law; I'm saying we would have to determine whether Federal law precluded the grounding of a fiduciary duty under the status of the land prior to admission.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the decision of the Hawaii Supreme Court would then be vacated?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Under Munsingwear.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what's--   ",07-1372

Roberts, Jr.  --I -- this may be a purely academic distinction, but you talked in terms of liability.  Are you suggesting that the trust principles do not set a standard to which the Secretary is bound, or simply that they don't constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.  Mr. Phillips.     Carter G. Phillips  --He's totally on board with us, Justice Scalia.  [Laughter]  That's out of the brief.  I'll just conclude with the section 8 argument, which is to recognize that the Secretary did owe a duty of candor and disclosure embedded in section 8.  That program did not end.  That disclosure responsibility did not end.  What the measure of damages for that breach of duty is a question that obviously is still open on remand.  But the notion that the Secretary can behave the way the Secretary did in this case, which is to know that he was not going to take personal jurisdiction over the final decision, command that no decision be made, leave the Navajo in a state of distress under those circumstances, force them to negotiate with one hand tied behind their back at a minimum, and then ended up an agreement that was half what the fair market value would have been for the quality of coal, is an outrage and the Court ought to allow the damages action to go forward.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  With respect to both blacks and whites, correct?   Edwin S. Kneedler  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, can you assure me that the government's position would be the same if this test -- black applicants -- firefighters scored highest on this test in disproportionate numbers, and the City said we don't like that result, we think there should be more whites on the fire department, and so we're going to throw the test out?  The government of United States would adopt the same position?   Edwin S. Kneedler  Yes, and let me -- your question had two parts of it.  You said there are too many blacks or too many whites.  That is not a permissible objective under our view.  The employer's action has to be tied to a concern about a violation of the disparate impact of--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah.   Edwin S. Kneedler  --under -- under Title VII.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's the part I don't understand.  What you're saying is that the department can engage in intentional discrimination to avoid concern that they will be sued under disparate impact.  Why doesn't it work the other way around as well?  Why don't they say, well, we've got to tolerate the disparate impact because otherwise, if we took steps to avoid it, we would be sued for intentional discrimination?  This idea that there is this great dilemma -- I mean, it cuts both ways.   Edwin S. Kneedler  Well, to -- to say that an employer violates the disparate treatment provision of Title VII when it seeks to -- when it acts for the purpose of complying with the disparate impact provisions of Title VII would be to set those two mutually reinforcing provisions of Title VII at war with one another, contrary to--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, this may be the same question Justice Breyer asked, but I'd like something closer to a yes or no answer.  Does the government consider promotion of diversity by itself a compelling state interest in the employment context as opposed to the school context?   Edwin S. Kneedler  We think -- we think it probably is a compelling state interest, but it is not one that -- that can be advanced by race -- by racial classifications.  And that -- and that is our basic submission here.  This was not a--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can it be--   Edwin S. Kneedler  --This was not a--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Can it be advanced by taking actions to avoid what is perceived as a disparate impact?   Edwin S. Kneedler  --Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, the disparate impact is regarded as something you can intentionally respond to by drawing racial distinctions solely because you would like a more diverse workforce?   Edwin S. Kneedler  No, not drawing racial distinctions.  That's our -- this -- the employer's response here did not draw racial distinctions.  It did not say so many black firefighters would be promoted--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It didn't care--   Edwin S. Kneedler  --and so many white--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --It didn't care -- it had to draw racial distinctions because it looked at the test and said, we think there's a problem because of the racial makeup of who's going to get the promotions.   Edwin S. Kneedler  --The employer was responding to the discriminatory test or what -- what it was reasonably concerned was a discriminatory test--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It didn't look at names; it just looked at the label of what their race was.  That's all they were concerned about.   Edwin S.

It was because of what they saw as the impact on race.  Yet we concluded that was racial discrimination.  So what's the -- how do you draw the line between race-conscious that's permitted and racial discrimination that's not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but if we -- if we agree with your -- I mean, you're assuming, it seems to me in your argument, that the actions that they've taken here are not intentional racial discrimination; and of course if they're not, then you don't have much to worry about.  But let's assume that they are, as we found they were in Croson and Wygant and Adarand and Parents Involved.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And the only reason you say that isn't by an individual is that you have blacked out the names?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your position is what?  They threw out the test, so you would have no problem at all if they looked at those results and they were predominantly black rather than white; you would say the city can throw out the test and there's no racial discrimination there at all?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So this case would come out differently, if the list was there with then names and they go down and instead of saying throw out the test, they said Jones, you don't get the promotion because you're white; Johnson, you don't get it because you're white.  And they go down the list and throw out everybody who took the test; then that would be all right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So they can keep -- they get do-overs until it comes out right?  Or throw out this test; they do another test; oh, it's just as bad, throw that one out; get another one that's a little better, but not so -- throw that one out?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well if -- how many times before it's a problem?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You say if they did it over and over again.  What if they did it twice here?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that -- I am sorry.  Is that correct if we -- we conclude strict scrutiny does apply under the Constitution?  Compliance with a statute, looking at impact, is a compelling interest trumping strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess it would go to how you construe the statute.  It seems to me an odd argument to say that you can violate the Constitution because you have to comply with the statute.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I get back just -- just -- since I don't understand it yet, the distinction between intentional racial discrimination and race conscious action.  I thought both the plurality and the concurrence in Parents Involved accepted the fact that race conscious action such as school siting or drawing district lines is -- is okay, but discriminating in particular assignments is not.  Now, why is this not intentional discrimination?  I understood you to say it was because you don't have particular individuals being treated on the basis of their race.  You are going to have to explain that to me again, because there are particular individuals here.  They are the plaintiffs, and they say they didn't get their jobs because of intentional racial action by the -- the city.  Why is that not on the racial -- intentionally racial discrimination side rather than the permissible race consciousness side?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that -- you may be right that that's what the question is about.  I still don't have in my mind from you a line about how we decide.  Because there are many cases, Croson, Adarand, Wygant, Parents Involved, where we said action taken obviously because of race is nonetheless discrimination.  So -- and then there are cases where we have recognized that race conscious action is permissible.  Again, what -- when I look at something like this, how I do decide which side of the line that's on -- this is on?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But just to take Parents Involved, it wasn't a necessary -- the driving factor was not a specific decision with respect to specific individuals.  They didn't care whether it was Jones or Smith that they were citing.  All they cared about was the race.  And it seems the -- the same here.  You maybe don't care whether it's Jones or Smith who is not getting the promotion.  All you care about is who is getting the promotion.  All you care about is his race.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You just referred--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I'm sorry.  You just referred to a discriminatory test.  What you said in the district court, and I quote, the issue is not whether the tests were valid.  Are you just changing positions on that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Kennedy.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What type of -- what type of other things are you talking about there?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the question, I guess, would be whether the program was valid or not under the traditional approaches you take under Title VII.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So does your position here depend on a conclusion that this test is invalid?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your response to me that you don't have to show that the test is invalid, your argument is you just have to show that there's a basis for being worried that it might be invalid.  And then it seems to me the only distinction is how high a showing you require.  And you reject the idea that you have to show a strong basis in the evidence?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand from -- I guess I should say I understand from your brief if not from your argument that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --You agree with the strong basis in fact standard?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So I guess, my -- so my -- your position is that you should never have a strong basis in fact standard, because you don't think strict scrutiny should apply, and you think if it's under Title VII, it's only reasonableness?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your position is that the city -- the -- the government can take action without -- only if it's reasonable.  It's a reasonable view of whether or not they might or might not be liable.  That's the standard.  And then they can engage in race-based action?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what is something less than that, that they might be sued?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't that -- isn't that kind of a blank check to discriminate, if all they need is a reasonable basis to think that further investigation might be useful?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I'm sorry -- that's an answer about why it would be okay.  I'm just saying, isn't it in fact a blank check?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I'm sorry--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I still -- I still don't have absolutely yes -- of what?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, they can--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, just to get back to your answer to Justice Stevens, you say they'd have to certify it.  You say that, in that situation, the decisionmaker could not have a reasonable basis for thinking further investigation is required.  Why?  Just because the second test came out the same way?  It's not at all reasonable to think they ought to look at it further?   ",07-1428
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  There'd be no need to dress up anything.  I mean, that's Justice Stevens's point.  You wouldn't have to dress up anything; if you send it back, it's not reviewable.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, ""woodenly"" is a bit much.  I mean, they're going to read it not to say what it says.  And Thermtron involved the court saying: I'm not going to take this because I'm too busy with other things.  I mean, it could be limited to that unusual situation, couldn't it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think it would solve the problem Justice Ginsburg pointed out earlier, that this way you don't get to appeal big things like no subject matter jurisdiction, but you do get to appeal picayune things.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You thought the Respondents asked us to overrule Thermtron.  On page 22, you say,  ""Respondents' implicit request for this Court to overrule Thermtron should be rejected. ""   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So this gets a lot of attention across the street?  The reviewability of remand orders gets ----  [Laughter]  I mean, in one of those provisions, they said this was only technical amendments, and if they're just doing technical amendments, that doesn't mean they have to look at it and approve the whole thing.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they don't have a choice, right?  They can't say, I don't like the Supreme Court rule so I'm not going to apply it, other than the Federal Circuit.  [Laughter]   ",07-1437
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your idea is there is jurisdiction, but when the Federal claims fall out, then there's no jurisdiction?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay, but that seems to me to echo the fundamental misperception that if you have Federal jurisdiction based on a particular event -- let's say, if you're dumping chemicals in the water, that gives you a Federal cause of action; you have Federal jurisdiction; there's a trial.  It turns out you weren't dumping chemicals -- you don't then say, there was no jurisdiction; there was jurisdiction before, but once the finding is made that the facts didn't support it, then there was no jurisdiction.  You say, there was jurisdiction all the time, and you lose.   ",07-1437
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry to interrupt, but isn't there a third, which is that you just don't assume anything and you wait to see if he makes -- says,  ""I want to talk to my lawyer. ""  or he could well say, ""You've told me"", as was the case here,  ""I have a right to a lawyer, I don't have to say anything, I want to talk some more, I don't -- okay, there's a lawyer, fine, I want to talk without my lawyer, I want to waive my right to counsel. ""  Which he can do.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  If you prevail and you say silence constitutes saying  ""I want to talk to my lawyer. ""  that's right.  I'm saying that's a false, a false alternative.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the rule you're asking for would apply across the board.  How would it apply in a case where the defendant is given Miranda warnings, says, thank you, I don't want to talk to my lawyer, I want to talk to you.  He's talking to the police.  All of a sudden they bring a note in and say: They've appointed a lawyer.  The police says: I just got a note; you've been appointed a lawyer.  Do you want to keep talking?  You would say that's a violation, right?  And then he says yes and continues to talk.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's a violation, even though he knows that if he wanted a lawyer he could request one, he knows one's been appointed for him, and he's been warned that if he doesn't want to talk without a lawyer he doesn't have to, and he's in the middle of a conversation that he initiated, and the police says, do you want to keep talking?  That's a violation?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Early on, before the lawyer was appointed, he's given Miranda warnings and he says: I want to talk.  He's talking.  They say: Now, we just got the word; a lawyer has been appointed; do you want to keep talking?  He says yes.  That's a violation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm trying to -- which stage are you talking about, before the lawyer was appointed or after?  I'm telling you before he was appointed, the police did not initiate the conversation.  They told him he didn't have to talk.  He says: I want to talk.  Now, you're saying it counts as initiating the interrogation if they say: You've got a lawyer; do you want to keep talking?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is he -- where is the initiation?  Is it when he says, yes, I want to keep talking, after being told -- asked do you want to keep talking?  Or is it way back at the beginning?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  At the outset.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't that what happened here?  He had been given his Miranda warnings, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Again, you are arguing the facts of a particular case, and we are looking at a rule that is going to apply across the board.  In a particular case, as you say, the Louisiana Supreme Court said this almost violated his Fifth Amendment right.  There are protections against the actual coercion, which it seems to me you're arguing.  As I understood Justice Scalia's question, he says: Don't you have to assume that there is coercion even in the mildest case, not the most extreme one, but the mildest one?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  A right that you can relinquish, a right that you can waive, and all that's being suggested is that it is not totally determinative whether the police say: Do you want to keep talking, or if the defendant says: I want to keep talking.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right, and whether or--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --whether or not your -- your dialogue with my colleagues about overruling Jackson -- putting that to one side, what you are arguing is an extension of Jackson from the context in which it arose to this context.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Landry.     Kathryn W. Landry  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Verrilli, you have four minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",07-1529
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, I didn't understand you to be doing that.  I thought your position was once there's a request, there's a request, and that's enough.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So I -- I suppose what the dialogue simply establishes is that like in any situation there's going to be factual issues about what's a request or not.  I mean, he could say, the court says I'm appointing Johnson, and he says,  ""Johnson? ""  ""Is that the best you can do? ""  And the question is, is that accepting Johnson or not?  He says is that the best you can do?  Maybe it is, maybe it's not.  I mean, but the point is whether or not you establish a rule that requires some request, and in the odd case there will be a debate about what's a request or not, but the issue is the general rule.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, why don't you answer Justice Alito's question?   ",07-1529
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if your shipper here knew that every time he delivered one of these truckloads of the chemical, one-third of it would end up on the ground and seeping through the ground, and no doubt about it, he knew that, and yet they kept sending it?  Wouldn't that be arranging for the disposal of at least a third of the shipment?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But your -- your argument assumes a sharp distinction between useful product and waste.  Yet it's quite common to talk about there being waste associated with a useful product.  When you use up so much of this, there's going to be a certain percentage of waste.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --That's making it too easy for you.  It would mean all of those people would be liable when in the course of delivering stuff they know there's going to be a certain amount that's going to spill, and even -- perhaps the Justice Alito's hypothetical -- they could have easily -- they chose the truck that causes more spill rather than the one that causes less.  It's not simply here's the product, we're gone, see you later, and all of a sudden there's a spill.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, I know.  But I'm trying to reach the extent of your argument.  So in that type of a case would there be arranger liability?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Mahoney.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if -- what if you have a situation where it's clear under apportionment one party is liable for one-tenth and the other is liable for nine-tenths, but one-tenth is enough to pollute the -- the water.  Do you have apportionment in that situation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I assume it's not a linear, if that's the right word, progression, because once you've got to start a clean-up, you've got to start a clean-up, whether it's, you know, caused by one-tenth or -- or nine-tenths.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what about the issue of insolvency?  You have talked about the Restatements.  There's the comment h to one of the Restatement provisions that says you don't apportion if one of the other parties is insolvent.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Stewart.     Malcolm L. Stewart  I think there is no ""arranger"" case going in either direction that's on all fours with this one where there is the sale of a useful product during the course of a delivery that the seller arranged -- that the seller controlled.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Sullivan, we will give you five minutes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not sure I know what it means to say it's a divisible harm.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that means that whatever percentage of responsibility the parties have, that's the percentage of cost that they--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --So does that mean that, let's say, the -- how does that work when it costs $2 million to sort of start a clean-up, no matter who, and then, you know, the more stuff there is, the extra million it is?  Is that -- is -- is the initial cost a divisible harm?   INTERRUPTING ",07-1601
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  On the question of apportionment, is it really your position that because of the precision you would require, that if there's a big fight over whether it's 10 percent responsibility or 30 percent and there's no way to tell, that if the parties said, look, we'll take 40 percent, that that's no good?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't that what happened here?  I mean, whatever -- I guess the railroads said 6 percent, and the district court said, well, just to be on the safe side, we'll give them 9 percent.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that still doesn't address the question, if you have varying degrees of whatever you want to call it -- fault or causal relationship -- that that's a sensible way to apportion the liability.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what -- what about Ms. Mahoney's three answers, when I asked that question of her?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  She also said that the Restatement comment h that you rely on cites no cases, and the Third Restatement backs away from that comment.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you don't -- you don't think that the insolvency should prevent apportionment if you have a situation where a party is 1 percent responsible and the 99 percent responsible party is insolvent?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And what do we have in the way of findings on that question?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But is that right?  I mean, doesn't it -- aren't you challenging the whole basis for apportionment?  I mean -- I don't think when you're apportioning responsibility, you allocate whether or not the actors independently caused the harm.  I thought the assumption was, yes, everybody's -- all of this group has contributed to the harm, but now we're going to apportion their responsibility.   INTERRUPTING ",07-1601

Start over again, but he would have to accept counsel at that point?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your standard of coherent communication, you would not require the defendant, for example, to understand the hearsay rule, or other things of that sort?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, even if you don't, I mean, how is he going to effectively participate in the trial?  Does he have to know, for example, that he has the right and understand that he has the right to cross examine witnesses?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if he... what if he wants to communicate not self defense, but that, you know, Martians did it?  Is he... and he can coherently communicate that.  There won't be any doubt on the judge's part or the jury that he thinks Martians did it?  Would that qualify?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I mean, I'm trying to find some level that is above competency.  I mean, there are people who believe in Martians, but above competence to stand trial, but also that would still be coherently communicated, but would show that it's a ridiculous defense that's not going to be effective in representing himself.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you argue that the State has no interest to be considered in this calculus?  In other words, it is solely the interest of the defendant in representing himself and that the State has no interest in ensuring a credible process?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but an individual doesn't have to know and appreciate the rules of courtroom procedure to be judged competent to stand trial.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that's suggesting to me that you give no weight to the State interest.  In other words, so long as he's held to those rules, that's basing your determination solely on his interest and no weight given to the State's interest in ensuring that you have a trial where people are observing the rules.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I ask the... it's really the flip side of the question Justice Scalia asked.  Why shouldn't we be concerned that if you have the same standard that trial courts are going to elevate the competency showing beyond what really is required?  In other words, if they have to have the same standard, they don't want a proceeding where you've got someone who... you know, whatever the standard is... is not going to be as competent or reasonably represented as he would by a lawyer, so they're more likely to find the person incompetent to stand trial in the first place?  These are addressed to two different, entirely different questions.  And rather than having a problem with merging the standards which results in one of them being cheated, why don't we have two different standards?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well then, why don't they have the choice of elevating the standard for ability to represent themselves in a coherent way at trial?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's what understood Godinez to say, that you certainly don't have to elevate your standard, but I didn't understand it to say you can't.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it actually doesn't say that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It seems to me that both sides are kind of raising these, taking the arguments to extremes and they don't have to do that.  If you... if you accept the fact that there can be a higher standard than competency to stand trial, that doesn't mean that the judge can say you can't make the decision if you have tattoos.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but you're putting a heavy burden on the State to say, all right, now... and the prosecution... to say, now we've got to look out for what this guy is going to say, and now we've got to appoint standby counsel.  And I'm not sure how your response deals with the guy who says: I was indicted for 93 counts because it's 1993.

And in the context of many of those acts, reliance would be completely inappropriate.  I would also like to point out that I think the conduct that is alleged here really does go to the core of what RICO is intended to redress.  Congress made clear, in the finding that accompanied the statute, that one of its principal concerns was that criminal enterprises could use illegal means to compete unfairly with legitimate businesses.  And so if a business... a criminal business were to use threats of violence directed at its competitor's customers to get them to switch their business to it, the competitor would have a cause of action for that.  And then the same should be true, we submit, if the business uses fraud directed at its competitor's customers to induce them to switch their business.  If there are no further questions.   John G.

In other words under your statutory argument, you still could sue; but because of other considerations you can't?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what happens... what happens if some of the bids were more than zero, and some weren't?  You get to sue for part of the damages, and the county gets to sue for the rest?  Or how do you divvy that up?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but I suppose since we are talking about a rotational rule, you could have... what are these, monthly or annually... one, possibly, cycle where it's all zero percent, and then others where it isn't, and then another where it is.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Stewart, I don't understand that point.  Let's say Allison Engine is defrauding Bath, but Bath makes ships for a lot of people, boats, whatever they make.  Allison Engine is defrauding, saying these engines, you know, work this way and, in fact, they don't.  It doesn't know Bath is going to use some of them in a government ship as opposed to a private ship.  So you're saying in that context, since there's no intent to defraud the government, there's no liability?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It just sells them engines.  It doesn't know what Bath is going to do with them.  They are going to put some in private boats and some in the government boats.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, how far down the line?  I mean, let's take that hypothetical.  The government gives money to the State to build a school.  The school has to be painted as part of that, so the school contractor, the prime contractor, takes some of the money from the Federal Government and pays the painter.  The painter needs to buy paint.  So the painter takes some of the Federal money and pays the paint company.  The paint company has to get the chemicals from somebody.  So the paint company takes some of the money and pays the chemical company.  And at that point, the chemical companies fraudulently added, you know, a dollar on to the cost of the chemicals.  So that dollar goes all the way through.  So the Government ends up paying a dollar more because of the fraud five, six, seven times down the line.  Can an uninterested person bring a qui tam action against the chemical manufacturer because of that fraud?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not a presentment requirement.  That's in (a)(1.  It's that the claim be paid, the fault claim, be paid by the government.  And what you're saying is when the government pays the State, that pays the school, that pays the contractor, that pays the paint... blah, blah, blah... that that is payment by the government of a false claim because the chemical manufacturer six or seven steps down the line commits fraud.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Stewart.  Mr. Helmer.     John G.

Roberts, Jr.  So when the government... when the phrase '86?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  There were a lot of statutes that said ""with Federal funds"", right?   John G.

So I guess I get back... you read ""by the government"" as if it said ""with Federal funds""?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if in fact, as you suggest, Allison submitted the certificate to the Navy person at the shipyard, then the question presented in this case is not in fact presented here?  Because the question presented assumes that there had not been a submission to the Federal Government of the false... false claim.   ",07-214X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the shipowner is, I suppose, the owner of Exxon or the hundreds of thousands of shareholders, right?  So you have to have a shareholder driving the boat before you can assess liability?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's not quite correct to say only the owner.  In other words, it is a certain level of employee, because corporations only act through individuals.  It is a certain level of employee in the company.  Now, where do you draw the line between the CEO and the cabin boy?  How do you do that?  And I would suspect, just instinctively, that somebody driving one of these huge tankers is a lot closer to the CEO than the cabin boy.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That is only true if you lose on your second and third questions as well, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The answers to your second and third questions preclude a new trial?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the City of Milwaukee involved the displacement by Federal statutory law of Federal common law.  Your case involves the displacement of Federal maritime law by Federal statutory law.  Federal maritime law is routine.  Federal courts do that all the time.  Federal common law is unusual, and in the City of Milwaukee was resorted to simply by necessity.  Doesn't that suggest that whatever the Federal maritime rule on punitive damages is, it's a harder showing on your part to conclude that it's displaced by the statutory process?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Dellinger, did you say you had a second and a third point?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You going to get to them?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  All right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Fisher.     Jeffrey L. Fisher  Right.  One of the many ways in which this case is the mirror image of the due process cases that Justice Souter was referring to that caused this Court to have such great concern about the uptick in punitive damages, here you have a single case.  You have a single digit ratio which is proportionate to the harm that was shown in this case.  You have... in contrast to State Farm, in the most recent... second most recent case this case had... in State Farm you had two plaintiffs who stood before this Court having received $500,000 each in compensatory damages for the emotional distress of 18 months of not knowing whether an insurance claim was going to be paid.  What you have today are 32,000 plaintiffs standing before this Court, each of whom have received only $15,000 for having their lives and livelihood destroyed and haven't received a dime of emotional distress damages.  If there are no further questions, I'll submit.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Fisher.  Mr. Dellinger, you have four and a half minutes.     ",07-219X

Is the corporation liable in that case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you regard the ship as a business unit?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's different if they say that it's... depending on how they categorize the different units tells whether they are liable or not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That was a question that I asked, not a statement.  Well, how do you draw the line?  I mean, is the second in command on the boat a man responsible for policy?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Fisher, you... your friend says in his reply brief that you cannot cite one U.S. maritime case that has allowed vicarious liability for punitive damages.  Is this the first one?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What's your best case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let's take... take the Ludlow.  Mr. Dellinger says that's a case where the court found that the owner is not vicariously liable.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is your position of how to look at the case if you have a managerial employee who acts contrary to corporate policy?  Is the corporation still exposed to punitive damages?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In a case like this.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what can a corporation do to protect itself against punitive damages awards such as this?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, and assume it has a policy that we will hire fit and competent people?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you're saying... that's the question I'm asking.  What if there is a breach of the corporate policy?  I don't see what more a corporation can do.  I mean, your... other than... other than what?  I mean it has to say that the policy is this, and if somebody breaks the policy, they're liable for compensatory damages, which can as this case shows be in the billions of dollars, and of course the individual is liable for punitive and other awards.  But what more can the corporation do other than say here is our policies?  And try to implement them.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  At that level... at that level, the president, I think you would have an argument that the policy was being changed.  It's not clear that that argument works when you're dealing with someone at Mr. Hazelwood's level.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose that would go to how consistently and how effectively the policy is enforced.  If the president of the company isn't following the policy it's not going to be taken very seriously.  That's different than saying you have a situation where on an episodic and sporadic basis a firm company policy is breached, the individual is breaching the policy.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  A while ago you were about to make a point on the Limitation of Liability Act.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I was... I would have thought that cuts heavily against you on the third point.  In other words, if we're looking to guidance, you look to Federal law.  And whether it's directly applicable or not, the Limitation of Liability Act reflects a very strong Federal policy about restricting liability on shipowners, adopted at a time when it was intended to encourage maritime... the maritime economy.  And why isn't that something we should look to, at least under question three?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that means they don't get the really quite extraordinary protection that the limitation of liability gives.  It doesn't mean that we should ignore the reflection of that policy outside the confines of the Limitation of Liability Act.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The argument is not that the Limitation of Liability Act should apply.  It's that it would be very strange to say, where Congress has radically reduced the exposure of shipowners in one area, that we as a matter of development of Federal common law, Federal maritime law should allow dramatically expanded punitive liability in another area of shipowning liability.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It was a different jury.  And the jury is the one that set the amount of punitive damages.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  This is the same judge who approved the instruction that said Hazelwood's negligence and recklessness is automatically imputed to Exxon, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So he was operating that under understanding of the law.   INTERRUPTING ",07-219X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you're right, Mr. Dellinger, it's certainly an odd way in the Second Amendment to phrase the operative provision.  If it is limited to State militias, why would they say ""the right of the people""?  In other words, why wouldn't they say  ""state militias have the right to keep arms? ""   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if that's right, doesn't that cut against you?  If the militia included all the people, doesn't the preamble that you rely on not really restrict the right much at all?  It includes all the people.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that may be true, but that concedes your main point that there is an individual right and gets to the separate question of whether the regulations at issue here are reasonable.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but your reading of the militia clause, the militia clause specifically reserves certain rights to the States by its terms.  And as I understand your reading, you would be saying the Second Amendment was designed to take away or expand upon the rights that are reserved, rather than simply guaranteeing what rights were understood to be implicit in the Constitution itself.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the militia clause, Article I, Section 8, says certain rights are reserved to the States with respect to the militia.  And yet you're telling us now that this was a very important right that ensured that they kept arms, but it wasn't listed in the rights that were reserved in the militia clause.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is... what is reasonable about a total ban on possession?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you have a law that prohibits the possession of books, it's all right if you allow the possession of newspapers?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The regulation... the regulation at issue here is not one that goes to the number of guns.  It goes to the specific type.  And I understood your argument to be in your brief that because rifles and shotguns are not banned to the same extent as handguns, it's all right to ban handguns.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm not sure that it's accurate to say the opinion below allowed those.  The law that the opinion, the court below, was confronted with was a total ban, so that was the only law they considered.  If the District passes a ban on machine guns or whatever, then that law... that law would be considered by the court and perhaps would be upheld as reasonable.  But the only law they had before them was a total ban.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are you allowed to carry the weapons that are allowed?  I read the ""carry clause"" to apply without qualification.  So while you say you might be able to have a shotgun in the home, you can't carry it to get there.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why don't you remain, Mr. Dellinger.  We'll make sure you have rebuttal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Dellinger.  General Clement.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, these various phrases under the different standards that are proposed, ""compelling interest"", ""significant interest"", ""narrowly tailored"", none of them appear in the Constitution; and I wonder why in this case we have to articulate an all-encompassing standard.  Isn't it enough to determine the scope of the existing right that the amendment refers to, look at the various regulations that were available at the time, including you can't take the gun to the marketplace and all that, and determine how these... how this restriction and the scope of this right looks in relation to those?  I'm not sure why we have to articulate some very intricate standard.  I mean, these standards that apply in the First Amendment just kind of developed over the years as sort of baggage that the First Amendment picked up.  But I don't know why when we are starting afresh, we would try to articulate a whole standard that would apply in every case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But this law didn't involve a restriction on machine guns.  It involved an absolute ban.  It involved an absolute carry prohibition.  Why would you think that the opinion striking down an absolute ban would also apply to a narrow one... narrower one directed solely to machine guns?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Gura.     Alan Gura  --some fact finding.  It's something that might be doable, but again, that's so far from what we have here.  We have here a ban on all guns, for all people, in all homes, at all times in the Nation's capital.  That quite simply is too broad and too sweeping under any level of review.  Thank you, Your Honor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Gura.  Mr. Dellinger, 10 minutes.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, before you start with it, how many minutes does it take to remove a trigger lock and load a gun?  Because both the gun has to be unloaded; it has to have a trigger lock under the District laws.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, disassembled--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --In either case it has to be unloaded, correct?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the law, as I understand it, says that the gun has to be unloaded.  So under your hypothetical, I assume that would violate the District's law if the gun is still loaded.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So how long does it take?  If your interpretation is correct, how long does it take to remove the trigger lock and make the gun operable.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it like that?  Is it a numerical code?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So then you turn on the lamp, you pick up your reading glasses...--  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It may not matter, but I'd like some idea about how long it takes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if proportionate, in other words you're saying your interest is allowing self-defense in the home--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Does it really make sense to say the best self-defense arm is a rifle, as opposed to a pistol?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's a related point.  Do you understand the ban... the carry ban to apply if you carry the firearm from one room in the house to another?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is the... why is the D.C. law phrased in those terms?  In other words, if you can't have a handgun at all, why do you have a separate provision saying that you can't carry it anywhere?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why isn't that covered by the provision that you have the right to keep arms?   ",07-290X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So a conscientious objector who likes to hunt deer for food, you would say, has no rights under the Second Amendment.  He is not going to be part of the militia.  He is not going to be part of the common defense, but he still wants to bear arms.  You would say that he doesn't have any rights under this amendment?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there any parallel--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Is there any parallel at the time that the amendment was adopted to the machine gun?  In other words, I understand your point to be that, although that's useful in modern military service, it's not something civilians possess.  Was there anything like that at the time of the adoption, or were the civilian arms exactly the same as the ones you'd use in the military?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why isn't the trigger-lock provisions that are at issue here, why aren't they similar to the various provisions that Justice Breyer mentioned like the gunpowder restriction?  In other words, for reasons of domestic safety, they said you can't store the gunpowder anywhere but on the top floor.  Why isn't the modern trigger-lock provision similar to those?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, there is always a risk that the children will get up and grab the firearm and use it for some purpose other than what the Second Amendment was designed to protect.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, right.  But, I mean, you don't necessarily expect a young child to be able to reassemble the pistol.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about... what about age limits... you've got to be over 18 or you've got to be over 21 to get a license?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is the age limit necessarily the same nationwide?  Maybe 16 in Wyoming makes more sense but 21 in the District.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --you would define ""reasonable"" in light of the restrictions that existed at the time the amendment was adopted.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You know, you can't take it into the marketplace was one restriction.

Roberts, Jr.  We're talking about... we're talking about the Constitution here.  And in effect... I mean, I assume I could run through the usual routine.  I mean, you wouldn't say they could have a statute of limitations of two days, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. Millett.     Patricia A. Millett  --I'm not sure... I'm not sure it would have come out differently.  Maybe they would have explained things differently.  But this Court said in most cases the question is which statutory scheme is better fitted.  And at two levels we think the Tucker Act is better fitted for this claim.  One, because any tax only applies when there is asserted legitimate basis for the tax; and two, the Export Clause is a unique limitation, specifically denies the government any authority to use exports as a source of revenue.  And you have a refund scheme here that has been designed over the years specifically to protect revenue interest, to make you pay the revenue first and have them hold it.  It's not just holding them for six months.  They had to pay every two weeks.  But, of course, the government didn't treat that as paid for purposes of interest until the end of the quarter when a return was filed.  That's one way why the interest calculation might be different under the Tucker Act than it would be under the refund scheme, just the timing of whether it's the deposit or the actual return.  Justice Kennedy, I forgot to get back to you on that.  But the question here is whether the Export Clause can be fully enforced by... which it's... it's not a suggestion and it doesn't say when you're doing your tax stuff, it's okay if you slop on on exports a little bit.  Exports are completely off limits to the tax power.  And Congress using its tax power to create a tax scheme that specifically preserves and protects revenue and is not a revenue neutral system is not the best scheme for vindicating the Export Clause.  It's not better for that.  It is at cross purposes with the Export Clause.  But the bottom is this Court doesn't need to get to that constitutional question.  We think it certainly informs the analysis.  It certainly is enough of a constitutional concern or doubt to conclude that Enochs still applies any tax in the tax injunction... any tax in any court.  No suit shall be maintained for any tax in any court means the same thing in 7422 that it means in the Tax Injunction Act.  If Congress thought it meant something different, it has had half... almost half a century to tell us.  It hasn't done that, and the Export Clause can't serve its unique historical function of keeping government's tax regulatory hands off... hands off the tax export process and the revenue out of the Federal fisc unless this is treated as a constitutional claim.

You are taking an adamant position with respect to three years but you give up six years.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So... so, the rhetoric in your brief how this is a constitutionally based prohibition is not pertinent?

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why does there have to be... there has to be a filing for bankruptcy before you get a plan confirmed, but I didn't understand that to be the threshold before... what does that mean, there has to be a filing for bankruptcy?  That the confirmation of the plan can't go back before that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It goes back before then in a lot of cases to look for preferential transfers and things like that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought your answer to Justice Breyer was saying there's another key event and that's the filing of the petition for bankruptcy.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I'm not sure I understand the practical consequences of your position.  I assume that if you're right, people who have an interest in buying the bankrupt business will wait or have to wait until after confirmation of the plan, because the tax liability is going to save them a lot of money.  Is it going to work in that case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, will the effect of your plan be that it will discourage people who come along and want to buy a bankrupt business?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't understand why this is a big deal.  Assuming that was news to me, that this only arises after the filing of a bankruptcy petition, and you are looking forward to confirmation of the plan, this tax only applies at the transfer of title.  Why don't you just get your deal together and just say, well, the closing is going to be the day after confirmation of the bankruptcy plan?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that's when you transfer title, and that's when you have to pay the stamp tax.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, I assume that the creditors have an interest in that as well.  I don't know how...

I would say two things, if I may.  One is it's no accident that Appellant isn't asking you to level up because what... they're not interested in doing additional financing; they're really taking... interested in taking advantage of keeping the opponent down to the $2300 level.  The only other thing that I would say about this choice between leveling up and leveling down is I would say that the statute that would have relaxed the caps for both candidates would pose the same First Amendment issue as this statute.

I mean, is there any other area... if you're writing a book, you don't have to disclose to the government when you're going to publish it and how far along you're getting in the draft.

These are special disclosure requirements for people who are going to engage in additional speech.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  What if the... what if the restriction were more tailored, if Congress decided the one area where the wealthy really have an advantage is buying television time, so that's what we're going to restrict.  If the wealthy individual buys a certain amount of television time, we're going to allow contributions to the less wealthy candidate to buy television time.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  So is there no limitation on the rationale of leveling the playing field throughout the First Amendment?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's trying... it's certainly trying to chill self-financing by burdening it when it reaches a certain level.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if the law expressed a displeasure at the introduction of self-financing and said that, as you have these very rapid disclosures, that the less wealthy candidate can accept contributions whatever, twice the amount of whatever the self-financed candidate is spending on his campaign?  Is that all right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, he... you know, the millionaire, as we are talking about, spends... discloses that he has spent $500,000.  Then the contribution limits are off the table for the less wealthy candidate to the tune of a million dollars, in other words twice as much as the self-financed candidate.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why not?  Because as... your point in this case, rather than the hypothetical, is that the self-financed candidate is not burdened in any way, but simply that his opponent has benefited.  And it seems to me that would be true in the case of my hypothetical as well.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I would have thought all the arguments that you gave before, like the self-financed candidate wants to be able to say he doesn't rely on contributions and so on, those would still be equally applicable.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's not a... it's not a qualitative argument you're making but a quantitative.  At some point, the benefit to the opponent gets to be too much of a chill on the self-financed candidate, but under this system you think it's below the line.   ",07-320X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, speaking of Roper and Atkins, is it... is it only work in one way?  How are you ever supposed to get consensus moving in the opposite direction?  In other words, you look to the number of States under Roper and Atkins who impose it, and you say, well, most of them are abolishing it, so we think it's unconstitutional, combined with other factors.  Now, if there's going to be a trend the other way, how does that happen?  As soon as the first State says, well, we're going to impose the death penalty for child rape, you say, well, there isn't a consensus, so it's unconstitutional.  And do 20 States have to get together and do it at the same time?  Or how are they supposed to move the inquiry under Atkins and Roper in the opposite direction?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And the trend since 1995, '90, has been more and more States are passing statutes imposing the death penalty in situations that do not result in death.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let me ask... we will put that to one side, but how much movement you need.  I'm more interested in the analytic question: How does it happen?  I mean because your position would be every one... a case in every one of those States, whatever the number is, is unconstitutional because we've said the trend is the other way.  Well, how does a trend ever get started in the opposite direction?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you want to say this is... you want to say this is unconstitutional because most States do it the other way.  And I assume if a similar case arose in Texas involving capital punishment in a nondeath case, you would say well, most go the other way.  In other words, if you knock them down one by one, it is kind of hard to get a trend going.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If somebody in this case is tried and convicted under that law, you would say: Well, that's unconstitutional because there is not a sufficient trend in favor of that.  And it just seems to me that that understanding of Atkins and Roper prevents the development of the law except in one direction.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know, but, as I pointed out, it is very expensive to run a regime in which you have the death penalty.  And I can see the legislators in those States saying, well, we've got Coker on the books.  We've only got one State.  Why would we want to be the second State and go through this process and then have the Supreme Court throw it out?  You know, everyone is waiting for the next State.  I mean it's a very difficult process, it seems to me, to run the evolution of the law in both directions.  And then if you're insisting on a trend of whatever... I don't know what the number is, 15, or 20, or 30 States... it just can't materialize when you have Coker there and you have Atkins looking only in one direction.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I wonder if Atkins and Roper are qualitatively different, considering the mental retardation of the offender, the youth of the offender.  Those are issues that go, as we said in Roper and Atkins, to culpability.  In other words, they are focused on the offender.  This is quite different.  It is focused on the nature of the offense.  And I wonder if that's more something on which we have less basis for determining the issue than a legislature.  We can look at the question of characteristics of the offender and make a judgment about that.  I don't know how we decide this for the reason you were just saying: What crimes are more serious than others?  I wonder if it brings into play our jurisprudence on things like the three-strikes law and others where we sort of say: We can't judge how serious crimes are and which ones are more serious than others, and so we leave that to another branch.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But we're talking about--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --if were talking about evolving trends, I think it's fair to say that society's recognition of the seriousness of the crime of rape has evolved even since, the period since Coker.  Now isn't that something that we should take into consideration?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It certainly involved... evolved since the time of Blackstone and even since... as I say, even since Coker.  So while Coker may have thought rape of an adult wasn't serious enough to warrant the death penalty when the legislature had made a contrary determination, perhaps that would be addressed differently if... differently today; and certainly rape of a child would be understood not to be not included in Coker's analysis.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Coker, of course, repeatedly in the statement of the facts and the analysis, repeatedly referred to the victim as an adult woman.  It seems to me the Court was taking... was being very careful to leave open the question of what would be the analysis in the case of a child.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Fisher.  Ms. Clark.     R. Ted Cruz  Correct.  There are two other narrowing... narrowing aggravators that could be applied.  One would be especially heinous or vile rapes.  The aggravated rape that Justice Powell discussed in his Coker opinion, a really brutal case, which both Florida and Georgia have... I would note Petitioner says Patrick Kennedy could not be convicted in any other State.  In Florida and Georgia, if they concluded that his violent rape requiring surgery to correct was especially violent and heinous, he could be convicted in either of those States.  Or, finally, there could be, as in Lowenfield, an aggravator for multiple victims.  Some of the worst of these child rapists rape more than one child.  And so that is another potential aggravator that a State could choose.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Cruz.  Mr. Fisher, we'll give you five minutes.     INTERRUPTING ",07-343X

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  When you have a situation where it is an associational standing case, and an individual is the one that's relied upon give the association standing, in that case is the individual, even though he's not bringing the suit, is he barred by the association's case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about if it is the executive director of the association, and the suit is brought in the name the association, and they lose.  Can he bring suit as, you know, I'm just Joe Blow, but I happen to be the executive director, but I'm bringing this in my own name?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let's say that it is somebody above him, you know, the president of the association, who decides what lawsuits are brought, and he's just the executive director?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But he recommended to the president, said we ought to file this lawsuit.  The president said okay, and they did, and then they lost.  Can he go ahead as an individual?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that means your statement implicates very serious questions of standing under Article III, whether Congress can say create the injury by saying you've been denied records and, therefore, you have standing.  I think that's... I wouldn't go ahead assuming that that was correct.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if you have a situation where a client has retained a law firm to do something and the law firm as part of its normal activity files a FOIA request?  They think something useful is going to come up there, and it's denied, and the law firm on its own, and not as the... not as retained by the company files a FOIA suit?  In that case, is the company bound by the determination in the case?  Or can they then file another action?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, the law firm... the law firm files its own FOIA request, and it is denied, and they litigate that, and then they lose, and the company brings a FOIA action.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But... I guess to be fair to my hypothetical, it was the company that was paying for what the law firm was doing.  It just wasn't the... the filing of the suit.  The law firm went off on it own.  Maybe it does it all the time when they have a case, they think this might be helpful and they are filing a FOIA request.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it purely a formal inquiry?  In other words, let's say the company is paying the law firm to represent, but the law firm just filed in its own name?  Does that make a difference?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's a company--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Let's say some group, say, Public Citizen Litigation Group sends a fundraising thing around saying we think all our members ought to contribute to a special fund so that we can bring a lawsuit under FOIA.  Are all of those individual contributors then bound by the result?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it make as difference if it's one company as opposed to 40 donors?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then in the previous hypothetical there was no authority to represent.  They just said,  ""I think this is a good idea, here's the money. ""  ""Here. ""   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, controls.  So there are three companies, and they each have... you know, they can vote.  They each have 33-percent control.  Are they each bound, or because they didn't control it none of them are bound?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they said, yes, you can represent us, and we're three different companies, and, you know, it's a majority vote as to what you can do.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Although the precise formulation adopted by the court of appeals may be somewhat novel, its holding of a finding of privity here is consistent with well-established principles of res judicata.  Where multiple persons engage in coordinated successive litigation to vindicate a joint interest with respect to which a judgment in favor of any of them will benefit all, then a judgment in the first litigation in which that interest is adequately represented binds the others as well.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Did you make your friend on the other side aware that you'd be--     --Yes.  Yes, I did, Your Honor.  The Schendel case is 270 U.S. 611.  And they discuss Des Moines Valley at page 619.  And what had happened in Des Moines Valley was that the United States had granted some land to the State of Iowa, which in turn passed to the railroad, which in turn sold to one claimant.  There was another person who claimed directly from the United States as a homesteader.  There had been litigation between the person claiming via the railroad and the homesteader as to who had title to the land.  And the judgment in State court was adverse to the homesteader.  And what happened later, about 10 years later, was that the United States brought suit to have declared invalid the title of the person claiming via the railroad.  And the district court actually initially questioned whether the United States had standing to bring the case at all.  They viewed it as Fairchild's case.  That was the homeowner... the homesteader, a little coincidence with this case, which also has a Fairchild.  But the court of appeals specifically said it wasn't deciding whether the United States had standing to bring the case in its own name... the case was litigated by the United States attorney... they looked to the purpose that the United States sought to vindicate.  They said that the United States does not seek to obtain title to this property for itself again.  They are, in a sense, lending their name to allow Fairchild a second bite at the apple.  Now, there was no control that Fairchild had over the United States.  Fairchild didn't direct the United States attorney who was representing the United States.  But the United States had taken up the interest of Fairchild, taking advantage of the fact that it had standing to sue itself--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Even if he's the individual in the club that gave the club standing, associational standing?     --I think in... Your Honor's first question to opposing counsel was such that, yes, I think that if that was the individual whose interest was relied upon to give an association standing, that it would bind the individual whose name and interest was relied on.  And this is in some ways the reverse situation where--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is this an approach that only applies in FOIA cases?  I would assume in every other case you have the normal Article III requirements of injury, which limits exactly who can sue.     --Well, the rule is a broader rule.  And we've pointed out that it has in common with the rule with respect to co-beneficiaries that existed since the 1800s at the very latest, the rule as stated in section 48 of the Restatement, which is an example, a counter-example, Justice Ginsburg, to your question about whether it always had to be a pre-existing legal relationship, because section 48 deals with a particular situation where there are multiple individuals who can claim for personal injury of one of them.  And the section is stated in terms of another person, not a family member.  And the commentary to this section makes clear that although most situations where it would apply would be family members, it also applies to... and I want to quote it:  ""A de facto connection may sometimes suffice as well as a formally valid one. ""  So the law of--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Stetson.     Catherine E. Stetson  --That is right.  That is absolutely right.  The reason that Mr. Taylor is barred is not just because he's asking for these same documents.  These are incredibly unusual documents; they don't have great public appeal; but the reason he's barred is because Mr. Herrick requested his assistance in the repair of the airplane.  Mr. Taylor sought the same documents for exactly the same reason to be used to exactly the same end purpose.  That should... I think... give the Petitioner a great deal of comfort in this regard.  We are not advocating nor is the government, a privity rule that is going to result in the widespread preclusion of FOIA plaintiffs who seeks the same documents for independent reasons; but when someone comes to the Court pressing someone else's interests, that is a square privity issue, and he should be barred.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Stetson.  Ms. Rosenbaum, four minutes.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if two people get together who want the same documents for the same purpose, which is they think they're going to make money off of it.  And they say which ever gets it we'll share with the other and we'll split the money we're going to get?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Separate... separate suits, separate requests, separate suits.  They just want to double their chances of getting the documents, but they agree to split.  They think they're going to make a hundred dollars off of this and agree to split it 50-50, regardless of who wins.   ",07-371X

Roberts, Jr.  So you think there would be... there would be tribal-court jurisdiction in the case I hypothesized?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your case, your entire case, is based on whether or not there's consent to dealing with the tribe by the nonmember?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Well, just like this and there was a choice of forum provision, says, well, you've got to bring this in State court.  I thought there were restrictions on whether or not tribal law can be enforced in State courts.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even if it... well, that's if it's a contract claim.

You have special interrogatories, including number 6 but also number 4 and then they have damages.  And it's not clear whether those damages are based on the finding of liability under 4 or 6.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Who wrote that?  You gave us the benefit of the author of the Ninth Circuit, but not the First.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And, presumably, tribal... whatever tribal precedent there may be, as well.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, neither could... and neither could anybody, right?  I mean if anybody could find it, you could.  It's because it's not published anywhere, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  One of the points you mentioned earlier is that this is an Indian corporation, and that's a concept I don't understand.  If Justices Scalia and Alito form a corporation, is that an Italian corporation?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand the concept of a minority-owned or an Indian-owned corporation, but the point here is you are trying to say that the corporation is a member of the tribe.  And I just don't know.  And I certainly don't think the State, when it incorporated this entity, said: You're a different type of corporation than every other; you're an Indian corporation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How would a normal... I guess a non-Indian or non-Italian or non-Irish... corporation dealing with the Long Family Land and Cattle Company know that it was an Indian corporation--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --putting apart the particulars in this case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I know the BIA says that.  But if you're a bank and somebody comes in and says: I'm a corporation; I would like a loan, is the bank supposed to start asking questions about whether there are Indian shareholders, and how many, and all of that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So they should have a check box on their loan application that says: Are you an Indian?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm asking you about: In a general case, let's say they don't require BIA loan guarantees.  They require, just as in this case, collateral.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I am sure the facts here matter.  I have a hypothetical question.  A bank dealing with an Indian-owned corporation, how are they supposed to find out, or may they find out, whether it's an Indian-owned corporation, particularly when under your approach, when they do form that contract, they are subjecting themselves to tribal-court jurisdiction?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And do they subject themselves to tribal-court jurisdiction because they are dealing with, as you call it, an Indian corporation?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that if the bank had two... two different types of loans, in one situation the corporation comes to the bank.  It is an Indian corporation, if there is such a thing; and the bank deals with it, although it doesn't know that.  In the other situation are the facts, as you suggest here; and the... dealing through the normal, collateral consequences and operations of a contract with a bank, they want to know the collateral, and all of that, that constitutes consent, but a commercial relationship with a member does not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's an odd sort of basis on which to predicate jurisdiction.  We usually... when you're dealing with jurisdiction, we usually look for a bright-line rule.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You said earlier... I am sorry.  You said earlier that this was a straightforward application of Montana?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, given the facts.  But isn't it true that this would be the first case in which we have asserted or allowed Indian tribal jurisdiction to be asserted over a nonmember?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about... what about their point that, under our system, governing is based on the consent of the governed, and in this case the bank has no role to play in the nature or establishment of the court to which they are being subjected?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, and I suppose--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what if the tribal law has certain cultural principles such as fairness and equity of a sort that aren't recognized under Federal or State law in this type of contractual relationship?  Does that preclude the State court from giving comity or not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Frederick.  Mr. Gannon.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you agree with your friend Mr. Frederick that Montana did not address jurisdiction over a nonmember and that this would be the first case in which we'd recognize such jurisdiction?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What happens if the bank deals with a corporation that is not an Indian corporation, and then that... the shareholders of that corporation sell their shares to Indians?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does the bank now have a consensual relationship with an Indian corporation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the only reason... the only reason the bank is on the reservation is because the land was collateral, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They didn't want to buy land on a reservation; they wanted to make a loan and get the interest or whatever, and it just turned out that the Indians defaulted, and therefore they were left with a land on a reservation.  Is that consensual?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if it's a different... the Indian... the corporation is owned by members on the reservation, the collateral they put up is off the reservation, is there consensual dealings with the corporation then?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but the subject of the contract is loan to a corporation owned by Indians on the reservation.  The collateral put up is other land that the corporation owns or the individuals own off the reservation.  Jurisdiction or not.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess, what I meant, what do you mean by the subject of the contract?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about a home equity loan for home on the reservation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your argument relies on the notion that the word ""during"" in the statute is solely temporal.  In other words, it just refers to the time?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So... that's not always the case.  If I say, you know, I hung lights during the holiday season, you wouldn't think that I hung a chandelier, right?  There'd be not simply a temporal connection, but also a relation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is there in the statutes a difference between possession of explosives in this circumstance and possession of firearms?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there any--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Is there any policy limitation within the department not to charge under this provision unless there is a relationship between the underlying felony and the use of... the carrying of explosives?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The ten years, though, is mandatory, correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if a prosecutor asks for it and there is an underlying felony and there is an explosive, that's an additional ten years, no matter what.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you get... the underlying felony is of the sort Justice Scalia was talking about, and let's say the person gets probation on that because, you know, it is the first offense, no harm, he still gets ten years.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but how many cases are there likely to be... this isn't one of them... where you have no ""in relation to"" connection whatsoever?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Or any historical record that you're familiar with.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, in this case, as you point out, there was, of course, a connection.  And I would have thought in most cases where the prosecutor is interested in charging... because, as you have indicated, this case is... there would be an actual connection.  Now, you may have, as you suggest, problems with proof or... or evidence; but, as a practical matter, I'm just wondering how often the question we're concerned about arises.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I mean the interesting thing is that you're... the cases where this is going to arise is not where you're really worried about the explosives; it's going to... because in that case, presumably there is going to be a relation, and you can use it as you used it in this case.  The cases where this is going to be problematic is when you are really interested in the underlying felony.   INTERRUPTING John G.

""  It seems like a high hurdle for you to surmount.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's the Abbott Labs exception, isn't it?  I don't think anybody suggests that that is applicable here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's when his primary conduct is nonetheless going to be affected?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You know, the drug companies have to do something.  Well, they don't -- you know, they have to do it before they can -- they don't have to wait until they are sent to jail to say that their conduct has been affected.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you have not pointed to a particular fact under any of these affidavits when it was applied to any of the plaintiffs.  In what the National Wildlife Federation case said,  ""Some concrete action applying the regulation to the claimant's situation. ""   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You haven't shown any standing with respect to the Burnt Ridge Project on an ongoing basis because that has been settled.  It's outweighed -- it's out the door.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's in for a penny, in for a pound.  If you show standing with respect to discreet action D, you can challenge A, B, and C?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I now have footnote 2, and it refers, as you say, to a particular measure that applies across the board to all individual classifications.  It goes on to say, which is final,  ""and has become ripe for review in the manner we discussed in the text. ""  Then we say, or Justice Scalia says,  ""it can of course be challenged under the APA by a person adversely affected. ""  ""And although that may have the effect when they get a general decision invalidating a program, it says that a quite different from permitting a generic challenge to all aspects of the program as though that itself constituted a final agency action. ""  So you still have to become ripe for review in the manner discussed, which was the sentence that I read to you earlier, and the challenge can only be brought by a person adversely affected.  I don't see how footnote 2 undermines the sentence I have read to you at all.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it says -- it says, if it's become ripe for review in the manner discussed in text.  In other words, if it has been applied to a particular individual adversely affected then, quote,  ""a person adversely affected may bring a challenge. ""  And I don't -- that seems to me to be a restatement of the sentence I read you earlier.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That would be like in footnote 2, the general program.  Yes, they are saying these types of activities we don't do the notice and comment and appeal.  That's the general program.  But you have to wait until it's applied to a particular individual who is adversely affected.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You cut down a tree in the national forest without approval?  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And where is ""there""?  He would like to go back where?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  This isn't one of those after-submitted declarations, is it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, don't we generally not look at after-submitted declarations in determining standing?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you -- if yesterday you submitted a declaration, we would look at that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The later filed, where along the district court proceedings were they filed?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you lose that again, you figure, well, I've got some more -- I can get some more declarations.  The reason we don't look at after-submitted declarations is because there has to be under the normal rule, an end to litigation at a particular time.  It seems to me this would be an endless process.  You know, every time the district court identifies a particular flaw, you would say okay, here's a declaration, and then they say, well, here's another basis, well, here's another declaration.  I'm not sure that that's what our cases sanction.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You filed them after judgment, right?   ",07-463X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that what you do in this case... I mean the person is fired and that's all you know.  And so you go back and see: Well, is there any possible reason?  So you look at the time sheets.  Oh, here are a few days where she punched in late.  That's a possible reason, and that's enough?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So in that case... and then let's say you're at trial, and you ask: Did you fire this person because she punched in late a few times?  I take it that the objection would be that that's irrelevant, and that would be sustained.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  The record shows she was... a few times she punched in late.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you're going to have to articulate it in Federal court.  You emphasize it's a deferential standard, it's not... but every case now... every case of an employee firing, in fact every case of employee not getting as big a raise as he thought he was entitled, that's now a Federal case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But Title VII, there's no... you know, there is no, ""because you don't like me"", it's not because I'm a particular race or--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I'm not worried about a frequent filer.  I'm worried about 40 million single filers.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I ask you more... perhaps a more abstract question about this class-of-one?  Doesn't that have the effect of adding an equal protection claim to every violation of law?  In other words, you have a Fourth Amendment search and seizure claim, and you're treated illegally; you say well, everybody else was treated legally and I wasn't, so it's an equal protection violation?  You get... you know, the zoning ordinance, it was improper under the zoning law, and because everybody else was properly treated, it's a violation of equal protection.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Katyal.  Ms. Metcalf.     Janet A. Metcalf  I think the difference is not that great.  I think, admittedly, the actual rationale is harder to discern in legislative cases, in part, because you have so many decisionmakers.  But here, for example, it is similar because the decisionmakers might have had a number, and probably did have a number, of elements in mind from dislike to a preference for a certain kind of background.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Metcalf.  Ms. Blatt.     Lisa S. Blatt  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are two types of class-of-one claims that should not be recognized in the public-employment context.  The first is a claim of residual ill will or bad-motive complicitor, and the second is a simple demand for a rational basis for an adverse personnel decision.  The problem with those claims is that they would constitutionalize routine employee grievances and impose a for-cause requirement on public employers, notwithstanding the long tradition of at-will public employment.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I agree with all of that, but... so the Equal Protection Clause doesn't apply?   Lisa S. Blatt  Sure, it applies.  It just doesn't give you a right to collect what this plaintiff did: Punitive and compensatory damages based on residual ill will.  She ran an equal-protection claim on race, gender, national origin, sex.  She had a statutory claim for imposing unlawful conduct under Title VII.  The jury rejected all of that and imposed punitive damages, and it went to the jury on a legal question that has always been decided by this Court and the courts about whether there was a rational basis or whether, instead, it was solely based on vindictive, arbitrary, or malicious reasons.  It went to the jury, and there was no allegation that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think the Equal Protection Clause applies--   Lisa S. Blatt  --Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --in any case of public employment... what... that's satisfied?   Lisa S. Blatt  It doesn't... no.  If you have a membership in an identifiable group classification as opposed to purely subjective and individualized criteria.  Here the class was: I was a thorn in my supervisor's side.  That is not a class.  And if it is a class, it would lose, because you would always have a rational basis.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the Equal Protection Clause doesn't balk about classes.  It talks about any person.   Lisa S. Blatt  That's correct, and... and in First Amendment... and that's a different amendment, but in the Fourteenth Amendment there is the Batson context.  It's just... just like in the Batson context, the high cost of litigating every single claim to try to ferret out what would truly be an irrational decision is not worth the cost when there is such an overwhelming likelihood that a truly irrational decision would already be prohibited by some other contract or statutory source.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Blatt.  Mr. Katyal, you have four minutes remaining.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is your answer to their Batson analogy?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but you're adding the class aspect.  If the rationale of the prosecutor is, I don't like this person, under Batson you don't get to bring an equal protection challenge to that.   ",07-474X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but, as your friend points out, the constitutional provision says ""any person"".  It doesn't say any person who is a member of a particular class or any person who is exercising a fundamental right.  It's ""any person"".   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, isn't that an odd system?  I mean, you have... like our time card example, you're going to have litigation over whether she was late for work or was not late for work, and in fact that's got nothing to do with the reasons she was fired at all.  And yet the government puts it out, well, this is a conceivable reason, and then the other side says, no, it's not, and they fight.  It just seems so otherworldly; it has nothing to do with the reason at all.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that's with respect to legislative or regulatory action, where there are important reasons not to inquire into the motives of the legislators.  It's not clear to me that that same rationale applies here.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What exactly is the analytic basis of that?  I mean, do you think that... you don't think the Equal Protection Clause applies at all to this situation where it's just a class of one?  Or do you think that the clause is always... the claim of violation under the clause is always rebutted automatically?  What is the--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Oh, but that's very different, because those cases say that those individuals have no First Amendment rights.  In other words, in the public employee context, talking about their official obligations, there is no First Amendment right to do that.  I think it's quite a different situation to say there is no equal protection right in government employment.   INTERRUPTING ",07-474X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I take it your position is that there's no ambiguity in the way the term is used in the statute, as opposed to no ambiguity in some abstract sense?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  Where -- the plain language dictates the result, where do I see that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If -- if they say that the plain language of the statute dictates a particular result, I say -- I suspect that that's a concession we are in Chevron step one, rather than two.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Pincus.  Mr. Katsas.     Gregory G. Katsas  --Justice Ginsburg, it's true that the Displaced Persons Act was limited to the Nazi regime, and later statutes, the Refugee Act generalizes in the sense of eliminating the time and place restrictions on the definition of refugee.  On the specific question of the persecutor bar, Congress carries forward the same language with an affirmative indication of intent to preserve the concept.  With respect to your point about the Nazis being singularly horrific in human history, think of how that feature plays out under Petitioner's theory.  Under Petitioner's theory, the uniquely horrific nature of the Nazi regime gives rise to a dramatically expanded class of people who can credibly raise a duress defense on anyone under -- anyone under Adolf Hitler in the organization chart of the Nazi government could credibly say, if I didn't kill Jews, I would be killed myself.  The Executive permissibly rejected that construction of things in -- in construing the persecutor bar at issue here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Katsas.  Mr. Pincus, you have four minutes.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do they typically have views on the underlying persecution issue that is at issue?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.  I mean, it is not at all unreasonable, if you have a clash between two ethnic groups in a particular country, that the interpreters are going to have views one way or the other.  They are going to come from one of the groups of one or the other.   INTERRUPTING ",07-499X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where you stopped -- you stopped in the part that interests me,  ""participated in persecution on account of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular group. ""  ""When these people are forced to engage in persecution, it's not because of the victim's race or religion; it's because someone's got a gun at their head. ""  ""So, you ask them. ""  Well, why did you do that?  Why did you, you know, whip that person?  They will say: Because they were going to kill me.  They are not going to say, I -- you know, because I was biased against his race or religion.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, how do you know that?  Why can't it just as easily modify ""incited"", ""participated in""?  You have persecution.  Did they participate in the persecution on account of race; or did they participate, again, in the persecution on account of what the -- what the force exerted against them was?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that just bring you back to what ""assistance"" means.  If you -- normal statutory canon, you have got ""ordered"", ""incited"", ""assisted"".   John G. Roberts, Jr.  ""Assistance"" can be read in the same sense as ordered or incited with terms of an active -- I don't know what it is -- predisposition or desire.  Or it can be read in the manner you suggested, somebody who's just doing it for -- for the paycheck.  So, if we read it in eiusdem generis terms, then I think your response falls short.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that argument is at one extreme, where if this does apply as the way Petitioner suggests we assume the Attorney General can exercise his discretion and not afford relief.  But on the other hand, it could go to some of the horrific examples that Mr. Pincus suggested; and in those circumstances the Attorney General could exercise his discretion to afford relief.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And so too would, I gather, the person who is threatened with harm if he doesn't build the prison walls, right?  He knows they are going to be used to persecute people and hold them in.  I mean, if -- you know, if you push the extreme interpretations they go either way.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does he -- does he persecute people on account of race?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We have a prison here; we are going to hold members of a particular racial group here, and we are going to force you to build the walls.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, speaking of -- to get back to the language, what's wrong with saying, you have a clause that says ""otherwise participated"", right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that must mean, I gather, or could mean that ""assisted"" does not have as broad a meeting as you suggest, because otherwise the ""otherwise participated"" language would be unnecessary and redundant.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm not sure that's right, because if ""otherwise participated"" covers -- ""assisted"" does not include ""otherwise participated"", and I understood your broad reading of ""assisted"" to cover the prison walls, and if it does, then I would say ""assisted"" needs to be interpreted with ""ordered"" and ""incited"", and if it is, then ""otherwise participated"" should be interpreted along the same lines.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think there was just a -- it was a belt-and-suspenders redundancy?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What I may have missed, what was your answer to the prison walls?  The guy who builds the prison walls?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is he or is he not participating in the persecution?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your concession -- statement earlier on, that there are going to be situations for judicial line-drawing--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --And it suggests to me that BIA's discretion isn't applicable here under Chevron step two.  Because what you are saying is this is not a situation where the statute never applies.  In a situation where you can logically determine and your answer on the knowledge question is pertinent, you can logically draw a line between what a person's doing and persecution; and yet you said the courts are going to have to draw lines.  So BIA -- the board might get discretion with respect to where that line is drawn and when, but they do not get discretion on the question of does it ever apply.  And what your position is, that this never applies, whenever there is a but-for logical intention between the action and the persecution.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you would say the woman who cuts the hair does participate in the persecution if there is a guideline that says look, we are not going to execute anybody unless -- before their hair is cut, right?

Roberts, Jr.  Is the wholesale price claim that the Ninth Circuit looked at in -- in the case below, in the decision below, a necessary or significant or partial element of your Brooke Group claim, or is it totally irrelevant?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess it would have been nice, if you thought the case was essentially moot, to hear about that in the cert opposition.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You didn't argue that the decision below was essentially moot in your opposition to certiorari here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Breyer's draft judgment said we would vacate the decision below.  Shouldn't we reverse it, because if we think on the price-squeeze claim, as distinct from the Brooke Group claim, the Ninth Circuit was wrong?  We don't just throw it out and let everybody go home.  We say whether it was right or wrong.  And if we're saying it's wrong, we would reverse.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're saying we don't have to cross the Rubicon because your Brooke Group predatory pricing claim will show that the prices here were below cost?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So we don't have to consider, which I guess I thought we had to consider--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --And you're not going to amend your complaint to raise such a claim on remand?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which you understand to require that the retail prices be below cost?   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Why did the first -- first person in that scenario need a physical copy of the warrant?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, there was something done in this particular case, though, right?  The warrant clerk notified -- was it the Coffee County people?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --that the warrant -- that the information she had given 10 minutes before was inaccurate.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is it going to keep--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --It's a separate question.  It may be an illegal arrest, but the question is the separate one of whether or not you exclude the evidence collected incident to that arrest.  And we have, in several cases, separated the two questions, and I guess it's difficult for me to see if no one has done anything wrong, no one, why you would suppress the evidence in that case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but you have this difficulty: Do we have to get into negligence, or should we assume, as I understand to be your theory, as Justice Breyer put it, that you would still suppress the evidence when no one has done anything wrong?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's just rephrasing it.  It's probable cause based on the existence of a warrant, and it turns out to be there is a mistake in the warrant.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Michael R. Dreeben  --No one knows, Justice Ginsburg, because a great many of these cases will settle out of court, but our brief does provide examples of conduct that was more serious and more egregious than anything involved in this case resulting in situations where courts denied summary judgments to the defendants and ordered the cases to go to trial.  And I'm not suggesting that in a case like this -- may I complete the answer -- there should be a 1983 remedy, but I am suggesting that civil remedies will provide incentives to the police to avoid the bog of litigation by putting into place systems that will prevent this kind of error.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.  Miss Karlan, you have eight minutes remaining.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not the procedures of the police.  The officer is on the stand and you say, all right, you've been here a while, how many times have these warrants turned out to be wrong, just as simple as it was in this case?  And he says, gosh, this is the first time that I've had this question.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Cross-examine people.  These people are under oath, you cross-examine.  You say, I don't think that's right.  How many times?  It's not that big a deal to find out on what basis the arresting officer was acting.   John G.

So how -- how do you tell in 1934 who is under Federal jurisdiction?   INTERRUPTING John G.

But if they were drawing -- if Congress were drawing a sharp line, presumably, it would be based on a sharp distinction; and, yet, as I understand it, there is no real sharp distinction.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  --Indian descent of those in 1934, but not when it's determining -- in other words, you say the Indian descent as of when?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, I see.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you do about United States v. John?  There the Court in describing an Indian, Indian descent, went out of their way to include in brackets the phrase  ""any recognized in 1934 tribe now under Federal jurisdiction? ""   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it -- it may have shown it's ambiguous, but it shows how -- shows how we resolved the ambiguity.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  This is -- we are talking about an extraordinary assertion of power.  The Secretary gets to take land and give it a whole different jurisdictional status apart from State law and all -- wouldn't you normally regard these types of definitions in a restrictive way to limit that power instead of saying whenever he wants to recognize it, then he gets the authority to say this is no longer under Rhode Island jurisdiction; it's now under my jurisdiction?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, how do we know which one of them benefits the Indian?  I mean, have the Indians benefited from Federal jurisdiction in the last 50 years?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What are the plans the Indians have of doing with the land once it's determined to be Indian land subject to trust of the Federal Government?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, of course, the use of that land would not be limited to housing, right?  They could engage in other activities that Indian tribes can engage in, correct?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of course, your friend on the other side says the exact opposite.  It was backward-looking.  They had had the allotment policy, which they decided was not a good idea, and yet, that had resulted in Indian land being turned over to in fee simple, and this is a way to compensate for the discredited allotment policy.  So, if you weren't recognized in 1934, you were not penalized by the allotment policy, so you didn't need the benefit.  I think that backward-looking perspective seems to make perfect sense.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  An Indian -- an Indian community.  Now, if we are looking for a definition of ""Indian"", we go back to the first sentence.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if it does it four times, you ought to give effect to it at least once.  It says  ""Indian tribes now under Federal jurisdiction. ""  It seems to me that that is the key restriction, and that it's not taken away by that last sentence, which again reiterates that it's ""Indian tribe"".  And then in the last clause to which you refer, it's still ""Indians residing on one reservation"".   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's a defined term.   ",07-526X

The whole point of a bright-line rule is that you don't look at the specific facts and it presents a problem here you say the guy is handcuffed and in the back of the car?  Well what if he is just handcuffed but not in the back of the car, what if he is in the back of the car but not handcuffed?  What if there are five people around who might break open the police car and free him?  What if there are three people around?  You have exactly the same case by case inquiry that Belton said we are not going to do.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Was that all pre-Belton?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which one is not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are those all pre-Thornton.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well the point is that in Thornton of course the guy was handcuffed in the back of the police car and we no less applied Belton.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess my question is what is left of the Belton bright-line rule if you prevail.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well now we have got to have a case by case inquiry to determine whether there is actually in that case a threat to officer safety.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Except if you're wrong, stare decisis comes into play only assuming the decision is wrong.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Just not to get back -- Mincey was 1978.  Belton was 1981.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but I'm trying to see -- you cited three cases.  And my question was whether those survived Belton.  Now, were all three of those before Belton?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Just to explore that, that does seem to me to be overruling Belton to the extent Belton adopted a bright-line rule.  What you're saying is, well, in these circumstances Belton applies, and in these circumstances, it doesn't.  But you're overruling Belton when you say there's no longer a bright-line rule.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think after Belton -- you think after Belton, we still have to look and see what's reaching distance on a case-by-case basis?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't understand that part: ""Arguably within the reach"".  I don't understand that to be part of Belton.  I thought that's what Belton did away with, and thought Belton was saying, look, we are going to have a bright-line rule, because we don't want to say he's five feet away, he is not within the reach; two feet away, he is.

You're saying it was lawful at the time to deliberately discriminate on the basis of pregnancy -- Gilbert -- but that that was somehow unlawful if in fact your deliberate discrimination had a disparate impact?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, maybe I'm missing it.  Isn't it a bit unusual to say it's perfectly all right to discriminate intentionally, but if it has a disparate impact, that's not all right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I -- I don't think it's every disparate impact case.  In a disparate impact case, it's because you can't show, typically, deliberate discrimination, so you look at what the impact was.  But I guess I've never heard of a case where it's okay to do something intentionally, but it's illegal -- to discriminate intentionally, but it's illegal if that has a disparate impact.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but Gilbert said it wasn't discrimination on the basis of sex, because it said that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was not discrimination on the basis of sex; and yet you are saying if there is a disparate impact on the basis of pregnancy, then it is discrimination on the basis of sex.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  It seems to me that you're arguing one of two things: First, that there was no error at all under Stromberg; or second, that if there was error, it was harmless error.  And I thought the case was about whether or not the Ninth Circuit erred in concluding that harmless error analysis didn't apply to a Stromberg error.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Shah.       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think the Chief Justice framed the main issue in this case properly.  Consistent with the last two decades of this Court's instructional error jurisprudence, the Court should hold that the type of error at issue is not structural and is subject to harmless error review.  The Ninth Circuit's contrary interpretation of Stromberg creates the untenable result that adding an invalid theory -- adding a valid theory to an invalid one somehow makes the error worse.  Even Respondent now rejects that interpretation.  It follows that this Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit and remand for application of harmless error review under Brecht.  The main issue--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Suppose it's not, in the abstract anyway, necessarily true that this case follows a fortiori, because here, at least you have a valid theory.  That may make it a harder case, because the jury had based its entire verdict on an invalid theory.  It may be more difficult than a situation where you've got a theory of the case that is invalid because a particular element is missing.  And you can look and see whether or not that was harmless or not.     I would disagree, Mr. Chief Justice.  I think there are two possibilities in a case with alternative theories.  One possibility is that the jury relies upon the defective instruction.  For example, there is one element omitted just like the instruction in Neder.  If that's what the jury had done, then this case is no different than Neder, no better, no worse, right.  The other possibility, however, is that the jury relies on the completely valid theory.  If the jury relied on the completely valid theory, then there is even less of a problem than Neder.  There is no problem at all.  So I don't see how the error in this alternative valid theory and defective theory circumstance could be any--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess, though, the point is when you have invalid and valid theories, it would be a little harder than Neder, because they don't have to make any findings under the valid theory.  You know, because you don't just have to fill in a missing piece of the puzzle, as in Neder.  You have to -- they might have been working on an entirely different puzzle.     Well, Your Honor, in almost all conceivable cases there is going to be at least some overlap between -- between the two theories.  And what the -- the reason why that's relevant is because you know that when the jury has returned a general verdict of guilt, they have necessarily found beyond a reasonable doubt that each of those elements has been satisfied.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what we are talking about, in other words, is the application of harmless error, which may or may not be harder in the multiple theory case, and not the question of whether harmless error analysis should be applied.     Yes, Your Honor.  That's going to be completely fact dependent whether it's harder or not.  But I think analytically it's exactly the same as in Neder.   ",07-544X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the error wasn't harmless.  And that's an argument you can make before the Ninth Circuit on remand.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why don't we just take them at their word?  As you say, they are applying the wrong nomenclature.  It would be easy enough for them when they get it back to say, oh, we meant, you know, harmless error under Brecht.  But that seems to me to be at least an open question.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Under Brecht, you have the burden of showing a substantial injurious effect.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think you win under Brecht?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You think the Ninth Circuit, although it didn't use that label, actually applied the Brecht standard?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure.  Well, then it seems to me you agree with your friend that the Brecht standard -- and the government -- that the Brecht standard applies.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And all the fight is over is whether the Ninth Circuit applied that standard or not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why don't we just send it back and ask them?  Say: We can't tell.

Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Phillips.  Mr. Englert.     Roy T. Englert, Jr.  --For very good reasons.  Rule 23 exists to protect absent plaintiffs, something we don't have here, and to protect defendants so that they will know there will be a res judicata effect of the judgment, whether for them or against them, so that they can't be sued by other class members.  They have those protections.  In fact, if you read the blue and yellow briefs in this case, they keep referring in the abstract to the protections of Rule 23, but they don't identify a single concrete protection that they do not have under this system.  Rule 23 is inferior to an action by assignees for collection in every imaginable way.  It's not a superior alternative.  And to say that the existence of Rule 23 means we should throw out a traditional form of action that's been recognized for well over a century would be a very surprising result.  Thank you.   John G.

What's the latest case from this Court that you've got?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you say in your brief that there is no reason for concern about the absence of concrete adverseness.  But I would have thought there was a great deal of reason for concern and that your client doesn't care if he wins or loses.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's all the same to him.  If he wins, he doesn't get to keep the money; if he loses, he loses.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought the question came to us on the assumption that he doesn't retain any of the money.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I thought our cases made clear that that kind of... I forget what we call it... it's a separate interest from the injury that you're alleging in the lawsuit.  You don't allege in the lawsuit that the basis for Article III injury is that you're in this line of work and if the work dries up you're in big trouble.  That wouldn't be enough to support Article III standing.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but then why is the assignee bringing the lawsuit?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  He had no independent injury.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry, we got off the track here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm trying to find out what the assignee's injury is.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And how it's redressed by the receipt of the money.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  The Sierra Club protect... undertakes activities to protect the environment, but that doesn't give it standing in every environmental case to sue.  It needs to show members what the concrete interest and so on.  The fact that your client is in the business of suing on behalf of payphone operators--   John G.

I mean if it makes no difference either way I'd like to preserve significance of Article III as a limit on court jurisdiction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, Article III does trump tradition.  I mean, if it doesn't meet Article III, no amount of tradition can save it.  And you several times refer, when asked one of these questions, to the tradition and the old cases, but I haven't heard an answer yet to the concrete injury that is suffered by the aggregators.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In all of those cases, the class action, the trustee, you know, the named plaintiff, the named trustee has concrete injury and redressability to themselves?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Very much more than your clients.  The trustee has legal obligations that he has to discharge.  If it's a suit that he has to bring on behalf of the beneficiaries and doesn't do it, he is sued for breach of trust.

David C. Frederick  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It will not surprise you that my first question is, why did the United States not address the express pre-emption argument and, second, what is the position of the United States on the express pre-emption argument?     --Your Honor, the United States did not participate on the question of the scope of the express pre-emption provision in Cipollone, and to a large extent the express pre-emption question in this case is what was the meaning of the decision in Cipollone.  And so that is of less interest to the United States than certainly the second question presented, which has to do with the FTC's own authority and its exercise of that authority.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  All right.  Well, that's why you didn't address it.  Now, what is the position of the United States?  It's a statute that is directed to an area in which the Federal Government has an extensive interest in regulation, and I would have thought there'd be a position on that.  It is logically antecedent to the implied pre-emption.  You would consider whether there is express pre-emption before implied pre-emption.     Your Honor, the United States has not taken a position on the bottom line of the first question presented.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's not anymore.  I understood -- I understood Mr. Olson to give up on implied pre-emption in his opening argument.     Well, I--   John G.

But we also address a question that is common to the two questions presented, and that is an argument that the Petitioners make with respect to implied pre-emption, but they also make it with respect to express pre-emption, and that is -- and, Justice Ginsburg--   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  How is that consistent with what the Court said in the Riegel case where they said, and I'll quote:  ""We have held that a provision pre-empting State requirements pre-empted common law duties? ""  That's no suggestion that this is a distinction between a focused common law duty, which would be unusual anyway, and general common law duty.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You say Riegel wasn't referring to the particular text of any statue.  It was making a general point.  The Court said: We have held that a provision pre-empting State requirements, which is exactly what this one does, pre-empted common law duties.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So as a general proposition -- I understand your position to be that this particular statute doesn't pre-empt the common law duties, but the distinction I thought you articulated in response to Justice Alito's question was that general common law duties are not pre-empted; specific tailored ones are.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You agree that a general common law duty can be pre-empted by a particular statute?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you're -- so you're saying that we should -- the difference in your case is that the language here is narrower.  It says  ""no statement relating to smoking or health. ""  I don't see how that language is narrower.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So 1334(b) says  ""no requirement or prohibition with respect to. ""  Isn't that just as broad?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do you tell -- how do you tell whether it's deceptive or not if you don't look at what the relationship is between smoking and health?

You have to know what the relationship is between smoking and health to determine whether that's deceptive.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's the relationship between smoking and health.

You would say if you're going to work for me, you've got to arbitrate, and that could be negotiated, theoretically, with individual employee.  And -- I mean, the whole point, the whole benefit of collective bargaining is that that doesn't happen.  You say, well, the employer has a lot of leverage if he wants to insist upon that, but it would not -- it would be a matter for negotiation between the individual and the company.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, isn't that kind of conflict always present whenever you have collective action?  I mean, you may be a particularly good worker and could demand a higher wage than the union has negotiated, but you're still bound by the collective bargaining agreement.  That happens in every situation where you have collective action.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they don't have to be vindicated in particular ways.  The individuals can agree to arbitrate these claims, and they would be -- the arbitration would be binding.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they may go the other way.  They may say: Look, we don't like to arbitrate.  In fact, the arbitration is a great benefit to workers because it's very expensive to bring these claims, even with the prospect of recovering fees.  Most of them like the idea that the union is going to stand up for them and take it to management, but they could say: Look, we don't want it.  If -- if you are discriminated against, you know, sue us.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But under my scenario, the employer wouldn't have to pay for arbitration.  There would be -- there would be no arbitration at all.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  There is no arbitration.  The employer says: Look, I don't think I discriminate.  I've got a good record.  I'm not going to agree to arbitrate claims.  I'm going to make people go to court because there will be fewer claims brought.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I mean, my point is that there are benefits to employees from arbitration as well.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the employer may not agree to it.  If he doesn't have any protection, if it doesn't buy him anything, if employees can still go to court, what's the -- what's the point?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Frederick.  Mr. Gannon.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You -- you focus on the fact that Congress has given an individual right, but for the many matters that you say are the subject of collective bargaining, you don't need a statute.  I don't need a statute to negotiate with someone whether I get paid $20 an hour or $15 an hour for a particular job.  And, yet, that is something that you give up when you join the union, and you are subject to collective bargaining.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why isn't it -- why isn't it the same with these statutory rights?  Why aren't they subject to collective bargaining as well?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  I am -- the forum -- the forum for asserting the right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why would any employer want to agree to arbitration under this system?  He gets nothing from it.  You said you get to -- to arbitrate except when you don't arbitrate.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That just begs the question that your interpretation of Gardner-Denver is correct.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your position -- so your position is going to hurt most employees, because assuming that the employer wants to arbitrate, the union gets something in return for agreeing to that.  I don't know what it is, another 50 cents an hour, if you agree to arbitrate all these claims.  Well, you don't get that anymore, because an employer is not going to agree to arbitrate if it -- if the employees don't have to arbitrate.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the employees have no -- no leverage.

Does that still have the same force today when the broadcast medium is only one of several that are -- that are available?

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General Garre.  Mr. Phillips.     Carter G. Phillips  Justice Scalia, the language of the statute itself would suggest that, because the statute says that the Commission may find violate -- may impose certain enforcement actions for people who violate section 1464.  That, of course, is a criminal statute.  Therefore, it is not a statute that has been delegated to the agency's broad discretion to decide what falls within that language.  It is within the agency's discretion to choose a penalty that, in fact, enforces that criminal dictate.  And to go back to Justice Stevens's position -- I shouldn't give it as your position, it is my position -- but the point, I think, we were discussing, if you have a choice of two ways to read indecency, you have to read it in a way more favorable to the defendant, that precludes the approach that the government has taken in this particular case.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  The reason there is a change is they looked at it and they decided it was wrong.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You agree it's enough of a justification for the change that they think the other policy was wrong?  They don't have to say circumstances have changed, the facts are different; it's enough to say,  ""well, whatever the Commission used to thing, we think differently? ""   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And then explain why.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's not the Commission's position.  The Commission's position here is not when these words were used, people necessarily thought of a literal meaning; instead, its position is that the reason these words shocked is because of its association with the literal meaning.  That's a different question than what was being addressed in Cohen.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Then why -- why do you think the F-Word has shocking value or emphasis or force?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because it is associated with sexual or excretory activity.  That's what gives it its -- its force.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is that consistent with Vermont Yankee?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, you are saying that we add to the APA when we are dealing with a particular area.  Which of our cases--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Which of our cases supports that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, maybe sometime--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --to be in a position to argue your constitutional issue, but we can't assume that you are right on the Constitution in applying the APA.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, when you talk about the rule of lenity, I mean, the point is that this change -- if there is a change in policy or whether it's adequately explained -- simply gets you in the door.  They say then, once you are there, we just look at all of the circumstances and the context.  So, we don't -- it seems to me in their enforcement decisions, their decision not to impose sanctions, their decision not to have this count against you in future proceedings, they are being very lenient.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And this is where the context comes in.  At least with impressionable children, that's dramatically different from saying here is an awards show, here is a celebrity, I want to listen to what they are going to say because I listen to their music, and he comes out with that, as opposed to a football game.  They know that, you know, somebody says a bad word in the middle of the interview.  The context makes all the difference in the world.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They perceive that.  They know.  I mean, it's one thing to use the word in, say, Saving Private Ryan, when your arm gets blown off.  It's another thing to do it when you are standing up at an awards ceremony.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why -- the young football player is not a celebrity that they follow.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The point is whether they are or not is the contextual determination that the FCC can undertake.  All they are saying is that just because it's used once doesn't mean you are out of the -- out of the woods altogether.  Let's look at it, and if it turns out there's no -- I mean, this is the point they make, that in one context, it's completely gratuitous; in the other context, it's not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Then why do your clients not use these words between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why do you think it affects audience share?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you can take that into consideration, why can't the FCC make the same determination, that there may be some people offended by this, and if there are some people, as part of our statutory responsibility, we are going to look at it.  Not that they automatically impose--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Not that they automatically impose a sanction, but that they're going to look at it.   ",07-582X

Roberts, Jr.  Just to get back to your television hypothetical, if you told somebody that you were going to buy the best TV available, nobody would think you meant that, you know, you were going to buy a very cheap TV because, considering the costs and benefits, that was the best one.  They would think you are going to get, you know, the fanciest TV you could.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Mahoney.     INTERRUPTING John G.

I thought that was exactly what they did.  They said for different locations, different technologies may be the best available.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, your argument is focused on proving that your interpretation won't lead to insane results, as you put it.  But you've got to do a lot more than that.  I mean, you have to establish that this is not ambiguous language.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if you get to that, money in the bank, does this mean that best technology available changes over time?  I mean, maybe the industry could have borne these costs two years ago, but they probably can't today.  Nobody has money in the bank today.  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think they could have said, two years ago, this is what you have to do, but today they would say you don't have to do that anymore--   INTERRUPTING John G.

So if you had a supervisor who runs the cocaine testing lab and he is the one whose report is submitted, I take it he is the one who would have to show up.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  No, I'm saying that he would testify, I guess: I run the lab, these are the people I hire, they know you how to do these tests, and this guy did the test.  And since he was the one that the Government decided to -- on whose affidavit they decided to rely, that's the only person you could get.  Now, you could -- to impeach him, you say, well, did you do the test?  But you say, well -- but I mean you don't have a right to an analyst at a particular level.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, a good defense lawyer would love to have the guy there.  The first thing you say is: Do you remember testing Mr. Diaz's sample?  The guy is going to say no.  Just as was pointed out, I, you know, test thousands of samples.  Well, how long have you been working with the lab?  You know, just what -- what was your scientific background?  When did you -- how does this test work?  You put three drops of the acid in there.  It turns color, whatever it does.  How do you know that?  What is the chemical?  I mean, you spend three hours with the guy until the jury just doesn't think there is anything to the case at all.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're talking about the defendants or the lawyers?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do we know that this was prepared in contemplation of litigation?  I mean, let's suppose the lab occasionally does analyses for other -- research purposes.  They get a sample, they want to know what it's -- they want to test it, however they do it.  Are we just assuming that it's prepared in contemplation of litigation because it usually is, or -- you can imagine a situation where the analyst really has no idea, other than perhaps supposition, why he is being asked to test the sample.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the question is it could be law enforcement purposes to test it for the police to use and educational programs that want the rookies to know what the cocaine looks like.

Now why isn't that a suggestion that there is some leeway and subjective interpretation, and you might have different analysts coming out differently and so you need to get the fellow there and ask him well, how often do you -- how often do one of your fellow analysts disagree with your conclusion?  Or this is subjective; I guess some people read it one way or the other one way; which way do you always read it?  That kind of stuff.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I didn't -- I didn't go back and read the scientific treatise you cite, but you say some interpretation is required.  So what type of interpretation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think California did not join the amicus brief.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if it's the central issue in the case?  The defense says,  ""That stuff I was carrying was not cocaine. ""  ""Either I was trying -- you know, I was going to stiff the person I was selling it to or whatever. ""  That's the sole defense.  That's not cocaine.  All you've got to do is submit an affidavit from the lab guy saying,  ""I tested it; it is? ""   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.  Ms. Schertler.     John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they could have agreed that they have a bank account somewhere and any amounts would be set off by that.  That wouldn't make that bank account at issue with respect to their claim.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it doesn't matter that Iran recognizes that this would be used to set off a judgment it might obtain, because you just said, well they could -- a bank account could be used to set it off and that's not sufficient.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's the -- that's the only basis for your argument?  I thought it was a broader suggestion that these are, to some extent, substitute assets for the assets that are at issue?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can you -- can you articulate a general test in a sentence or two about how you decide whether particular assets are at issue?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Bederman.  Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States does not appear here today in support of Iran, but, rather, in defense of critical interests of the United States before the United States -- Iran Claims Tribunal.  In particular, the holding of the Court of Appeals that the United States never unblocked Iranian military assets after the Algiers accords is directly contrary to the position of the United States before the Tribunal, and Iran immediately indicated that it would use that holding against the United States and in support of its multimillion-dollar--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it's not our job to help you -- it's not our job to help you in other tribunals.  If a -- if a judgment is moot, it's moot.  We are not going to go back and tell the Ninth Circuit to revise its opinion just because that's helpful to you.     --No.  The -- the Court would vacate the decision, certainly.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So is it your position that that -- that is moot?     It is our position that the -- because Respondent has relinquished his right to attach these assets, the decision of the court of appeals should be vacated.  And that would have the affect of rendering inoperative that erroneous -- the other erroneous holding of the court of appeals with respect to blocked assets.  It is the position of the United States -- and we agree with Respondent on this point -- that as of now, because of the October, 2007, designation, the property of Petitioner is blocked and subject to attachment under TRIA.  And I don't believe there is any need for further proceedings on that.  The Secretary of State designated the Ministry of Defense of Iran, and the position of Petitioner in the court of appeals on remand from this Court was that it is the Ministry of Defense of Iran, a central core constituent part of the Iranian state, that is the entity that was designated.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So why isn't the consequence that you are so worried about under the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act that this is going to hurt your position by the tribunal, the same consequence that is going to come from the fact that these assets are blocked?     Well, Your Honor, again, the blocking order is the present status of the assets.  It doesn't mean that they could not later be repatriated to Petitioner; whereas, execution by Respondent against the assets would mean that they would be forever denied to Petitioner.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I guess this may be the same question Justice Breyer asked.  I mean, where do you cut this off?  You've got the proceeds from the sale to Canada that presumably go to Cubic, and then Cubic, you know, builds a new facility somewhere with those proceeds and then sells it to somebody else.  I mean, are those still assets at issue in the claims before the tribunal?     --Well, I believe that in fact the language of the statute makes it -- the assertions of the parties before the tribunal that define the property that is at issue before the tribunal.  That, again, is so that the courts are not put in a position of adjudicating, prejudging, the merits of the parties' arguments before the tribunal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's kind of a -- that's a broad assertion.  In other words, so long as you and Iran get together and say this asset is at issue in a situation where whether it's at issue or not saves you money and gives money to Iran, that seems to be a very self-serving legal test.     Well, Your Honor, I don't believe that this Court needs to consider what the outer reaches are.  In this case, this is -- Iran characterizes it, and this is at page, again, at page 85 of the U.S. appendix, that the Cubic judgment, quote  ""constitutes an integral part of the remedy sought in case B/61. ""  This isn't an offset or a counterclaim.  Justice Ginsburg, you previously alluded to the fact the United States did not file a counterclaim.  And that's because this is not some unrelated counterclaim the United States has against Iran.  This is a critical part of Iran's claim against the United States.  It defeats, in the view of the United States, Iran's claim entirely.  At the very least, it reduces the amount of Iran's claim against the United States.  This isn't somehow unrelated; we're asserting, well, we can use this as an offset because you also owe us money from something else.  This is in Iran's own statement, and this is the statement that you--   ",07-615X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that if you had these military assets, which are clearly the assets that are at issue in Iran's claim--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Cubic is worried about what to do with it and so they sell them to the Canadians but they keep the proceeds in escrow, under the theory that look we may end up owing this to the Iranians under the tribunal.  Under the setoff, this may not be our assets, which -- I mean the Iranians have a claim to these.  Would those -- would those escrow funds be assets at issue?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why is that very different from this situation, where you have an arbitration award saying that you, Cubic, owe the equivalent of what you should have -- what you would have provided to Iran, if there hadn't been the revolution?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The agreement between who -- between who--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --So Iran, I assume, would say, look, we entered into this agreement to take the place of what was at dispute.  Which is what they owed us because they didn't ship us the arms that we paid for.  I don't see that that adds anything to your argument.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right, so Iran says, look, you are not going to ship us the planes, whatever it is, you are not--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --You were not going to give us the money, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And we still have a dispute.  So, I tell you what, you are going to sell this stuff to Canada, you are going to get some money from them, and we have got an agreement that that money is ours.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why would Cubic enter into a contract with Iran to give them money if it wasn't taking the place of the money they owed them in the original agreement?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you know why it was pending for ten years?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the stayed because it was at issue before the Iranian claims tribunal?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the point is, depending on how it comes out, once you give a argument to the Iranians that they can raise with the claims tribunal that will affect far more than your one single case.  We -- the argument would be the United States is not living up to the obligations it undertook in the Algiers Accords.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What provision -- can you cite me the provision where the Congress said put your thumb on the scale?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  11a.  And how does that -- the title of the section says statutory construction.  I just don't see what follows as statutory construction.   INTERRUPTING John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry; six weeks before what?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but how does the plan know that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the plan terms say that if you want to change the beneficiary, here's how you've got to change the beneficiary; and we are going to pay the beneficiary until it's changed.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I would have thought your friend on the other side would be quoting that language.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's -- that's a bit of a stretch, isn't it?  It says no beneficiary designation is in effect.  If you look at the plan, he's got a beneficiary designation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's in the opinion of the company.  That sounds -- and this is a plan -- as we've said often in ERISA cases, we want to enforce these according to the terms of the plan because the companies don't have to set these up at all.  So it makes perfect sense for the company to say, well, if we think this, then we can do this.  So, in other words, there's a doubt and we don't want to give it to somebody who might not end up being the person, but if we don't think there's a doubt, that's it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, of course you only think the Solicitor General is right so far to a certain extent.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Then you throw them under the train because you don't -- you certainly don't think they are correct by saying, look, the only way you can do this is by modifying the plan.  I still don't know how the plan administrator is supposed to know that the person whose name appears on the plan documents, which the plan participant can change at any time, isn't the person that they are supposed to send the benefits to.  Now, you tell me here they knew about the divorce and all that stuff.  Maybe, maybe not.  But we are trying to develop a rule for all cases and it seems to me the easiest, most administrable rule is to say whoever's name appears there gets the money, and if they are not supposed to because of some collateral dispute, well, they can sort that out in litigation.  Maybe Kari has a suit against Mrs. Kennedy or her estate, but that's not a matter for the plan to worry about.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I must have missed -- where did Watergate come from.  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Kruger.     Leondra R. Kruger  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit decided this case on the grounds that ERISA's anti-alienation provision forbids a divorcing spouse from relinquishing an interest in his or her ex-spouse's pension plan benefits unless the waiver takes the form of a qualified domestic relations order.  We agree with Petitioner that the Fifth Circuit misinterpreted both the anti-alienation provision and the QDRO exception to that provision.  But we disagree with Petitioner's further submission that merely because ERISA does not forbid waivers in the divorce context or otherwise, that a plan administrator may be required as a matter of Federal common law to recognize such waivers even when those waivers conflict with the beneficiary designation the plan administrator has on file.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Am I right in understanding that there is a fairly sharp circuit split on that question, even that majority of the circuits are contrary to the Government's position?   Leondra R. Kruger  --That is correct.  There is a circuit split on the question as was raised in the petition for certiorari, and the Second and Sixth Circuits are the circuits that have to date agreed with the position that we are espousing here: That the plan documents control and preclude formulation of a Federal common law rule of the sort that Petitioner proposes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And which circuits are on the other side?   Leondra R. Kruger  There are a number of them including the Fifth, the Seventh, the Third.  The reason why the plan documents rule is so important in this case is because it serves important statutory interests in certainty, certainty of the parties as well as certainty of the administrators.  And it is clear; it is easy to apply; it makes it possible for administrators to do their jobs without fear of further litigation in case they happen to make what a court may later in the proceedings determine is the wrong choice.  For that reason, we think that ERISA is clear, and that it doesn't permit the kind of Federal common law rule that Petitioner proposes, which is one that would essentially revise the statute to override the plan documents rule and would require substantial burdens on the plan and would yield uncertainty for the parties.  For that reason we would ask the Court to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on alternative grounds or, alternatively, it should remand for further proceedings.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Levy.     Mark Irving Levy  Once she is a nonspouse she is no longer entitled to those benefits under ERISA section 1055.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Furlow, you have three minutes remaining.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  They look at it and say, is this a QDRO?  And if no, then they go back to the other provision, I guess on page 21a in the red brief, and say: If it's not a QDRO, ignore it.   INTERRUPTING ",07-636X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  But is that a case in which the question the court decided was presented in the petition, the court said we are not going to take that question then they decided it on that ground anyway.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess you agree that it's a question of which the circuits have split, so presumably there are good arguments on both sides, and it's one that your friend hasn't had a full opportunity to brief here.  So we'd have to be pretty confident of the answer, I think, to go ahead and decide it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why -- why do they have to worry about that?  The simplest thing is for the participant to change the designation, and if there's a divorce, the divorcee is no longer a spouse under the terms of the plan, so he is free to do that.  It seems odd to me that they have this elaborate QDRO provision when it shouldn't be necessary.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But another alternative is that all you can -- you can cross out this name and put in another, or you can go to court, get this, qualify it as a QDRO, file it with the plan.  I mean, why would anybody do that?   ",07-636X

Or do we have to put any president who wants to be on Mount Rushmore?  How do you answer those?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, it's frozen into time.  Everything up until now is okay, but anything going forward is not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I thought you said the Government can accept what's there and say that's our speech.  But you're challenging the ability to do that going forward.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it does all the time.  The -- you don't get equal time -- the cigarette companies don't get equal time because the Government says the Surgeon General has determined it is bad for your health.  It always suppresses alternative viewpoints.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does it depend on -- given the focus on public perception, does it depend on the content of the speech?  In other words, if you came across a monument and it said,  ""The Eagles are a lot better than every other organization, you should give money to the Eagles. ""  someone is going to walk by that and say,  ""Well, that's probably not the City, that's probably the Eagles. ""  But the Eagles, you know, for all the good they do, did not come up with the Ten Commandments, and somebody is going to look at that and say, ""That's probably the City"".

Roberts, Jr.  How can you say that this brings us closer to a situation where race will not matter when it expands the number of situations in which redistricting authorities have to consider race?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It seems to me to be a criticism of the majority-minority district approach in the first place.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about influence districts?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you move -- you've moved from majority-minority to crossover districts.  Should you continue to move to so-called influence districts?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I would have thought the possibility of coalition districts would be evidence that the Voting Rights Act has succeeded, rather than evidence that you need to apply it more broadly.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I mean, the obvious question when you say 15 to 30 percent is what number of crossover voters would you say demonstrates that you no longer need to consider race in shifting a coalition district?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of course, it could be 70 percent that don't vote for a particular candidate.  At some point you have to conclude that it's based on the candidate rather than on race.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is the answer?  What percentage of crossover voting would make this not actionable under section 2?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you don't have an answer to Justice Alito's question?  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Under your theory, it would be possible to challenge a majority-minority district on the ground that you could draw a different coalition district, maybe more than one coalition district.  Let's put it that way.  If you could draw a majority-minority district and you could draw two crossover districts, does the Voting Rights Act impose a limit on the choice?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's an easy -- I suspect that's a common hypothetical.  You could draw a district with 80 percent minority voters or you could have, as you have here, two 40 percent districts.  And the Voting Rights Act requires what?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We are fighting over -- the district that you want to draw, the crossover district, would have 39 percent African-American voters.  The district that complied with State law of the county line would have 35 percent.  Where the assumption is that you have a significant degree of crossover voting, is that really a difference worth changing the Voting Rights Act jurisprudence for?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you mean by ""workable""?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because it's 4 percent less than the district you propose?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it gets back to the Justice Scalia's point--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --that this is designed to protect incumbents.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Browning.  Mr. Thurman.     Daryl Joseffer  Right.  Another thing there seems to be a common misconception that our view of section 2 prohibits the drafting of crossover districts, which is not case of all.  The question here is what if they are required.  If a district -- if a jurisdiction wants to draw a crossover district, then at least in principle nothing is stopping it from doing so.  However, if what you were to do was require the drawing these crossover districts, that could create some funny maps of its own, because if you have to reach out to grab jurisdiction wide, look at every significant pocket of minority voters, look at whatever you could put together that would vote alike, which as a practical matter is the same political party, then you are going to be requiring the same dynamics that led to those very strange maps in the -- in the first place.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why in the -- why in the world would you stipulate to bloc voting in a situation where you have nearly 20 percent crossover voting?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it seems to me you have complicated situations on a rather critical point, what seems to me a basic conundrum, how can you have bloc voting and at the same time have significant crossover voting?  You take one of those off the table, it's kind of hard to address the basic issue in the case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Joseffer?     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you have a view on how we should approach the stipulation adopted below?   INTERRUPTING ",07-689X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, because the Fourth Amendment principle of consent was well established?  In other words, if a police officer goes to the door and says ""May I come in"", that is -- that is perfectly acceptable.  Is that -- that the level of generality that you think we ought to analyze this issue at?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, in every -- given the posture of the ultimate issue in this case on the underlying constitutional question, you do not have to prove that you are right; isn't that correct?  You have to establish that the contrary principle is not clearly established?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Stewart.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why isn't it -- why isn't it an advisory opinion, if we do not have to decide -- to decide the ultimate question whether this is constitutional or not, but simply whether or not it was clearly established whether it was unconstitutional?  Why isn't it purely an advisory opinion to say whether it's constitutional or not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  Those are different grounds, it seems to me.  Those are two independent, as you said.  Here it's kind of a -- it's a progression.  You first ask, either, under somebody's view, I guess, Saucier, whether or not it's constitutional or not and then whether it's clearly established.  I just don't know why the first question isn't purely advisory, because you don't have to know whether it's constitutional or not.   INTERRUPTING ",07-751X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  YOU -- was Mr. Stewart correct that you concede that if this person entering the house were in fact a police officer, that this would have been okay?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's a tough -- at least I find it a very difficult question.  I do not find it necessarily a terribly difficult question whether that -- whatever the answer is -- whether it was clearly established, precisely because I find the underlying questions difficult.  So you have a handful Court of Appeals decisions, you have got a factual variation; the issue is whether to extend the police coming in to a confidential informant, all of those questions are very difficult; but precisely because they are, it doesn't seem that the rule, whichever rule is adopted, is clearly established.  Why don't -- and yet if I were on the lower court of appeals, you would say -- or Saucier would say, I have got to decide that very difficult constitutional question and then decide what's a very easy qualified immunity question.  Does that -- why does that make sense?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I know you don't because you are arguing one side of it.  [Laughter]  But concede for purposes of argument that it is a difficult question.  Why don't we just tell the lower courts -- we do it, we go right ahead to the qualified immunity question by not granting cert on one.  Why shouldn't the lower courts have the same luxury?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why, because we need to provide guidance on that question?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, do you think it can't come up any other way?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Or a -- or a suit against the political subdivision, right?  You could have sued some other political entity other than the officers individually, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that was my question.  There are other ways for the law to develop.  The issue can come up on merits in the suit against the municipality which doesn't raise the qualified immunity question.  If you come up -- if you have a search where a person sues to get whatever was seized back.  You know, if there's a -- and also the option is, if the question of which order want to proceed is optional, the law can develop if the courts for good and sufficient reason decide to reach the constitutional question first.  I -- I'm just wondering what benefit there is in an absolute rigid rule that courts of appeals -- I had a few of these cases in courts of appeals; I thought it was very odd that I had to go and decide a difficult constitutional issue and then not worry about it because in one sentence you say well, but the issue is not clearly established and so it's qualified immunity.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but my point though is that at least in my experience it was unworkable, or at least frustrating, in that we had to decide not just a factual question but a constitutional question in a context where it wasn't necessary.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Doesn't the fact that there is a circuit split almost by definition mean that it's not clearly established?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If the Tenth Circuit says this is not allowed, and every other circuit since the Tenth Circuit's decision has held that it is, is that clearly established that it's not allowed in the Tenth Circuit?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Then it is irrelevant.  Then it is irrelevant that ten other circuits have decided it differently.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, right, but do the police officers get to decide that?  Do they get to decide that not only Judge Posner thinks this, but ten other circuits think this, and it has been five years since the Tenth Circuit.  I mean, do they have to go through that type of analysis?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do any of the other cases involve -- the other circuit cases involve confidential informants as opposed to police officers?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So at the time every circuit other than the -- you know, if there is a police officer and a confidential informant, I think that could be considered a police officer because he is going to call the police in -- every court of appeals decision involving a confidential informant said it was okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And in those circuits, did the court focus on the distinction between the police officer and the confidential informant?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you believe that -- what is the appropriate level of generality to look at in addressing this question, a case involving a confidential informant?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why isn't it that the issue hasn't come up, this question of a confidential informant is one that hasn't come up?  Why would we say that is presumptively unconstitutional?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but then he is going to get sued.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do you decide whether the confidential informant should be considered an employee of the police?  Let's say this is the tenth undercover operation he has engaged in.  They give him $100 after every undercover operation.  I mean, is he an employee of the police department?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why doesn't -- that doesn't make him an agent of the police?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  He wasn't acting on his own.  He was acting for the police.  He didn't decide I'm going to do this and -- because you know, I want to do it, and it just so happens the police are involved as well.   INTERRUPTING ",07-751X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you think it was right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It doesn't -- your point is that it doesn't go to the ""aiding"" issue.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But even, again, I think you are taking on too high a burden.  You don't have to show that the jury properly understood it.  You don't even have to show that it's reasonable.  You have to show the opposite -- or your friend has to show the opposite, that there is no way that the jury could have understood this correctly or applied the correct constitutional law.  That is, if there is a way, then it's -- it's not objectively unreasonable.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Fisher.     Jeffrey L. Fisher  Thank you very much.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Collins, you have four minutes.     INTERRUPTING ",07-772X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well -- but is that the standard?  You said there is -- they are saying that it's not reasonably likely, but that's not the standard.  They have -- you have to show that it's objectively unreasonable to show that the -- to assume that the State got it correct.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You might be able to and you might -- as I understood you to say earlier, you could read it one way or you could say it another way.  And if that's the case, it's hard to say that reading it one way is objectively unreasonable when the State court reads it that way.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it is not objectively unreasonable for the State to instruct jurors as they did?  If that's all you had, then that would be the point.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't think that your reading of question three is definitive.  I think it's like the instruction, the jury could read it one of two ways.  If you look at question three, the issue could be whether others could have had an intent, in other words, others in the group, not simply -- it doesn't show that the accomplice doesn't have to have the requisite intent.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's not the question.  There are a number of areas, and I think the first two questions point in the opposite direction.  They do not say we don't know whether it's ""the crime"" or ""a crime"".  Their questions, neither one, two or three focus on that.  It's a more general question that we could read the opposite way.  Perhaps you can read it the way you are, even though it doesn't say is it ""the crime"" or ""a crime"".  But there again, I think it's incorrect to say it's quite clear that the question -- and certainly not questions one and two, I mean question three is your strongest one -- but it's still not clear that they are focusing on the ""the/a"" issue.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, AEDPA of course requires that this be an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law.  What is the clearly established Federal law that was unreasonably applied?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that's articulated at a fairly general level.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In Yarborough, we've said that the more general the rule, the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in a case-by-case determination.  So you have a very general rule, and to find an unreasonable application, the court has broad leeway because it is a general rule.  And you've already said that the instruction does not establish unreasonable application.  Given that, isn't it pertinent, although people have objected -- you've objected to the idea that, well, all they did was send them back with the instruction.  So they sent them back with something that you said could be reasonably interpreted correctly.  So why isn't that -- why doesn't that -- given the leeway the State court has because this is a general rule, why isn't that sufficient to refute the idea of unreasonable objective?  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You've already said that the instruction doesn't get you there.  And I just heard you say that, with respect to the questions, we can dispute what the jury was asking.  So it's hard for me to see where you get the objectively unreasonableness if you can read the instruction correctly, if it's -- if you can't tell what the jury was asking, you don't know that they were reflecting the confusion you have here.  So is all you're left with the prosecutor's statements?   INTERRUPTING ",07-772X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  That simply means that you can't bring an action in Federal court because the agreement says you can't.  The agreement says you've got to arbitrate.  So if you throw the agreement out save for such agreement, the question is whether or not you could then bring the action in Federal court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  This is a tough -- it's a tough sell.  When you say ""save for such agreement"", which I agree with Justice Stevens seems to me you've put the agreement aside and then you say right away then you look at the agreement to see if there is Federal jurisdiction and only the agreement, not through that.  So you're throwing it out and then you bring it right back in.  It seems--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Of the arbitration agreement?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  And I guess it's -- I mean, you say if it said save for the historic doctrine of ouster, then it would be easy to say, and then you look at the arbitration agreement.  But it says ""save for such agreement"" and then you look at the agreement.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you do think -- you do think we should look through to determine diversity and the amount in question?  In other words, not in the Federal-question context, but if it's diversity, you say we do look through the arbitration agreement.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I hold up just a second to make sure I understand it.  You are saying that, let's say, Person A has an arbitration agreement that implicates Persons B and C.  C is diverse, but B is not.  They could decide to compel arbitration with respect to B and leave C out of it.  But if you follow the look-through doctrine, you would say, well, the dispute is between A and B and C; and so you would be depriving A of their right to frame their own complaint in a way that doesn't create Federal jurisdiction.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of course, I suppose how that works depends on what the rules are about how you frame the dispute once you do look through.  I mean, if there is a pending State suit between A and B, even though C may -- you could have sued C as well, I mean the judge can say, well, I am only going to look through to what the -- the actual litigation is; and if I look at that, that's not a Federal case.  And -- and -- and so your position follows.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, and what really leapt off the page at me in that opinion, he gets to the end, I think he basically presents your position and then he says: Thus, on my reading the relevant portion of section 4 could be rewritten this way.  Well, I mean that to me is a confession of error if you have to rewrite the statute to get to your position.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, his rewriting doesn't look very much like section 4 to me.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Phillips.     Carter G. Phillips  --Right.  But again I don't think -- I don't think section 4 is asking the courts to make that determination.  I think what section 4 is asking the Court to look at is the subject matter of the controversy, and is it -- is it clear under the circumstances that there is in fact a Federal claim underlying it?  And here there is no question on that.  I ask you to affirm.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Phillips.  Mr. Ortiz, you have three minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",07-773X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Who gets to frame -- who gets to frame the complaint?  Normally if you're a party and you have a dispute that may implicate Federal law, you have control over the complaint.  You don't have to have a -- you don't have to well plead it in a way that implicates a Federal question.  You can go out of your way to do it in a way that does not implicate a Federal question; and therefore it would not be, you could not bring it in Federal court.  Just as in the diversity example, you can specifically avoid suing people who would create diversity.  But in your position the judge has to in his mind write a complaint and see whether there is jurisdiction or not; and how does the judge decide whether to sue diverse parties or not to sue diverse parties?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What's hard to figure out, you have, let's say, a franchisee, and you have a dispute with the franchisor.  And the franchisee says it's an antitrust violation, and I'm going to sue you under the California antitrust law, and he does.  And the Federal court says, we've looked through and says, well, you could have sued under the Federal antitrust law.  And you -- yes, I could have; I deliberately didn't.  And then they say, well, this is something that could have been brought in Federal court.  And that really deprives a plaintiff of his right to frame his complaint as he sees fit.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  But you just say, is the dispute one that could have been brought in Federal court?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's a violation of the Sherman Act.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of course, it could be brought in Federal court.   INTERRUPTING ",07-773X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's pretty hard to argue something wasn't in force and effect when they have an election under it, isn't it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if the circuit court had gotten the State law right, then there never would have been an election?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, counsel, since you mentioned section 5, perhaps you ought to look at it.  It says that you have to preclear standards, practices, whatever, different from that in force or effect on November 1st, 1964.  Now, the Respondents in their brief accused you of making the argument that since this isn't different from what was in effect in 1964 you don't have to preclear it.  And you said, no, that's not what we're saying; we take no position on that.  Why in the world did you say that?  It says quite clearly the standard has to be different from that in force or effect on November 1st, '64.  At that point these people were appointed.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, in your reply brief on page 8 you say you take no position on that question.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, there wouldn't be a different baseline for judicial changes than there would be for legislative or executive changes, would there?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Newsom.  Ms. Karlan.     Kannon K. Shanmugam  --This bears on a critical point, Justice Scalia.  And this Court has a line of cases in the section 5 area that says that it is really incumbent on covered jurisdictions when they seek preclearance clearly to identify the relevant change in their voting practices when they come to the attorney general for preclearance.  And when the 1985 act was submitted for preclearance, there was nary a word in the Alabama attorney general's submission that there was any potential difficulty with the statute under State law.  And so, the attorney general precluded on the understandable understanding that the statute simply affected a shift to special elections.  And I do think that the great price of Appellant's interpretation is if the court were to adopt it, it would suddenly shift the burden to the Federal attorney general or the D.C. District Court to when they receive a preclearance submission, essentially assess the meaning and validity of any State statute, lest the State statute be construed differently by a State court, and thus, lock in the preclearance court or attorney general.  And we believe that that problem along with this Court's decision in Branch and Hawthorne support our interpretation.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Newsom, four minutes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about Ms. Karlan's response that this is not the same practice but it's different because the underlying method of election has been changed.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why did Alabama have to preclear anything?  On November 1st, 1964, this was an appointed position.  This is not a change from what was, quote, 1st, 1964.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no, no.  Those decisions are all dicta.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So something else changed--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --whether they are membership elections or at large elections.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The argument you made in your brief was that this was already decided in Reno versus Bossier Parish.  I didn't see the--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Is the argument that this was not, in fact, a change in your brief?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  They had the argument... you at least thought they did--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --You quote in your brief Reno versus Bossier Parish and one other case.  I'm thinking of one other.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.  And you raised the argument... you criticized them for raising this argument; that this wasn't any different; but you did not say that it wasn't any different.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think you're quite right on the DOJ regulations and the House report, but I just don't see how that squares with the statutory language.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So because we've ignored the text in other areas, we should just forget about it here?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought that... they ratified... these cases were ratified by Congress, but Congress did not change the language in the statute.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Karlan.  Mr. Shanmugan.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if the district court... circuit court I guess it is in Alabama.  This action is filed before the election and the circuit court says: You may have a successful claim here, but I'm not going to disrupt the election, there isn't time; so this election can go forward and during that period I'll be considering the law.  We do that all the time, or three judge district courts do, saying we're going to look at this question, but we don't have time to stop the election so it's going to go forward.  In that case, would that lead to the same result?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, sure, but not always.  You know, if it's a week before the election or something, even if they think it's a serious claim, they sometimes say: We're going to allow the election to go forward because we're going to look at this and perhaps the State Supreme Court has to look at it, and we don't want to hold up the election.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you talk about force and effect.  Of course, the statute says  ""force or effect on November 1st, 1964. ""  Do you have anything to add to Ms. Karlan's response on my quaint fixation on the language of the statute?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that can't tie our hands in properly interpreting the statute.   John G.

In other words, the further it is removed from the constitutional violation or an allegation of a constitutional violation, the less need there is for immunity.  The closer it is or the closer we must assume it is to a constitutional violation, then the immunity argument is stronger.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.  Mr. Rosenkranz.     E.

I mean, if -- I -- you could develop and make the same point, saying U.S. attorneys are instructed in complying with Giglio and Brady in this way.  But if there is a decision not to -- I mean, immunity is only necessary when you assume some -- there has been some violation.  And so the fact that somebody else avoids a violation, it seems to me, is not a good argument to deprive other people of immunity.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You drew a distinction earlier on between a determination by a prosecutor not to turn over certain material, which is absolutely immune, and said this was different.  But what if the purpose of the policy is to not provide prosecutors with material so they can't turn it over?  Why doesn't that go into the same prosecutorial core function?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why isn't that the same as the determination by the supervisor that, don't turn this information over.  Here's all -- we are not going to share informant information because we don't think that should be turned over to comply with Giglio.  The individual prosecutor they have says I'm not going to turn it over.  Why isn't it exactly the same?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I was surprised by your answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetical, because I thought it undermines your case.  You said that you don't have to show that the data system is unconstitutional.  You just have to show that it caused a constitutional violation.  But it would cause a constitutional violation as applied in a particular case.  And you would object to it in that case, and perhaps all this data sharing information system would be very good evidence in that case.  Look, he didn't turn over this document.  The reason he didn't turn it over is because they've got a policy of not giving them the document.  But your objection would have to be based in a particular case.  And we have already held that in that case there is absolute immunity.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Exactly.  Now, doesn't that just confirm the concern that has been expressed that all you're doing is circumventing the absolute immunity we recognized at trial.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even though the data system, as you've said, doesn't cause a constitutional violation.  It's the application of it at trial.  Now, I know that's immune.  You say, well, I'm going to get around it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you began this dialogue by suggesting that you don't -- I am saying -- you don't have to prove that what you are complaining about causes a -- is a constitutional violation.  You just have to prove that it causes a Constitutional violation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In all the examples you just gave me, it seems to me the allegation would be that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, but that gets -- it seems to me a fundamental tension in your case.  When you are talking about the conduct, you need to link it to a particular constitutional violation.  The data system has to be linked.  But when you are talking about immunity, you want to say, oh, it has got nothing to do with the constitutional violation.  It's just shuffling paper.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think Justice Stevens's question highlights for me one of the confusing parts of this case.  You sort of paired off a number of the people who would otherwise be covered, and you are left with the county employees.  If you had started with the county employees, is this how you would have gone about telling them they can't do this?  I mean the county employers.  Would you have passed a law saying that the county employers are not allowed to have this checkoff?  If you think they are part of the State, I guess you could have just written them a letter and say don't do this, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, because the State couldn't--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --No other organization other than the Federal, State and local governments.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are there other areas in which the State exercises the authority you're asserting here with respect to county employers, telling them what they can and can't do?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean more generally.  Your assertion is that this is part of the State, and therefore, as I gather, it's conceded on the other side, this is acceptable with respect to State employees but not other public employers.  Are there other areas in which you act like the counties are part of the State?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm looking for--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I'm looking for a specific example.  I mean, maybe counties or municipalities, you know, contract for trash collection or water services and maybe the State tells them, look, you've got to deal with these people, you've got to do it by open bidding, whatever.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's -- since I asked the question, I think it's necessary.  So what's the best example where the State exercises control over what the counties would otherwise have discretion to do?  You mentioned school districts.  Is that -- is that an area?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I -- I didn't hear you.  You think that's what?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That depends -- I mean the whole case turns on -- and the response to Justice Kennedy, I think, would be -- if the Federal Government is simply saying you can do it if you want, that's one thing.  If the Federal Government is saying you must do it because it's covered by the Federal Power Act, or whatever, that's different.  If it's just a grant of permission, I would suppose the State can say, well, fine, it's okay with the Feds, but you can't do it because we don't want you to.   John G.

Is it -- is it your position that if the offense, based on all facts found by a jury, carried a maximum sentence of 30 years, but there was a provision that the judge could determine that if a firearm was not used in the offense, you would lower it to 10 years, would that pose a problem under Apprendi?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Then it does.  All the facts authorize a punishment of 30 years.  And if it's going to be a reduction, that's for the judge.  But I would suppose it's not the problem -- we didn't interpose a jury between the defendant and the State with respect to every element, but only those elements that increase the punishment.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if under the law the judge upon sentencing is supposed to make a determination of where the defendant should be sent, which facility, based on determination of which one has the most room.  Is that a determination that has to be made by the jury?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even if one was, you know, the most horrendous prison in history and the other was one of -- a country club?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but here in my hypothetical it's something that a judge puts in the sentence.  It's just like you've got to, you know, make restitution, you are not eligible for parole, you are going to this place rather than that place.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if the -- what if the rule were that all sentences should be concurrent unless the defendant has been convicted of a prior federal offense and then the sentence runs consecutive to the federal sentence?

So why doesn't that just take the 404 regime completely out of what you were just talking about?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The -- the discharges we're talking about have to be discharges of -- of effluent.  Right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  My question is, does it apply to solids?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess, I mean, does suspended solids mean there's some liquid involved?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Like the discharge here.  Now, I think Mr. Olson said these are 55 percent solid by volume.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there a point at which it's proper to speak of it as a solid rather than a suspended solid?  I mean, 90 percent by weight or by volume, whichever it is, solid?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You wouldn't think something that's 90 percent solid is wastewater?   INTERRUPTING John G.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  And so if they chop up the concrete and put a little water in so that it's easier to move, then all of a sudden it comes under 402 and the--  EPA's jurisdiction.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess I'm just curious how that makes any sense, since we're talking about putting something into water.  I mean, does it really matter whether you add the water before it goes into the lake or just the lake adds the water when you put in the solid?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Either way, I guess your friends on the other side would argue, I assume, that it's properly regarded as fill material, because that is the effect of it, rather than as effluent subject to 402.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even when they -- even when they fill -- even when they fill a lake?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So when EPA regulates -- or it has regulated these for 40 years, which I assume is up to 2002 -- then it -- it's because they don't go into lakes; it's because they go into settling ponds.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, do I -- do I understand your response to turn on -- let's say the State, for example, limits class actions because it doesn't want vast exposure under the penalty provisions that you could get in a class action.  It only wants to pay when they can be brought on an individual basis.  But they may also limit class actions by saying, as Justice Sotomayor suggested, that they are not fair and efficient.  Do you get one result in the former case and a different result in the latter?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do you -- how do you tell?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose it's pertinent, then, whether they do it, as I think you were -- was discussed earlier, on an across-the-board basis or on an individual basis?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I guess--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --But -- but wouldn't Justice Stevens's hypothetical suggest that they were less concerned about the impact of -- of the class action procedure than they were about its procedural efficiency?  In other words, I understand your position if you're saying, look, we've only got $20 million in this fund to pay plaintiffs and we think it's better to go on an individual basis, because if it's a class action, you know, it would be over in one shot or whatever--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --but it's not appropriate to say, we don't like the class action procedure as a general matter.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And in Justice Stevens's hypothetical, it applied across the board, which would cause me, anyway, to think it was the latter.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it -- it only reflects a substantive choice -- if it is a substantive choice.  If they say, we are not going to allow class actions because we think, procedurally, they are a bad idea because we think lawyers get too much recovery when they recover -- in other words, it -- your -- your position depends upon a characterization of the ban, and the restriction on class actions is either substantive or procedural.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the question is New Mexico causes of action.  Can they decide that they don't want actions from outside of the State to be brought as class actions?

Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Katyal.  Mr. Clement.     Paul D. Clement  --Well, I think it's -- I'm not sure it's a decision you have to make.  I think it's actually something that would be evaluated objectively after the fact, and I think the way that this Court should approach this case is neither of the parties before you have asked this Court to overturn Buckley.  I wouldn't do it under those circumstances, but, of course, it's worth adding that, if you were going to overturn Buckley, then the place to probably start would be to go back to first principles, and if you're going to go back to first principles, then what you're going to find is that there was no common law support at all for absolute immunity.  And I wouldn't think that this Court was particularly interested in coming up with implied immunities that aren't in the statute and had no basis at the common law, and that's why I think some of the Justices that have looked at this as an original matter have tended to be quite reluctant in recognizing absolute immunity because it lacks support in the text and it lacks support at the common law.  So we're -- we're happy with the lines that this Court has already drawn.  But if the Court's going to go back to first principles, well, let's go back to first principles and look at -- the at the statute Congress passed in 1871.  That statute did not provide any immunities, and I do think, as we say in the brief, this is a case where it's important not to lose the forest for the trees because this is a statute was passed -- passed in 1871.  This is one of the great civil rights statutes.  Is it really plausible to think that the Congress that passed this statute didn't want to provide a remedy in the circumstances before the Court today?  I think it's clear, from this Court's cases -- there may not be a case that lines up all the dots exactly, but I think it's clear, from this Court's cases, that the police officer that engages in this misconduct has committed a grave, grave constitutional violation and ought to be liable.  I think the prosecutor who engages in the pretrial misconduct and then doesn't participate in the trial is just as liable as that police officer, and I can't think of a single reason why the only reason a prosecutor would get absolute immunity is, if they not only participated in the pretrial misconduct, but completed the scheme by committing further misconduct at trial.  For all those reasons, we think the Court should affirm.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Clement.  Mr. Sanders, you have five -- five minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",08-1065

He fabricated it; nobody believed it when it was presented at trial.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How -- how do you -- I mean, we hear that type of argument every time, because there is usually a circuit conflict here, and you look at one circuit and say the world hasn't fallen.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, let's say that you -- let's say that you can't because we read Imbler as conferring absolute immunity on what goes on at the trial.

We have also recognized that in the prosecutorial area, and trying to draw the line where you do -- I think this was one of the points Justice Alito was making, is that, sometimes, you're investigating and preparing your case at the same time.  You don't just sit back and say, I'm -- I'm just going to look and see what I can find.  You have particular areas.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, if -- if -- if lawyers are debt relief agencies, I am curious how your limiting construction works.  If a client comes into a lawyer and says, look, I know we are thinking of filing bankruptcy, but I want to go to Tahiti and charge it; can I do it?  And the lawyer says: Oh, the law says I can't give you advice in contemplation of bankruptcy; the Solicitor General says that means I can't give you advice in aid of fraud that would deprive debtors of assets they might otherwise get, so I can't tell you.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Has that person violated -- has that lawyer violated the statute?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the person has asked, can I charge the trip to Tahiti?  And the lawyer, although giving perfectly truthful advice, has effectively conveyed to his client that if he does he would be depriving debtors of assets they might otherwise get.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  He has communicated to the client that if he takes the trip, one, he will have a good time in Tahiti; and two, he will be using assets that would otherwise end up in the hands of the debtors.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if -- what if the lawyer said: I can't give you advice in contemplation of bankruptcy, but here's the Solicitor General's brief, read that.  [Laughter]  And a reasonable -- my point is a reasonable person reading the brief would say, well, the reason he can't give me advice is because that might cause me to do something that would defraud the debtors, so I'm going to buy the ticket.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's one of the things I'm concerned about your limiting construction, ""intending to defraud the debtor"".  What if the person takes a trip to Tahiti every November?  They've always done it.  They are not intending to defraud the debtor.  They are just doing what they have always done.  So an attorney that gives that advice, would be -- that would be okay?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if -- so if the lawyer said that, I can't give you advice in contemplation of bankruptcy, but I can tell you that fraud turns on the debtor's intent?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but the whole point is that the attorney could be providing advice that would steer the debtor away from doing anything wrong.  And yet the other -- the government would say, oh, no, no, no, no; you are trying to tell him it's okay to take the trip to Tahiti.  If he says you can take the trip to Tahiti so long as your intent is not to defraud the debtor -- correct advice that could be read as telling the debtor not to do anything wrong or could be read as giving the debtor a little, as you say, a wink and a nod and saying, you know, what do you intend to do?  And he says, oh, I just intend to go on vacation, not to defraud the debtors.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You can come up with your own hypotheticals that are a lot easier from your point of view, and Justice Ginsburg has been suggesting some that are much more difficult because they depend on particular facts.  And under your construction it seems to me that a lawyer trying to give correct, legal, ethical advice has got to pause before every sentence and think, oh, is this going to be construed in violation of subsection (a)(4)?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the point is you don't know.  Of course you can't give advice to do something illegal.  But I -- I would think that some of the questions have been suggesting that it's hard to know whether it's illegal.  You yourself say it depends on the debtor's intent.  So if a client came in to me and said, can I do this, and it depends on his intent, as a lawyer I would want to say: It depends on why you are doing it.  But if -- but that I think could be construed as being -- giving advice in contemplation of bankruptcy.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  This is a regulation of the attorney-client relationship to pursue an unrelated substantive objective.  You want to ensure that debtors don't do something and you think, well, the way -- it's not enough to tell debtors, don't do this.  You're going to say: We are going to regulate what lawyers tell them as a way of pursuing an unrelated objective.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the objective is criminal; that doesn't mean it is not being indirectly enforced by interfering with the attorney-client relationship.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --or affecting the attorney-client relationship.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, it's a good way to enforce it, to tell people you can't get legal advice about it.  What if a State thinks that there are too many punitive damage awards, that they are out of control, and so it passes a law saying lawyers may not tell their clients that they can get -- they can seek punitive damages?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, if it's done with the purpose of fraud, it is.  If you think, well, I'm really -- I really wasn't -- it really wasn't malicious conduct, I know that, or whatever the standard is for punitive damages, then it's illegal, just like here if you incur debt to defraud your debtors it's illegal, but if you don't it's not.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Only if it's -- you know, it says you can't give that advice in contemplation of filing a lawsuit.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, no.  It's a difference between filing, because there the lawyer signs the -- signs the complaint.  It's giving advice to the client.  And the -- I guess what I would see as the parallel is that it's an objective outside the attorney-client relationship.  It's not like saying, you can't charge more than 50 percent contingent fee or -- or whatever -- you know, designed to regulate the client -- protect the client.  It's -- it's a totally extraneous objective.   ",08-1119

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, no. 1328(a)(2) brings in the definition, the kind of debt specified in 523(a).  It doesn't bring in the discharge under 523(a), which is limited to 1328(b).   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If -- if you'd like to reserve time, it's probably time to wrap up.   John G.

And I see that 523(a) is referred to later on, but only for purposes of definition, not for purposes of discharge.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then the key distinction you draw in your brief is totally meaningless.  You say on page 18 that this -- the issue is whether the provision is, quote, ""framed as a directive"" to the bankruptcy court.

I certainly, if I were representing them, would try -- try it, but it's just something that I have not seen, and in working up this case, I am not familiar with it, but it may very well be an appealable order.  My point is simply that, the bottom line, we have something here that is very final; there are literally billions of dollars of disbursements made by chapter 13 trustees in reliance on the these plans; and it would be very, very upsetting to the bankruptcy jurisdiction, exceedingly upsetting, to make a very broad exception to finality.

Roberts, Jr.  --Do you have any reason to suppose that that's a redefinition of -- of property that the legislature isn't free to change tomorrow?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It would be -- what would your position be, assuming you still have title, you still have the right of littoral title, contact with the water?  Would you concede that the State has different regulatory interests with respect to that new strip of land versus the old strip of land?  It's still your property.  The State can regulate your property.  Presumably, they regulate your beach property now.  Would their different -- would their authority to regulate be greater with respect to the new area?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  Your -- you would still have the title to the property.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's still your property.  You know, the State regulates property all the time, in zoning -- would their authority be broader with respect to that new land than with respect to the old?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sometimes -- and I don't actually know what the law is on this.  Sometimes the State builds, you know, sidewalks in front of people.  Maybe they do it on their own land, and they say: We're putting this easement, and people can walk across it.  Would this be in the same category of public project?  They say, well, it's your land because you have a right to the mean high-water land, but we built it so we have greater rights with respect to regulation than we might have with respect to the natural beach.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could the State--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Could the State sell this new land to somebody else?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Safriet.  Mr. Makar.     Edwin S. Kneedler  --No.  It varies.  And in--  that may be true in the Port of Seattle case discussed in Hughes, where the State had the -- you're balancing the rights of adjacent property owners, just like -- just like nuisance or other principles do.  In Washington State, apparently, you could completely fill the submerged land and the upland owner had no rights.  In Florida -- Florida is actually more protective than that.  It has limited rights.  You have a -- you maintain a right of view, a right against unreasonable interference.  So there's no one constitutionally based rule.  It's a question of Florida property law.  And the background principles of Florida property law under Martin v. Busch and the fact that the State owns the adjacent land, I think, not only is there -- there is more than a fair and substantial basis here.  There is a -- it's very solidly grounded in State law.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose it depends on -- or maybe not -- how quickly it all happens.  I mean, if the State project is such that they add a foot a year, is that an avulsion or accretion?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, is your view whenever the State does it, it's an avulsion?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  I know.  My -- my questions was what if it is?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't recall how quickly things happened here.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if it's -- if it's gradual, even though the State is doing it, it can be an accretion, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's a foot a year.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, on these facts--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --On these facts, if the State's project added sand at a foot a year, the landowner would win?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  A foot -- are we dickering over the distance?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then, wherever you want to say it's an accretion -- what -- it's an inch, 6 inches--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --So, you're--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --If I can -- we're arguing about the application of a doctrine to this case.  I'd like to step back if I can and talk about the doctrine through a hypothetical, if that's all right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The -- the -- let's say the legislature passes an act saying the boundary of beachfront property is now where the sand starts, and not the mean high-water mark but the mean high-sand mark.  All right?  And -- and then -- so that's sued.  You -- you sue under that, and the court says: Yes, of course, that's a taking; our precedents have always said it's the mean high-water line and nothing else.  Florida has judicial elections.  Say, somebody runs for election for the Florida Supreme Court and says: I'm going to change that law.  I'm going to say that it is not a taking.  I think people should be able to walk right up to the land.  And that person is elected, and the law is changed.  Now, is -- is that a judicial taking?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it a possibility or is it a clear case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  I know.  You're changing--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I understand you have a different view about here.  But under my hypothetical, would you agree that the action of the Florida Supreme Court is a taking?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's not the question.  I mean, you just said that, let's assume the -- assuming the property line doesn't change.  The other side is saying the property line is the mean high-water line, and so if you -- whoever adds sand, the State, mother nature, you dumping it -- I guess you can't do that, but whoever adds it, the property line is the mean high-water line--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Yes, but that's because you think the property line is the ECL rather than the MHWL.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it's not -- it's not the same as the property right he held before, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So he can exclude people from the additional 60 feet?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But, that's what the case is about.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So why doesn't -- why don't you take your list and Justice Breyer's list and submit that in the just compensation hearing?  When the landowner comes in and says, look, you have taken my property and it is worth $100,000, and you come in and say oh, no, no; it's not worth $100,000; look at all these things we saved and gave you.  It's only -- what you have lost is only worth $20,000.  And a court will review that and say yes, no, whatever, and that's what you get.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Again, that is what the whole case is about, whether they have a right to contact the water or not.  It seems to me if your only answer to every question is they don't have the right, you're just completely begging the question.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So on behalf of the State, you concede if any of this list -- these -- the list of good things that the land owner gets, if the legislature next year takes them away, that would be a taking?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You can complete your thought.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Kneedler.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Kneedler, that's a clever ploy.  We're talking about judicial takings and you say, don't look at what the court did; look at what the legislature did.  That changes the whole ball game.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  There's no choice.  If their argument is what the court did constituted the taking, they couldn't have raised that earlier--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --and said, oh, we think we know that the court is going to change things.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Judicial -- judicial taking if that were the case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Accretion -- accretion, of course, would change.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It would take submerged State land and give it to the landowner.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So a foot -- I'll get back to what I raised earlier.  A foot a year, if the State does it and it's a foot a year, does the property owner get the foot, or does the State get the foot?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it makes a difference whether it's done in a day or done in a month?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, what is your--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I'm sorry.  What -- what is your view on the hypothetical I posed to your -- to your friend?  The legislature moves it to the vegetation line.  The State supreme court says that's a taking.  Somebody runs for election to the State supreme court, saying, I'm going to change that.  He's elected.  He changes the law.  Is that a judicial taking?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, doesn't -- it's not pretextual.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  He says, I think they got the law wrong.

Dreeben  This is a bedrock principle of the common law that exists in all 50 States, and the mistake that the lower courts made in the pre-McNally era was in thinking that the mail fraud statute protected it, but there was no obscurity whatsoever that the fiduciaries owe an obligation of undivided loyalty to their principal.

Roberts, Jr.  It's a light sentence because the disclosure obligations are confusing, but -- and then the Federal prosecutor comes along and says, well, you -- you are going away for 20 years because this violates 1346.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't that a critical difference, though?  I mean, I understood the fundamental question in -- before getting arbitration is whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate this dispute with this party.  And it's one thing to say that the contract permitted this sort of arbitration; it's another thing to say it didn't preclude it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And if it didn't preclude, the contract may not preclude -- if I agree -- I guess it's the -- well, if I agree to arbitrate with A, it doesn't preclude me from arbitrating with B, but nothing in the agreement compels me to do that.  So which did the arbitrators do?  Did they say, under this contract, you agreed to a class action treatment, in the sense that -- whether it's the language or the intent or whatever -- or did they say we don't find anything here that precludes class action treatment?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Would you show me this -- I see they have quoted from--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --from the agreement.  Where is that in the agreement itself?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you know offhand.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, this is -- I'm sorry.  This is what I was wondering.  It is, of course, any dispute arising from -- blah, blah -- performance, termination of this charter party shall be settled in New York.  Now, there's -- the class is not a party to this charter party.  So disputes arising from this charter party doesn't involve the class.  So they did not agree to arbitrate with the class.  Now, as I understand what the arbitrators did, they said, well, they didn't preclude it, and so we get to decide how far our authority goes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, now -- now -- I'm sorry.  I'm just reading along here.  They rejected your argument about ""forbids"", but the -- they go on to say: The issue -- we look at this, we look at that to see whether they intended to permit or to preclude class action.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's enough for them if the parties did not intend to preclude class action.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In -- in any -- in any case -- when you say ""arbitrators' toolbox"", I'm trying to figure out if that is something different than what the parties agreed to.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's just saying that they're -- they're giving up a lot.  This is the basic reason that you require, I thought, fairly clear language that you are agreeing to arbitrate.  They are giving up their right to go into court.  They have an agreement between A and B that they will arbitrate a dispute, and they say you are giving up your right to go to court with the dispute between A and C.  And the ""any dispute"" language that you're, you know, quite understandably relying on refers to any dispute arising from the -- making performance or termination of ""this charter party"".  ""This charter party"" says nothing about arbitrating with C.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, but they can agree to arbitrate.  They can agree to arbitrate with some and not with others, even if it's the same contract.  They may decide that your client is a very reasonable person; they are happy to submit that to arbitration.  Or it's a very big and important client, and they don't want to get into court with you.  They may decide some other party, for whatever reason, they don't want to get dragged into court with them.  Same charter party, different -- different parties--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --and different results.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Go ahead.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Allowing.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Allowing.  See, that's where I get hung up.  There's a difference in arbitration -- and it's a fundamental difference -- between allowing something and a background rule that requires it if you don't say anything about it.  The difference I see with the hypothetical Justice Breyer put is that you are talking about the details of a contract once it's agreed there is a contract.  There's a contract that governs the relationship between the employer and the employee, and you're trying to figure out if it says anything about where they eat lunch.  This is the much more fundamental issue of whether you've even agreed to arbitrate with this person.  Is this guy your employee or just somebody who came in off the street?  And I think what your brother's position is, is that this is just somebody who came off the street; the class members.  I didn't agree to do anything with them.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I -- I--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, that's -- that's what it comes down--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --That's what it comes down to--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --whether it's an interpretation of the contract to give the arbitrators the authority to proceed on a class basis.  Not enough, right, under your view, if there's nothing in there that precludes them from doing so?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what -- what happens--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --What happens if you get the arbitrator on the stand, and he says: As we read the contract, it doesn't say -- and nothing about the intent of the parties leads me to believe they meant -- you may arbitrate this on a class basis, but at the same time there is nothing in there that says you may not.  And I looked at the intent of the parties and background rules, and nothing there says you may not.  What do you understand to be the answer?  Can they proceed on a class basis or not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  It's the background rule--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --under which you should interpret this.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So we have to decide, when we -- when the contract says nothing about class actions, whether the background rule should be you can go ahead -- or the background rule should be you can't go ahead.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --What the arbitrators have already told us -- I think you disagree with it--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --but take it for purposes of argument.  What the arbitrators have told us is that it doesn't say anything.  It doesn't say you can do it, it doesn't say you can't do it.  I assume that's true.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I know I said she doesn't agree with it.  But, I mean, assuming that's true, what's the answer?  Yes or no?  Can they go ahead with class action or not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --If you and I have a--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I'm sorry.  If you and I have a contract -- you're going to sell me a car, and we write up a contract and we enter into it, and it provides for arbitration if we have a dispute.  I also buy a car from Mr. Waxman, and I Xerox that contract.  It's the exact same contract.  We have a dispute, and we go to arbitration.  Can Mr. Waxman come in and say, I got the same contract, and I've got the same dispute.  Arbitrate with me, too?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Now, suppose I have a contract just with you and -- to arbitrate -- or I -- I have the same contract with Mr. Waxman, but it has no arbitration clause.  And he says, well, the dispute is the same, you are arbitrating that, can I come in, too, and get bound by your decision?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You would say no.  And the reason is?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not that I -- he doesn't have any arbitration agreement with me or that it's not the same arbitration agreement?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let's say the intent is pertinent when we enter into the contract, okay?  And there's good evidence about what you and I meant the contract to mean, and there's not any evidence about what Mr. Waxman and I meant the contract to mean.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think -- reading ""intentional"" the way you just articulated is absolutely right, but when you add -- I don't see what work ""bona fide error"" does in the statute, if ""intentional"" should be read in this case to mean what you say.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you say: Well, intentional means you meant to send out the document; you meant to serve it; in other words, no specific intent requirement.  But if -- a bona fide error, it seems, doesn't make the activity not intentional under the traditional understanding of intentional.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you are sort of begging the question there.  I mean, the antitrust laws also don't have a bona fide error defense, and the question is whether that includes a legal mistake defense.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  One -- one of the things you have to include on this initial communication is the name of the creditor, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So let's say the bank that is the creditor is being sold or taken over.  And, you know, you have heard that, well, they have merged, but, you know, the closing date of the merger is two months later or whatever.  It's just not clear what the name of the creditor is.  So you -- you are not a lawyer, but you are trying to collect the debt, and you go -- you fill in, I -- it's either A or B, and you say: I think it's A, and you fill it in and it turns out that it's -- it's B.  Let's say that's a bona fide error.  Okay?  But if you are sitting there as the debt collector and you say: I don't know if it's A or B.  And you say: I know; I'll call the lawyer.  You call the lawyer and the lawyer says: Oh, it's -- it's B -- I mean, it's -- it's A.  And you put down A and it turns out it's wrong, aren't -- you are in a worse position if you ask the lawyer than if you didn't, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, it's a -- it's a legal -- the lawyer looks at it and says: Well, you know, the merger is not going to close for whatever, but I think it's still this bank.  And it turns out his legal analysis of who the creditor is was wrong.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if the client just says: I'm not going to ask the lawyer; I'm just going to make -- I think it's A -- it's a bona fide error, but it's an error -- he gets the benefit of that position.  But if he asks the lawyer, he doesn't get the benefit.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Who the -- who the creditor is is necessarily a mistake of law, rather than fact?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, is it a mistake of fact if the lawyer does legal research to find it out?   INTERRUPTING John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Jay.     William M. Jay  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  I would like, if I may, to pick up with a point that Mr. Russell made, which is that the FDCPA is of a piece with most civil regulatory statutes, in that it makes knowledge of the law an aggravating factor and subjects violators who know that they are violating a law subject to substantial civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day.  But it doesn't completely excuse violations based on a lack of knowledge of the law.  In order to be excused, the violation must have resulted from a bona fide error and meet all three elements of the bona fide error defense.  We think that two of those elements are not satisfied by the Respondents' error in this case.  First, legal errors, for the reason Mr. Russell explained, aren't unintentional.  Justice Scalia asked about whether the phrase ""the violation is not intentional"" is a signal in that respect.  We think that the work that that phrase, ""the violation was not intentional"", does in this circumstance is to show that the portion of the debt collector's conduct that triggers the violation of the statute, it was -- is what must be unintentional.  Let me illustrate that with an example.  Under the statute, a debt collector who places a call to a debtor at home after 9:00 at night may well violate the statute; likely does violate the statute.  So what must be unintentional for that debt collector to make out the bona fide error defense is not that the telephone call had been -- had been placed unintentionally, but rather that the debt collector didn't have knowledge, for example, because of an error about what time zone the debtor lives in.  The -- the debt collector didn't know that the call was being placed after 9:00 at night.  That is an unintentional error, and it is excused under the statute if the debt collector can also show that it maintains procedures reasonably adapted to prevent any such errors--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How many times have they answered in the past decade?   William M. Jay  --In the past decade, Mr. Chief Justice, they have been asked seven times for opinions by the debt collection industry, and they have answered four of them under the criteria that they adopted in the regulations they are cited in footnote of our brief.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that's not a very realistic procedure to rely on, is it?   William M. Jay  Well, the debt collection industry seems to not have asked very many times, Mr. Chief Justice.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And why is that?  Because it's a little difficult dealing with the FTC bureaucracy and getting an answer from them in a reasonable time?   William M. Jay  I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that first, even if this were relevant to what Congress intended the -- how Congress intended the adviser opinion process to work when it wrote this provision in 1977, that the debt collection industry, as we pointed out in our brief -- if you ask the FTC for an adviser opinion, and it sides against the requester, which, incidentally, in none of these four opinions has it ever done -- in each case it sided with the requester -- but if it sides against, then the requester is on notice of the law.  And the requester is going to be -- as I mentioned at the outset, the requester is going to be in the category of -- for heightened penalties, because it will be very difficult to suggest that you don't know the law--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you are saying that the debt collection industry doesn't does ask the FTC, which would be a safe harbor for them, because if they get a bad answer, they may not follow it and then they may be subject to heightened penalties?   William M. Jay  --Well, I'm saying, Mr. Chief Justice, that the -- that they would understandably prefer to ask their own lawyer for an opinion if the -- if this Court were to agree with the Respondent's position and affirm the Sixth Circuit.  They would be able to ask their own lawyer, get a private opinion, and if the opinion is favorable, then they are home free under the bona fide error defense.  If -- if it's an -- if it's adverse advice, they may need -- even if they disregard the advice, they may never need to disclose the opinion at all, whereas the FTC advisory opinion process clarifies the law for the benefit of the entire field.  Those opinions are public.  They are published and--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but there are four of them.  I don't care how public they are.  There are four of them over the past 10 years.  It's not a very reliable or usable effort to clarify the law and address the problem that the statute presents.   William M. Jay  --Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I submit that you can't look simply at the number of responses without looking at the number of inquiries.  And I am confident that if this Court, as we urge that it do, reverses the Sixth Circuit and makes clear that asking your own lawyer for an opinion is not going to be a safe harbor defense under Subsection C, that there will be increased use of the -- of the safe harbor defense that Congress actually wrote into the statute in Subsection E.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And if that's wrong, it doesn't do you any good.   William M. Jay  --If that's wrong, it doesn't confer the safe harbor.  But that's up to the debt collector, Mr. Chief Justice.  If you -- if you want an informal opinion, you can get one very quickly.  If you want the safe harbor, that requires the imprimatur of the commissioners, and that takes a bit longer.  We don't think that's at all inconsistent with what Congress intended, and we do think that Congress intended that this be the primary avenue.  And if you look at the advisory opinion provision of the Truth in Lending Act, we think that illustrates it.  At the time Congress enacted the FDCPA, the Truth in Lending Act advisory opinion provision had only been on the books for a couple of years, but it had already filled more than 100 pages of the Code of Federal Regulations with advisory opinions.  And we think that that's how Congress intended for the law under this statute to be clarified as well, not in a way that effectively confers qualified immunity on debt collectors whenever there is an ambiguity in the law.  We think that that is reinforced as well by a substantive aspect of the statute, which is that Congress recognized -- and this is in particular in the legislative history at page 18 in footnote 9 of our brief -- that the debt collection industry is extremely aggressive and looks for loopholes whenever they exist.  So the substantive prohibitions of the statute, especially 1692d, e, and f, are written in such a way that they contain broad, substantive prohibitions that are illustrated by examples, but those examples expressly are illustrative and not exclusive.  Congress would not have wanted a debt collector to be able to say: Well, gee, this -- this practice is not expressly addressed by the statute and has not yet expressly been addressed by any judicial opinion, and to say: Well, that law is not clearly established.  We think it's -- may I finish the sentence Mr. Chief Justice?  We think, instead, that Congress would have recognized that the purpose of this statute is to protect the unsophisticated debtor, and that the sophisticated repeat players of the debt collection industry, if they want to clarify the law, should go to the FTC.  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Jay.  Mr. Coakley.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose it would make interpretation of the act a little more difficult.  The same practice would be unconscionable in -- not unconscionable in one circumstance, you would have an opinion saying this is not unconscionable; but yet if somebody else does it, you know, two weeks later, that doesn't have the same -- he says, well, look, it's not unconscionable, but it turns out it is, in his case.  And it would have to be -- the opinion would have to clarify the law by saying, this is normally unconscionable but we are going to say it's not here because of this activity that is unlikely to happen.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That issue is still not settled, is it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We still don't know if the lawyer here was right or wrong.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So I mean, you're -- the substance of your answer is that they are just two very different statutes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I -- but I share Justice Scalia's concern, I mean the -- the ways in which they are different would suggest you need the legal mistake defense more in TILA than you do in the FDCPA.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I see I have a copy in the retail -- Association of Retail Collection Trades.  The first -- second sentence in the FTC's response is I apologize for the delay in responding to your request.   INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's a tort action, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose -- grounded in contract.  I suppose the existence of a contract is an evidentiary matter that you have to establish, but the cause of action is still tort, and of course 301(a) is limited to violations of contracts.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't see how somebody who is not a party to the contract can violate the contract.  They can be liable for all sorts of things, but I don't see that they can be liable for violating the contract.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose you can have tortious interference with the contract.  Can you, without the -- establishing the existence of a contract?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, I suppose that's--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --tortious interference with -- what is it, the ability to enter into a contract, I think, is recognized in some jurisdictions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose it's a question for your friends on the other side whether they think the ratification or the contract that was entered into in December that's effective in May -- if that makes them liable for violating the no-strike clause, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what happens if it's ratified retroactively?  Is the no-strike clause in effect?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You want to say yes, right?   John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, if there was a contract beginning May 22nd, then that included the no-strike clause?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so you don't think -- I guess this is following up on Justice Alito's question.  You don't think it included the nostrike clause--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --for -- that would apply to July 2nd?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if it doesn't -- I'm sorry to interrupt you.  But if it doesn't include the no-strike clause and the question is whether the July 2nd one does, all this talk about the December agreement being retroactive to May is really kind of beside the point.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well -- I'm sorry, but that's the central issue.  Your friend says no, we had a contract on July 2nd, and that's for the court to determine, not the arbitrator, because it's a question of formation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And what do you expect the arbitrator to do?  The arbitrator -- since you agree that there's a contract in effect--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --the arbitrator is not going to decide whether the contract is there or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And the contract has a no-strike clause.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you expect the arbitrator to say you get the benefit of the contract that lets me decide something, and even though there's a no-strike clause in the contract, you want the arbitrator to say that no-strike clause is not operative on July 2nd?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even though -- I'm sorry to interrupt you.  But even though the later agreement was that it would be retroactive?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that an issue for the arbitrator?  Now that we know there was an agreement on July 2nd, is the question whether the strike continued or not for the arbitrator?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you say there was no strike, and I -- I thought the other side said there was.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right, but their position is that there was a contract on July 2nd that included a no-strike clause--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --that you violated.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  And your answer is, one, that there is no contract, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, sure.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that -- and that position depends upon your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, that you are severing arbitration and the no-strike obligation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Nussbaum.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not against the international?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I'd like your broader perspective as a representative of the international, because I think it's an important issue of labor policy.  If I think that the cause of actions available under 301(a) and the pre-emptive effect of 301(a) ought to be coextensive, which -- which do you prefer, a broader 301(a) or a narrower pre-emption?  I think it makes a difference.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think 301 -- I think whatever -- I don't think there should be a noman's land between you can bring your action under 301 and it's pre-empted by 301.  In other words, if -- if you are right, that they cannot bring a tortious interference action under 301, I don't think it should be pre-empted.  If you are wrong and they can bring it, then I can understand that it should be pre-empted.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it was pre-empted by 301, and they cannot bring it under 301?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And so if Granite Rock brought this claim in State court, you would say it's pre-empted by 301?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And then, if they turned around and brought it in Federal court under 301, you would say, no, there is no cause of action under 301?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it is in a noman's land.  Their claim for tortious interference with contract just can't be brought anywhere?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They could always go to the NLRB--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --In State court or in Federal court?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you bring it in Federal court?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What would the makewhole -- I gather a cease-and-desist wouldn't make any sense because this is over, but what would the makewhole remedy entail?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that applies in 301.  They're not touching the contract.  They're not touching the parties to the contract.  This is outside the contract.  So why should it be pre-empted?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand that.   ",08-1214
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you would say that the Federal Government has no such power independent of the criminal conviction?  In other words, that Congress could not pass a law saying, just as this one says, we are going to commit people who are sexually dangerous until a determination that they are not or until the State can take them?  That power would not be in Article I?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  I understand your argument to be that this power is necessary and proper, given the fact that the person is in Federal custody for some other reason, criminal conviction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why doesn't the Federal Government's authority to have custody because of the criminal justice system end when the criminal justice system is exhausted?  In other words, when the sentence is done?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, if there were--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --But, General--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I understood you in your response to Justice Alito to say, if I remember, that it was not just the fact of Federal custody, but the fact that there are no States or there may well often be no States willing.  What if every State is willing; I mean, every State is willing to take the people on out of a concern to protect their citizens.  Does that somehow mean there's no necessary and proper power?

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought the reason that the Solicitor General gives for not -- that NHTSA did not immediately require the type 2 seatbelt is because the costs would have been higher.  Is that your understanding?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How come allowing -- or why doesn't allowing the relief you seek under State law impose those same costs, contrary to NHTSA's objective in not making those mandatory?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And a State tort action does not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose -- I understand the argument.  I'm not sure it's right, though, in the sense that NHTSA may decide not to make particular standards mandatory for reasons other than cost.  It may decide it doesn't think the technology is adequately developed.  It may decide that it doesn't think there are adequate, you know, mechanics prepared or involved.  But here it's because of the cost, and the relief you are seeking it seems to me directly imposes the costs that NHTSA decided not to require.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, every -- there is no objective that the government pursues regardless of cost.  I understand that their objective was to encourage this, but it was clearly not to impose it, because it thought at that time that the costs were too great.  So to simply say their objective was to get these in ignores the other side of the cost/benefit analysis.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if the rule here had another provision that said you must have Type 1?  You can have Type 2--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --You can have Type 2, right?  But we are not requiring Type 2, because we think the costs on manufacturers would be too great.  We may require it in the future, but not now.  Is it the same?  Is your position the same?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, doesn't the -- doesn't the increased costs that are imposed by the tort liability conflict with NHTSA's determination in my hypothetical that they're not requiring Type 2 because of the cost?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it said all those thing in Geier, too, didn't it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Jay.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No -- I agree with you, it doesn't require.  It doesn't support the inference that they did not want Type 2 seatbelts to happen, to be used.  It does, in my hypothetical view, support the inference that it didn't want to mandate Type 2 seatbelts because it was worried, as you said in your brief at page 9, about the cost.  And yet its worries about the cost, it seems to me, are overridden by the position that State tort suits can go on for the absence of Type 2 seatbelts.   INTERRUPTING ",08-1314

What happens then?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that's a fanciful answer, because EAJA requires that the government's position, to get fees, is substantially unjustified.  And so the government lawyer is going to sit down and say, well, you know, if I take a position that is substantially unjustified, I will at that point pay the fees to you, not to the client.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but the attorney's interest -- I thought in the hypothetical we were talking about, the attorney's interest is.  He thinks the government is going to take a substantially unjustified position, and he wants to make sure in that case that he gets paid.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's going to look awful bad to a court that comes in and he's -- and the court is asked to award EAJA fees, and there is an agreement already in effect.

""  ""With that information, defendants Lay and Skilling sold tens of millions of dollars of their own Enron stock.

""  ""When an investor buys a share of stock, they buy the right to hear and receive truth from the chief executive officer.

As Mr. Dreeben was explaining, if you have an experienced judge who goes through this all the time, I think it's reasonable for him to say: Look, bring the person in front of me.  We've got a questionnaire.

Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no, no.  No.  They'd go to the statute that says honest services--  [Laughter]  Right.  It seems -- it seems -- I'm being flip.  It seems that that's where you would focus your attention, if you think your community has essentially been fleeced by somebody because of his dishonesty.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if -- if you're going to say that the statute refers to a term of art, the whole point of a term of art is that it's a shorthand for defining something.  And then -- but if you're saying that it's a term of art that means the pre-McNally case law over the -- you know, all the different circuits and the district courts and that some knowledge of that, it -- it's descriptive of something, but it's not a term of art.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I'm with you there.  But then the kinds of cases -- that's where it gets fuzzy.  I mean, you need lawyers and research before you get an idea of what the pre-McNally state of law was with respect to intangible -- the right to intangible services, of honest services.  And I'm just wondering how clear does what that body of law is have to be before you can say, you know what, when we tell you that right, you know that that's what it's referring to?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It kind of -- it puts the prospective defendant, I guess, in an awfully difficult position, though, if he has got to wait.  There's this common law evolution over time.  You have two cases the government wins, one it loses, three -- and he's supposed to keep track of that.  That doesn't sound like fair notice of what's criminal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that covers the case that your friend put of the employee using the computer for personal use?

In other words, if it's a smaller--  [Laughter]  If it's 10,000 of these balls and you are going to go through it 10,000 times, it's more likely that you are going to get a sample that reflects the overall percentage, correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  That -- I'm confused.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought it was the other way around.  I thought Grand Rapids gave however many -- you know, 30 percent to the pool and then took Grand Rapids people back?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so do we have any evidence in the record that -- I gather this whole claim depends upon Grand Rapids having more need for jurors per capita than anywhere else?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So do we have any evidence in the record that that's the case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I would suppose that's something we can find out pretty easily, right?

John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess I'm -- I guess I'm echoing Justice Stevens's question of whether or not this type of statistical analysis really works when you're dealing with relatively small numbers.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do I understand your siphoning theory to depend upon Grand Rapids drawing a disproportionate number of jurors from the pool?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That results in fewer minorities going up to the county court, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Removed from the county--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Where -- where in the record is it established that Grand Rapids had a disproportionate need for jurors from the pool?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if it's -- if your theory depends upon Grand Rapids drawing a disproportionate number and it is not in the record that Grand Rapids drew a disproportionate number, I think that means you lose.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of course.  Of course, but we have to look at this on a proportional basis, right?  Grand Rapids is also sending a higher number of jurors to the pool than -- than the small rural county.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your -- your theory depends upon Grand Rapids drawing not just a proportional number, if it's contributing 30 percent and it draws 30 percent; your theory depends upon Grand Rapids contributing 30 percent to the pool and drawing 40 percent.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is that?  Don't those people then have to become professional jurors?  They have to serve on every jury, or you're going to have the disproportion that the statistics show.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your answer to Justice Scalia's question is -- is no, right?  Because the idea is, if Grand Rapids sends up a pool that's 30 percent minority and if it takes back the same number as everybody else, it's going to get -- the county is going to get the same proportion.  It's only when they take back more.  They have the more heavily African-American pool, and they are going to draw from it more than everybody else is drawing from theirs, so there will be fewer African -- Americans to go to the county.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you have no evidence that Grand Rapids takes back more than its share, proportionally, than anybody else.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  At the county level?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.  Was there any evidence that your venire -- that minorities were underrepresented on your venire?   John G.

And on December 30th, 2010, the group delegates to itself because it's acting as the board the authority to act until December 31, 2011.  Is that valid?   INTERRUPTING John G.

I think that the police should be able to talk to a defendant, but there's got -- but it's got to be voluntary, and that in order to do that, you really have to get a waiver.  U.S. v. Cardwell I think is an implied waiver where the defendant starts to talk to the officer there -- they're in a police car, and the defendant starts to talk to the officer after an hour and a half of silence, although that, again, isn't a custodial situation, but the police found -- but the court found that that was, in fact, a waiver.

Roberts, Jr.  Is it there any clearly established law the other way, which is the pertinent question?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We're not talking -- we're not talking about the Fifth Amendment right.  We're talking about the Miranda warnings.  There's no issue of voluntariness in this case.  Right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  There's no suggestion that there's -- that the statements are not voluntary.  The suggestion is that they may have violated Miranda.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if he said, do you want to remain silent?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And he doesn't answer either one.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You say you don't have to invoke your rights, but Butler also says that you can impliedly waive them.  You don't have to expressly waive them.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  So the question under AEDPA -- you agree there can be an implied waiver; that's what Butler says, right?  So the question under AEDPA is whether the State court was unreasonable to determine that there was an implied waiver on these facts?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What are those?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And all he has to do is say: I don't want to talk to you.  It's over.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't understand how they create the ambiguity.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess this gets back to a question I had earlier.  I thought there was no dispute on this record that there was no involuntariness.  We are talking about a violation of the technical, important but formal, Miranda requirements.  This is not a case where the person says: My statements were involuntary.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's correct -- and that's where -- how I read Butler; you have to look at the circumstances.  And you're saying no, you don't look at any circumstances; they have got to ask the question and he has to waive.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The other circumstances are irrelevant.  Well then, if yes, why are you talking to me about 2 hours 15 minutes, what they are doing?  You say that circumstances don't matter.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That issue is not in this case, though.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  As I understand it, you've lost at every stage on the voluntariness and have not renewed that, correct?  This is a Miranda case; it's not a Fifth Amendment case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  One?  I mean, that's -- I don't want to piggyback off Justice Kennedy's point, but that's the whole point, is you do not look at any of those circumstances, you say.  Before they can say anything more, they have to get a waiver.  So it's 30 seconds if they go on, before they -- if they sit there for how long before -- how long do they have to ask, do you want to waive?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could -- could you describe a situation where you think there would be an implied waiver?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I thought that -- that doesn't sound implied.

The Nazis have a hospital, and you are giving them advice on how to run a hospital, but the government decides that anything that legitimizes the Nazi Party, you know, promotes that group's terrorist activities.  Can the government make that kind of determination?  I'm thinking of something like Regan v. Wald--   John G.

I didn't mean to suggest we were at war.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I meant to hypothesize a group that the government could reasonably determine should not be supported in any way--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --because it legitimizes it.  It's going to make their hospital run better.  People are going to like their hospital.  So the party, the group, will be legitimized.

I didn't see the argument that we've spent a lot of time talking about, which is the legitimate activities allow the illegitimate activities to take place.   John G.

It seems to me your case is all about O'Brien.  I'm not sure you have an answer to whether or not strict scrutiny is satisfied.

But I would suppose that would come up in the application of the right, rather than in an effort to determine whether parts of it are incorporated or not.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, I think that's exactly -- that's exactly right.  And that is what the Court elaborated on in Duncan.  I do think the focus is our system of ordered liberty, not any abstract system of ordered liberty.  You can say Japan is a free country, but it doesn't have the right to trial by -- by jury.  The -- the concept only makes sense, I think, if you limit it to our system.  Under our system, as you said, the -- the right to a jury is essential.   INTERRUPTING John G.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't see how you can read--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I don't see how you can read Heller and not take away from it the notion that the Second Amendment, whether you'd want to label it fundamental or not, was extremely important to the framers in their view of what liberty meant.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, sure, and it's still going to be subject to the political process if the Court determines that it's incorporated in the Due Process Clause.  All the arguments you make against incorporation, it seems to me, are arguments you should make in favor of regulation under the Second Amendment.  We haven't said anything about what the content of the Second Amendment is beyond what was said in Heller.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And so the argument you make is, well, given this context, you should not be able to have concealed carry.  Well, maybe that's right, but that doesn't mean you don't incorporate the Second Amendment to allow you to enforce that type of regulation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That sounds an awful lot to me like the argument we heard in Heller on the losing side.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, to get back to Justice Breyer's point, which I'm not sure you answered, is your theory that you simply -- it's not a question of is it in or is it out?  But you're saying, well, what is in and what is out, are you?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think it's in or out, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I -- I know your reasons.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm trying to get you to take a position on whether or not you want us to not only pick and choose among which amendments are part of our abstract notion of ordered liberty, or if you want us also to take amendments that might be in and refine them and shave them off a little bit and say, well, this part of the amendment is in, and this part isn't.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So your argument is all in or all out.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's how you think Madison went about his job?

And -- and the point here about the forum is an important one, because Union Pacific has never thought that in these ocean bills of lading that that entitles American cargo interest to have to go to a foreign country under the ocean carrier's bill of lading in order to vindicate the interests in damage to their cargo.  That was an invention by UP sought to remove it under the Carmack Amendment and transfer it to New York, and UP joined that motion and has argued throughout that the Carmack Amendment applies.  It would be unusual, to say the least, to allow UP now to take advantage of a contractual extension of COGSA where section 12 of COGSA, by its plain terms, in language that is completely ignored by the other side, says COGSA stops basically at the tackle-to-tackle period and does -- otherwise does not affect otherwise applicable law.  And there is a specific reference in section 12 to the Harter Act and any other applicable law.  And in 1936, when Congress enacted COGSA to implement the United States -- of the Hague rules, it was aware of the Carmack Amendment.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Ballenger, you have four minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",08-1553
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --But part of your argument -- you don't rely heavily on your plain language argument when it comes to deciding that these huge ocean vessels are rail carriers.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that's a little bit different from your argument that they are a rail carrier because their bill of lading would cover the train ride to Chicago.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If it weren't -- if it weren't for the -- for the track from Long Beach to Los Angeles, you would say then they are not a rail carrier?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, unless we hold, as your friends argue on the other side, that they can opt out under 10709.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that's a different question with respect to liability and claims than with respect to venue.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe now you could respond to my question about the distinction under 10502 between claims and liability and venue.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it's a little -- I mean, am looking at page 64a of the petition appendix, where they are saying you can't exempt through contractual terms for liability and claims.  Venue is treated elsewhere, separately from liability and claims.  So again, under -- you are the plain language team, and that seems fairly plain that venue is not covered.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, the liability is not where you can bring your suit.  Liability is liability.  Venue is where you can bring your suit.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that because they have contracted for them?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they don't own Union Pacific's rail line.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if I -- if I own a container being pulled by somebody else's train, I'm in the train business?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, it wouldn't.  It would just -- it may not just mean that they don't have the regulatory authority because that container is a rail carrier.  What is carrying it is the rail carrier.  It's a container.   ",08-1553
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'll jump on the hobby horse even if Justice Kennedy is jumping off.  I mean, the -- the exception in the TVPA is to the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign state.  That doesn't sound the way you would just establish a cause of action.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Millett.     Edwin S. Kneedler  --We are not addressing that here.  The court of appeals remanded for consideration of common law head of state and other immunities.  Suggestions of immunity traditionally have been tendered to the district court.  And the legislative history of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act shows -- clearly says that the official type immunities -- using the word ""official"" immunity, head of state immunity, diplomatic immunity, consular immunity -- those things are not addressed by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  Section -- section 1602 shows that Congress wanted to take the Executive away because the government was being pressured by foreign governments with respect to the restrictive theory with respect to commercial activities.  And that's where the pressure was being applied, and the Executive Branch wanted to get out of that business, and agreed to.  If you read 1602, it specifically refers to commercial activities.  There was no such conscious abrogation of the Executive's critical role to make immunity determinations on behalf of officials in the legislative history.  And this Court should not strain to read the rigid provisions of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which were just not tailored to the immunities that the Underhill decision of this Court specifically said officials have immunity for their official acts exercising governmental authority.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Dvoretzky, because of that, we'll give you 5 minutes.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's kind of hard -- I mean, I assume the reason you don't rely heavily on it -- because it says that an agency or instrumentality is an entity.  I mean, we usually don't think of individuals as being entities.   ",08-1555
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the state -- there is -- the distinction strikes me as artificial as well.  We're talking about insulating state acts.  The only way a state can act is through people.  And you're saying: Well, the state is insulated, but the people who do the acts for the state are not.  I don't see how that can -- can work.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, well, then -- but the whole point of the Act was to codify what was there before, and -- and it seems odd to say, well, they were codifying the immunity of the state, but not the immunity of the only way a state can act, which is through individuals.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. Millett, I thought--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I thought the whole point of the FSIA was to get the Executive Branch out of the business of sending letters to the court every time a state was sued.  The government requested it for that purpose.  Now they are just back into it again if you say, well, you can just sue the individuals.  And the government's position in this case confirms that.  They're -- they tell us the way you should proceed is to look to the Executive Branch and, basically, we'll send you a letter and let you know.  So it seems to me the whole reason you have the FSIA is undermined by the position you're taking today.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Courts -- courts decide this sort of question all the time, whether you're talking about principles of domestic immunity or even corporate liability: Is the employee on a frolic or is it a detour?  Determining when an individual is acting for another entity as opposed to on -- on his own business, that's a very common inquiry.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your friend -- you friend--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Your friend said it happens all the time.  He cited the example of the Israeli embassy is always sending letters or showing up in court when their agents are -- are sued.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Please.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Finish your sentence.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You made that a long sentence.  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Kneedler.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I wonder -- I wonder if the example you give or the point you make, that there's no functioning Somali Government, doesn't cut the other way.  Let's assume you have somebody who was acting in an official capacity, doing what his job required, whether you like it or not, and then there's a change in the Somali government; and the United States likes the new Somali government.  That guy is kind of put out to -- to dry because he can't get anybody to say what he maintains is true, which was I was acting pursuant to official policy of the government.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And the United States is not going to give him the letter he needs because they like the new Somali government.   ",08-1555

Number two?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Those are all -- all three of those are -- are pretty subtle ways for Congress to change the view in Castillo.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Moving something from the body of the paragraph to a separate section and so on.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Fisher.     Jeffrey L. Fisher  I assume so, but I don't know the specific answer to that, Justice Kennedy.  What there is a dispute about, of course, is whether the -- if it were a sentencing factor, whether the government has to prove knowledge.  And we do emphasize that that would be an alternative basis for this Court to decide this case, by saying you at least have to prove knowledge even if it's a sentencing factor.  And let me just leave you with this, unless there are any further questions: The government makes a couple points in its reply brief suggesting that certain arguments were not preserved or made properly in this case.  The knowledge argument that I just referred to is raised in the brief in opposition for Mr. O'Brien at pages 23 to 25.  So under rule 15 of this Court, that argument was properly presented at the cert stage.  You will also find that argument at pages 34 to 37 of the Joint Appendix.  Also with respect to the Sixth Amendment substantive reasonableness as-applied argument, the government suggests that for some reason, that would be inappropriate for this Court to reach or rely on.  Again, we disagree.  First of all, we can't understand why it would be inappropriate to reach or rely on that constitutional argument, whereas it is apparently appropriate for this Court to address the McMillan argument or the ""overrule Harris"" argument.  They're all three constitutional arguments that are present in this case.  And, again, if there were any doubt they were raised below, pages 38 and 39 of Mr. Burgess's First Circuit brief, pages 32 to 35 of Mr. O'Brien's First Circuit brief, and in the brief in opposition, which the government, in its reply brief at the cert stage, responded to without claiming any error or any waiver problems.  So we think absolutely all the arguments that are made in the blue -- in the red briefs are clearly before you.  If the Court has any additional questions, I would be happy to entertain them.  Otherwise, I am prepared to submit the case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Fisher.  Mr. Horwich, you have 4 minutes remaining.     ",08-1569

Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but we know that's a sentencing factor.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the Court's -- the Court's opinion in Castillo quite carefully noted that it wasn't addressing this statute.  I think it's a little bit of a bait-and-switch to say that, well, Castillo decides this case.   ",08-1569
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You keep talking about phones, and you began by saying this covers phones, but this was -- language was added in 1970?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, there weren't cell phones of the kind you have now.  I think this was directed at the beepers, right, when those were around then, or -- or land-based phones or something like that.  And the technology has so expanded that the reach of the statute has so expanded in a way that brings in a lot more casual users than was the case before.  And I just don't know how that issue of statutory interpretation is supposed to be resolved.  Assuming I'm right that the technology has dramatically expanded the reach of the statute, even if you think it's covered by its terms, how is that issue addressed?  What's the right answer there?  Is it because the terms still cover it, that's -- the breadth has expanded, or because this is something new technologically that the statute shouldn't be construed that broadly?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I know, but let's assume I don't agree -- let's assume I agree with that only in the context of the 1970s technology.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What's the answer then?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It reminds me of these old hypotheticals.  You know, before there were automobiles, you had to have someone with a lantern walk in front of your carriage, and they don't change the law and it still turns out to be the law when you're driving your car, and it doesn't make any sense.  But, I mean, is there a case of ours that says what to do in that case, in such a situation of statutory construction?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but I mean, it's natural to view the woman in that situation more as a victim than as someone facilitating the crime.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not sure that would extend to your case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  This really isn't the transformation of a misdemeanor into a felony.  It's a separate -- separate activity and an activity that facilitates the commission of a crime.  It's much easier to carry out your drug distribution business if people are calling you on their cell phones than if they have to meet you in person or call from a land line.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your gloss on this statute makes -- gives rise to some difficult questions of proof.  I mean, what if it's -- I don't know -- 10 pounds of something, and the guy says, well, I was just buying in bulk for personal use, like a Costco drug dealer.  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you would have lost this case before 1970--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --because the incongruity on which you rely--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --didn't exist then?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  So the scope of this language was changed sub silentio?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but this language: 1970, but not after 1970, because of the changes in some other sections?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, no.  That question goes to whether or not the distribution was a felony.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Miller.     Eric D. Miller  Thank you.   John G.

Saharsky  I think that the idea was that there needed to be -- the State determined that there needed to be -- it was going to solve the problem statewide not only because of the concern under the State constitutions, that it would provide for all ELL students.  And it was not that it would provide the same amount to each school district, but just the same amount per ELL student.  That the State had decided that it was going to fill that responsibility because -- both because of the Constitution and because it's responsible for supervising education statewide.  Thank you.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I guess, as I understand Justice Alito's question, if the prior order is based on funding a particular plan and the State comes back and says, this is a new approach.  It could be for any number of reasons, and say that, you know, the plan is not working, or there have been other budgetary crises in the State that strain what we can afford to spend on this particular program.  Here's another plan.  The funding levels are different.  You should look at it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not a question of progress; it's a question of the plan and the approach.  And I understood the Ninth Circuit -- I'm looking at page 72a -- it talks about the ELL's specific funding that was based on the prior order.  And what I understood the State's submission to be -- look at what the superintendent has done in this particular case, and so on, so that those specific funding levels aren't applicable.  And I would have thought it an extraordinary enough thing for a district court to tell a State legislature: Pass this budget, and you, Legislature, pass it, and -- I guess -- you, Governor, sign it, or you are not going to be in compliance.  And if they've come up with a different way with different funding requirements, I don't know why that's not a changed circumstance that justifies looking at the judgment--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, I don't think the State -- I didn't understand the State to disagree that there's still work to be done.  I thought that the plan -- the point was that their approach had changed, including by No Child Left Behind, that they don't have to reach the same specific funding levels that the district court order required.  And what I understood the Ninth Circuit to say is, no, those specific funding levels are still in place.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there any--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Does -- then does that stay true without regard to what is happening economically to the State?  In other words, the district court can say: You've got to spend this much money on this program, and I don't care what it means for jails, roads, anything else, when there are profound changes in economic circumstances of the sort that everybody's experiencing lately.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I gather it's often the case in institutional litigation of this sort that the political figures, whether it's the Governor or the Attorney General, can't go to the voters say, look, we should spend more money on this.  So they go to the district court judge and say, make us spend more money on this.  And they get the same result they'd wanted in a non-democratic way, particularly when there's a division, such as here the legislature doesn't want to do something, and the Governor or the Attorney General does.  So why should we put a lot of weight on what the representation is when we are at least concerned that it might be a -- I don't mean it in a pejorative sense -- but a collusive piece of litigation?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's hard for the Attorney General to get funding from the legislature for all he wants to do, and this is a way for him to get it, to go to the legislature and say look, you don't have a choice.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I ask just a question that was confusing to me?  What standard for changed circumstances do you understand the Ninth Circuit to have applied?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which is?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I am looking at page 72a of the Ninth Circuit opinion, and the standard they use there is radically changed, not significantly changed.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, if we have a -- if we are confused as to which standard they applied, because at one point they say significantly changed and at another point they say radically changed, what should we do?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Saharsky.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, when you were starting out I heard you articulate a third standard, materially changed.  What is your understanding of the standard applied by the Ninth Circuit?  Was it materially changed, significantly changed or radically changed?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I don't either but I see both of them being different from radically changed.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I still have trouble with the idea of district courts ordering State legislatures to fund it.  Isn't the preferable approach for the district court to say you have a violation, you have to fix it, and I'm going check to see if you fixed it at particular intervals?  And it's up to you, the State, to determine how you are going to fix it.  And the State might change its mind.  They may start out by saying we have got all of this extra money and that's how we will fix it.  Then there is a budget crisis, the kind that we are familiar with, and he says we can't the money, we are going to do it some other way, and here's the way.  But that's kind of the judgment of the State, not for the district court.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why does it order then -- why did its order specify and be linked to the termination of the legislative session, and say you have 12 days left in the session and that's how many days you have to enact this budget?

The bankruptcy judge says, well, you are going to be immune from any traffic accident liability.  And there is a traffic accident, and Travelers said, well, the bankruptcy court said I don't have to pay.  Is that all right?  It's within the jurisdiction as you read it because it involves Travelers, it's related to the funds they submitted into the trust account.  Is that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --No, I know they that didn't intend anything with respect to traffic accidents.  But my question is how far does your theory reach?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Are you suggesting it would be barred -- that Travelers would have protection under a collateral attack?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is that?  It -- it involves one -- it involves the insurance company, its coverage of Johns-Manville.  And the Travelers is saying: Look, we are not going to do it unless you give us this -- this broader immunity.  And the bankruptcy judge does it.  I don't know why it would be outside the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.  It's clearly related to allowing the settlement to go forward.   INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that's not terribly persuasive.  In the statute there are separate provisions, they talk about disclosures  ""in criminal, civil or administrative hearings. ""  ""in a congressional administrative or Government Accounting Office report, or from the news media. ""  Simply because you want to limit ""administrative"" or not limit ""administrative"" does not mean that the other side's view requires news media to be modified by ""Federal"".   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you counsel.  Mr. Hurt.     Mark T. Hurt  Yes, as are many reports, Medicaid reports by private recipients, today.  This report was only done because the local government was a recipient of Federal money, no different from any private recipient, a not-for-profit.  So there was no real distinction there.  It was not really a governmental report, in the truest sense of the word, as it should be construed or regarded for purposes of the public disclosure bar.  And that's -- that shows the real -- one of the real problems of going down to the -- to the local and State level.  You get all of these problems where the recipient is generating the reports rather than the -- the administrator versus the recipient.  You get all those problems going down to this level, the local and State governments, and it shows the real problem with that.  Again, this is the -- the overall statute is Federal, it's to recover the Federal Government's money.  The statute has a strict dichotomy between the Federal Government and everyone else.  If the States or local governments are going to be qui tam relators, they bring it as a private person.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Hallward-Driemeier?       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  As I think the discussion this morning illustrates, the Federal nature of the second category, the phrase that is directly at issue in this case, is self-evident from the text.  The terms congressional and GAO are Federal and under the doctrine or canon of construction noscitur a sociis--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well -- I didn't mean to interrupt.  Clear limitations, you really have only one, right?  I mean you have no argument construing administrative in a Federal way other than it is sandwiched between two other Federal--     --Well, Your Honor, I think that -- that again, as Justice Alito's question at the very beginning of the argument illustrated, the literal language of the word administrative would encompass hearings conducted by private hospitals or universities as well.  Now Petitioner es hewed that interpretation--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, we would just -- we would just take the sections from your brief today and say well no, you have got to read it in the context in which it appears and this is all Federal, which means it's all governmental.     --That's -- that's right, Your Honor, and governmental in a particular nature, of a particular nature, the Federal Government.  As is the Court's decision in Cook County made clear, municipal governmental entities are with respect to the False Claims Act the same as private corporations.  The -- the Court recognized that municipalities are the recipients of many Federal dollars.  In that case the local governmental entity whose conduct is at issue was a county hospital.  And -- and county hospitals receive funds under the same programs that private hospitals--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well -- well, North Carolina has got a government, too.     Excuse me?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  North Carolina has a government, too.     Well, as we note, Your Honor, the statute uses the term ""Government"" with a capital G throughout to refer to the Federal Government.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Same rule for Congress?     Excuse me?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Same rule for congressional?     Well, congressional -- the -- the term congressional is frequently used without a capital, but State legislatures are not referred to as congresses.  And that is one of the anomalies that petitioners simply cannot explain: why Congress would have thought that an administrative report issued by a local school board should give rise to the bar, but a report or a hearing conducted by a State legislature would not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Browning, you have six minutes.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  To -- to follow up, I think it was a question that Justice Breyer asked earlier.

I mean, if we do decide the arguments are pretty much in equipoise, the suggestion was that the Federal government is both the beneficiary and the loser in the qui tam actions, from the sense they lose a percentage of recovery, and so we ought to let them strike the balance.  What argument do you have on your side?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's the same -- that's one of the arguments that, I think, is balanced on the other side.  For example, is -- do -- have we ever said -- and this is an unusual statute, of course, with a private Attorney General and all that.  Have we -- does -- is there any authority for the idea that we should read it restrictively because of that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Have we ever -- have we ever said that that's a basis for reading the act restrictively?   ",08-304X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, are you sure that -- your argument is that this is sandwiched between two Federal descriptions?  Are you sure ""congressional"" is limited to Federal Congress?  The first definition in Black's Dictionary is ""a formal meeting of delegates"".  And I don't know -- maybe I should -- I don't know if all 50 States refer to their legislature by some term other than ""Congress"".   ",08-304X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I remember, perhaps incorrectly, from the prior argument here that the period that they had to try out the school plan was ten days?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not a hard and fast rule.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So is that -- is that a period that your client's prepared to accept?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --why isn't it the case that the school's diagnosis is a related service under the statutory provision?  It seems to me to be very important service to the parents to know what the school's diagnosis is.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I'm talking about what the parents received.  And they receive a diagnosis, and the statute covers -- asks whether they previously received special education and related services.  Diagnosis would seem to me to be a service related to special education.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Salmons.     Eric D. Miller  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Feinerman, you have 4 minutes remaining.     ",08-305X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is wrong with ten days?  I mean it's -- it's a big expense you are asking the school district to incur, that will take away funds from other programs.  And all -- all they are saying is give it a try for ten days, and if it doesn't work out, then you can go?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, yes, the first day -- the first day they say, look, we don't think this is going to work out, so we are notifying you what we are going to do.  And they say, well, you've got to do that in ten days, and they said, okay, ten days.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I suppose that's right, but once the law is clarified, schools that specialize in -- in treating these kids would be able -- they would understand as well, and they would understand you've got to -- the people who are going to be sending -- most of the people who will be sending their children to the school have to wait ten days.  And it seems to me that the actual practice on the ground would work out pretty easily.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, which way does that cut?  It seems to me that cuts the other way.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Here's a -- here's a new plan.  We've worked on it.  Here it is.  At least give it ten days -- two school week tries.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  With respect, counsel, what Congress provided is that the child must have previously received special education and related services.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So I think they did provide that you've got to try it out at least for a minimal period.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So what type of special education services do you think do count as having been previously received?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In reading -- in reading it that way, you are reading the phrase  ""who previously received special education services. ""  to mean also who previously did not receive special education services.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, so it doesn't matter whether they previously received or not.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you are saying Congress went to the trouble of spelling out this elaborate provision in (C)(iii) and (ii) and all the other things, but that was not the universe of the situations in which there could be reimbursement?  They went to that trouble, but then -- at the end you want to say or some other provisions or some other circumstances?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Miller.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, for 10 days, right?  Even assuming the bad faith that you are ascribing to the school district, it would only work for 10 days, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And then they would have -- then they would have previously received special education services, and they could proceed.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  ""Stonewall"" sounds to me like bad faith.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That was the word you used.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let's move to the situation where they have a plan that the parents regard as inadequate.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In that situation all they would have to do is to have the child try the plan for 10 days.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, this is Spending Clause legislation.  Do you have any rough idea of how much of the obligation incurred by the States is reimbursed by the Federal Government?  What percentage?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if this interpretation vastly expands the liability of school districts in that particular area, isn't that a consideration we should consider?  Since they accept -- the States accept 10 percent of the funds to incur these obligations and then you are expanding the obligation in a way that we may at least find is ambiguous, isn't that a pertinent factor?

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, the (.) the (.) our (.) our decision in City of Boerne said that action under section 5 has to be congruent and proportional to what it's trying to remedy.  Here, as I understand it, one-twentieth of 1 percent of the submissions are not precleared.  That, to me, suggests that they are sweeping far more broadly than they need to, to address the intentional discrimination under the Fifteenth Amendment.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's like the old (.) you know, it's the elephant whistle.  You know, I have this whistle to keep away the elephants.  You know, well, that's silly.  Well, there are no elephants, so it must work.  I mean, if you have 99.98 percent of these being precleared, why isn't that reaching far too broadly.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let me focus on that historical aspect.  Obviously no one doubts the history here and that the history was different.  But at what point does that history seek (.) stop justifying action with respect to some jurisdictions but not with respect to others that show greater disparities?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, so your answer is that Congress can impose this disparate treatment forever because of the history in the south?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  When can they (.) when can they (.) when do they have to stop?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they said five years originally and then another 20 years.  I mean, at some point it begins to look like the idea is that this is going to go on forever.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why didn't Congress then extend the Act to Massachusetts, whereas your brother told us the disparity between Hispanic and non-Hispanic voting is far greater than jurisdictions that are covered?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I thought (.) I thought our opinion in City of Boerne said that the problem that Section 5 legislation addresses has to be widespread and persisting.  Do you think the record that is before us today shows widespread and persisting discrimination in voting?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Adegbile.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So is it your (.) is it your position that today southerners are more likely to discriminate than northerners?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your answer is yes?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So (.) but I guess that point depends upon the assumption that shortening the time period for early voting is discriminatory as opposed to good policy.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that was largely to protect the incumbent.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, incumbent--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Incumbent protection takes place in the North as well as the South.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the cases you're talking about include both intentional and impact cases.  And the Constitution that section 5 is designed to implement covers only intentional discrimination.  So even the examples you have given sweep broadly as a prophylactic measure and then the section 5 preclearance of course sweeps even more broadly.  So we do have a situation, despite the evidence that was (.) that you have cited, where less than one-twentieth of 1 percent of the submissions that the States make are denied preclearance.  Again, it seems to me that that means that section 5 sweeps very, very broadly.   ",08-322X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I -- I suppose, if the case is moot, then you are entitled to a Munsingwear order.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So there's no controlling authority.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And then I suppose the district court doesn't know whether to award damages or not until it gets a final decision from -- or a decision from the Seventh Circuit or this Court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But surely your position is going to be that the statutory procedure pre-empts and takes the place of any Slocum hearing, isn't it?  I mean, somebody comes in and files a petition saying, here I'm raising this right under, you know, an early 19th century procedure, and you're not going to say, okay, here's our position or here's the property.  You are going to say, wait until the forfeiture proceeding that is provided under Illinois law.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Slocum then is the answer to a very different case.  It's a case where you have a class action of people whose cases fell through the cracks and never got the procedures they were entitled to.  It doesn't seem at all responsive to the claim that they are entitled to procedures before it falls through the cracks.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We will afford you additional time because the Court's questions have intruded upon your rebuttal time.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Jay.     William M. Jay  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to begin, if I may, with the colloquy that Justice Stevens and Justice Scalia had with my co-counsel about the hypothetical where the State mandates a minimum time--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I would think you'd begin with the mootness question.   William M. Jay  --I would be happy to begin with the mootness question, Your Honor.  And I -- although I think that it's, to some degree, a question for the Respondents what precisely they are seeking.  Because there are two Respondents, Yunker and Williams, who have lost their property.  The property is in the possession of the State.  And if their position is that unless a hearing is held within 10 days, which is what they originally asked for in their complaint, a probable cause hearing within 10 days, if after that no forfeiture is possible because timely post-deprivation process has not been afforded, if that's their claim, then it appears their claim is still alive because the State still has their property.  If, however, their claim expires when the forfeiture proceeding is actually held, then that proceeding is over and we agree that their injunctive claims are moot.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Peters.     Thomas Peters  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Castiglione, why don't you take 3 minutes?

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but then if it's -- if it's money that is being conditionally released, there's no security for the government.  If it turns out later on it shouldn't have been released, it's probably gone.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if -- what if at your innocent owner or the hearing that you are seeking, you establish, well, I was going to sell my baseball card to give me the money to -- to survive, to get food?  That was my -- I mean, what happens then?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So just to get back to the cars, I thought your answer to Justice Alito was a little abstract.  In the absolute concrete case, where the drug -- the suspect is driving the car, there are drugs in the car.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  At your hearing, the -- it's not registered to him.  The registered owner comes in and says, that's my car, I had no idea it was being used for drugs.  Who wins, the State or the registered owner?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, aren't they always going to say that?  They are going to say, well, we don't know if the registered owner is involved in the drug conspiracy.  We don't know how closely he is tied with the owner, so it's reasonable to assume he knew what was going on, and besides, we've got a lot of other bigger fish to fry during this period.  We are trying to find out the scope of the conspiracy.  We are trying to find out where the sales were going to take place.  Why do you force us to -- to focus our energies on the relationship between a registered owner and the guy driving the car?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's as -- so it's as applied in every case, which I think ties in a little bit to the mootness question that we began with.  Because it focuses on the circumstances of the individual claimants, and if the individual claimants have already had their property returned, I think it accentuates the mootness issue.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's an interesting -- that's an interesting question.  I mean, is it becoming moot through their voluntary cessation or activity when the State law requires them to take particular action?   INTERRUPTING ",08-351X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  There is some disagreement among the parties, of course, what ""direct evidence"" means, whether it means direct as opposed to circumstantial, or direct in -- in the terms that for example Judge Colloton put it in the decision below.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you're telling us that we've never required direct evidence, when you're not taking a position on what direct evidence is?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, you may be right or you may be wrong.  But we kind of have to know what we're dealing with.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, in your petition, you asked -- you used the phrase ""direct evidence"".  And I just want to know in what sense you mean that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In your response to Justice Souter's question, you said you're only focusing on the direct evidence threshold.  But if direct evidence is the threshold to give you the benefit of shifting the burden of persuasion of the employer, is it really fair for you to be able to say, we are only going to take out one side of the balance; we're going to leave the other side of the balance there?  It seems to me that it's artificial to separate the two requirements, the two aspects of the Price Waterhouse inquiry.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand the difficulty of figuring out who is controlling in -- in Price Waterhouse.  But at least as it has been applied, my understanding -- I understand it has been applied in different ways.  My understanding of what people mean when they say ""the Price Waterhouse approach"", which is that there is a higher showing of evidence, direct evidence, whatever -- people don't agree on what that means.  But if you meet that showing, then the burden of persuasion shifts to the employer on the issue of causation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Blatt.     Lisa S. Blatt  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think both on a substantive level and a procedural level Desert Palace largely resolves this case.  The question presented is the one of should you have a direct evidence requirement to obtain a mixed motive instruction under the Age Act?  And there is the procedural posture, which is Desert Palace left unresolved a lot of very difficult and complicated questions about when do you get to the jury on mixed motives and what is the requirement that separates a mixed motive motivating factor instruction from the ""but for"" or commonly known as the McDonnell Douglas?  And Desert Palace left all that unresolved.  On the question presented, there has -- the same conflict in the circuits under the Age Act is the same conflict in the circuits that was under Title VII -- is, do you need any kind of evidentiary special showing to get to a mixed motive, and, if so, is it noncircumstantial evidence or evidence that directly ties--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why don't you--   Lisa S. Blatt  The third reason--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I will let you get your third reason in, in a minute, but why -- do you really think it's fair to pick one part of a complicated test that the court has constructed and say, well, this one doesn't make any sense, and pull it out?  I mean, maybe it only makes sense in the context of the whole construct, or maybe none of the elements actually make sense.  But it seems to me very artificial to focus on one aspect and say, let's fix this, without assessing what its impact is on the rest of the test.   Lisa S. Blatt  --I see your point, even though that's exactly what you did in Desert Palace.  But Price Waterhouse is a 2-decade-old decision.  We're 20 years past that, and it has been essentially codified in Title VII.  So no matter what you do to, quote unquote, VII, and a motivating factor instruction is codified, and you unanimously held in Desert Palace there's no special evidentiary requirement.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that was because -- that was because of the 1991 Act, which addressed Title VII and quite deliberately left ADEA out.   Lisa S. Blatt  Unless you overrule Price Waterhouse, which would be an upheaval in the law, and certainly -- this wouldn't be the appropriate case to do it, all of the courts of appeals have unanimously held under the Age Act and under a wide variety of State statutes and other Federal discrimination statutes that the Price Waterhouse burden-shifting framework applies.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You are asking us to overrule the aspect of Price Waterhouse involving direct evidence, at least if you look at Justice O'Connor's opinion.   Lisa S. Blatt  Right, but I don't think you need to decide that question.  In a lot of other contexts, you have said, well, there's language in our opinion that may have been confusing or it's not clear what the holding is, but we henceforth are going to clarify, here's what the law is.  You did it in the recent crack cocaine case in Spears, you did it in your nude dancing case, and you did it in a case called Jefferson v. City of Tarrant -- County, an opinion Justice Ginsburg authored, that you said: Well, there's some language here that subsequent cases have made clear, and there's lots of reasons why you would not impose a ""direct evidence"" requirement, however you define that term.  Since Desert Palace, there is the decision of Sprint/United v. Mendelsohn.  And I think that case a fortiori forecloses all the arguments made by the other side that, well, even if it doesn't mean non-circumstantial evidence, it must mean something that is highly relevant to the issue of discrimination.  In Sprint/United, you said: We're not going to have a per se rule about what's relevant to prove discrimination.  The Court said the same thing in Reeves.  I think that was a unanimous decision.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what would be the position of the Solicitor General on just saying let's get rid of all these artificial court constructions and say this is like any other case, the plaintiff has the burden of persuasion, and the defendant can come up with what defenses he has, including that I did this for some other reason -- it wasn't because of age -- and the jury looks at it and decides whom they believe?   Lisa S. Blatt  You would still have the same issue as you have under the constitutional regime of what is causation?  And if you asked my opinion, the Solicitor General in -- in Price Waterhouse itself argued something different that no Justice adopted.  We argued a standard of causation that no one -- no one was persuaded by.  Six went off on this motivating factor with the burden-shifting approach, and three of the Justices would have applied a straight ""but for"" causation--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The statute -- the statute has language.  It says ""because of"".   Lisa S. Blatt  --And it--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Tell the jury that.   Lisa S. Blatt  --Absolutely.  And it did in Title VII, and this Court, for better or worse -- regardless of what you think -- in Price Waterhouse, six Justices defined the language ""because of"".  And we have Price Waterhouse now that is codified.  And so--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Go ahead and make your third point briefly.   Lisa S. Blatt  Oh, on why you shouldn't decide it?  I mean, it's essentially this: That this is complicated, difficult under Title VII.  That's the leading anti-discrimination statute.  I think the Court may want to resolve these very legitimate important questions in a Title VII case, because you have got statutory language.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Phillips.     Carter G. Phillips  Right.  No, I don't -- there's no question that -- that -- well, there is a question on that.  It's not before you.  It's -- it's back in front of the Eighth Circuit.  But there is still the issue of whether a motivating factor, meaning that it played a role, is a sufficient basis on which to trigger the -- the burden-shifting instruction in this case.  That -- that is the narrowest basis on which this Court could affirm by simply saying that Justice White's opinion requires a substantial showing.  The instruction in this case clearly doesn't accomplish that, and, therefore, the Court should set that aside, or the Court should affirm the Eighth Circuit and remand so that the district court can have a new trial on that issue.  If there are no further questions, I'd urge the Court to affirm.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Now, Mr. Schnapper, 2 minutes.     ",08-441X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I get back to Justice Stevens's hypothetical?  You have two people making a decision; one says it's because of age, the one because of something, and -- a legitimate factor -- and you acknowledge that that could get to the jury?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And is it under an instruction that simply says ""because of""?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but I mean -- you say--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --You say ""but for"" causation, but my understanding of Justice Stevens's hypothetical is that it's going to be very hard to say that one would not have had -- the discrimination, the alleged action, would not have happened but for one factor or the other if they are just two different factors.  You would just leave that up to the jury to say ""because of""?   ",08-441X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's correct with respect to a particular loan.  It's not respect -- with respect to Federal policy about national banks around the country.  It's conceivable and I suppose likely that the Federal regulator would want the same rule to apply to banks in Michigan as to banks in Hawaii.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  There is an historic reason for thinking that Congress would be more concerned about States exercising visitorial powers than they would be about private attorneys general or private lawyers.  This goes back to McCulloch v. Maryland.  National banks were always targeted by the States.  They weren't typically targeted by private attorneys.  So that incongruity doesn't strike me as terribly significant.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you want to talk a little bit about Chevron?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Whatever the arguments may be on the merits, it's not clear to me that visitorial powers has an unambiguous meaning that would pre-empt the authority of the OCC to explain it to us.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but -- I'm sorry, but it certainly is pre-empted with respect to visitorial powers.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  This kind of gets us back to where we started.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Stewart.     Seth P. Waxman  May I answer?  I believe that it would if those incidental authorities are in fact authorized, approved and regulated by the OCC, but this case doesn't require you to address it, because this is an express power under section 371(a).   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Thank you, counsel.  Five minutes, Ms. Underwood.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, why isn't it a complete answer to what I agree is a somewhat unusual situation of pre-empting enforcement but not the substance of law that its enforcement that raises the concerns?  That the Federal Government thinks the State law is fine, but when you get attorneys general enforcing it in a particular way, that's what causes the problem.  And I mean, the problem arises in a lot of areas.  Even within the Federal Government, the FBI and DEA have different ways of enforcing that might conflict with each other.  Why doesn't that make perfect sense?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, why -- why is it a mistake?  Why can't Congress or the OCC think that that's where the difficulties are going to arise?  In other words, it's kind of a less intrusive approach, and saying, well, you can have your State law but we are concerned about enforcement, so we are going to be the ones that enforce it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your answer is because they have different entities that can enforce it, they are sort of in for a penny, in for a pound?  If you let anybody else enforce it, you have got to let everybody else enforce it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Including the entities that have historically have targeted national banks?   ",08-453X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is your concern that -- not with the substantive State law, but that leaving enforcement to the States would cause particular problems?  I mean there may be a State law provision that says you shall do this, and the way the attorney general elects to enforce it is by shutting the bank down, jailing the bank officers, doing all sorts of things that -- that the -- the Federal Government may not consider appropriate.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Any place, even though he had perhaps no reasonable suspicion to suspect that she was hiding the contraband in her underwear?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Any place?  I mean, prison inmates, for example, are subject to much more intrusive searches.  Are you suggesting that would have been justified in this case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I ask just a follow-up on your answer to Justice Kennedy's earlier question about whether the informant was subject to civil suit.  When you said no, did you mean she hadn't been sued or that she could not be sued?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  When was the -- when was she detained there in relation to the lunchtime period, which was when the other student had said that all the kids were going to take these pills?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Wright.  Mr. O'Neil.     David O'Neil  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Intrusive body searches in the school context implicate fundamentally different expectations of privacy than other -- other kinds of searches.  For that reason, they require greater justification under the Fourth Amendment.  In the government's view, the best way to give effect to that greater showing is to adhere to the basic reasonable suspicion standard of T.L.O., but to elaborate on that standard in two ways.  First--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Before you get started, do we have to reach the underlying merits or can we just decide the qualified immunity issue?   David O'Neil  --The government agrees with the parties and all amici in this case that this Court should address the substantive Fourth Amendment issue.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Should -- should, but must?   David O'Neil  This Court could decide the case on qualified immunity grounds alone.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That sounds like you--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --That sounds to me like the sliding scale that you reject from the Ninth Circuit.   David O'Neil  --No, because we believe that where you have reasonable suspicion that there is contraband in the underwear, then you could go directly to that location, and you wouldn't have to work from the outside in.  But, Justice Scalia, it takes--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, surely not.  You are saying if you have reasonable suspicion that it's in the underwear, you shouldn't even bother searching the pack or the pockets.  You should go straight to the underwear.  That can't be right.   David O'Neil  --Well, to take T.L.O. as an example, Justice Scalia, in that case the Court believed that there was reasonable suspicion that the student had cigarettes in her purse because that was the obvious place to find them.  Now, if the -- if the school principal in that case had searched the purse, searched the student's pocket, searched the locker, searched the desk, I don't think this Court would have said that there was reasonable suspicion to believe that the cigarettes were in--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if your -- accepting your argument that there may be no reasonable suspicion based on Marissa saying this is the person who gave me the drugs, does the fact that she said kids are going to -- the kids are going to take these drugs at lunchtime, a specific time, does that present a difference in the level of concern that the school should have?   David O'Neil  --We believe that the schools may take seriously any information they receive and must take seriously any information they receive about the presence of prescription pills on campus.  And the fact that the teacher believed that these pills were going to be consumed at lunch as part of an event that obviously wasn't simply intended to get rid of the students' headaches, we believe that that would give rise to reasonable suspicion to initiate some search.  But we believe that without some particularized suspicion or some specific indication that this, the location, was a likely one to contain the drugs, that this search was excessively intrusive.  And this is not a new standard.  This is essentially the same standard this Court adopted in the Montoya De Hernandez case for intrusive body searches in other contexts.  It has proved workable in that context and we believe that it would prove workable here.  We believe that it is also better than the alternatives of a higher level of suspicion, which does not bear any necessary logical correlation to the likelihood that the--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is a school administrator supposed to know?  Marissa says: She gave me these pills.  What are they?  I don't know.  And so how is the -- if it depends whether it's a dangerous drug like crack or a relatively -- not harmless, but a different one like ibuprofen, the search depends on that, how is the school administrator supposed to know?   David O'Neil  My point was simply with a drug like crack there is a more common understanding that a drug like that can be hidden in a student's -- in underwear.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what is the school administrator supposed to know when he sees a white pill and doesn't know if it's something terribly harmful, even deadly, or if it's prescription strength ibuprofen?  You say in the former case he can search undergarments, in the latter case he can't.  So how is the administrator supposed to know what he's dealing with?   David O'Neil  Well, we believe that, as I said, school administrators have to take seriously all medication like this on campus.  My point was simply that where a particular type of contraband is known to be carried in a certain way, that can be relevant to the totality--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry, your answer to me was they have to take it seriously.  My question to you is, what is the administrator supposed to do?  He sees a white pill; nobody can tell him what it is.  Is he allowed at that point to search the undergarments or not?   David O'Neil  --No.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  He's not?   David O'Neil  He is not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even if it turns out to be -- you know, I don't know, some very deadly drug?   David O'Neil  Mr. Chief Justice, we do not believe that this Court should get in the business of deciding that searches are okay for, for example, heroin, but not okay for cocaine.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's what you just told us we should do, in answer to Justice Alito's question.   David O'Neil  No, I simply -- the point was simply that if there is some common understanding that a type of contraband is generally secreted in a certain way, and the example is crack, and there is a known understanding that crack can be hidden in that way, that that would be relevant to the totality of the circumstances.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   David O'Neil  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Wolf.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Wolf.  Mr. Wright, you have 3 minutes remaining.     ",08-479X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't think the case can begin and end with that because we have the separate issue of qualified immunity.  Can we take that off the table?  I mean, we have got six to five in the Ninth Circuit, disagreement throughout in this case, and yet you say the rule is so clearly established that you can make these school officials personally liable.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --What if what Marissa has is heroin?  The school administrator recognizes heroin.  She says: This is what the student gave me?  Search the undergarments or not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Just to combine it with -- with your answers to Justice Kennedy, you are saying it's unreasonable to take off the outer garments even if your suspicion, reasonable suspicion for justifying the preliminary search is that the student has heroin?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you've made that point several times.  In fact the issue here covers the brassier as well, which doesn't seem as outlandish as the underpants, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe I'm -- maybe I'm not articulating this.  You keep focusing on the fact that it's unlikely that the pills would be concealed in her underpants.  That doesn't go to the brassiere at all.   ",08-479X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that would be a remarkable coincidence if her equipment happened to be worth exactly what Congress said she could exempt, which is a very odd way of reading what she's put in the schedule.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I would have thought the most natural way of reading it is that she's claiming the equipment because she thinks that's the value of the equipment.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, thank you, Mr. Goldblatt.  I'll afford you rebuttal time.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Wall.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what does she put down if she thinks this is what the property is worth, but she doesn't know for sure?  I mean, I don't know how you would accurately value a bunch of kitchen equipment.  What is she supposed to do?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that goes through -- I think as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, you have to go through a long process if you're going to have an auction, and for this sole proprietorship, it seems like a waste of money and time.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's right.  I mean, this is a government form, and you say, even though it says ""Value of the claimed exemption"" and ""Current market value"", that these debtors should know, oh, you should put in, as your friend said, put in an asterisk and write something else in there.   INTERRUPTING ",08-538X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if it turns out that this business equipment was worth $100,000 and the trustee looks at it and says, oh, she's only claiming -- you know, less than she's entitled, $10,000, and doesn't object, she gets that dramatic windfall.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no, no.  She -- she -- and it may be even in good faith or -- or bad faith, depending on the rule we -- we adopt, but she gets that incredible bonus because it turns out her business equipment is worth a lot more than she put down.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, this -- the trustee doesn't know.  He doesn't know.  He looks at it and says, oh, that sounds like kitchen equipment might be worth that, and so he doesn't object.  What you're doing is, I think Justice Kennedy pointed out, you're requiring the trustee to object to everything, lest he lose the $100,000 that it turns out this is worth.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but the point is, that drags out the whole process.  You're imposing a burden on the trustee.  He loses everything if he doesn't object, and I think the idea is that these things move as quickly as you can, and you don't want the trustees -- you know, I may be severely prejudiced; the creditors might if I don't object, so I'm going to object to everything; we'll sort it out later.   ",08-538X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but this is different.  I mean, this is part of an expense of a fund.  They don't get fees, but -- but they get -- they have to pay for the lawyers, just like they have to pay for management advice.  So why wouldn't you review the lawyers' fees to make sure they are fair?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel for the fund.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if -- if you are having courts decide -- review what is fair, a fair fee, what if the adviser had given such good advice that the fund beat the industry average for his category of fund by 5 percent over the last 5 years.  Does he get double the normal compensation of the average fees?  Does he get triple?  50 percent more?  How is the court supposed to decide that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, surely you think it is.  When you say they don't give the money back, you are not suggesting that the amount of the fees should be the same regardless of whether they outperform by 10 percent or not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but there is different parameters, right, in the sense that you're trying -- the company is trying to attract investors to the mutual fund.  If you are advising a pension fund, it is not the case that they are trying to attract pensioners who have other choices.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do technological changes make a difference in terms of disclosures required?  These days all you have to do is push a button and you find out exactly what the management fees are.  I mean, you just look it up on Morningstar and it's right there and you can make -- as an investor you can make whatever determination you'd like, including to take your money out.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So we could look at -- you know, as the fund grows bigger and he doesn't get those benefits he can go look at another fund.  It takes 30 seconds.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Companies -- companies change who they invest with under the 401(k)'s all the time.  The employees are not happy with the return they are getting because the company has limited their choices, they change.  It happens all the time.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You told me just a little while ago, or told somebody, Congress wasn't interested in protecting investors; they were interested in protecting the companies.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Gannon.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, if we are going to have regulation of what fees can be charged, you cite in your brief the various regulations the SEC has issued.  It makes a lot more sense to have the SEC regulate rates than to have courts do it, doesn't it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You are not suggesting the SEC wouldn't have authority to do that, are you?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, the statute does not say, in considering the rates you look at all the circumstances.  Am I right?  It says, in considering whether to defer to the board, you look at all the circumstances.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The board.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  But isn't that different than saying, in looking at what the rates should be or whether they are excessive, you look at all the circumstances?  It may well be that you don't defer to the board, but that doesn't mean it's a free-for-all in deciding what you do look at.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Donovan.     John D. Donovan Jr.  I don't think it is, Your Honor.  And, again, I would go back to what Judge Kocoras said on 32(a).  There was absolutely suggestions in the record by the plaintiff that they would have negotiated differently, but, for example, with respect to ostensible misrepresentations on -- among other things, profitability and the rest, this was because the plaintiffs' expert did an accounting and accounted for costs differently and said, had you accounted for costs and allocated them the way I did, you would have reached a negotiated result that was different.  Well, that just isn't what happened.  That's why Judge Kocoras said, this goes to the integrity of the negotiation.  Would the negotiation have been different?  The plaintiffs say, I would have done it differently, but that's all they said, and it's not a misrepresentation to say, I would have accounted for costs differently.  Finally, I would -- the other question you asked is where in the record -- Justice Scalia, I'm sorry.  It's at page 161 and following, where the background of all the difference in fees and the difference in services is chronicled.  You can tell, from the pull-out charts at page 171, what fee is charged for each of these mutual funds and what fee is charged for institutional accounts.  If you take the plaintiffs' point of view and say that a comparison to institutional accounts is always required and may be dispositive and is always a fraction of what mutual fund charges and that judges are the, in the first instance, the ones to decide who is fair and reasonable or what is fair and reasonable, as opposed to directors, I suggest you consign 8,000 mutual funds to a trial.  On this record, these were funds that had best in class performance for fees that were at or below industry averages.  That is not a record upon which a reasonable person could conclude that the adviser has over-reached.  That is at the heart of fiduciary duty.  I see my time is about to expire.  Thank you, Your Honor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Frederick, you have three minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Was your friend correct, that these funds have better than average performance and lower than average fees?   ",08-586X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what is ""so far out of bounds""?  In other words, you are saying, you can look at what the directors did if it's, as you said, too far out of bounds, but 10 percent off, 50 percent off?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Double, as they say is the case here?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Double, as they say is the case here?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then you say: Look to see if it's outside the bounds, and now you tell me there is no way to look to see if it's outside the bounds.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  When you say you should look at the range and how far it's off, do you mean that in the Gartenberg sense -- in other words, if it is way out of line, then you assume or can at least look further at whether there was a fair process?  Or do you mean it in the normal case, in sort of setting the rates you just look how far it is off.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's probably -- you're not the person to -- to ask, but do you understand the Solicitor General's position to be your understanding of the Gartenberg sense or something else?

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Blume.     John H. Blume  I'm sorry, since Penry.  Since Penry there have been new developments, and I believe that a new consensus exists, the one that this Court subsequently embraced, and it violates the Eighth Amendment and the Ohio Constitution to execute persons with mental retardation.  And it was in response to that claim that the State conceded the fact of mental retardation, and it was in response to that claim that the State court found again Mr. Bies to be a person with mental retardation.  That wasn't in some question of the balance of aggravating circumstances.  That was a straight claim that you cannot execute me because I have mental retardation.  And so I was really responding more to Justice Souter's questions of judicial estoppel and was it the same issue in this, and I think it clearly was at that time in this particular context.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Mizer, you have ten minutes remaining.     ",08-598X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  How far -- how far down do you go on applying the issue preclusion?  Let's say there's a ruling by the court that a particular expert was not credible.  I mean, is that binding in a subsequent proceeding?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's narrowing it to your particular context.  I would have assumed that the theory has to be more generally applicable, and not just applicable in the particular Atkins context.  If you can have issue preclusion with respect to an underlying factual question under which the loser can assert that, I don't see why it wouldn't apply more generally.  That's a theory of the Double Jeopardy Clause, not of Atkins.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, this strikes me as the sort of case where their incentives might well be different, as Justice Ginsburg suggested.  If you're dealing with a borderline case, you don't -- and you think you have very compelling aggravating factors, you know, why call attention to the -- the mitigating factor of the mental condition when your case can be won on the others?

No matter how clear it is what happened below, if it wasn't included in the question presented, we say you can't raise it.  This is just a rule like that.  They have a rule saying this is what you have to do, you have got to put the evidence of conferencing in -- in the record at a particular time.  You didn't do it, so we are not going to -- the fact that on the facts, on the real facts, it occurred is not an adequate challenge to the procedural rule.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You think there is now?  In other words, this is -- rulemaking by adjudication is not unheard of.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So is it -- is -- where is the rule that there has to be conferencing?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think -- you think that was where the board erred, in requiring conferencing?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's -- can the board adopt procedures about how you go about proving conferencing?  You say there is no rule because there wasn't a rule adopted in 1934.  There is a rule that there has to be conferencing.  Does that mean that at any point in time you can just pop up and say, oh, by the way, there was conferencing?  Or can the board say, this is how you go about establishing it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So they can -- the board can never have a rule that says, you have to establish conferencing, you know, before the date of the first arbitral proceeding, or within 30 days?  The fact that all that has to happen under the act is that there be conferencing, you are free to establish it at any way you want, at any time you want?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where -- where does it say the unions have to send in letters requesting a conference?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So could the board -- could the board adopt a rule requiring that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Just to be clear -- I will take you off the hook.  [Laughter]  Just to be clear, you say it's established practice that the railroads normally file their objection at a -- you know, at a particular point, and you think the board is without power to say: Look.  This is the established practice.  You, railroad, did not follow it, and so we're not going to consider your objections.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  You mean that they -- the board can't do that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought, under the Steelworkers trilogy, the arbitrators has broad deference to adopt these sorts of modes of procedure.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That we would review only for whatever it is.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the review -- the review of government arbitrators arbitrating provisions pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, the standard of review of that is different than private arbitrators under the Steelworkers trilogy?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you don't think that this is that.  I mean, if you say: Look.  Here's the rule.  You have got to file these things by this date, that is not imposing your own rule of industrial justice.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm saying that, if the board adopts a procedure exactly like that, you may challenge it as -- as violating due process because you didn't have notice, any number of things, but you can't say that the board is imposing its own brand of industrial justice.  That sort of seems, to me, goes to the merits in the standards of arbitration, rather than procedures like this, unless it's a procedure like was hypothesized earlier, that only applies to one side and not the other.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Presumably, there is none that says they don't have to be.  In other words, I take it that this is an issue that is simply not addressed by the CFR rules?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you are just disputing the validity or applicability of the rule.  You don't want to comply with the rule.  I mean, is it any different than saying: Look, okay, we've got this arbitration that is going to go forward.  We are going to meet at 10:00 Monday morning.  It is the first meeting.  One side doesn't show up and then they say, well, there's no rule that says we have to be there at 10:00 Monday morning; that's just the arbitrator saying that to -- to move the procedure along, so you can't penalize us in any way for not showing up at 10:00 Monday morning.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you recall the situation -- do you recall the situation Justice Breyer described, and we can debate about it, whether it's rulemaking by adjudication, which does take place, you would say that in the situation you described, it violated due process, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think you could submit that offer of proof at any time during the proceeding and the board would have to accept it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why wouldn't the other side say we don't have to raise the objection at a particular time.  You can't make a rule telling us we have to do that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your answer to my earlier question is that you can submit that offer of proof at any time, and it has to be considered?   ",08-604X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  The answer you just gave about concern for the protection of the child, that applies only to the child?  In other words, in the case that we have been discussing, if the woman would be subject to whatever persecution or domestic violence, but the child -- you know, there's no suggestion of any harm targeted to the child, that would not be a case in which they could grant refuge?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  To only -- only to the child?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the woman would be subject to -- if she wanted to remain with the child, there would be no protection.  She would have to choose between subjecting herself to violence or being apart from the child?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That would be consistent with the convention, for the returning state to say, we are returning the child, but only if -- you know, bang, bang, bang?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Anders.     Ginger D. Anders  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The ne exeat provision at issue in this case gave Petitioner the power to prevent exactly the harm that is the Hague Convention's central concern.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that if -- so that if you have the mother taking her daughter from, say, a country where she would be forced to be raised under sharia law and that -- that is up to that country to decide whether the child has to be returned?  Or is there a basis for a domestic tribunal in the court, in the -- what is it called, the country of refuge?  Can that country decide that the child should not be returned?   Ginger D. Anders  --There are narrow defenses to return, and one of those is the grave risk defense in article 13(b).  There's also a fundamental principles defense in article 20.  But, fundamentally, I think the convention is premised on the idea that the courts of the various states parties will be well-placed to determine the custody--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's your position that, in that case, the mother should return her daughter to the country where she will be raised under a system that the mother finds quite offensive?   Ginger D. Anders  --Well, that would not necessarily be the case.  Presumably, that mother could raise the 13(b) defense or the article 20 defense to return, and--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And what -- I know Ms. Howe cited it.  What is the standard on the 13(b) defense?   Ginger D. Anders  --It says,  ""A grave risk that the return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm. ""   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does -- does the status of, in this case, women in the country, does that constitute grave risk, or is it an individualized determination?   Ginger D. Anders  I think it would generally be an individualized determination.  But I think the convention is based on the assumption that wherever -- wherever the parent started out, wherever their custody determinations are being made to begin with, that is the country that should continue in the normal situation to determine what should be in the interest--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that country is going to make a determination in favor of their domestic law and their domestic system.  Presumably, they are not going to say: We think it's a grave risk to the child to be raised under our system.   Ginger D. Anders  --Well, it would be the -- it would be the courts in the country of residence that would be making that determination.  But I think the question of which court might have a more favorable determination, that -- that kind of forum-shopping is precisely what the convention was trying to prevent.   John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You wouldn't have to -- you wouldn't have to do anything like that at all.  He would just file before 30 days just to be on the safe side.  It's not like he's going to say, I'm going to analyze this 100-page document to see whether I get an extra 30 days to do something as simple as filing a notice of appeal.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And -- and if the inquiry says it's hard to tell, there's a 30-day limit and there's a 60 day limit, I don't know of any responsible counsel who wouldn't file within 30 days.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why would that -- why would it -- I mean, it would still apply to the government or any case in which the government is a party, where it's not an issue whether is the government a party or not.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no, no, no, I agree with you that it -- I'm just saying why in a world would the relator want to invoke the 60-day provision if there's at all -- at all a question about whether it's 30 days or 60 days?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- yes, but -- you don't have to know that before you file the one-page notice of appeal.  I mean, if you need more time, you can get more time, but you don't have to know all of that.  It's not going to cost you a lot of money to file the notice of appeal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So there may be -- there may be a lot of reasons the relator will not pursue an appeal.  I don't think there's any reason that the relator would not file a notice of appeal within 30 days or, if he doesn't like 30 days, you ask for an extension of time for another 30 days.  Then the whole issue is moot.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Rephen.     Paul T. Rephen  If there are no further questions, then we can -- we can hear from the government.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Wall.     Jeffrey B. Wall  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- why do you care?  I mean, you're just giving people who might well be confused by this provision another 30 days.   Jeffrey B. Wall  I think there are two distinct harms, Mr. Chief Justice.  The first is to the government, and the second is to Congress and the system it set up in the statute.  The harm to the government is that, if it can be made a party under FRAP 4, despite the fact that it has actively attempted to decline party status, it could also be made a party under the other rule.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay, but, again, we would limit any decision to Federal Rule of Appeal 4 because of the dramatically adverse consequences for the unwary.  They lose their right to pursue their case.   Jeffrey B. Wall  I don't think the government has any objection in theory to a period of 60 days for only FRAP 4.  I think the difficulty is that any number of rules speak in terms of parties.  And Petitioners advance no persuasive between FRAP 4 and other rules.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I just does did.  Under FRAP 4, you're out the door without any hearing on the merits.  It's a technicality.  The spirit of the rules is that we don't throw people out because of mere technicalities.  Now, failure to file a timely notice of appeal is not a technicality in terms of the consequences.   Jeffrey B. Wall  That's right.  Three brief points, I think.  First, if this Court announces a 30-day rule, that's clear going forward.  Relators and their counsel will treat declined qui tam suits like civil actions generally to which the United States is a party.  Second, if the rules are better read for a 30-day period, because the United States was not a party, you're entitled to appeal the judgment, then Petitioner was not entitled to assume that he would get 60 days--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sure that the Appellate Rules Advisory Committee, when they hear this decision, if they haven't already, will put something in the rules about whether it's 30 days or 60 days.  So I'm not terribly concerned about clarity going forward.  It's going to be made clear by the Advisory Committee and the submission of new rules, and I see no reason that they wouldn't make it clear.  I don't know whether they'll think 30 or 60 is the best idea.   Jeffrey B. Wall  Right, and--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's just a question of -- in this case and, as Justice Stevens pointed out, what the effect is going to be on other cases.  And it seems to me that in that situation, 60 days makes the most sense because otherwise you're disrupting the system solely based on a trap for the unwary.   Jeffrey B. Wall  --Well, and that goes to a question that Justice Breyer asked earlier.  The statute, 2107, was enacted after what is now FRAP 4.  The rule and the statute shortened the period to appeal from 3 months to 30 days.  And then the Judicial Conference, in the -- in the -- what is now FRAP 4, drew the exception of 60 days for cases in which the United States was a party because of an express need for more time for the Solicitor General to make a decision.  The Judicial Conference raised some question about how we do that.  Two years later Congress enacted the statute putting in the 30-day and 60-day rules.  I think then that's a baseline.  And I'm not sure that the advisory committee could come back and effectively amend the -- amend the statute by changing the rule.  What Congress had in mind when it passed 2107 was if the -- if the -- the United States is a potential appellant and requires more time to conduct its internal decisionmaking processes, it gets 60 days.  Otherwise, that 30-day baseline governs, and I respectfully disagree, Mr. Chief Justice, that Congress was not concerned about moving appeals forward expeditiously.  It shortened the period from three months to 30 days precisely because of wanting judgments to become final.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Wall.  Mr. Schor, you have three minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",08-660X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  This is certainly a trap for the unaware, right?  I mean, every lawyer loves to win on a technicality, but--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --It says if the United States is a party, it is -- it is 60; if it's not, it's 30.  And you have got a situation where the United States -- the action is brought in the name of the United States.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know, but this is such a -- such a trap for the unwary that you never even raise this point.  It was raised sua sponte by the court of appeals.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, my point is if it didn't occur to you, how can you claim that it should definitely have occurred to your friend on the other side?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How about -- I'm sorry.  Why don't you finish, counselor?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, how does it work in -- presumably, I guess the government can decide that it wants to appeal the case in which it has not participated below, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It has to move to intervene.  So let's say there's a judgment and the government looks at it and says: Well, we didn't know we would get a decision like this; We've got to appeal this.  The relator doesn't want to appeal it.  30 days goes by.  The Government moves to intervene because it has 60 days.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So for all the reasons in the legislative history that you discussed about why the government gets more time, those reasons don't apply in that situation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I -- I pressed your friend about what's the big deal, why don't you just file within 30.  It only seems fair to press you on what's the big deal with letting them have for 60--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --which also solves the problem of the potential trap for the unwary.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I agree with that.  I agree with that.  But what if we say--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I'm sorry.  What if I say, or whoever is writing the opinion says, this is only for purposes of filing the appeal?  We don't decide whether the government is a party in all these other characteristics, but whether it comes to Rule 4(a)--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, it should be construed narrowly.  I don't think saying whether it's 30 or 60 days at all implicates that principle.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, yeah, but I mean, if we assume you're right, then that's construing it narrowly.  But the whole question is that there's some confusion in the rule about who's right, and all I'm saying is it seems to me that it would be the easiest thing to avoid any trap for the unwary with no consequences on the other side, to say 60 days.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, this isn't going to delay appeals, for heaven's sakes.  I mean, there's all sorts of scheduling rules about the timing of the briefs and everybody gets an extension on their briefs.  This is going to have no effect whatever on how quickly appeals move along.   INTERRUPTING ",08-660X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, it seems to me -- your last few answers seem to me to beg the question.  You start out by saying: Well, obviously it's a horizontal agreement among the teams, and then you explain how you are going to analyze it.  I thought that was the very question before us: Whether these sorts of rules and regulations are horizontal agreements between the teams or whether they are part of a particular -- a single entities' articulation of rules.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That you have been begging the question?  Is that -- it's that part?  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, could you articulate for me as succinctly as possible the extent to which your position departs from the position of the Solicitor General?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I would have thought it is just the transfer of the inefficiency and lack of clarity from the -- the first question to the rule of reason.  I mean, I'm not quite sure it -- you don't have the same problem.  It's just a question of where you want to rest the inefficiency and confusion.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I -- I thought the purpose of their submission was to respond to some of the questions we've seen, like scheduling, like what the rules are going to be about -- about the game.  There are some things that it just seems odd to subject to a rule of reason analysis.  And you yourself have said: Well, that is going to be an easy case under the rule of reason.  Why doesn't it make sense to sort of carve those out at the outset, rather than at the end of the case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Nager.  Mr. Stewart.     Malcolm L. Stewart  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  I think that by focusing on a rather mundane aspect of the NFL commissioner's powers, this may help to explain why the United States is not four-square in support of either party's theory in this case.  Among the powers that is vested in the commissioner by the NFL -- by the NFL constitution is the power to incur expenses to carry on the ordinary business of the League, and this includes renting office space, hiring employees, and procuring supplies.  And if the commissioner, pursuant to that delegation of authority, decides from which company he's going to -- to acquire paper for the League's offices or decides what the weight scale for secretaries in the League offices should be, our view is that that's the conduct of a single entity.  It may be that the commissioner's power to do those things is ultimately derived from the consent of the individual teams within the League, but once that consent has been given, once that authority has been centralized, then the commissioner's decision about a paper supplier or wages for employees--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't -- I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt your answer.   Malcolm L. Stewart  --I guess my point was, once -- once the teams decided that they would -- rather than each negotiating individually, either with a single licensee or with multiple licensees, once they decided they would negotiate as a collective and that any potential licensee had to go to the collective rather than to the individual teams, that's the central Section 1 issue.  And if the -- the collective had decided, we will give contracts to a multitude of potential bidders, that would not have affected the fact that concerted action was involved.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So under your -- following of your paper case, are you saying that if the teams delegated to the commissioner the authority to decide whether we are going to enter -- whether the League is going to enter into one contract on logo products or let each team decide, that would be all right?   Malcolm L. Stewart  That would -- that initial delegation of authority would be subject to a Section 1 challenge, because that would be concerted action in the same way that the Court in Dagher said--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why isn't the decision to order paper from one company rather than another subject to Section 1 challenge?   Malcolm L. Stewart  --Because that -- that occurs after the point at which the commissioner has been vested with that authority.  If -- if somehow a plaintiff wanted to say there was an -- there was illicit concerted action when the teams agreed to give the commissioner this general power, that would be subject to Section 1 review.  It seems -- because that would be concerted action.  It seems highly unlikely that such a challenge would prevail.  But if--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is that?  I mean, if I'm Office Depot and I'm selling paper to the -- to the Giants -- or does this only apply to the commissioner's office?   Malcolm L. Stewart  --This only applies to carrying out the ordinary business of the League.  It -- it would only apply to the commissioner's running of -- of the League office, not the running of the individual teams.  And as I say, our central point is that--   ",08-661X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if it's a plausibility standard at the threshold inquiry, there is a range of things, and I guess your -- your friend on the other side is just saying selling logos is closer to selling houses than it is to playing football.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if there is a factual -- if there is a factual dispute about whether a particular activity of the League is designed to promote the game or is designed simply to make more money, than that is the sort of thing that goes to trial?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Or do something else, do something other than promote the game.   ",08-661X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Some time ago Justice Breyer asked the question of why is this different than the other privileges, and I would like your answer to that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Resnik.     INTERRUPTING ",08-678X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  We will get to that, I think, when the government lawyer gets up.  But does that distinction make sense to you?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Government lawyers get the privilege, private lawyers don't?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But we are talking about the central privilege to the maintenance of the adversary system which we've determined to be central to maintaining the rule of law.  This is not like the other privileges, priest-penitent, other evidentiary privileges, because it is the privilege that allows lawyers to protect the interests in those other cases.  And it just seems to me that -- that to allow a single ruling by a district court judge to undermine the privilege is going to affect people.  What -- I mean, the statement of the lawyer could be, look, you are going to lose this case, and you are saying the district court can require the disclosure of that without allowing at least a quick trip to the court of appeals to check it out.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it matters which they do, right?  If they are denying disclosure the statistics don't mean much.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it is a bit of a hurdle, isn't it, since you do have to satisfy the materially advanced -- the litigation and those other criteria?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The usual way that the district court, after denying the recognition of the privilege, insists that people proceed is, they want the lawyer to go to jail.  They say, You've got contempt, you can appeal contempt.  The district judges, as you've mentioned, they want these things to move on and they tend not to think that their rulings are in error, and the lawyers are frequently confronted with an extremely difficult choice, of violating what they think is their ethical obligation or going to jail.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, a protective order isn't going to work -- a protective order isn't going to work at all.  You're not going to -- I mean, the lawyers on the other side get the privileged material, so they don't care -- I mean, in terms of the viability and protection of the privilege, it doesn't matter if the clients get it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the -- you know, the -- the American Bar Association has said the exact opposite.  It will say that the opening up of the privilege and the disclosure, however rare the case is, will, in fact, undermine the -- the value of the privilege.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, sure, the other people are, too, but we -- I, at least, look at a brief of the American Bar Association and view that as a representation of how the people affected here, the lawyers, view the value of the privilege and what will happen to it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, but the law -- the law professors aren't the ones who deal with this question on a day-to-day basis and have to worry about going to jail, if they want to protect their client's -- what they view as their ethical obligations.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Kneedler?     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, except when the government is the one raising it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but, in the government context, what would be in the private context, an attorney-client privilege, is redressed as a different type of governmental privilege.  When you give advice to a government agency, you don't call that the attorney-client privilege.  You call it a governmental privilege, a deliberative privilege, all these other things.  In the private sector, when you are an attorney and you give advice to a client, you can't say, This has got something.  It's the attorney-client privilege.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you are saying that you -- government lawyers cannot seek an interlocutory appeal of any privilege claimed, other than Presidential communications and State secrets?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  There are problems with 1292(b).  Are you telling me, when your office writes a letter to the Department of Interior and says, Look, we are not going to appeal -- we will appeal your case, but we think you have got a really bad case, you are likely to lose; and you assert -- the only privilege you can assert is the attorney-client privilege, and, if a district judge says, that's not covered, for one reason or another, you -- you don't get an interlocutory appeal?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't think that the attorney-client privileges rises to the level of who gets to -- who has to put up security for costs that was an issue in Cohen?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We are not talking about -- I guess what, perhaps, the case comes down to is, if you think the attorney-client privilege is like every other evidentiary privilege that you have just listed, relevance, materiality, all those sorts of things, or if you think the attorney-client privilege is different, even more important than who has to post security for costs, because it is central to the rule of law, because it is central to how the adversary system functions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the review -- I follow your answer but the review on final judgment is meaningless.  I mean, the cat is out of the bag.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The injury to the party, but not the injury to the attorney-client privilege.   ",08-678X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, if Powell extends to subsequent prosecutions -- I know you argue that it doesn't -- but if it does, isn't it unusual that the defendant is in better shape if a jury hangs on the non-acquitted count than if he is convicted on the nonacquitted count?   ",08-67XX
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You -- you are asking us for a pretty dramatic extension of Powell.  Powell was not a case involving subsequent prosecutions.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's because in the same proceeding you have two different jury verdicts, one going the other way and one -- obviously, one way and one the other way.  So to protect the jury's conclusions, you couldn't give effect to one without undermining the other.  It's a very different case here.  The only jury determination you have is the acquittal.  If you give effect -- if you don't give effect to the findings in the acquittal, you are undermining the jury, the only determination by the jury.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the -- the point about the big extension, you were rather coy in your brief about what you think about Ashe v. Swenson.  Are you asking us to revisit that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you're not going to talk about -- you're not going to talk about the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause, are you?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If we rely on that the case is pretty easy, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The person was in jeopardy on the hung offense as well.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Under this Court's decisions, but not under the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think that's right, and your argument depends upon that interest balancing against the interest in giving effect to the acquittal verdict.  Now, what if I think, under the Seventh Amendment, that's -- that what is important is protecting jury verdicts?  And the interest in the irrational case, when you have a conviction and acquittal, is that you have two jury verdicts and you can't go one way or the other without undermining one of them.  Here, however, you can give full effect to the verdict of acquittal without undermining another jury verdict.  You certainly undermine the government's interest in prosecuting after a hung jury, but if I think what's important under the Seventh Amendment is the jury verdicts, then the case comes out the other way, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, he -- he carried that burden before the court of appeals.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Revisiting of that issue was not included within the question presented.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if we -- if we agree with you on that proposition, then the conflict that we granted cert to resolve would still continue?   ",08-67XX
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Without regard to the time?  A break in custody of one day, do you think that should be enough?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what if it's repeatedly done?  You know, you -- you bring him in, you give him his Miranda rights.  He says, I don't want to talk.  You let him go.  You bring him in, give him his Miranda rights.  You know, just sort of catch and release, until he finally breaks down and says, All right, I'll talk.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You mean he is not -- I assume you mean he is not free to leave the prison.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  As I understand the terms, pehaps it's inaccurate, jail is where you are when they are still questioning you and figuring out what's going to happen to you.  Your argument is when he is sent to prison, he is no longer in custody for Edwards purposes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So I thought Roberson told us it's not a different question, that it's the same question.  Roberson did not draw a distinction between what crime he was being questioned on the second time.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Heytens.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Davis.     Celia A. Davis  --It is not confined to time, Justice Sotomayor, but the termination point is, especially for a prisoner, it's easy for the prisoner to contact the police.  Just tell the jail guard that you'd like to talk to the police about that investigation.  They will make arrangements quickly for that to happen, I'm quite sure, or counsel could be present and questioning can proceed in that instance, and those are the reasons I would ask this Court to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry to interrupt you -- interrupt there, and I will let you get back to the answer.  They should attempt to do so.  The rule here does not allow the police to approach that person, a murder suspect.  And you are saying he cannot even be approached to see if he would waive his rights ten years later because he was -- invoked the right in connection with joy riding?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but not--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --It was one day.  He said he wanted the--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --to remain silent in the evening, and at 9:00 the next morning they were back.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So then I don't understand why your answer to Justice Alito's hypothetical was what it was, because that person obviously was not in custody.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the Miranda Rights do not require the police to provide counsel.  They have to mean -- mean you have to stop questioning, until the person has right to counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And the one thing this person knew from the prior Miranda situation -- was 2003?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that, if he said,  ""I don't want to talk without counsel. ""  the one thing he knew is that the police would stop questioning because that's what they did.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, Miranda doesn't--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Go ahead.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you say, ""in captivity"", but you think the rule applies, whether they are in captivity or not.  In -- in Justice Alito's hypothetical, the person was free for 40 years, so captivity is not a limitation on your -- your proposed rule.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I suppose, if they are in a pretrial detention center, they know they are still being looked at for the crime as to which they have invoked the Miranda warnings.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you wouldn't call that -- and I don't understand the other side to argue that that is -- there is a break in custody there.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  I agree with you.  There shouldn't be a break there, but, here, the situation is quite different.  There is a break between jail for questioning and prison for 15 years -- or whatever your sentence is.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That is a -- isn't that a Sixth Amendment question?  That's not a Miranda question, if he has not been provided a lawyer.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  And it's the Fifth Amendment we are worried about, and that is directed to coercion--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --and that is addressed, if you stop questioning him.  You don't even start questioning him, if he says, Look, I don't want to talk without a lawyer.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Talking stopped, as it did the very -- the first time he was approached.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if he says -- I'm sorry--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Are you done answering?  So if he said, instead of I want to talk to a lawyer, if he said, I want to remain silent, your case comes out differently?  He doesn't say anything about a lawyer.  He says, Look, I don't want to talk to you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but all your arguments about he hasn't been provided a lawyer, there is an ethical obligation to provide a lawyer.  Those -- those are off the table.   ",08-680X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I'm -- I'm not sure this matters very much, but do you know, are stays usually granted in this type of case?  Not this type of case.  A -- a removal case as opposed to a application to reopen.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, I understand it.  I'm just saying if you happen to know empirically if most people who are facing removal get stays.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it possible in this case to kind of split the -- split the baby?  You have a more appealing fact case than is typical because yours involves a denial of a motion to reopen and doesn't really go to the ultimate merits.  Most of the petitions, I think, do go to the ultimate merits, and it's easier to see that (f)(2) may apply there as opposed to your case.  Now, is there a coherent way of saying that?  In other words, in your type of case, you apply the traditional stay standards, but in a case where the issue that is before the court is whether to order removal or not on the merits, the -- the other approach applies.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that's just really saying the way to avoid that is to say you win across the board.  I mean, it -- my understanding is that situations in which they're going to be seeking an injunction to enjoin are actually quite limited.  They're typically just seeking to vacate the removal order.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I think I understand that point when they're seeking to have the order -- the removal order vacated.  But here, you're seeking the reopening of the proceedings, which I guess is a little different, isn't it, than the -- the underlying decision on the merits?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that right?  How -- how can that be?  I mean, you have an order of removal, and then you move to reopen the proceedings.  Aren't they two separate things?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where does it say that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's -- that's kind of a systemic challenge, but you wouldn't have a situation where you get an injunction in far more typical individual cases.  Right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe I'm missing something but -- and, again, I don't know which way this cuts, but the dispute strikes me as very academic as a practical matter.  Judges looking at whether someone is likely to prevail on the merits versus judges looking at whether the person has shown by clear and convincing evidence that he shouldn't be removed, the judge that's going to find one in one case, depending on the standard, and the opposite in the same case I can't visualize.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It doesn't?  You're talking about equities or irreparable harm?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Same.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Same thing.  And you cannot consider that at all under (f)(2)?  There's no way in which the removal would be prohibited as a matter of law under provisions that are concerned, for example, about whether the person would be tortured or something like that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because the -- because the objection is on this procedural matter?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if the objection is that I'm going to be tortured and so you shouldn't order my removal, he would be able to -- a court under (f)(2) would be able to consider that, wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Don't they get -- don't they get to pursue that even after they're sent back?  There are provisions that -- I mean, their case does not abate just because they've been removed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess that's why -- I guess that goes back to my earlier question is -- I see that if they're killed the case is probably not in very good shape.  But -- but the situations in which they're likely to face that sort of difficulties upon removal, it would seem to me are these situations where the removal would be prohibited by law.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think references to equitable relief and restrain are clear enough to cover the court's authority to grant a stay?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  General Kneedler.     Edwin S. Kneedler  It feels like it, yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.  Ms. Harrison, you have 7 minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess -- I guess General Kneedler's point is that clear and convincing shifts a little, depending on how long you've got to -- to look at it.  If you've only got a day or a few hours before the removal is going to take place, you can say this is convincing enough based on what I've had a chance to look at.  But -- and therefore you could enter, I guess, what may be called the temporary stay to get more briefing from the government or whatever.  But you may find out, when you look at it a little more deeply, that it's -- it's not clear and convincing.  What -- what's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING ",08-681X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you -- do you agree with your friend that the basic difference between your two positions is that, under the stay factors, you are allowed to consider irreparable harm but are not allowed to consider that under (f)(2)?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So I take it, at least in the Seventh Circuit, these things are usually granted stays.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So in this -- in this case involving a denial of a motion to reopen, what the court of appeals is supposed to do is to look ahead and see if this person has shown by clear and convincing evidence that they shouldn't be removed.  And if they haven't, then they -- their removal can't be blocked even, for example, if the court of appeals thinks, well, yes, they should have gotten their motion to reopen.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  This provision applies to us as well, I take it.  Right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if there is a cert petition filed on behalf of an alien subject to removal, and he asks for a stay of -- of removal, we have to decide whether he meets the clear and convincing evidence standard.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We should have -- we should have done this in this case, but I assume you suspended removal of the Petitioner on your own?   ",08-681X

Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what is your answer to your friend's explanation that it's hard to defer when they don't even say anything?   INTERRUPTING ",08-724X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You say -- you fault him for not talking about performance in prison, prospective performance in prison?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It doesn't look like that's going to be a very strong argument.  I mean, he is still talking about people he wants to kill, and you are going to get up there and say he might perform well in prison?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  He is on the stand with a Hitler moustache testifying about what a great job he did killing these people, and he says he is going to do it again.  I think -- didn't the letter identify particular people he wanted to kill?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And the jury is supposed to believe that this guy is going to do well in prison?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I guess it gets back to the -- the point, we are talking about what a jury would think and isn't it possible.  You are suggesting, I think, he -- he should grasp any straws that are there, this might help.  But isn't it possible that that would have a negative effect on the jury?  In other words, they see this lawyer telling them this guy is going to do well in prison and the lawyer's credibility is -- is shot.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But, I mean, it seems to me that you are imposing a strategic rule, and the counsel obviously made a decision -- or the record may reflect that the type of advocacy that you are telling us he has to have.  Here's why you should give this guy sympathy.  Here's why.  Here's -- he's a good guy.  I mean, there is -- even standing at that podium, there is a different strategy that people sometimes employ, which is sort of the understated -- you know, well, he did some terrible things, don't -- I'm not asking for sympathy for these things, but -- you know, we are very proud of the fact that we don't execute -- you know, it seems to me that this disagreement is over different styles of advocacy.  And I don't know how to -- particularly in a case where you don't have much to work with, I don't know how to make a judgment that his choice was worse than the other.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you're -- if you're right about that issue on which we haven't had a decision yet, then we would look at prejudice on our own, without deference to the State court findings?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, the Mills opinion has one of those concluding paragraphs at the end that sort of sums everything up, and it says that we conclude there is a substantial probability that reasonable jurors upon receiving the judge's instructions in this case and in attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed may have thought they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence unless all 12 jurors agreed on the existence of a particular such circumstance.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now how is that clearly established law that your claim is -- is contrary to Mills?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That is on death or nondeath, not on whether a particular mitigating circumstance exists.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where does that say what your summary was earlier, that they--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --can't consider a mitigating circumstance unless they unanimously agree about it.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What would you -- if you could do it in one sentence, what is your test for determining which categories of speech are unprotected by the First Amendment?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but to say that they are not concerned with the content, I -- I think is contradicted by the exceptions.  You have to look at the content and make a decision, is this bona fide scientific, journalistic, educational, historical?  So you have to look at the content to determine whether or not the speech is prohibited.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How can you tell these aren't political videos?  You do have, with organizations, PETA and others, depictions of the same sort of animal cruelty that is used to generate support for efforts to prohibit it.  Why aren't these videos the exact opposite, you know, efforts to legalize it, and, in each case, it would fall under the political exemption?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, would this -- would a statute like this apply to humans be constitutional?  You can't depict videos of, say, violent muggings or things of that sort?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Millett.     Patricia A. Millett  But, under the First Amendment, if the only rationale Congress is giving is we are here to shield your eyes for you, we will make this censorial decision, it has got to find some basis to think that was never freedom of the speech under the First Amendment, in the way that obscenity was.  You don't get to make it up as you go along.  We are interpreting a constitution.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Katyal, you have three minutes remaining.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Did I just understand you to agree with your colleague on the other side, that Congress could not ban the human sacrifice channel because there would be no connection between drying up the underlying activity?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  I'm saying there is no connection.  We can't reach the activity where it is taking place.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if Congress is -- and we will give you sufficient rebuttal time.  So, if Congress is saying, Look, we just don't like what -- is being shown on the human sacrifice channel, we don't want people to see it, they can't do that?   ",08-769X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I think -- I think Ferber analytically is the hard case for you, because the Court in Ferber did said -- and I am quoting from page 763:  ""The evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interest at stake. ""  That was their articulation of the test.  Now, why shouldn't we apply that test to this statute?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I mean, but this definition or these exceptions are not drawn out of thin air.  They are drawn from Miller, and the Court in Miller recognized that they were significant in causing the restriction of obscenity to pass constitutional muster.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I understood your answers to Justice Alito to acknowledge that there would be situations where this statute could be constitutionally applied, or as you put it, you could draft a statute.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not this statute.  But--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --But if in fact there were situations where we thought a narrowly drafted statute could be applied to particular instances, perhaps the crush videos, perhaps others, why isn't that enough to say that this statute is valid on its face and then we will consider as-applied challenges?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess I am just trying to get at what your understanding of what the test is for overbreadth in this area.  How much of an area of constitutional application is necessary before you decide that a statute is not unconstitutional on its face, but will consider as-applied challenges?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry; you agree you can prohibit it, or not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So I'm sorry.  I'm still looking for your answer to Justice Alito's hypotheticals.  Can Congress ban the human sacrifice channel or not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You are unwilling -- you are unwilling to say that Congress can pass a law, even-handed, straightforward, you cannot have a human sacrifice channel.   INTERRUPTING ",08-769X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Long.  Mr. Stris.     Peter K. Stris  --I don't think it would ever happen, but that's how it worked at trust law.  They wouldn't have to.  But I think courts are more reasonable than that.  Thank you, Your Honor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Roberts.     Matthew D. Roberts  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a plan administrator has abused its discretion in construing plan terms, courts are not required to defer to the plan administrator's fallback interpretation of the same terms.  That rule follows from trust law, and a contrary rule would undermine ERISA's protections for plan participants.  It would reduce incentives for administrators to interpret plans reasonably; it would discourage participants from challenging unreasonable benefit denials; and it would make employers less likely to draft clear plans.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about the hypothetical I asked your friend?  You know, this is how we read the provision, reading A, and we recognize there's some ambiguity there, and if a court disagrees with it, our -- our second reading is -- is B.   Matthew D. Roberts  No.  We--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No deference on B?   Matthew D. Roberts  --We think there would be no difference on B if it was just a second reading of the same -- of the same term.  Under that logic--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does that make sense?  I mean, don't you want the administrators to give you their best -- best understanding?   Matthew D. Roberts  --You want the administrators to give their most reasonable interpretation, but under the logic of letting them be able to put the first interpretation there, they could just put a list of 10 interpretations--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, they can--   Matthew D. Roberts  --starting with the one that's most favorable.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --They can -- they can take it to the extreme.  But if it looks like a good faith effort, to say -- you know, it's tough to interpret and administer these plans, and they say, this is what we think it means, but we're human; maybe we made a mistake.  And this is--   Matthew D. Roberts  Then a court might choose to defer if it thought there was no reason to think that there was -- that there was a reason to suspect that they're just trying--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --So one strike and you're out?   Matthew D. Roberts  --No.  According--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, that's assuming, it seems to me -- it makes sense if there's bad faith.   Matthew D. Roberts  --According--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, you make fallback arguments.  You're here and say this is how we read this, but if you don't agree with it, this is how we read it.   Matthew D. Roberts  --That's right, and -- but there are -- there are concerns here about undermining ERISA's protections for plan participants that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if--   Matthew D. Roberts  Well, it's -- I think any responsible district court would -- would do that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --So you disagree with Mr. Stris.  Do you think the district court should listen to what the plan administrator has to say?   Matthew D. Roberts  Well, I think that, in trust law, that -- under the principles of trust law, that Mr. Stris is correct, that the district court has the -- the -- the court would have discretion to formulate the remedy and could direct the trustee--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Thank you.  Mr. Long, you have 4 minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",08-810X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, if I could switch to the deference point.  Let's say you have an administrator who says I interpret this particular provision to mean A; and he says but, if that's rejected, there are these other provisions that should be read to mean B.  That goes up; the court -- the rejects A.  Does the administrator get deference on his reading of the other provisions B?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but I think it's kind of odd to say to the administrator: Look, if you want discretion, you should make as many rulings as you can possibly think of because then you'll get discretion as to each of them.  But if you only do what's efficient and say here's how I read it, then you don't get any discretion at all on the other provisions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you're saying it's not just that they abused their discretion; they're discretion abusers?  You can't trust them on the next provision?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We do that with the district court.  We get a district court, and we use all of these pejorative terms -- ""abuse of discretion"", ""arbitrary and capricious"", ""clear error"" -- and we send it back for them to do the same -- you know, they make--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --They're the fact finder.  Here, the plan administrator is the primary interpreter.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  What's the relevant principle?  Isn't it what the lump sum was that he took out?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they chose to take it out of that plan, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, since that's a fairly stark disagreement among counsel on a factual matter, where in the record do you see 5 years?   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  And the brief.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Carvin.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  General Kagan.     Jeffrey A. Lamken  Right.  And the answer to that is that these are the standard limitations -- the standard removal provisions that exist throughout the financial area where the SEC has a subordinate entity under its control, and Congress presumed that because the SEC's -- the SEC's control was so pervasive, it didn't need to go back and revisit those standard removal provisions, because -- precisely because -- the SEC has power to rescind the board's enforcement authority, establish rules requiring it to obey commands, disobedience of which would be grounds for removal, to withdraw the salaries.  The control is so pervasive that these removal provisions did not have to be reconsidered.  And from the board's perspective, they're just another means of control, one that actually taints them, as Shurtleff points out, with having committed misconduct.  Thank you, Your Honor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Lamken.  Mr. Carvin, to keep the time even here, you have 8 minutes.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I would have -- Judge Kavanaugh has suggested there are two ways to cure this problem: One, have the President appoint and remove; and the other thing, make it truly subordinate to the SEC.  Now, I've heard the argument on the other side, both from the government -- well, it's an issue with the government -- the Solicitor General and the board, that the agency, the board, is completely subordinate to the SEC.  Well, if Congress -- Congress could fix this problem by saying: The board is subordinate to the SEC.   INTERRUPTING ",08-861X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  I thought the employees were appointed by the chairman, not by the commission.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think -- you think a -- a veto power is the same as an original -- original power?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let's say--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Let's say that the -- let's say that the board issues -- demands documents from a particular company.  Can the SEC direct them not to do that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Will that be consistent -- do you think that will be consistent with the intent of Congress in establishing the PCAOB?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why did -- just out of -- I guess maybe it's not important, but why did the -- why did Congress set up a separate board if it's going to be entirely controlled by the SEC?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Before we get -- before you get too far into that, of those first two things, is there any reason Congress couldn't have achieved those same objectives by establishing the PCAOB as a division within the SEC?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does it have consequences for public companies subject to the board if it refuses to turn over documents requested by this -- this board?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, I know, but presumably you only get a subpoena when people don't cooperate.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And what happens if they don't?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are there any other -- are there any consequences from the company's refusal short of -- that would not require the board to get a subpoena?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In the absence of the subpoena, if nothing happens?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it -- does it have a consequence as a practical matter for the company if it doesn't comply with a request from this board?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So there are in fact collateral consequences that take place without any involvement by the SEC?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you had a statute here that said, look, if you don't comply with the board's request for documents, your authorities will be suspended, and if that were the statute, you would say, well, that's okay, because the SEC can always change that rule.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry, I asked you whether there were any consequences from the failure of the company to turn over documents; and is your answer that there are no consequences whatever?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  That's Humphrey's Executor.  But you have to add to Humphrey's Executor Perkins and Morrison.  Humphrey's Executor says you can limit the President's removal power.  That doesn't get you down to the board.  You have to also say the principal officers -- there can be limits on their removal authority of the board members.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I didn't say anything bad about Humphrey's Executor.  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is -- I'm sorry.  What is the removal authority of the SEC with respect to board officers?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  All right.  So there is a limitation there.  For cause does not include failure to follow the policies of the President.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you need to rely on Morrison to make the limitations on what the SEC can do with respect to the board constitutional.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you need to rely on Humphrey's Executor to make the limitations on what the President can tell the SEC constitutional.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no, no, because you have got an extra layer there.  Let's say, I mean, that you have to have two violations of the for-cause provision.  You have got to have -- you have to meet the requirement in two places.  When the SEC wants to remove the board member, they can only do that for cause.  And if they decide, well, there isn't cause, I'm not going to do it, then the President under your theory has to remove the SEC commissioners, all of them, not just -- not just the chairman, and he can only do that for cause.  So you have got ""for cause"" squared, and that's -- that's a significant limitation that Humphrey's Executor didn't recognize and Morrison didn't recognize.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which one are we talking about, the first one or the second one?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let's just talk -- a practical example.  The board says I want to get the documents of company X.  The SEC thinks they shouldn't do that.  Okay?  Can they remove them for that situation -- in that situation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can they say--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --you are fired?  Can they say, you are fired because we have control over what you do and we don't think you should do that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The easiest way to do it is to pick up the phone, not by promulgating a rule.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can the President pick up the phone and fire the SEC commissioners?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  He thinks -- he thinks they -- the board should be getting the documents from the other company, and the SEC thinks they can't.  So the SEC tells the board, don't go after that company, and because they do that the President fires the SEC.  Does that work under your theory?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not worried if it's the same.  I'm worried if it's enough.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  And then--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --It goes further because you've got to rely on the SEC to get to the board.  So there you've got to rely on Perkins and Morrison.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do they have to say about the theory that the SEC commissioners can be removed by the President?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you are not contesting it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Lamken.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought -- so you disagree with General Kagan?  I thought she said one of the reasons for taking the board outside the SEC is that they'd have an independent funding stream.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the board can act, and the SEC can, I suppose, retroactively veto their actions, but the SEC doesn't propose what actions the board takes, actions that can have significant, devastating consequences for the regulated bodies.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not talking about rules.  Agencies in the government do not act only in implementing a particular rule.  They have authority to regulate.  And the board here, for example, can tell a particular entity: You have to turn over these documents.  They don't have to have a rule that says, this company must turn over the documents.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there any other--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Is there any other situation in the vast federal bureaucracy, where you have this two-level situation that we have here?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, the President can't remove the SEC commissioners at will.  They can't remove the PCAOB commissioners at will.  Or even if you look at it from the for-cause perspective, there has to be two layers of ""for cause"".   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- well, give me an example.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The formulation--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --The formulation -- excuse me.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The formulation that you use and your friend the Solicitor General have used -- has used is that they have the same authority that they have over every other independent agency, but I'm -- it's very hard to find out exactly what that authority is.  So what is your position about the authority of the President?  Is it more than for cause or only for cause?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you understand that position to be?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the President -- I guess I'm following up on Justice Kennedy's question -- the President cannot call them and say, take this particular action in this particular case.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The -- the government tells us it was an outlier.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let's say you have a bank that is going to be opening up a lot of branches in the State, and one of the directors knows this and knows where they are going to open them.  And he goes around and buys up the real estate where the bank is going to put its -- put its branch, so that he gets the benefit of the -- of the sale.  And assume that the price that -- that he's going to charge is a fair market price, no different than what anybody else would charge.  Now, is that sort of self-dealing covered under your view of the statute?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But he is not stealing -- he is not stealing the confidential information.  As the director, he has the perfect right to know the confidential information.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I don't know that I would call it a corporate -- I don't know if I would call it a corporate opportunity.  They are not looking to sell the land; they need to buy it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but presumably, the one thing it's odd to suggest Congress did was sort of run 1346 through 1341, when what it was trying to fix was the Court's understanding of what 1341 provided.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where -- where in the record do we find your argument that the statute is unconstitutional?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you were -- I think you were about to tell me where you raised it in the Court -- the constitutional argument in this Court?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So is that -- does the right to intangible services refer to an obligation that is legal or moral?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Only -- only legal?  So that if in a State their corporate law says conflicts of interest with respect to spouse and children must be disclosed, but conflicts of interest with respect to nieces and nephews need not, you would say you cannot use this statute to prosecute somebody who, under some abstract sense, should have told their employer that,  ""My niece is going to get $10 million if we go ahead with this contract? ""   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, could I ask -- could I ask you just, in terms -- the terms of the statute, does your theory give any independent substance to the word ""right""?  It seems, to me, your argument is that -- that someone who deprives another of honest services.  I don't know where the concept of ""right"" comes in, which is in the statute.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  I suppose you are willing to concede that there are situations where the delay would be attributable to the State because of systemic problems?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The State has so many cases, and it's only willing to hire one lawyer.  That lawyer can't possibly handle all the cases.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose -- I'm not sure that we necessarily want to get into the particular details of a very complicated record, but there are several points in the Vermont Supreme Court opinion where it says that the failure of assigned lawyers to do anything to move the case forward is attributable to the State.  And I thought the fundamental principle we were debating is whether or not assigned lawyers who fail to move a case forward, whether that is attributable to the defendant or whether it is attributable to the State because they happen to work for the State.  And I would assume one way to dispose of the case would be to decide that general question and send it back for the Vermont Supreme Court with that guidance that they were wrong, as a general matter, to assign delay caused by the counsel to the State, to sort through the record themselves.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  We'll hear from Ms. Kruger first.     ",08-88XX

Roberts, Jr.  What is the -- what is the distinction in your theory of the case between delay and failure -- failure to move a case -- what did -- what did the Vermont case say: Failure to do anything to move the case forward?  When do we know that that's attributable to the defendant, and when is it attributable to the State?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of course, if the lawyer is a do-nothing lawyer, then I suppose there's an ineffective-assistance claim?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In the abstract, you have a lawyer who is a public defender or hired as a public defender, and he keeps asking for continuances -- continuance, continuance.  How do we tell that that's the State's problem as opposed to what the defendant is doing through his lawyer?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  This is not an unusual reason for criminal defense lawyers in the private sector to ask for a continuance.  It's quite common for the lawyers to go before the judge and say, look, I've got this other case going to trial next week, I've got this and this, can I get more time, and judges give them the first two but not the third.  And why in a case simply where you're dealing with a public defender do you presume the opposite and blame the State for what's a quite common practice in the private part?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  My point is, I guess, how do we tell?  I mean, if this is normal -- I think it is normal, I think it's quite unusual for a defense lawyer to be prepared to go to trial the first time the trial date is set.  If it is normal, how do we tell?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, but -- again, I assume that's -- there are probably cases in the private bar where that's true as well.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What does your -- your argument do to the fundamental and I think quite vital principle in Polk County that public defenders work for their clients; they don't work for the State?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess fairly read, it does say the failure of several assigned counsel to do anything to move the case forward is attributable to the State, because they didn't do anything, I guess is the touchstone.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you agree -- just following up--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I'm sorry.  Just following up on your latest answer, do you agree that it has to be a systemic problem?  I mean, you gave us that -- the situation where the lawyer says I've got 150 cases, I need a -- need a continuance.  What if there's none of that?  They've got, you know, 500 public defenders, and the -- but the guy still delays.  He's responsible for not doing anything to move the case forward.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it still attributable to the State?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, when is that?  The -- you have the same situation, the defense counsel appointed by the State does nothing to move the case forward, that's as I understand it the Vermont Supreme Court touchstone.  When is that attributable to the State and when is it not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --It does sound to me, then, that you're saying there has to be some systemic problem, that the rule that I understand the Vermont Supreme Court to have adopted, that when assigned counsel does nothing to move the case forward, that that's attributable to the State, you would disagree with?  You would say no, there has to be a systemic problem, not the -- not just the individual lawyer, but they're not assigning enough defenders, they're not supervising them, whatever.   ",08-88XX
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What would you -- what would you -- what phrase would you use to describe what happens when inquiry notice culminates in finding out?  You have to say, oh, there looks like there might be scienter, I have to look at it.  And after a year, you find it; yes, there was scienter.  What -- what would you call what happens when they find out there was scienter?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Frederick.     Malcolm L. Stewart  And I think if you read Tellabs as a construction of this statute, it would be inconsistent with our view.  But the Tellabs Court was talking about something else.  It was construing the heightened pleading requirements of the PSLRA.  Now, the PSLRA pleading requirements do distinguish, in adjacent subsections, between the requirement that a plaintiff plead with particularity the specific statements that are alleged to be false or misleading and the reason that they are false and misleading, on the one hand -- that's in subsection (1) -- and then, in subsection (2), it requires also to be pleaded with particularity the facts that establish strong inference of scienter.  And the Court in Tellabs used the term (1); namely, you have to plead with particularity facts about the alleged misstatement and why it's misleading.  The statute itself, the PSLRA, does not use the term ""facts constituting the violation"" to describe the first category.  And the word 10(b) naturally encompasses both what the defendant did and what his state of mind was.  The other thing we would say -- two other things we would say in that regard are, first, as the introductory language of section 1658(b) points out, this limitations period only applies to suits in which the plaintiff alleges misconduct involving fraud, deceit, manipulation, or contrivance.  And so, the limitations period is limited to violations that have scienter as an element.  And, therefore, it would be particularly peculiar to think of a violation as not encompassing the fact of scienter.  The other thing we would say -- and Justice Scalia was asking earlier about the differences between 78i(e) and 77m -- and there are really too salient differences.  The first is that 77m is explicit in providing that constructive as well as actual discovery will suffice.  And we think that 1658(b)(1) is properly read to encompass constructive discovery, even though it doesn't say so in so many words.  But the other salient difference is that the period in 77m doesn't commence to run by its terms upon discovery of the violation or the facts constituting the violation.  The statute says discovery of the false or misleading statement or omission.  That's natural in 77m, because 77m deals with violations that don't have scienter as an element.  But if this Court had incorporated that language, it would have given the impression that knowledge of scienter was not sufficient -- was not required.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

I -- I find it curious -- and maybe you can illuminate it for me -- that the Justice Department is before us, arguing that the Justice Department can't be trusted without judicial review.  And I find that doubly curious when the Justice Department won on the opposite position below.  I mean, are you suggesting that the statute is so absolutely clear that you could not stand there and say that your colleague down the hall in the Justice Department could be trusted to exercise his discretion, but in fact you are saying: I know we won on that, but we are not going to defend it because we think the Attorney General needs judicial review to help him stay in line?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but if you take -- if you continued to argue the position you won on before the -- before the Seventh Circuit, it wouldn't be that the standard of review is -- is so deferential that it is okay.  It would be there is no review at all.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And the position of the Department of Justice was the opposite before 2004, correct?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you think it's so bad, the Attorney General doesn't have to do it.  Why do you need a court to tell you that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You keep saying ""the Board"".

You initiate a series of transactions between commodity providers and commodity consumers.  You set a fixed price at the consumer end, you set a fixed price at the other end, and that's it.  I mean, I could patent a process where I do the same thing.  I initiate a series of transactions with sellers.  I initiate a series of transactions with buyers.  I buy low and sell high.  That's my patent for maximizing wealth.  I don't see how that's different than your claim number 1.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but your claim 1 it seems to me is classic commodity hedging that has been going on for centuries.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- I'm sorry.  Just -- what are the physical steps?  Initiating a series of transactions between commodity provider and market participants?   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Stewart, I thought I understood your argument up until the very last footnote in your brief.  And you say this is not -- simply the method isn't patentable because it doesn't involve a machine.  But then you say but it might be if you use a computer to identify the parties that you are setting a price between and if you used a microprocessor to calculate the price.  That's like saying if you use a typewriter to type out the -- the process, then it is patentable.  I -- I -- that takes away everything that you spent 53 pages establishing.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  That's just saying instead of looking at the -- in the Yellow Pages, you look on the computer.  And that makes all the difference to you?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if you look at your footnote, that involves the most tangential and insignificant use of a machine.  And yet you say that might be enough to take something from patentability to not patentable?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think it's a hard question.  If you develop a process that says look to the historical averages of oil consumption over a certain period and divide it by 2, that process would not be patentable.  But if you say use a calculator, then it -- then it is?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But your footnote -- I don't mean to dwell on it -- it says to identify counterparties to the transactions.  So that if what you're trying to get is the -- the baker who sells bread, because you are going to hook him up with the grocer who sells, you know, in the grocery store, if you punched in, in your search station -- you know, give me all the bakers in Washington -- that would make it patentable?

Roberts, Jr.  But you don't -- you don't think that proximate cause is satisfied only with respect to the person who is supposed to be paying the taxes?  If there's some way in which someone else contributes or makes it feasible or makes it more likely that the person is not going to pay his taxes, that's not automatically outside the scope of proximate cause, is it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Koerner.     Leonard J. Koerner  The State has records, but they -- they've been uninterested in this issue for political reasons.   John G.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  That still creates the ambiance?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the definition and giving scope and meaning to the concept of proximate cause is one that's in our bailiwick.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that's because in every one of those cases, or at least in many of them, we kind of wring our hands and say, well, we don't have any choice, this is what Congress did, and we're faithful to that intent.  But I guess, as I tried to point out earlier, this is a different question.  This is the usual judicial application of concepts of proximate cause, and I would have thought concern about how broad RICO was written and how broadly it has been interpreted would cause us to look very carefully to the proximate cause question.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No -- I don't understand that.  The injury is directly caused by the consumers who don't pay the taxes.   INTERRUPTING John G.

But the issue is proximate cause, and if you've got to go through the individual consumer, it's either proximate cause or not.  And if the -- if the indirect nature of what they're doing because the direct cause is the consumer's failure to pay, it doesn't seem to me that their intent is pertinent.   ",08-969X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, this -- this brilliant second-year associate we are talking about, the way these submissions to the Court are -- the way they're presented, do they carve out her contribution to a particular filing?  To the extent I have looked at them they have something like, you know, draft motion to dismiss, and the associate has 40 hours and the junior partner has 10 hours and the senior partner has 5 hours dedicated to that.  I mean, if the associate is doing -- in the hypothetical, is doing work at the partner level, how do you know that the brilliance isn't contributed by the 4 hours of the partner rather than the 40 hours of the associate?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Shah.     Pratik A. Shah  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1988 permits reasonable attorney's fees.  That means going above and beyond the lodestar amount can be justified only if the lodestar is unreasonably low.  We submit that a lodestar based on prevailing market rates does not require a performance bonus on top of the lodestar to make an award reasonable.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it's one of the long-standing traditions of the bar that lawyers are expected to do that in the normal course.  So why would that be a special circumstance?   Pratik A. Shah  --Well, Your Honor, I think that circumstance is much more closely tied to the statutory purpose of section 1988, which is to attract competent counsel in this subset of--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, how do you tell -- how do you tell whether a client is popular or unpopular?  I mean, a lot of unpopular clients in the abstract sense are in fact -- they have a lot of support in the community.  I suppose one of the more unpopular clients these days is a Wall Street banker.  [Laughter]  But I mean, you wouldn't say -- you wouldn't suggest that law firms charge more when they represent them?   Pratik A. Shah  --No, Your Honor.  I think what our -- what our enhancement would allow for, even if you can't make the ex ante determination that taking on this representation is going to cause me some special harm; that is, all my clients will leave my firm if I take on this case -- even if you don't know that before the fact, the fact that there is an ability for the court to give you an enhancement when that occurs -- remember, this is done after -- after the case is already complete is when the -- fee hearing determination is made.  The ability of a court to give that sort of compensation would provide an insurance, a guarantee to the attorney before they take on a case that if it turns out badly that -- that they will still get compensated.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   Pratik A. Shah  Thank you, Your Honor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Clement.     Paul D. Clement  --Two things, Mr. Chief Justice: One, it's the law of the Eleventh Circuit and I think every circuit that before submitting your fees to the court you are supposed to use billing judgment and take care of some of those things, approximating maybe what your client would do for you.  But, second, and I think more tellingly, the client may do that to you.  The client doesn't have the help of your opposing counsel to egg them on and give them suggestions, and that's what a district court does in the context of one of these cases.  So I really think, as a practical matter, you are systematically undercompensating counsel.  And I mean, if you want to take into account practicalities, I am not here to reargue the Dague case, but if you want to talk about practicalities, the fact that all of these cases are contingency cases and the rational market for those would be much higher than -- if you are worried about sort of windfalls for plaintiff counsel in these kind of cases, you really can worry about something else, with all due respect, because the combined effect of Dague and Casey makes it very difficult to get sort of comparable compensation.  As I say, I am not here to reargue those cases.  I do think, frankly, Dague is distinguishable because there you had the prevailing party language.  The other thing about Dague that's distinguishable that I will say before I sit down is one of this Court's concerns in Dague was creating an asymmetry.  Blanchard had already said that contingency fees could not cap your awards; they didn't want to have an asymmetrical system.  That's exactly what Petitioners are asking you for, is a completely asymmetrical system.  Farrar v. Hobby says you can reduce downwards based on exceptionally poor results.  There would be no basis whatsoever to even adjust a little bit under their rule for exceptional results on the upside.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you Mr. Clement.  Mr. Cohen, you have 4 minutes.     ",08-970X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I will let you answer your second point, but just on that, I don't understand the concept of extraordinary success or results obtained.  The results that are obtained are presumably the results that are dictated or command or required under the law.  And it's not like, well, you had a really good attorney, so I'm going to say the law means this, which gives you a lot more, but if you had a bad attorney I would say the law has this and so he doesn't get a multiplier.  The results obtained under our theory should be what the law requires, and not different results because you have different lawyers.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but what does a judge say when he said, you have achieved extraordinary results?  That if you weren't there, I would have made a mistake on the law?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess that's saying the same thing I said, which if it weren't for how good you are, I would have made a mistake.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe we have a different perspective.  You think the lawyers are responsible for a good result, and I think the judges are.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, this lawyer -- I'm sorry, this judge said they were extraordinarily good, but, I mean, where's the cutoff?  If the judge said, this is in the top 10 lawyers I've ever seen, or the top 20, where do you get an enhancement and where do you not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, that's the thing.  It's hard to tell.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, for 28 years -- the judge was on the bench 28 years, right?  Well, if you are in the top 28, is that a rare case or not?  It's once a year.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know, but we are trying--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --We are trying to establish a principle, and other judges are going to have to follow this.  And do they think, well, this was really good, but it wasn't as good as that law firm or lawyers we had 3 years ago; they were really good.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And I assume -- how long -- how does a judge, who is on the bench in his or her first year, do this?  Well, this is the best lawyer I've had in the eight months I have been here.  [Laughter]  But how does he or she know that that -- that may be as good as it gets, for the next 28 years?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  There is a flip side to the unpopular case situation the S.G. talked about, which is lawyers and law firms sometimes take on a particular high-profile case to increase their profile, and they would have done it for a lot less.  We have lawyers who argue here, who are doing it for free, because it's a big deal to be recognized as doing something in the Supreme Court.  So when you use prevailing rates with respect to that type of work, you are overcompensating them.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's also not the term Congress used.   John G.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, following up on that, I'd like your answer to this question: Is a State procedural rule automatically inadequate and, therefore, unenforceable when the State rule is discretionary rather than mandatory?  Automatically?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you agree--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --So you agree with the Petitioner's response to that question?  Their point -- their question presented is, is it automatically inadequate because there is discretion?  They say no, you say no.   INTERRUPTING John G.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  And that is -- your objection is that it wasn't fairly applied.  Discretion was abused in this case, to borrow from the Federal law.  They didn't treat them the same.  They should have treated them the same.  But the question is whether the rule is automatically inadequate if there is discretion.  You are arguing about how it was applied, which I guess means that it's not automatically inadequate because if they apply it the way you think it should be then it would be adequate.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe I did, too.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the point is you are arguing about the application -- the exercise of discretion.  You say the one guy, Lewis, got the benefit of the rule; your guy didn't get the benefit of the rule; and that's unfair, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you are not arguing -- which would be very odd to argue -- that the discretion always makes the rule invalid because you--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Okay.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  Obviously if the State prevails he's in a worse position.  But under your view, he's in this -- he's in no worse position.  He hasn't waived all his objections and claims, procedures.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm sorry, if I could just nail down the point.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  The review of the determination or the request to move the period is -- is what?  Up to the total discretion of the -- of the judge?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your objection to the fact that the judge has more discretion with respect to defining ""projected disposable"" -- you don't mind the discretion on the other side.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right, but the only purpose of moving the time period is to change the income.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's a good answer, isn't it, because your point would be the statute does not allow that exercise of discretion with respect to projected disposable income, but it does in the other areas.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, my -- my point and what I thought your point would be is that the fact that there is exercise of discretion in two different areas is not the problem.  The problem is that in one area the discretion is specifically permitted and in the other area, projected disposable income, it's not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where is that, by the way, the provision that allows it to move the 6-month period?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Goldstein.     Thomas C. Goldstein  Multiply.  And Congress did that a bunch of times.  Projected -- if we try to project something, we try and make the -- and everybody agrees on the definition, so really, it's not an unusual term.  It is: You make your best estimate of the future based on the data you have now.  My friend is right.  One piece of data we have now is her previous 6 months' income.  Another piece of data is we know that she's not going to have the same income in the future.  If there are no further questions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Ms. Harrington.     Sarah Harrington  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  In bankruptcy, as in many areas of the law, Congress has tried to balance on the one hand, doing case-specific justice, and on the other hand, ensuring that the statutory scheme is administrable.  Now, Congress certainly could have chosen to elevate simplicity over accuracy by telling bankruptcy courts to take a debtor's current disposable income and multiply that number by the number of months in the plan in assessing whether the plan is confirmable.  But there are several strong signals in the code that that is actually not what Congress intended courts to do.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It seems to me that, particularly since you are adopting a fairly broad -- well, depending on how broad a theory you are adopting of what's projected and what's not, that you are taking into account a lot of things that are more properly taken into account when it comes to whether the plan should be confirmed or not.   Sarah Harrington  Well, this is--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What's going to happen?  What's the situation going to be?  What should, you know, the creditors get?  What should the debtor get?  There is no reason to kind of shoehorn those into the projected disposable income.   Sarah Harrington  --Well, except that if the creditor or a trustee objects, then the calculation of projected disposable income is one of the conditions of confirmability of the plan.  The court can't confirm it unless it can--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, is that -- I mean, let's say your friend wins up to the point and somebody else, when it gets to confirmation, can say: Well, look, you know, there was this big payout before the filing.  So don't confirm it.  We know she has got all this -- all this other money.  That -- it could do it that way, couldn't it?   Sarah Harrington  --I'm sorry, if she got a higher-paying job just before?  Is that what you're suggesting?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, whatever the situation is, can't that be taken into account when it comes to confirmation?   Sarah Harrington  Well, it could affect the -- well, one thing that is important to note that hasn't been brought up is under Section 1325(a)(6), the court is actually -- which is the feasibility provision -- the Court is actually required to think about what is going to happen in the future, whether a debtor is going to be able to repay her creditors.  And so it doesn't make very much sense to, on the one hand, require a court to consider what it knows will happen in the future in determining feasibility, and then on the other hand, if there's an objection by the creditor or the trustee and 1325(b) comes into play, to prohibit a court from considering the same facts it knows about what is going to happen in the future--   ",08-998X

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I appreciate all those points, but counting -- cutting, perhaps, the other way is that it's not a real adversarial system before you get to that stage.  It's a collaborative effort, the Veterans' Administration and the -- the individual.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which seems to me may counterbalance a little bit the fact that the veterans are uncounseled.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think -- unless I am missing the point of my colleague's question, it's two different issues.  Of course they don't participate in the court.  They are not lawyers.  But it's not clear to me why they wouldn't participate at least in the process of saying, you've got to file your notice and here's where you file it.  Are you saying they don't do that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They do it regularly and they -- every now and then they file it in the wrong place?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't see how that works.

Roberts, Jr.  What clear statement rule are you talking about?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, I remember that.  I remember that.  I thought that that was a prospective bright-line rule.  It's kind of hard to apply a new bright-line rule retrospectively.  I understood what we said in those cases to be: Look, Congress, we are tired of trying to sort out this ambiguity.  From now on, if you want it to be treated as jurisdictional, tell us it's jurisdictional.  It makes sense prospectively, but it doesn't make sense to do that to statues that were passed before we announced our bright-line preference.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  I understand changing the subject, but in my question, you invoke the bright-line rule of Arbaugh that the statute should say ""jurisdictional"".  And I'm just saying that only makes sense prospectively.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Miller.     Eric D. Miller  --I -- I don't know of any from this Court, but of course in the courts of appeals Petitioner hasn't identified any in which an exception was made.  And then I would point out that Bowles -- in Bowles, the petitioner had a very sympathetic equitable claim, in that he had done what the district court had told him to do and filed on the schedule given to him by the district court, and the court held -- nonetheless held that because the time limit was jurisdictional, there was no authority to create an exception to it.  If there are no further questions, I ask that the judgment be affirmed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Ms. Blatt, you have 4 minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING John G.

Here, although we are dealing with an Article I court, there are characteristics of what you might call internal agency review.  The court is specialized with respect to veterans' affairs, and there are particular standards for review that you don't find when you are talking about between the district court and the court of appeals.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess it's related -- just to get everything out on the table, it's related to the same point that I thought was significant in Bowles: That you are dealing with a time limitation that lawyers had long recognized as being, you know, a drop-dead date.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And it made some sense.  When you look at the statistics, when you get into this court, the veterans almost always win, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  My point was the exact opposite: That if you -- they almost always win, you assume that Congress wouldn't want to cut them off, because it's -- if only 1 percent of the veterans appealing win, you might understand an absolute rule, because they're not -- as -- statistically, we are not losing much.  But if, as I understand to be the case, about 80 percent of them win, you might cut them a little slack on appealing because it is a very significant part of the -- the process.

At a deposition just before the evidentiary hearing Dr. Stahlberg revealed that nothing in the new material called into question his original diagnosis.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How does that work--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --How does that work, counsel, if you have new evidence?  My claim was decided, it was reasonable under (d)(1) based on what they knew, but I've come up with new evidence that I think could not have been reasonably discovered before the (d)(1) hearing?  What happens to that?  It seems to me you have to determine whether that evidence can come in under (e)(2).   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so you think, and I have trouble understanding the parties' position on this.  When you talk about claims, you don't mean totally different legal bases; you mean different evidentiary support.  The claim that it's ineffective assistance of counsel based on organic -- the failure to discover the organic brain damage, you say might or might not be considered a new claim, and therefore (d)(1) would not be a bar to that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So then, and the reason that doesn't undermine your position is because you think it's evidence that could have been discovered and presented earlier?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand that.  But if it were evidence that could not have been discovered previously, then (d)(1) does not bar looking at (e)(2)?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If it's really a new claim?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose -- I suppose the Federal court can send it back to the State court for exhaustion.   John G.

Kennedy  The factual predicate that could not be discovered was the evolution of the mental health testimonies as it moved from affidavit to live testimony, and the state gave for the first time specific notice of how it was going to attack the presentation in state court.  And all of the arguably new mental health theories were in response to the changes in the -- that the state itself had made in Federal court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  A finding under the standards that we have applied under AEDPA?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We have to determine under AEDPA that it was objectively unreasonable for this lawyer to get a psychiatrist, or whatever his status was; to get a report, which he did, and which he looked at, in which the psychiatrist or psychologist said, look, there is nothing here.  And he went through all the stuff that was there.  And, in fact, after the Federal evidentiary hearing, he said, well, in light of this new evidence I'm still correct.  And objectively unreasonable for this lawyer to say, look, my best bet is to put his mother on the stand, that that might engender sympathy, and portray him as not as bad a guy as everybody says, as opposed to putting on all this evidence that explains why he's such a bad guy.  Those are two -- we've said those are reasonable choices.  If you are relying on that basis, we have to decide that it is objectively unreasonable for a lawyer to proceed on that basis.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Just to pause for a moment: You said there was no hearing in the State court.  Well, that was because the State court, pursuant to the established procedures, assumed everything you wanted to show was true.  It's a little bit much.  I mean, you were not going to be in any better position after a hearing than you were before the State court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you are putting your eggs in the basket that under AEDPA, what happened here was objectively unreasonable?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Or do you want to go on and look at the question on which we granted cert and argue that we should look at the new evidence or that the State court should look at the new evidence?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, this -- again, as your friend pointed out, and I have to say it's a logical conundrum for me, too -- you have to show under (e)(2) that the factual predicate could not have been previously discovered, and your claim is that his lawyer should have discovered this.  They both can't be true.  And if the former is not true, you don't get a hearing, and if the latter is not true, you don't get relief.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  When you say the State court -- you just told us that this was better off because it is only 6 hours, and you said in the State court they did nothing, is that right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  When you say they did nothing, surely that was rhetorical hyperbole, and you took the 6 hours to say this proves what we said, they did nothing; they did next to nothing.  You're not saying, oh well, it was six hours, so we are sorry we said they did nothing.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That gets back to the point that Justice Scalia was making, is that this is new evidence that the Ninth Circuit considered with respect to the original.  In other words, they were not just saying, okay, even if none of this happened, we would still rule against you, because one of the new things they had was the 6-hour evidence, which you've just said makes your case stronger.  I think it does make your case stronger, but it also makes clear that we can't say let's just look -- the Ninth Circuit just looked at what was there originally.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You are going back to arguing that, you win under the original proceeding and the question on which we granted cert--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --should be addressed.   John G.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what protection is there at the summary judgment stage in response to allegations?  Because it doesn't have to be scientifically valid; it can be completely irrational.  All you have to do is allege that, you know, if you had told this the price would have gone down.  If you had disclosed this the price would have gone down, and the response from the company is, well, but this is just ridiculous.  This is some guy in his garage who writes this out on -- on a -- you know, a piece of paper in -- in handwriting; and the response is going to be, well let's let the jury sort it out.   INTERRUPTING John G.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you have no problem -- I mean, Mr. Stewart is being careful for his client, but you're comfortable with the idea that the government could impose that, even though there's nothing in the statute that requires it, and even though somebody could argue that the statute's somewhat inconsistent with it, in the -- in the sense that it wants to promote commercialization.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the problem with--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Are you finished answering Justice Breyer?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that might lead to the same thing that the Bayh-Dole Act was intended to get away from, which is a variety of different arrangements across the vast array of government agencies, because they will have differing degrees of interest, differing leverage with respect to what they insist on from the different contractors.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you -- are you aware of situations where the universities enter into different types of arrangements with different types of professors and researchers?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Presumably some of them have greater degree of leverage than others and can say: Look, you've got to make sure I get this much of the royalties, and I'm only going to give you that much.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, go ahead.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it's just--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --it's not just that there may or may not be an effective assignment.  The problem is you may get together, you the inventor get together with the university and say, look, the one -- we share an interest in making sure none of this goes to the government.  Why would we want to do that?  So you make an arrangement.  Your theory -- your theory is that whatever the contractor gets is what the government can get and nothing more, so the contractor and you work out a deal to make sure that the contractor doesn't get the invention or the patent, it just gets royalties.

Roberts, Jr.  Just to pose there, we've had a little discussion about what licensing laws are, but we haven't talked at all about those last two words, ""and similar laws"".  It seems to me that whatever wiggle room or ambiguity there may be in saying whether this is a license or not, Congress swept pretty broadly.  It said, not just licensing laws, but licensing and similar laws.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  Let me just -- I mean, businesses had to have licensing laws pretty much across the board, right?  You couldn't set up a -- I don't know, an electrical contracting business if you weren't licensed to do business or met the requirements for an electrician.  It wasn't just agricultural.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even if they said and you have to renew your license every year or every six months?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't disagree that whether or not a company hires illegal workers is related to quality or asserted ability to do business or qualification?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, just so I make sure I understand your approach.  You're saying that Arizona had a law saying you have to have a license to do business.  And then it became aware of a problem that it wasn't aware of before, it found out a lot of employers were employing child labor and they didn't know they would do that.  And they say we can revoke your license if you're determined to have employed child labor, that that would not be okay?  But it would be okay if in the original licensing thing they said and you had can't employ child labor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you -- excuse me.  You tried earlier to talk about the two boxes and you said something would be preempted by the first clause.  Anything, civil and criminal sanctions are allowed if they are imposed through licensing and similar laws.  There are not two boxes.  The State can do what's in the first part so long as it does it through licensing or similar laws.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it similar to a licensing law?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. O'Grady.     Mary R O'grady  --They work in our system, Your Honor, as they do under the Federal law, under -- that you get a rebuttable presumption if you -- in your favor if you used E-Verify, the affirmative defense if you've used I-9.  And I am -- there is that caution; it is good faith use of -- of the I-9 system.  We do have examples where for example if an employer is terminated because they are unauthorized and they show up with a different name and different papers 2 weeks later, you are not going to be able to establish your good faith.  So you are home free but subject to that good faith limitation.  But we do incorporate the same obligations that exist under Federal law.  And also, I wanted to address more on the farm labor contractors and the amendments and what we think that we are doing in those amendments was simply dividing responsibility at the Federal level between the Department of Labor and their processes that preexisted IRCA, and what they were establishing in IRCA, and said we are not going to have these determinations of whether they -- the farm labor contractor has employed an unauthorized alien through a Department of Labor process; we are going to instead use the IRCA-established process.  But importantly what Congress did not change in the agricultural worker regulations was the provision that addresses State law.  It said before IRCA and after IRCA that those laws -- those Federal laws only supplement the authority of the States; and that means that they preserved all of the States' authority that they had before IRCA in the area of farm labor contractors.  And that I think is reinforced by the legislative history that -- that again reinforces that those have been preserved through IRCA.  This is an area that has traditionally been within the mainstream of State police power.  We acknowledge that Congress does have the authority to preempt us, but they left important discretion in terms of our ability to impose sanctions through licensing and similar laws, and we are doing so by establishing this scheme that provides for the suspension and revocation of State licenses.  It's an important part of the balance that Congress struck when it enacted IRCA by addressing what State authority would exist after that congressional enactment.  We think the lower courts properly determined the scope of that provision and unless there are further questions, I thank you for your attention this morning.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Would you classify these maps after -- I mean, assume that you don't prevail, could you then classify these documents, preventing their release before they are released?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't it the case when a government agency has to go through its records in response to a FOIA request and comes upon records that would otherwise be disclosable, they can at that point say we are going to classify this so we don't have to disclose it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It seems to me you're asking us to do your job.  You have got to go through these documents and say, you are telling us how sensitive these are and therefore it would harm the national interest if they have to be disclosed.  If that's true you can classify them and, instead of coming to us and saying you should torture the language in FOIA, to allow us to determine that this is sensitive to the national interest and therefore should be disclosed.

So while if you were the first person here, you're entitled to, you know, ten interrogatories, because we have been through this before, I'm going to say you can look at all the discovery that's there, but you only get five interrogatories.  Now, do you say no, no, no, I'm entitled to the same procedural rights I would have if I were here first?  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING John G.

The McCollins case in Federal court was that kind of case, and he pled that he satisfied the jurisdictional amount of $75,000.  But even if it's a small claim, the -- that doesn't mean that the opportunity to litigate it in a class action and join other parties is a property interest that implicates due process protections.

Roberts, Jr.  You don't dispute the statement I have, it's in the response to the Intervenors that between October 2006 and October 2010 the population of the adult facilities declined by 14,832 inmates?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that is not what -- that is not what the three-judge district court determined.  The Prisoner Litigation Reform Act requires that court to give substantial weight to adverse impact on public safety.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And when -- and then it said to the State, look, you come up with a plan that gets you to 137.5 in two years.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The State did, and the State did not say, emphatically did not say this is not going to have an adverse impact on public safety.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  There is a problem with negative there, but -- and what the district court said, it didn't examine that.  It said, well, we're sure the state's not going to do anything that has an adverse impact on public safety.  I am looking at page 4a of the jurisdictional statement.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And said -- and so it did not make those determinations, but the PLRA requires it to determine that what it's ordering or at least gives substantial weight to the public safety issue.  So isn't that a basis for overturning the remedy that's imposed here?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought you would.[Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Did he want to do it within the two-year period the district court ordered?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right, right.  Now my -- my question is specifically with respect to the --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- with respect to the two-year plan --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- and I would like an answer to that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  As I look at this record, I see that the district court did what was required by the Act with respect to the plan that it's ordering.  It just simply said, oh, we're sure -- I'm the State wouldn't do anything to hurt public safety, after telling the State you have got to give me a plan in two years that gets to 137.5.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they said we're sure, because we trust, I'm just quoting from 4a, ""We trust that the State will comply with its duty to ensure public safety as it implements the constitutionally required reduction.""  The State is saying it cannot meet the 137.5 in two years without an adverse impact on public safety.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think Justice Sotomayor has been patient.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe you can answer.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe you can answer, counsel, please.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I ask you a hypothetical question that I know is not your case, but let's say you had the district court entering an order saying you have to bring it down to 137.5 in 2 years.  That will as a practical matter result in the release of 40,000 prisoners.  The State comes back and makes a showing supported by experts saying, look, if you give us 4 years, we can reach the figure without releasing any prisoners.  Do you think it would violate the Prison Litigation Reform Act for the district court to say, no, I want this done in 2 years, not 4 years, and we just have to deal with the fact that there are going to be 40,000 prisoners out on the streets?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  I couldn't -- what was the first--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  70?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, one of the things that concern me about this type of institutional reform litigation is that the State is responsible for a lot of different things.  What happens when you have this case, another district court ordering the State to take action with respect to environmental damage, another court saying you have got to spend this much more on education for disabled, another court saying you have got to spend this much more on something else?  How does the State sort out its obligations?  Does it say, well I'll spend more money to build prisons, but I will violate this other district court order saying I have to spend money to build water treatment plants?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know you like your particular case.  You want the State to say, this is where I'm going to put my money, but the point is that it's a bunch prioritization that the State has to go through every day, and now it's being transferred from the State legislature to Federal district courts throughout the State.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, I believe that as well, Counsel.  What I'm saying is that you have conflicting orders from different district courts telling them, you have got to comply with the Constitution by spending 8 billion here and another court saying, I have got another constitutional problem of my own, and you have got to spend 8 billion over there.  What is the State supposed to do in that situation?   ",09-1233
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, you have an apartment building where the police know from experience there is a lot of illegal activity, a lot of drugs, drug transactions.  Every 2 weeks they walk through and knock on every door and wait for evidence of the destruction of -- of -- of drugs.  Is that all right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the probable cause, of course, comes when they hear the, you know, flushing and, you know, the hiding or whatever behind the door.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  I think I have got two different probable causes that's caused -- causing me some confusion.  I understand their requirement of probable cause, and that they hear sound of evidence being destroyed and therefore enter.  Is that -- or are you talking about the probable cause to think there's something going on in the first place?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So there's only one probable cause, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure, you can.  There's nothing illegal about walking down the hall and knocking on somebody's door; and if as a police officer you say, but I smell marijuana, and then you hear the flushing, then there's probable cause.  You don't need any business about the dealer and the breezeway and all that at all.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Farley.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. O'Connell.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. O'Connell.  Ms. Drake.     Jamesa J. Drake  Well, the factual record in this case is fully developed, and how a reasonable person would interpret the scenario is a mixed question of law and fact, which -- this Court would review the decision of the Kentucky Supreme Court in that regard de novo anyway.  In that regard, it's no different than any other case that makes its way to this Court where this Court is asked to review the record, make a determination of how an ordinary person would interpret the officers' conduct.  It is simply unreasonable and unlawful for purposes of the Fourth Amendment for an officer to convey the impression that he has the authority of a warrant when he doesn't have one.  And when that prompts, as it obviously would, an occupant of a home to move, and then that movement is used as evidence that exigent circumstances exist and warrantless search is justified, if this Court were to, you know, adopt the framework the Commonwealth is arguing for, the exception to the warrant requirement would be the rule.  So we would ask this Court to affirm the decision of the Kentucky Supreme Court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Farley, you have four minutes remaining.     ",09-1272
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you're--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --You're describing what you think the evidence was to support exigency, and the suggestion we have heard on the other side is that that's an issue that can be addressed on remand once we, according to the other side, correct the State court's error in that this -- you -- the police cannot create exigent circumstances.  So I -- I don't know that it's terribly relevant what the underlying facts about what they heard was.  That will be relevant depending, or not, depending on what our opinion says.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, it's -- it's not at all.  The court said: I don't care whether exigent circumstances existed; you cannot create exigent circumstances; so I don't care whether they were or not.  The legal standard is antecedent to the application of the facts.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, sure, there is.  It was dismissed because the State Supreme Court held you can't bring this evidence in.  If we say, oh, yes, you can, then the issue comes live again.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  This is the argument you presented to us in the letter, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And, yet, we nonetheless decided to have argument?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So maybe it would be -- it's your case, but maybe it would be best to move on to the legal issue.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where's -- no ""open up"".  I thought you said earlier they said ""open up""?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that after -- after the exigent circumstances or the alleged exigent circumstances were presented?  That's after they heard what they thought, and I know you disagree, was the destruction of evidence?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It seems to me that you're trying to change the case.  I mean, this is not a case where they come in and, in effect, demand entry.  My understanding is that the issue in the case is whether or not after a request for entry, they can then base probable cause and dispensing with the warrant based on what they hear from behind the door.  Now, I know you think whatever they hear is perfectly innocent; but the issue is whenever they knock on the door, ""police"", or ""can we come in"" or whatever, and then they hear that -- the activity behind the door, they have reason and can -- can enter.  Now, what you're -- it seems to me what you're arguing is well, they did something else.  They banged on the door, they yelled police; it wasn't simply knocking on the door and seeking entry.  And you may be right, again, on the facts, but it seems to me that's for -- for later on.  I want to know what your position is on whether they can assume, at least for me, they knock and say can we come in or knock and say police, no demand to get in.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So just assume for -- for my sake that the police comes to the door.  It's not 10:00 at night, it's you know, 6:00 at night, knocks quietly on the door, and says we're the police, can we talk?  And then there was the smell of marijuana.  And then he hears the sounds that do convey to a reasonable police officer that evidence is being destroyed.  At that point can they enter without a warrant?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You know -- you don't know what -- you don't know what unlawful means, but you know what unreasonable means?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is -- what is an example of conduct that you would consider unreasonable resulting in suppression of the evidence that would not be unlawful?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you can't -- can't give me one example of some conduct that's unreasonable under your test that would not be unlawful?   ",09-1272
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it -- I'm not sure of the answer, but is it different in this case or unusual that the agreement is between the Federal Government and private entities, as opposed to what I think is the more typical situation in which these cases come up, where it is, say, an agreement between the Federal Government and the State?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about a False Claims Act action?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You -- you emphasize that the contract has the language in haec verba of the statute.  What if -- what if it doesn't?  The statute imposes certain provisions.  The pricing I guess is the key one.  But in a private deal when you're arranging for the delivery of, you know, pharmaceuticals, you could have a lot of provisions.  It's got to be delivered by this much.  You have got to have this much inventory.  You've got to -- whatever.  I mean, what if the contract here included terms beyond those in the statute?  Could those be enforced by the third-party beneficiaries?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Anders.     INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Issue a regulation saying manufacturers who participate in this program agree to do, you know, whatever your contract says.   John G.

INTERRUPTING ",09-1273
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, which way does that cut?  That seems to me to put an awful lot of power and authority in the hands of one beneficiary and one lawyer saying -- all they have to do is filing a suit saying, look, we get a hundred doses of Lipitor from this program; we think we should get less.  And if they win, the whole country's -- the pricing of Lipitor under this program has changed.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That strikes me as an argument in favor of leaving the enforcement with the Secretary.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It doesn't have to be a class action, does it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's why it was brought as a class action?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's Miree, that's 1977.  And a lot of your argument, it seems to me, is in the earlier world of implied right of action jurisprudence that has changed dramatically in the last 30 years.  And what concerns me is when you are talking about the same language, the mere fact that the Government has decided to go through a contractual mechanism to advance this program doesn't allow you to use that to get an end run around all of the implied right of action jurisprudence of the last 30 years.  You're on stronger ground before that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that was pretty well -- that analysis was certainly consistent with the established jurisprudence in this area then.  But it started changing very quickly thereafter.  I think about 1980.  And then consistently went in the other direction, to the point now where I think the jurisprudence is pretty clear that we're not going to imply a private right of action at all.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It is the same situation with the states under spending clause legislation.  They done have to sign up.  But if they do, then the issue is, is there an implied right of action on the beneficiaries.  Our cases for the last 25, 30 years have said no.   ",09-1273

If you have the president of the environmental organization says something about whatever it is, we can lobby this guy to get this change, is he able to protect that on the grounds of his personal privacy, even though the embarrassment would go to the -- the organization as a whole?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is it such a big deal, then, to extend that to the organization as a whole, if the individual's privacy is already going to be protected?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  I mean you're -- you're already protected, at least to a significant extent, because the individual officers would be able to assert a privacy interest, to the extent at least that what you find embarrassing to -- to the corporation is also individually embarrassing to them.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, your central argument is that because ""person"" is defined to include corporation, ""personal"" in the same statute must include corporate.  I tried to sit down and come up with other examples where the adjective was very different from the root noun.  It turns out it is not hard at all.  You have craft and crafty.  Totally different.  Crafty doesn't have much to do with craft.  Squirrel, squirrely.  Right?  I mean, pastor -- you have a pastor and pastoral.  Same root, totally different.

The manufacturer, as I asked earlier, may decide, I don't want to sell New Jersey.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The manufacturer may reasonably assume his machines aren't going to be in Montana because there is no scrap metal business in Montana.  So I'm just trying to see if there are limitations to your theory about the stream of commerce covers everything.   John G.

That issue is out of the case if you lose, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if there's no -- no new evidence?  One of the objections to your theory is you don't have discovery at the certification stage.  What if you have no new evidence to put on at later stages?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, no.  You -- on page 13 of your brief you say one of the objections to it -- to your opponents or your friends' view is that it would just postpone the defendant's ability to rebut the presumption, result in countless classes being certified with the certain knowledge that they would have to be decertified later.

I know as a technical matter it's not binding, but if you're Camreta, do you say, well, the Supreme Court vacated that decision, so I can go ahead and do this again and not have to worry about personal liability?

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But all of our cases have equated the Petition Clause reach with that of the First Amendment, and our cases under the First Amendment have made clear that we don't want to constitutionalize the -- the employee grievance procedures.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does the Petition Clause cover anything that the First Amendment does not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, getting back to the second part of my question--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --in the First Amendment cases we were concerned about, as I said, constitutionalizing employee grievances.  If you constitutionalize it under the Petition Clause, how is that any less a problem of constitutionalizing it under the First Amendment?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  All you have to do then is add a sentence to your complaint saying: This is an example of how the government employer mistreats its employees?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And then it becomes more generalized?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But -- but that's the basis of our law in this area is that when the government is actually the employer the rights of the individuals are somewhat different, and they're closer to the rights that private employees have.  So simply saying that these constitutional provisions apply against the government and therefore, you don't have to worry about the distinction between private employers and government employers doesn't seem to be -- me to be completely responsive to our precedent.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but things will be a lot different if we give the sanction to your theory.  I think the idea that it hasn't happened in 17 years in the wake of San Filippo is a little bit -- it's not very compelling.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the most likely solution when you have an employee grievance along with it is that some umbrella settlement -- I mean, the employer doesn't want to spend -- I mean, that's part of the reason our doctrine developed under the First Amendment.  The employer doesn't want to have to worry about spending time and money in court to resolve what is essentially an employee grievance.   INTERRUPTING ",09-1476
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it can't all be the formality of the context.  I mean, if the police came in and said, well, has this person -- Rick, I guess -- sold you drugs before, what was the -- what was the quantity, and all those sorts of questions, the answers to that would be testimonial, despite the same lack of formality.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm confused on what -- what Davis focuses our inquiry on.  Is it the purpose of the interrogators or is it the purpose of the declarants?  We say the statements are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events.  The -- the focus seems to be on the purpose of the interrogation, which seems to be the question of what the police thought, not what the -- the person dying thought.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, I mean--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --But what the footnote -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but what the footnote says is in the final analysis, it's the declarant's statements, not the interrogator's question, that the Confrontation Clause requires us to evaluate.  So which -- I guess, which is it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then, how does that apply?  The officer says, what happened?  And the -- the declarant says, Rick shot me.  Now, is that testimonial or not?  Because the declarant knows he is 6 miles away.  It's not going to help them solve an emergency, but the police don't know that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Ms. Kruger.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Then you are saying that the focus is on the police officers.  And after all, we are not saying that police officers can't do this, we are just saying the testimonial aspects can't be admitted into evidence or that is what your friend is arguing for.  I still have trouble figuring out is the issue the purpose of the interrogating officers, or the purpose and intent of the Declarant?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.

Roberts, Jr.  Even though the guy in the gas station is still there with a gun, the police are within range?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.  I mean, that strikes me as something that happened in the past, he shot me, but at the same time demonstrates an ongoing emergency because he is right there and he might shoot you.  I'm suggesting the line you propose to Justice Alito doesn't work.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, sure it can.  If he says the principal did it.  It's 10:00 in the morning, you assume the principal is at the school and he says the principal did it.  You can infer from the circumstances that he is referring to an ongoing emergency.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's quite different from saying this happened to some guy driving by or something like that.  If it says the principal did it, it's at 10:00, it's in the school, that suggests to me more, not that the dying student or the wounded student wanted to make sure that the principal was convicted, but there is an emergency, something is happening.

Roberts, Jr.  I would have thought the argument would go the other way: That because they set up a compensation scheme, that was a good sign that they didn't want to allow State law claims.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you are asking us to interpret this statute in light of his testimony at a hearing?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It seems to me the language supports the reading Justice Ginsburg has just suggested, or the government has just suggested, with the use of the word ""the"".  It says the effects of the vaccine were unavoidable, even though the vaccine was properly prepared.  Your position is, well -- the question is whether it was unavoidable if you could have prepared a different vaccine.  But this says  ""unavoidable, even though the vaccine was properly. ""   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't see the word ""if"".   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  --But I'm not sure that in most cases you are going to be able to tell immediately -- you are marketing one vaccine and something else is being tested or about to be approved, or it's on the market -- that that's safer.  Particularly since you have to look not only at -- whatever -- injury and mortality rates, but also efficaciousness -- or efficiency, I guess -- in terms of the vaccine.  So you don't know right away.  Somebody comes in and says, Here's a different vaccine; your vaccine causes one death every 10,000 doses, or whatever it is.  And the other says, This is better; it's one death every 12,000 doses.  You say, Well, but ours is more efficient in stopping the vaccine.  Well, how much more efficient?

Roberts, Jr.  Well, the comparison between the vaccine that caused the harm and the one that Mr. Frederick's client says was more efficacious and therefore the harms were avoidable.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, the provision refers to  ""a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base. ""  You read cocaine base to be crack, so you have to be talking about a mixture or substance which contains crack.  What contains crack?  Crack is the problem they're getting at; yet the statute, as you read it, has to talk about a substance which contains crack, not just crack.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's kind of an odd way for Congress -- it's an odd way for Congress to phrase the provision if what they want to get at is crack, to say what we want to get at is substance which contained crack.  That suggests to me, when you talk about substances that contain something, what they contain is a base that then is used in the substance.  I think that's a harder, harder logic to apply when you're talking about crack.  They want to stop the use of crack, not so much -- it wouldn't occur naturally that they're talking about substances which contain crack.  It would occur naturally, that language formulation, if you think of cocaine base as broader than just crack.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You kind of elided the point there in your verbal formulation.  It's easier to say this is something that's not just cocaine.  It's harder to say this is something which is not just crack because crack is a type of cocaine.  You can say it contains, as the government says, cocaine base.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you're saying Congress is afraid that the sodium bicarbonate, we might not be able to get at that if we just say crack?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Pincus.  Ms. Saharsky.     Nicole A. Saharsky  Yes, it could be pure.  I don't know that we've seen any cases like that, but it is almost always cut with something else.  So just to wrap up and be as clear as possible, what Congress had intended to do in the Controlled Substances Act really was to pull out chemicals that -- that have certain pharmacological effects on people that are dangerous.  Congress did that by using the term ""cocaine base"".  That is a term that is expansive and includes all these kind of forms that we've been talking about today.  The lower courts have struggled in trying to figure out whether a substance that's wet, off-white, rock-like, paste-like counts as cocaine base.  Certainly the Seventh Circuit has had several cases like that.  It struggled.  If this Court picks just one definition to limit the term ""cocaine base"", it's really setting up a road to evasion for drug traffickers to change to a different form.  We hope that this Court won't do that.  We just don't think the text supports it.  It says ""cocaine base"" without any limitation.  And this -- we just don't think that this -- this Court should be adding a limitation based on what it thinks Congress must have intended but didn't say in the text.  If the Court has no further questions, the judgment below should be affirmed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Pincus, you have four minutes remaining.     ",09-1533

He says under the statute the maximum is 8 years, and the court says, the judgment is vacated to the extent it goes beyond 8 years.  Can he then bring a new challenge to, say, the whole sentence, or cut it off at 4 years, or does that limit his challenge?  In other words, I'm trying to get to the point that it's not just the conviction, but if it's a period of the sentence that is not subject to challenge the first time?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's an issue that we look at all the time under AEDPA.  That's not a new approach.  AEDPA says, you know, if you show that a claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive, that was previously unavailable.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, but you say, but it won't be because of the degree of connection between the -- the retaliated-against employee and the means of retaliating.  I understood your brief.  I'm just looking at page 6.  The limitation you propose is someone -- someone close to him.  The anti-retaliation prohibition prohibits an employer from firing an employee because someone close to him filed an EEOC complaint.  And I guess I have the same concern that we have been discussing for a little while.  How are we supposed to tell, or how is an employer supposed to tell, whether somebody is close enough or not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But Burlington Northern, of course, is quite different, because you're just -- you're dealing with the obvious plaintiff in that case.  You -- your -- your concern is confined to a particular person.  In this hypothetical, it's an unlimited universe that you don't have any reason to know where it ends.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, can't they talk about that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, it's not like you're dealing with strangers.  That's the whole point.  It's someone close to them.  I -- on the one hand you're saying, well, you only have to worry about people really close; and then your response to this line of questioning is, well, the other person might not sue.  They're going to sit and say, ""Well, you sue"".  ""No, you sue"".   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is that a problem?  You're dealing with people who are close.  They assume the person who was hurt -- the person retaliated against would sue.  Well, why -- why don't they?  You said that person has a valid suit.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They are lay people.  They don't know about Article III.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Kruger.  Ms. Latherow.     Leigh Gross Latherow  That's true at trial, though, after a plaintiff gets past his initial burden of proof, and in this case the plaintiff is going to be able to establish their burden of proof solely by saying that they were a protected party and there was intent on the other side.  That is going to shift the burden to the employer at the outset of the case to prove that there was no retaliation, that there was no intent.  Your Honor, in conclusion, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals was correct.  The Sixth Circuit determined that Eric Thompson who was not discriminated against had no protection under the statute.  This Court clearly held in Burlington that the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII is designed to protect employees based upon what they do, based upon their conduct.  In this case Eric Thompson engaged in none of that behavior, he had no conduct, he did not come forward on behalf of anyone; yet he is here asking for remedies, remedies that really should belong to Regalado.  There is no reason that Regalado could not have brought this case.  There -- if the concern is that employers are going to discriminate against employees, the response to that is that employers will still be held liable and can still be held liable, and that is by the person who is discriminated against from bringing the suit.

I mean -- I -- I would -- other than that they are more closely related, I can see someone thinking, well, Costa Cruise is at least an independent contractor with which Costa Crociere does business.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but I don't -- I mean, there's some sharp practice going on here.  Paragraph 10 of their complaint sues Costa Cruise Lines because -- saying they owned, operated, managed, supervised, and controlled the ocean-going passenger vessel.  And it's the same lawyer for Costa Cruise as for Costa Crociere, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So that lawyer looks at this and says: Aha, they made a mistake; they named the cruise line rather than the name in Italian.  So I'm going to wait until the statute of limitations runs, and then a couple of days after, I'm going to say aha.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I would have said the previous paragraph, 9, says:  ""The plaintiff has complied with all the pre-suit requirements of the passenger ticket. ""  So you know they read the ticket.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, which is it?  Is that a Freudian slip?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Just a mistake.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING ",09-337X

Roberts, Jr.  You mean Respondent, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You are -- you are the Petitioner.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you have an answer to Justice Breyer's question?  It was sometime ago, but--  [Laughter]   ",09-338X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what would be gained from that?  I -- the parties, one says -- let's say one says yes and the other says no.  You ought to grant a mistrial, you shouldn't.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do people usually -- in your experience is there usually a clear breakdown between prosecution and defense on a question like this?  My perhaps uninformed view is presumably the defense, if they have got a deadlocked jury, they want that to continue, because all they need is, you know, one holdout.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If the jury is hopelessly deadlocked, is there a situation where that would not constitute manifest necessity?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it does get back to the factual determination of deadlock, correct?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the -- so the proposition that what happened here is an abuse of discretion cannot be said to be clearly established, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't have anything like this case that says this would be an abuse of discretion?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the fact that it's a plurality opinion means that it was not clearly established by the decisions of this Court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought you answered an earlier question that I asked -- maybe I'm -- maybe it was something I asked your friend, although I doubt it, since it would help him -- that the issue did come down to the factual determination of deadlock, because if there is deadlock then there is manifest necessity.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  So the case comes down to whether or not this is a case of genuine deadlock, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  With the layers -- with the two layers of deference worked into your formulation.  It's not simply whether the trial court erred in the determination that there was a deadlock that constitutes manifest necessity; it's whether or not there was an abuse of -- of discretion for the trial judge to so determine that we review under an additional abuse of discretion standard.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Doesn't our law clearly establish the fact that the prosecution bears the burden of showing there's manifest necessity, and if there is an absence of evidence supporting that burden, hasn't been -- hasn't been -- why isn't that the answer to the case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what -- I'm sorry.  Please finish your sentence.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  What other explanation is there for a note saying ""Are we being too loud"", other than that there was some degree of acrimony on the jury?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, you don't dispute the fact that a note came out saying, Are we being too loud?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what would that indicate other than that there was some degree of acrimony?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you -- you do agree that there could be situations where a Federal court on direct review would find abuse of discretion, and yet a court on habeas under AEDPA would say that that has to stand?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So there are a category of cases where a Federal court could look at it and say, that's an abuse of discretion, but that same court reviewing it under habeas would say you are not entitled to relief under AEDPA?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How can you say that?  I mean, you may think the discretion was abused, but it's not like he just suddenly announced there was going to be a mistrial.  He exercised discretion.  He looked at the note, he asked the question, he's -- are you hopelessly deadlocked?  Are you going to be able to reach a unanimous verdict?  And he was able to rely on the fact that they had previously sent out a note saying, are we being too loud, and the fact he knew, 4-1/2 hours on a case in which there were 10 hours of testimony.  I mean, I understand your argument that he abused his discretion, but I don't understand the argument that he didn't exercise discretion at all.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, she asked the foreperson a question.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where did -- where did -- I'm sorry.  Where did she conflate the two things you said she conflated, deadlocked and the other thing?  What was it, inability to--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, but you got to read down further.  She says:  ""Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not? ""  And the foreperson says ""No"".   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, just -- with respect, it's not the very first sign of disagreement.  Reasonably interpreting, a note saying ""Are we being too loud"" is a sign of disagreement.  And there is another note that comes out:  ""What happens if we can't agree? ""  You are making it sound more precipitous than it was.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no, no.  I'm sorry.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  There is not a period on page 7 of the Petitioner's brief.  Is that a mistake?  There's a--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --dash.  And -- and could the court be concerned that the person was about to say, and again with deference to the court,  ""The majority -- majority of us don't believe that. ""  --that the defendant is guilty, that the defendant is innocent.  Wasn't the judge quite correct to stop her right there?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't that exactly what she did?  After that he says don't tell me what you are going to -- or don't tell me what you are going to say.  I don't want to know what your verdict might be or how the split is or anything like that, are you going to reach a unanimous verdict?  She did go on after that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --How -- how do you know she answered for herself?  The judge was talking -- she can't reach a unanimous verdict by herself.  She is answering for the jury.   ",09-338X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You concede, I take it, or acknowledge that one episode can be the basis -- I mean, going forward -- for a determination that the defendant has a policy, custom, or practice.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And they have sued the State here, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Or under Ex Parte Young?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Pincus.     ",09-350X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that's what you think.  So you agree -- it struck me that your argument could have been made by your friend on the other side.  You say if you get an injunction, you must have shown municipal policy, practice, or custom, and therefore, you agree that a municipal policy, custom, or practice is required.  That's what he thinks.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Monell doesn't apply to State officials, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That, of course, isn't before us.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that would require -- that would require us to get into the question of whether Ex Parte Young is a fiction or substance, which I certainly wouldn't like to get into.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Breyer's question said you need a city policy, and you said that's exactly right.  So I think the case is over.  The issue is whether you need a city policy, and your friend thinks so, and you think so.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you don't think that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I think your friend agrees.  But -- but how can the city have caused the violation in the absence of a city policy, custom, or practice?  You say you have to show causation to get an injunction.  The only way to show that the city caused the problem is to show that they have got a policy, custom or practice, including one that might be shown by inaction.  But you still have to show that and that's all Monell requires.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now you are arguing whether Monell was satisfied or not, and you are get ago chance to do that on remand because the Ninth Circuit has said we are giving -- we are making the city pay and now we are finding out if they violating anything.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the Ninth Circuit was wrong to send it back for a hearing?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because you have already shown Monell was satisfied.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --but, yes, damages, but turning on whether Monell was satisfied.  It was a hearing about Monell.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Go ahead.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How can you get relief -- how can you get relief going forward under Monell unless there has been a city violation before?  Otherwise what the injunction you were getting is just an injunction saying don't violate the law and the city has said we haven't, because you haven't shown that we have policy, practice, or custom.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you were sued--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I'm sorry, answer.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it's not -- defending the suit doesn't give rise to a municipal custom, policy or practice?  They may have -- somebody comes in and says this what's going on and they may say, well, we don't -- we dont' think that's unconstitutional.  So they are going to defend the suit.  That doesn't mean that they adopted a policy to do what they -- the individual employee has been alleged to have done.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well -- or continuing to do, I mean, the suit doesn't satisfy the requirement of showing a policy or practice, because they may defend on the ground that it is not unconstitutional.  They may say, look, this isn't our policy, this isn't our practice, but we are going to defend our employee because we don't think it is unconstitutional.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And so the city--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --The city is in a Catch-22 position.  Whenever they are sued, they have to say if we defend this, we are going to be liable under Monell; but if we don't defend it, then, you know, our policy is being changed.  Or we might -- we might want to have this policy, we might not.  We didn't know this clerk was doing that, but we might think it's a good idea, we might think it's a bad idea.  The cases are not always going to be as clear as the hypotheticals in your brief.  It seems to me that it's a bit much to tell the city, when you have to choose whether to defend a suit, you are in fact choosing what policy or practice to have going forward.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you've got to get relief against the city.  Because the city is not responsible for what happened until they adopt a policy, practice or custom.  Now if they are told this is unconstitutional and they decide to stick with it, then they're -- that's their policy and custom and you can get an injunction against them.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  He is not -- he is not entitled to prospective relief against the city, because the city has not caused the alleged harm.  Until you establish a policy, practice or custom.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you establish what the employee is doing in a suit against the employee, which the city is defending because he's one of their employees, then the city is put to a choice.  Once -- I suppose once the legal process has concluded they have to decide whether they have to continue that or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What I'd like the answer to is whether or not merely defending the employee in court is sufficient to establish that the city has that policy, custom or practice.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, sure.  Sure.  You are back where Justice -- Justice Alito was commenting, well, that at some point you have to bring what you were complaining about to the attention of the city.  You dismiss that as an exhaustion requirement, but--   ",09-350X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  In this -- when the judge did not enter a date for restitution, did you object to that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why not?  It seems that that's when the violation occurred.  The statute said the court shall set a date if they're not ready to calculate the restitution, and he didn't do that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I thought it says -- maybe I am misreading it.  It says the court -- this is at sentencing.  When sentencing -- you look at the previous provision -- what is it?  3663A(a)(1)--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --talks about what you do when sentencing it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And the statute says,  ""the court shall set a date for the final determination. ""  90 days> [""].  And he didn't.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I think that's right.  I -- I agree with you on that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, the final determination -- the date for the -- the final determination can't exceed 90 days--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --but that doesn't mean that the provision saying the court shall set a date can wait -- that he can wait 89 days to do that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, no--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --So you can -- under your view, you can change the amount of jail time up to the point at which you have to set the restitution.  The judge says: I'm going to sentence you to 3 years, and I'm going to figure out the restitution.  He looks, and the restitution turns out to be a lot more than he thought.  So he says: Well, I'm only going to give you 2 years.  Or it's less, and he says: I'm going to give you 4 years.  Because the judgment is still open, he can do that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Heytens.     Toby J. Heytens  We don't think it means the same thing, Mr. Chief Justice.  What we think it means is the violation should have the same consequences.  The violation is to say if you don't do what you are supposed to, the remedy is to do it immediately.  The remedy isn't to say you don't have to do it anymore.  If there are no further questions, the government urges that the judgment of the court below be affirmed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Karlan, you have 4 minutes.     ",09-367X

Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, let's -- let's suppose there's no 3664(d)(5), and we're back to just 363(a)(1), which says when sentencing a defendant, the court shall order restitution.  What if the judge doesn't -- is that mandatory?  It has to be when sentencing the defendant?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think even without 3664(d)(5), the judge can say: I know it says when I'm sentencing I've got to order restitution.  But 2 months later, he can do it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but nothing happens if he doesn't.  Is that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --So a -- a defendant who is sentenced to a week in prison, and he decides, that's no big deal, I'm not going to appeal, and then finds out, you know, 90 days later he has got to pay a million dollars in restitution, is just out of luck, right?

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Schnapper.  Mr. Miller.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you regard -- is that the same as a but-for cause, motivating factor?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about a situation where a particular procedure such as the one here is set up for a discriminatory reason, and the employee is really upset with that, and so he, you know, starts a fire in the plant?  Wouldn't have had -- wouldn't have set the fire if not for the discriminatory purpose.  Now does he have a cause of action in that case when he is fired for setting -- setting the office on fire?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you do accept that the traditional doctrine of an intervening cause is applicable in this?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but what -- what independent intervening cause--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, I'm sorry -- but I think the end there just kind of glided over the whole issue.  You say it had nothing to do with his military status.  It has to do with a procedure that was set up because the employer was discriminating against him because of his military status.  So it certainly had something to do with his military status.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I know, but the hypothetical is extreme to try to flesh out your position.  You can certainly imagine an employee reacting in a particular way by being put through procedures that were set up in a discriminatory manner, that would seem to anybody to be a basis for termination, even though the groundwork was laid by the discriminatory procedure.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Davis.     Roy G.

Roberts, Jr.  And I understood your position to be that the supervisor has to have such dominant control that it's the ""Cat's Paw"".   John G.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what if you get in Justice Kennedy's situation, where the court doesn't know what's going to happen on remand?  You know, the objection is -- the administrator throws it out, saying, you know, you filed the wrong form, so you lose.  And the district court says you can't throw it out on that basis; under trust law, it doesn't matter.  And it goes back.  Now, the district court doesn't know what's going to happen.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, what is the impact on your position of our decision last week in Conkright v. Frommert?  I know you haven't had a chance to brief it, but I'm also sure had you a chance to read it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I would have thought that it -- one thing it did emphasize, that in the typical case, the likely relief is going to be sending it back rather than making a judicial decision, which -- which seems to me, then, that -- and then presumably, in most cases, the person would prevail before the plan administrator.  So given Conkright, your position is going to severely limit the circumstances under which claimants are entitled to fees.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even though the -- as in Conkright, the claimant's success can -- before an agreement, can be quite dramatic.  This was a very, very significant victory for the claimant to get it sent back under those circumstances.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that how it works?  Remands always retain jurisdiction?  I would -- I would have thought the district judge would want the thing off his or her docket, you know, for the statistics, if anything.  And--  [Laughter]  --and would say, and maybe could say -- well, what if the judge says: Look, I don't know if you're going to prevail or not on remand.  My decision actually doesn't help you much one way or the other, but if you get benefits, then the other side is liable for attorney's fees, and I assume you'll be able to work out the amount.  If you don't, he's done.  End of case.  Sent back to the administrator.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if the parties -- to follow up on Justice Ginsburg's line of questioning, what if the parties decide, look, this case rises or falls on the discovery issue?  If we have to go through discovery, it's going to cost us a lot more than to pay you.  So we stipulate whatever the ruling is on discovery will decide the issue.  In that case, can the party -- can the claimant get fees?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it grants the discovery order, and as a result, a direct result of that ruling, the plan pays benefits.   ",09-448X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You agree that those are two different things, then, right?  The vacatur is one thing and the injunction is another, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And under the vacatur, the normal APA remedy is a remand to the agency.  In fact, there are some courts that say you can't get anything else.  But whether you can or can't, it's clear that the burden is on you to get something short of complete remand.  The burden is on your friends to get -- establish the injunction.  The problem with combining the two, it seems to me, is that you are imposing on them the burden to meet the injunction standard simply to get a remand to which they are entitled under the APA.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the vacatur does that.  You can't plant once the deregulation order is vacated.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you would say that the injunction is limited only to a decision the agency might make to allow partial planting?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  Why did it do that?  I mean, the way the APA works, this is sent back to the agency.  If the agency wants to partially deregulate, it can do it.  And then you can challenge it under the normal APA procedures.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's very odd to get an injunction to an agency telling them they can't do something under the APA.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What authority do you have for the proposition that when a court vacates an administrative order, it has the authority to tailor an injunction rather than simply remand the matter to the agency?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess -- Weinberger, of course, involved a statute.  I mean, the concern is that the authority to determine how far to go in deregulating or partial deregulating is for the agency to make.  And once there has been a violation of the APA, it goes back to the agency.  What the district court did here was assume that responsibility itself.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Garre.  Mr. Stewart.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  You have the burden to establish your entitlement to those conditions that are short of a remand, correct?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure, sure.  Agencies can do that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, sure, because -- but here the question is whether the court can do that.  The court is stepping into the shoes of the agency.  And I would say it's -- I mean, there's authority that you can't do that at all, but certainly you'd have the burden to establish that those reliefs short of remand, that you are entitled to that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you're short-circuiting notice and comment or whatever else is required, the reason we send this to an agency, because they are expert and all that.  The agency is acting without the benefit of any input on the partial deregulation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you -- do you agree that when you're talking about the elements of the injunction that are short of remand to the agency, that the Respondents do not have the obligation to meet the injunction standards with respect to those?  In other words, it's part of the judgment.  It's not an injunction, and you have the burden if you want the court to do anything other than send it back.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I'm talking to the -- about the types of activities that would be prohibited if the court just remanded it back, vacated it, which is everything -- you can't plant.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess my point is they don't need an injunction.  The thing that's bothering me is you've got two different things, the vacatur and the injunction.  And it seems to me by melding them together, you're trying to impose the burden on the plaintiffs to meet the injunction standard to get the benefit of the vacatur.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Stewart.  Mr. Robbins.     Lawrence S. Robbins  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Garre, you have 3 minutes.     ",09-475X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if the injunction doesn't do anything, why are you bothering to defend it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Just -- I'm sorry to interrupt.  Just from the seeds blowing in the wind?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that -- there's a flip side of that that is not so good for you, because one of the things you want from the injunction is a prohibition on the agency partially deregulating.  Well, you're not entitled to that, because the vacatur sends it -- should send it back to the agency and they can decide.  And if they decide to partially deregulate, you have the APA challenges available to you.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your argument is that the district court judge made a mistake in mixing up the vacatur and the injunction?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't mean to interrupt your answer, but they've already done an EA in support of total deregulation, presumably, and they found no adverse -- presumably, that would be a fortiori for partial.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could I go back to something you said a while ago, that ""likely"" does not mean more likely than not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's -- I thought that would be obvious.  If I say your friends are likely to win, that means they are more likely than you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you have -- I -- I was surprised that this apparently hasn't been decided over the however many years we've had this standard.  Is there a case that says ""likely"" does not mean more likely than not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that's a decision for the government to decide, APHIS, and their lawyer, Mr. Stewart, who is in the courtroom told us what the APHIS view is.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  All arguments you can make before HP -- APHIS and which presumably were made before APHIS--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --and can be made before APHIS if this is remanded.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It doesn't entitle you to an order saying APHIS can't do anything in the meantime.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's kind of artificial to separate the two out.  I mean, it's one judgment, and they say they're intertwined.  The injunction is based on the vacatur.  And so if they challenge the injunction, you can't say, well, they're not challenging the vacatur.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but we have to decide -- for you to prevail on that, we have to decide that the injunction does no more than the vacatur.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so the district judge was wrong.  He should have -- if you say the injunction adds nothing to the vacatur, he should have ended by saying it's vacated.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you're -- if you are right that the injunction does nothing, they don't have standing because of that, we should throw the injunction out.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  No, it seems to me the perfectly natural reading to say: Look, we are providing some minimum sentences when this happens, when this is the violent crime and you use a gun, but if you have already got a higher sentence for the violent crime, then this doesn't apply.     Roy W. McLeese, III  That is true.  My point about the anomaly is just that it is very strange, to my knowledge unheard of, to have a judge go to sentencing and have a series of adjudications and to tell the judge as to one of them that it's not the greater or lesser included offense of another; you don't even need to impose a sentence on that adjudication.  The backdrop basic assumption is, on each of the adjudications, you impose a sentence.  Now, that is not true if offenses are greater or lesser or are the same offense, for double jeopardy purposes.  But under Petitioner's submission, that is true with respect to offenses like being a felon in possession of a firearm and being someone who violated 924(c) that are different offenses in double jeopardy law and have always been given separate judgments, separate punishments.  If the Court has no further questions, we would request that the judgements below be affirmed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. McLeese.  Mr. Ryan, you have three minutes remaining.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's not -- I can't imagine a single district judge getting that wrong.  To think that, oh, my gosh, here it says 10 years if you discharge the firearms and here it says 5 years if you have one, which one do I use in a case when it's discharged?  You don't need this provision.  Your argument can't be that this language is to make sure the district judge knows in that case to use the 10-year rather than the 5-year?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess things are obvious to different people.  I would have thought it would be odd to say when there are increased minimums that the highest minimum applicable isn't the one that applies.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But your main -- the meat of your argument focuses on 3559(c), right?  There is this significant provision out there that does provide a greater mandatory minimum.  And I just don't see as a practical matter why people would worry about that.  Under 3559(c), you get life.  And you are saying, well, they put in the 5 years at the end of a life sentence.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, exactly.  Yes, I'm sorry.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Well, just so I make sure I understand, the basic point you are making is that there are some things under your reading that this deals with.  One is the internal point, and we can disagree as to whether that is necessary or not, and the other is 3559(c), where it seems to me it doesn't make any difference whether you are in there for life or life and the additional 5 years.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's a difficult -- you are saying because Congress wanted to get tough on the people that use firearms in this provision, every ambiguous clause should be read in a way that makes it tougher on the criminal defendant?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  With respect to 3559(c) they were in fact being more lenient, not stricter, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought you said earlier the purpose of this, what it does, is it makes sure that you don't add five extra years on the people who are sentenced to life.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which is just saying when you get life, or you get 5, just serve life, don't serve the extra 5.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there any evidence in the legislative history that the reason they put this in was to ensure that people who got life would not get life plus five years?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You should pick any other violent or drug trafficking offense that already provides a higher minimum.     INTERRUPTING ",09-479X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But not to the question of which parties have agreed to arbitrate?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not the question of which parties have agreed to arbitrate?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I suppose that the substance of the agreement -- maybe this is just the same question as Justice Scalia's.  I suppose the substance of the agreement is evidence -- could be evidence on the unconscionability at formation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that is for the court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, the point is -- it's not that.  It would be the -- the provisions are so one-sided that you may assume from that that the formation was not voluntary.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your position is that the arbitrator gets to decide questions of unconscionability, but the court gets to decide whether the arbitrator can do that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I would have thought the answer to your -- the answer to your answer would be, well then, the -- you're more likely to win on that question.  Obviously, you are going to lose on the gun to the head, but if it's simply the economic inequality or whatever, under the State law you're probably going to prevail, and they will say there is a valid contract.  I thought the -- your -- your whole point was simply it's all or nothing.  The courts get to decide is there a valid contract or is there not.  And once they decide there is, then everything else about unconscionability of particular clauses is for the arbitrator.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Silverberg.     Ian E. Silverberg  There -- there is something unusual.  They've gone well beyond the AAA and limited discovery to one deposition and one expert, which in an employment case is very difficult.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I would have thought the issue would be -- it's odd to say, I think, that if you have 10 provisions, some are unconscionable and some are not.  The issue would be whether there is unconscionability in the making of the whole contract.  In other words, it's the same question I asked your friend: Why isn't it all or nothing?  If it was -- if there was no unconscionability in the making, then the arbitrator decides.  If there was unconscionability in the making, then -- then the arbitrator doesn't decide anything.  Questions 1 through 10, not simply, you know, 1, 8, and 9.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, my point is that once you get past that gateway question of whether the formation of the contract was not unconscionable, then claims that particular provisions were unconscionable are by definition for the arbitrator to decide.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought your--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --No, that can't be right.  The -- how can you say there's no problem agreeing to arbitrate, no imbalance in bargaining authority whatever, but then say, oh, but these procedures are unconscionable?  It seems to me that the procedures are there, and the party, the employee, whatever, can look at those.  And if he says, well, that's unconscionable, you don't sign the agreement as a whole.  But once you are -- in for a penny, in for a pound.  If you agree to arbitrate, then it's at least for the arbitrator to decide particular provisions, whether they're unconscionable.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know you're arguing in the alternative.  But the one argument that we get to pick out the provisions we don't like and say those are unconscionable, but the agreement as a whole is not -- that seems to me illogical.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's a matter -- it may be a matter of State law, but the open question is who gets to decide it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Arbitrators decide matters of State law all the time.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does it make a difference in response to Justice Stevens's hypothetical that there is a provision saying the arbitrator will decide the conscionability of all clauses?  The arbitrator may decide that clauses 2 and 8 are unconscionable, but if there's an agreement and it's not unconscionable that the arbitrator will decide, then the arbitrator decides all of them, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I ask you just a follow-up on Justice Breyer's hypothetical to you where he had the first agreement and then the issue to the second?  You said you've got to leave the door open.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  A decision that I suppose would be left at some point or another up to the State.   INTERRUPTING John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you can single out the railroads through exemptions.  I mean, let's say you have a tax of $1,000 per mile per day for anything that uses a thoroughfare in the State.  However, things that use roads, waterways, you know, the long list that in effect leaves only the railroads exposed.  You are saying that can't be regarded as a tax that discriminates against the railroads?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So what if there's only two that pay it?  Only -- and it applies only to railroads and bicycles?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We can determine that a tax is not generally applicable based on the exemptions.  If everybody else is exempt, well, it's not generally applicable.  If just bicycles are also exempt, then it is not generally applicable.  We have to look at the exemptions to decide whether there is discrimination.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  Just so I follow: And that test says what?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sure I'm just repeating mysself here.  So that it doesn't single it out if there's one additional business or line of business subject to the tax, no matter how small that exemption is?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Exactly.  So the Court has to decide, even when you are dealing with exemptions, whether or not that discriminates against the railroad?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If I'm right, that means you lose the case--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --at least as the question presented has been addressed, because all we are deciding -- I understand you think we ought to decide more, but all we are deciding is: Can (b)(4) ever come into play when the discrimination arises from an exemption?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's what railroads do.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it still doesn't get to the question that in courts in each particular case will be able to decide, even under your test, whether it singles out railroads.  The only question I have is that whether singling out means railroads have to be the only business subject to it, or if it has to be, you know, some theory -- Justice Kennedy was looking for a test.  I don't know if we have got a workable one -- to decide when it's really discriminating against the railroad and when it's that the exceptions are just the way taxes normally work.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you think section 11501(c) is relevant to all these disputes, because one thing 11501(c) does is give the State a little bit of a break?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  They recognize that it is hard to have exact equality in terms of ad valorem property assessment.  So, what does -- what does it say -- you know, a 5 percent legal room.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Couldn't you, if we rule against you, when you get back and other State officials say, look, the one thing we don't have to worry about is being precise.  We have got some legal room, so we can exempt the 85-year-old widow, we can, you know, exempt the farm property.  We just kind of have to get it close so that if somebody looks at it, and they'll say, well, it doesn't really look like they are discriminating against railroads, why isn't that pertinent and why doesn't it respond to a lot of your concerns?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I know.  I'm using that not as saying that this is applicable to (b)(4), but that it gives you an idea that Congress didn't have the precise absolute rule, and you go one, you know, 1 inch over the line and you are in trouble.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It clearly -- it clearly applies to (b)(1) through (3) and has got nothing to do with (b)(4) because it can't apply to (b)(4).   John G. Roberts, Jr.  (b)(4) is not a -- (b)(4), the whole point is if it's not a property tax, you don't have ad valorem assessments, so the details limiting jurisdiction when you do have ad valorem taxes don't apply to this case at all.

The outside counsel reviews what the policy is going to be?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Our question is the validity of that statement, whether that's deceptive in the prospectus.  That seems to me to be an entirely different question.  I understood your theory of the case to be that JCM is liable, basically, because they put it in the prospectus.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's the question, I guess, that -- your response seems to beg the question -- is that they falsely represented.  The issue is whether or not something happened between their drafting and its appearance in the prospectus.  That makes it appropriate to say that that's a statement of the trust rather than a statement of JCM.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry to interrupt, but it seems be an important -- when they issued the prospectus?  Who issued the prospectus?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And the SEC has recognized that they remain two separate entities, despite the interconnected relationship.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The one activity -- one activity that we know they did not outsource was review of the materials submitted by JCM.  They had independent counsel that conducted that review.  Would it have been a breach of the trustees' fiduciary obligations to the fund investors under common law -- I forget where this is incorporated -- to rubberstamp what they get from somebody on the outside, not to have independent counsel review what they're going to say in their prospectus?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't that, again, what has been conceded: That there may well be an action from the Fund represented by their trustees against--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Except, except to the SEC, right?  Because they can pursue it under aiding and abetting.  It's kind of a big--   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but is it independent from the State?  Is that what the statute says?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You say on page 27 of your brief, the blue brief, that there is no big deal here with respect to State sovereignty because ultimately the sovereign retains the authority to dissolve the State agency plaintiff if the State believes the litigation is too onerous.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's a good cite for your proposition, but arguably in those cases the ICC is really not the real party in interest.  The real party in interest is the beneficiary of the ICC ruling.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  To get back to my question, no court would entertain Ford West against Ford East?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not divisions; separate corporate entities that happened to be wholly owned by the same parent.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I would have thought that would become an advisory opinion.  Ford has an internal dispute, basically, and in that hypothetical one of the entities would be asking the Federal court to resolve it.  Ford can decide at the end of the day how it wants to resolve it.  If Ford West wins and Ford East loses, Ford can say, all right, this is how we are going to do it regardless of what the Federal court says.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  So that if, for example, the referendum involves a bond issue as to which people may have particular views, but they're not going to get terribly excited about it, we'd still have to say that that's protected under the First Amendment?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, my point is, though, you're not likely to get that with respect to, you know, a debt issue, raising the debt ceiling from 0.8 percent to 0.9 percent.  You're not going to get a crowd outside your house because you signed that petition.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose the -- a majority of the voters in Washington decided that, and one of the purposes of the First Amendment is to protect minorities.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  What would the First Amendment interests be?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you think having your name revealed on a petition of this sort might have a chilling effect on whether you sign it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't think revealing that you're a voter has the same chilling effect as revealing how you voted, do you?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I thought you told me that the First Amendment interests were implicated with respect to the secret ballot, that you couldn't require people to reveal how they voted.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, your answer to Justice Breyer was that they can bring an as-applied challenge.  Now, that as-applied challenge would be small comfort unless the names were protected pending the resolution of that challenge, correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think a stay should be granted in this case to allow the Petitioners to pursue an as-applied challenge.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you think that the disclosure of the names, pending the resolution of their as-applied challenge, would subject them to incidents of violence and intimidation?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  There's no evidence -- there's no evidence of episodes of violence or intimidation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what's the most sensitive similar petition for a referendum?

Roberts, Jr.  --What's -- what's the other one that's going to get people -- that's the most controversial public issue?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I'm talking about in Washington, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Was the referendum in favor or opposed to assisted suicide?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What percentage -- what percentage of the people who signed this petition to put this law on the referendum do you think signed it because they think these sort of things should be generally put to a public vote as opposed to because they opposed the law?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You think as much as 20 percent of the people who signed this petition are actually in favor of the law that it's aimed to repeal?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought one of the reasons you wanted to do this was so people would have information that would allow them to participate in the civic process, and there are people who -- might think it makes a difference whether a referendum was requested by -- primarily by members of a particular ethnic group or not.  So isn't -- doesn't -- I thought your brief would say the State has an interest in that type of disclosure.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How can they--   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  How do you train your new hires?  First day, somebody right out of law school shows up and says, I want to be an assistant district attorney.  How do you train them?     J. Gordon Cooney Jr.  I think the first thing you do is you have a hiring process that emphasizes the important of -- the importance of Brady, as this office did.  Brady was important.  One witness said -- McElroy -- from the moment you walked in the door, you had to write an essay on Brady.  Brady was emphasized as being very important.   ",09-571X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, Justice Alito's question was what you would tell the assistant D.A.'s.  What's your answer?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  That's your instruction on -- on Brady.  Now, you are basing liability on -- on this incident of failing to comply with Brady.  So you say they should have instructed on Brady.  What else should they have instructed on?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You are the -- you're the new D.A. and you are putting up -- I need to instruct my people.  What -- what do they instruct on?  I know they instruct on Brady under your view.  What else?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, we are -- we are looking at specifics where they are going to violate the Constitution.  I think that's a good thing, to tell them they have an obligation as well to protect the innocent.  But we are worried about violations of our constitutional requirements.  We know Brady is one.  What is the next one?  What is day 2 in the course?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if it is -- prosecutors can violate a defendant's constitutional rights by making improper statements in their closing arguments.  Do you have to instruct new -- I suspect new prosecutors coming out of law school don't know what those rules are.  Do you have to give instruction on what they can say in closing arguments?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  My understanding is -- I'm not an expert in criminal law.  I need training in that.  But my understanding is that comments in a closing argument can give rise to a constitutional violation.  So you should -- you should train those people.  You know that.  You know that that can happen, just as you know there can be Brady violations.  So they need training in exactly what they can say and can't say in closing arguments.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  When you are talking about improper comments in closing argument, it is the prosecuting attorney.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you don't have to train with respect to closing arguments?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could I ask you what -- most law offices with which I am familiar, the training is mentoring.  In other words, the young attorneys learn from the older attorneys, often by following them along -- around.  Would it have been an adequate training program for this office simply to say, new prosecutors, you don't get to be first chair prosecutors until after a year, and you are going to follow one of the prosecutors around and learn from them?  Is that an adequate training program?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even -- even if the violation that becomes of the basis for the claim later on is one that, you know, didn't come up in that year?  We -- they didn't have a Brady issue in that first year.  They went around; they sat in, in a lot of trials; but there wasn't a Brady issue and so they didn't learn about this type of question.  And -- does that give rise to a claim of the sort you are bringing here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But isn't that -- isn't that best practice?  In other words, I thought that was the good thing, when what the prosecutor does is say, look at everything we've got.  And as my brother has suggested, what is important may not be there for either deliberate misconduct or by happenstance.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Would this have been a no-training case if the rule was you have to be in the office for 3 years as a second chair prosecutor before we let you have a case, and in fact, you have to be here 10 years before we let you have a capital case?  That's all it says.  Is that sufficient training?   ",09-571X

And you say that he could have dragged him from the pool to the couch because there were drops along the way.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, what other expert evidence should Richter's counsel should have pursued before deciding upon this course of action in this case?  Put aside the blood splatter expert.  What other experts did he need to consult.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  We have got a blood splatter expert, a ballistics expert.  Go on.  I thought in the habeas proceeding, you said he should have consulted a serologist and a pathologist.  Okay, that's four.  Why wouldn't he want to talk to an expert on the effects of alcohol and drugs on people's different perceptions of the events?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought the Ninth Circuit said that part of the ineffective assistance was failing to consult an expert in planning his defense and in preparing his defense, not simply responding to the State's expert in the middle of trial.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do I understand you -- I just want to step back to your prior answer.  You think what counsel did here would have been effective assistance but for exactly what he said in the opening statement?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You mean the case against Gunner you've just described, would it have been enough, and wouldn't that have justified counsel's decision to focus on credibility rather than expert physical evidence?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Did -- did the counsel have to investigate the other aspects?  I mean, we are talking -- we are focusing on the scene where the shooting took place.  Did he have to consider experts with respect to the bypass, where they threw the guns, Victor's apartment, the vehicle that was used?  One thing counsel said is he thought about hiring a tire expert because of the vehicle.  He has to look at the possibility of expert testimony affecting every aspect of the various scenes that were pertinent in this claim?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What does -- what happens -- I know you have an answer that that's not this case, but what -- what happens if the defendant tells his lawyer, look, I did it, I'm guilty?  And the lawyer decides that the best thing to do is try to pin it on a guy whose nickname is Gunner?  [Laughter]  Does -- does -- what else is the lawyer supposed to do?  He thinks no matter what -- what physical evidence is found, it's got to cut against his client because his client did it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, your case -- your case does have an AEDPA issue.  Perhaps you want to turn--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --to that now.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It worked.   ",09-587X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Under the applicable State law, what's required before the recidivist sentence is triggered?  Is it a formal finding of recidivism by the -- by a jury?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but the State prosecutors often prosecute when they have a recidivist provision under that, rather than the much more difficult illicit trafficking crime.  I mean, if you're going to go to jail for a certain amount of years for a recidivist possession, that's easier to show than illicit trafficking.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan.  Ms. Saharsky.     Nicole A. Saharsky  In neither case does the prosecutor's judgment matter.  What matters is the offense conduct that was established by the conviction in State court.  What matters is the offense that the person was convicted of and if that corresponds to a Federal offense that was punishable as a felony in Federal court.  It is true that some charges may be brought and some charges may not be brought, and that would impact what a person has been convicted of.  So there could be disparities based on that.  But what Congress decided was that it had to balance its need for uniformity with a rule that is administrable, and the rule that it picked as administrable is, let's look at the offense conduct that was established by the conviction.  And when you look at that offense conduct, you have to ask how it could be punished in Federal court.  And it's that ""punishable"" language that requires this more hypothetical inquiry on how the events -- how the offense could be treated.  And just to summarize, it is clear from the last 20 years that Congress has had a very serious concern about recidivist criminal aliens in the United States, and Congress has made a judgment since 1970 in the drug laws that two drug possession offenses should be punishable as a felony.  And under those circumstances, a person who concededly has committed those two drug offenses and who concededly, if taken to Federal court, could have been punished as a felony, just should not be able to escape the aggravated felony designation that Congress intended for all aliens who are similarly situated.  If the Court has no further questions, we submit the judgment below should be affirmed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Saharsky.  Mr. Srinivasan, you have 4 minutes remaining.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry to interrupt so quickly, but that especially I take it -- I take it as a concession that there's a difference between claims for qualified immunity based on evidence and claims that are based on law.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't understand, counsel, how your argument that in every case you need to know the facts, every qualified immunity case you need to know the facts, and those only come out at trial -- is consistent with our recognizing that you can have a collateral order appeal of denial of summary judgment.  In other words, you can consider qualified immunity without knowing how the facts are going to come out at trial, which is why we allow you to have an appeal before trial.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, so you are just saying your case on qualified immunity isn't like that case; Is that all?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you have an obligation in opposing summary judgment to, in your list of disputed facts or facts that preclude summary judgment, to put all that in.  And why didn't you put the point you are raising now in the opposition to summary judgment?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know.  So it--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, but -- but you may prevail.  You may have three different factual disputes that the other side is saying are undisputed, and the fact that you prevail on one doesn't meant that you didn't have an obligation to put in your opposition the others.

Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Mills, you have three minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your rule, in response to Justice Sotomayor, would basically require anyone who has an assertion of qualified immunity to take their collateral appeal or interlocutory appeal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So they are put to a choice whether or not their qualified immunity claim rests entirely on law or might turn out, as you say it did in your case, to have some factual aspect?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's kind of a tough choice to put them to, isn't it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So they have to take the immediate appeal, and when they do so, they lose the right to appeal at the end?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why is that?   ",09-737X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, that is right, and I find that in the context where that already matters, whether they are appealable as a collateral issue, already very difficult and complicated to sort out.  Now, what you want us to do is take that difficulty and continue it on in terms of when you can appeal and when you can't.  Some qualified immunity claims are purely legal.  Some are purely factual.  Some are in the middle.  Wouldn't it be easier if we just said: Here's the rule from now on, you've got to renew them all in a 50(b) motion and that makes it a lot easier for the trial courts and the appellate courts to figure out when they have to -- when they can consider it and when they can't.  I understand your argument that it makes a difference.  I think it's a good argument, because some don't depend on the facts.  But going forward it just creates an awful lot of difficulty that we don't need to buy into.   INTERRUPTING ",09-737X

Roberts, Jr.  Well, no -- Justice -- Justice Alito posed, the grandmother was returning from the grave of her grandson.  She didn't enter the public discussion at all.  So I'm anxious to determine whether in those circumstances you think the First Amendment allows that cause of action or not.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Your response -- your response to Justice Alito is dwelling on the facts of this particular case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm interested in knowing what your position is on the broader question.  Can you imagine a circumstance where this same type of discussion is directed at an individual and yet would give rise to the tort of emotional distress?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry, can or cannot?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You can.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So if you recognize that there can be a tort of emotional distress in circumstances like that, isn't that, the factual question of whether it rises to that level of outrageousness, which is part of the tort for the jury?

Roberts, Jr.  --Does it make a difference, which seems to me to be the case here, that Mr. Snyder was selected not because of who he was, but because it was a way to get maximum publicity for your client's particular message?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, assuming it is accurate, does that make a difference?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it might affect whether or not the selection inflicts emotional distress for a reason unconnected with the individual who is the subject of the emotional distress.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, if the person is selected because, as I indicated, it gives maximum publicity, rather than because of a particular connection to the matter of public debate, I wonder if that makes a difference.

And one of the things I think is important in the tax code is that you not have litigation on different case, so the different courts are coming out with different rules.

So why doesn't it make sense simply to refer to -- to defer to the Service's interpretation?   INTERRUPTING John G.

The only way you can draw the line is to have somebody say: This is going to be the line.  And if anybody is going to say it, it ought to be the IRS.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts  There's no -- there's no question, Your Honor.  It's always been the Social Security Administration's position that medical residents are not students exempt from the Social Security Act.  The Social Security Administration stated that in a Social Security ruling as far as back as 1978, and they continue to adhere to that position.  In addition, as a practical matter, the way the Social Security Administration determines whether people get coverage for a particular period under the Social Security Act is they look at the W-2's that come in.  And if FICA tax has been paid, then they put them down as being covered under the Social Security Act.  So as a practical matter, it works that way as well.  As I said before, these workers who are working between 50 and 80 hours a week over many years for substantial salaries, are precisely the kind of workers whose employers should be supporting the Social Security system and who should be earning credit towards disability and survivor benefits.

And then when you bring a claim for -- for money because of mismanagement of the trust, that's -- that's quite different.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that -- is that to assert the basis about why an accounting should be required?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what is the -- maybe I don't know enough about what an accounting is.  But why would it be other equitable relief to which they are entitled if they simply say, we want to know what we've got?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And they can get -- and then it may be a basis for a further claim that, if that's all we've got, where did the rest of it go, and that might be the Court of Claims action.  But it does strike me that they are different -- claims for different relief.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it accounting what should have been in the trust fund or what actually is?  You say give me an accounting of the trust fund.  Does the officer go back and just add up the bank accounts and value the land and all that?  Or--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --does he go back and say, well, this should be there but it's not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Going forward.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, are you at cross-purposes on those two issues?  When it comes to what an accounting is, you want to say, oh, that's just going forward; when it comes to this 1500 question you want to say they're the same as the money damages, which goes backward?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not -- I mean, you are putting a pejorative spin on what they are doing, saying, you know, many plaintiffs like to take a chance in more than one court.  But your response to Justice Breyer suggests that that's a tough choice if you have to choose between injunctive relief or damages.  That's not them trying to, you know, get the same -- take two bites at the apple.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Yang.  Ms. Spinelli.     Danielle Spinelli  --There are a couple of reasons why that doesn't work, Justice Kennedy.  First of all, the Nation needs the accounting now.  I mean, it's as if in Casman, Casman had been told, well, you know, first get reinstated -- I'm sorry -- first get your backpay; then go get reinstated.  He needs his job back now not later -- the Nation needs the accounting now, not later.  In addition, if it were the case that the accounting uncovered additional mismanagement, this statute of limitations, the six-year statute of limitations might well expire while the district court suit for an accounting is pending, those suits tend to last a very long time.  Indeed in the Indian Claims Commission they have been known to last for up to 50 years.  And it would force the Nation to run the risk of losing its right to damages.  We don't believe that's what Congress had in mind.  It doesn't harmonize Section 1500 with the remainder of the statutory scheme.  It's not mandated by the history of the statute, and it simply doesn't make sense.  Unless there are further questions, we ask for the judgment be affirmed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Yang, you have four minutes remaining.     John G.

Maybe the Court of Federal Claims, you can't go there and say, look, I want an accounting, but you can say I have been wronged over the century and I would like to find out to what extent, and before you can figure that out you actually have to have an accounting.  Can't the Court of Federal Claims get an accounting in that context?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.

Roberts, Jr.  In other words, how these -- you've obviously seen a lot of these and I haven't seen any, but I mean, do the Rule 35 motions typically say -- do they typically concede the legal validity of the sentence and then simply say -- what?  I mean, I assume the sentencing is completely open and you can put in anything at all, like the deprived childhood, the unique situation, the age, whatever.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In what sense is Rule 35 different from the arguments that are made at sentencing?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's bad for you, isn't it, for the very point that Justice Kennedy was raising?  If it's the same sort of arguments that you get to raise as a legal matter prior to the imposition of sentencing, why should they not be considered legal matters when they are raised under Rule 35?

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why don't you just call your motion a motion to correct an illegal sentence?  Then we wouldn't have any dispute here, I gather.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You are not one of the stupid lawyers that we were worried about before.  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sure of that.  But you do think that if you had -- if you or whoever files these motions had simply said that, there would be no problem, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's because you want something other than legal review, right?  You want to throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  You have got plenty of avenues to correct the illegality of the sentence, but this is something different, right?  This is to -- not correct -- you admit it's illegal, but you say it should still be reduced for a lot of reasons.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You can raise all of those -- all of those claims under the normal State collateral post-conviction, State habeas, all those other thing, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So I guess I'm having trouble.  You can -- the various grounds on which the sentence should have been lower than it was, including the fact that setting the sentence at that level was an abuse of discretion, you obviously can raise those at sentencing and you can raise those on direct review, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can you challenge it on -- in State habeas?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's the only vehicle you have -- that's the only vehicle you have for challenging the sentence?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I may have asked this already, but it seems unusual to me so I want to make sure the answer.  You have a client who is convicted of a particular offense that results in a sentence of what, zero to 5 years, okay?  And the judge in imposing the sentence engages in racial discrimination.  It turns out that he sentences African Americans to 5 years and Caucasian defendants to 2 years.  That you are telling me is a claim that you cannot raise on direct review or on -- in State habeas?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you say it ""would be raised"".  Are you saying it can only be raised under Rule 35?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's what I would have thought.  So Rule 35 is not the only vehicle for challenging a sentence?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess the question -- and I'm sorry if I cut you off -- is not that this is a question of abuse, that it may be a good thing.  The idea is you have got a motion for reduction of sentence because of mercy, and the judge might say: Well, I'm inclined to exercise mercy if you come out of the rehab program in a good way, if it turns out after the first several months that you are a model prisoner.  In other words, it's not a question of abuse, it's a good thing; and if we start saying that the time for Federal habeas is tolled, judges might be inclined not to exercise such charity based on the prisoner's conduct after conviction.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  If I could just go to your -- your second reason seemed to be focused particularly on arbitration as opposed to a principle that applies to every other contract.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but the substantive State liability rule on the issue you are addressing is that you consider the issue of consent ex ante, and with respect to arbitration you are considering it at the time the dispute arose.  Isn't that a discrimination against arbitration agreements?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, sure.  That's true in all of these cases.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's a question of what the State law provides; then you consider whether it's consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what other area of contract law does the court consider unconscionability not with respect to the parties before the court, but with respect to third parties?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But isn't that -- doesn't that look to the parties before the court rather than third parties?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's a general rule of contract law that contracts contrary to public policy could be unenforceable.  It seems to me that's quite different than saying we're worried about third parties that are in the same position as these particular parties.  In other words, it's not simply adverse public consequences, but it's a different mode of analysis than I'm familiar with under basic contract law.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where do you get--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Where do you get ""obvious subterfuge"" in the Federal Arbitration Act?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's in the independent and adequate State ground context, which strikes me as quite different.  We have a statute here that says the arbitration agreements have to be treated like any other contract, any contract.  I don't see how that's the same as obvious subterfuge.   ",09-893X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  And they get it whether or not they incur that expense or not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, food, you don't have to say, well, he did spend this much money on food, so he gets the same deduction?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If he doesn't eat as much as somebody else he gets the same deduction, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Maynard.     Deanne E. Maynard  Whichever is less.  I think that -- that is my understanding of how the local standards work, Your Honor.  I think, then, as a practical matter, that really will end up only applying to car leases with respect to transportation ownership costs, because I think that the notwithstanding sentence removes secured car loans from Romanette ii and has been calculated under Romanette iii, where there is no comparable cap.  But the point at issue in this case doesn't involve the interaction between Romanette ii and Romanette iii, because no matter how those two things interact, when the debtor has no payment whatsoever, he ought not to be able to claim any car ownership costs, because what we are frying to figure out is: What amount does he reasonably need for his maintenance and support?  And this question is a very important question.  This scenario happens a lot.  In the 2007 study that U.S. Trustees did at Congress's request to -- which Petitioner cites in his reply brief, the average overpayment of a debtor in claiming this transportation ownership expense was $335, which is a lot when you are talking about the standard in the tarp being 471.  There are many debtors who are getting this expense either above their amount or when they have no such expense at all, and so even if the Court doesn't resolve these other issues that are implicated by this case, the decision here is a simple one, which is: This debtor has no applicable monthly expense amount for transportation ownership costs, and he shouldn't be allowed to expense any amount for that.  If there are no further questions, the Respondent requests that the Court would affirm the judgment below.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Ms. Saharsky?     Nicole A. Saharsky  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The only question this Court needs to resolve in this case is whether the vehicle ownership expense is applicable to Petitioner.  The answer is no.  The ownership cost is for loan and lease payments, the cost to acquiring the vehicle, and he just doesn't have any payments of that type.  To allow him to pretend that he does would create absurd results.  He would be able to shield approximately $28,000 from his unsecured creditors, and he would be better off than lower income Chapter 13 debtors.  And we just don't think that that's a result that Congress intended.  We don't--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And if he pays--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --If he paid a dollar, he would be able to shield $27,999, and you are comfortable with that result.   Nicole A. Saharsky  --Well, that goes to the question of whether the amount in the table is the amount to be used or a cap on actual expenses.  In our view, it is--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And I understood your brief to say it was the amount -- you get the whole amount, not simply as a cap.   Nicole A. Saharsky  --That's right.  Now, of course, we haven't seen -- the executive office for U.S. Trustees has not seen any $1 payments.  It doesn't know of any such commercially available payments.  It suspects the payments would be--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If the point of the $1, Counsel, is to lead to the extreme hypothetical that would flesh out your position, what if it were $10,000 and the amount would give him $30,000?  The trustees have probably seen loans like that.   Nicole A. Saharsky  --What I'm saying, Your Honor, is that there are many circumstances in which an expense amount is a standard amount, but you still need to make a threshold showing that it's applicable to you.  And if I could give the Court one example: When an individual does his Federal income tax forms, you can take a deduction for your dependents, but you can't just take a deduction for any child you have.  You have to take a deduction -- you can take a deduction if the person lives at home with you for more than one year and have you a certain amount of expenses to support them, and that is a standard deduction that you get on your tax forms.  The IRS doesn't ask everyone to figure out their actual costs.  It is the case in real life that there are allowance amounts that are average amounts that are given to people once they meet the criteria.  And that's what we are saying happens here.  Now, that is, again, only a disagreement as to what you do with people who actually have vehicle ownership expenses.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. Saharsky, I should probably know this, but if you do have amounts that are excluded from the disposable income because of car ownership, in other words, you actually have, in your point of view, expenses, do they have to go to the pay off the car loan or are they available for everybody?  All the creditors?   Nicole A. Saharsky  They are not available for the creditors.  The idea behind this calculation is that there, of course, are secured debts that have priority and then this calculation is used to figure out how much money is left to pay unsecured creditors, and the idea is that the debtor has certain expenses, that he needs to keep money for himself so he can continue with the every day business of life.  For example, the car ownership payment is designed to ensure that a vehicle can still use and have access to a car, and if someone has a loan or lease payment they need to be able to continue making that payment in bankruptcy, but if they don't have any such payment then they don't have this additional need for additional funds.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If there is more food expense than is allowed, can he decide of the amount that would otherwise go for the car payment that he is going to pay some of that for the food expenses?   Nicole A. Saharsky  Well, certainly the Bankruptcy Court doesn't scrutinize, you know, what happens to that regard.  What it's just trying to do is figure out the disposable income that is available to pay unsecured creditors that the debtor doesn't need.  And I should just note with respect to this question of whether there is an overall budget that the debtor is allowed, you know, that is certainly not the case in any of the other provisions that follow this applicable monthly standards and local standards.  You have the actual other necessary expenses, actual continuation of taking care of chronically ill family members, and Petitioner himself acknowledges that he has to show that he has a car.  So it's not the case that every debtor is just getting some set amount of money to do what they will with.  Congress has referenced the standards, the standards break this out into certain expenses, it says just take the applicable ones and we just don't think it makes sense to interpret applicable in that circumstance.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if they have prepurchased their food expenses, so long as they have one dollar of food expense they get the entire expense even though they are not incurring it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And there are things like, you can pay up, you know, have the grocery deliver your food every month and you can pay in advance, and if you paid up you still get the full food expense that is allowed?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if you paid 1 dollar for food you would get the full amount for 60 months?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your argument leads to a result that is just as absurd as your colleague's result on the other side.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, that was a big part of your argument.  You said his position leads to an absurd result, and yours is just as absurd.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your -- your position penalizes debtors who pay their expenses in advance, who don't incur additional debt to pay for things like their car.  I would have thought the Bankruptcy Code would think that's a good thing, that they are not incurring debt that they can't afford to pay off, but instead, to the extent they can, they are paying expenses in advance.  Why should somebody who does that be in a worse position than somebody -- somebody who takes out a loan they can't afford to pay back?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, he hasn't incurred -- he hasn't incurred expenses.  It's the whole point, I guess, that he's paid for something.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even though he can do it -- even though he can do it for everything else: he can do it for food, he can do it for housekeeping expenses, he can do it for personal care expenses, he can even do it -- the other, the final category is miscellaneous, so he can do it for anything.

The district judge didn't happen to go down that particular path.  But clearly from our perspective, the important element is to maintain the status quo ante until a resolution of the legality of California statute can be made, either by the agency or the courts.  But the one thing you shouldn't be allowed to do is simply to -- to permit this to drift without any remedy and without any ability to get access to medical care that's clearly consistent with what Congress intended, and where a remedy is available under the Ex parte Young formulation.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why isn't -- Why doesn't your position constitute a complete end run around all of our implied right of action jurisprudence?  We have wasted a lot of time trying to figure out whether there's an implied right of action under a particular statute if there has always been one under the Supremacy Clause.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How can they have much broader -- broader -- First of all, all of those cases -- I don't know if all of them did, but certainly a lot of them did -- included claims for injunctive relief.  And I would have thought the court's authority under your equitable action under the Constitution would be at least as broad as it would be under the Statute.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But your position--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Your position is that the Constitution prohibits you from doing anything where the State law is preempted by the Federal law.  That doesn't sound very narrow to me.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if -- what if the law that Congress passes sets forth certain Federal standards, it's a cooperative Federal-State law like this one, and it says: And there is no private right of action for any individual to enforce this.  That's limited to the Federal Government.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So Congress can say--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Congress can say in the same statute that confers the allegedly preemptive Federal standards that we do not want individuals bringing actions in Court to enforce this.  We want to leave that up to HHS.  And you are saying, even though Congress said that, individuals can nonetheless bring a suit under the Supremacy Clause, the theory of which is we are making sure that Federal law controls.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The same Federal law that says you can't bring a claim of action.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is there no suit -- why is there no suit if the agency doesn't approve,--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --You're saying Congress can't say there's no implied right of action--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --But the agency can?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you have the same answer or--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --But you still have a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought you were saying you didn't, if the--   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  --Congress says it its statute no implied right of action, that that doesn't control.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The answer is yes, they intended to deprive them of the right to sue under the statute.  I understand that you're not challenging the proposition that this statute, when Congress was specifically focused on the question of how to enforce this provision, they did not provide a right of action.  And under our implied right of action jurisprudence, that means there isn't one.

Roberts, Jr.  And for it to be real -- just so I understand -- for it to be real, you have to have a defense counsel, a client comes to him with a non-frivolous Federal habeas claim, and the defense counsel says, I can't tell whether we are going to be barred by this time rule or not.  Some courts, looks like we will; some don't.  So what?  Of course he is going to file the Federal habeas and see if it's determined to be adequate or inadequate, correct?   ",09-996X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But everybody in this room can tell him that he is obligated to file the petition as promptly as the circumstances allow.  He has complete notice of that.  And if he wants to go and do the research and say, well, here's one where they let it in after five months, but here's one where they didn't leave it in after nine months, so he sits here and decides I'm going to wait nine months and put my money on that court.  That is not a scenario that's likely to happen, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You are not challenging that as the State rule, are you?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And they didn't look at possible justifications at all, correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  I'm not asking about Mr. Martin's.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  This -- the analysis that the amicus undertook simply looked at the chronological time.  They did not consider the fact that, for example, somebody with three years might have had an explanation; somebody with one year might have not had any.  And they may view those cases as different cases.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How did they look -- did they look for explanations for delay when you had the one-sentence denial?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How much range are you willing to give the State?  Do they have three months' range?  I mean, if you come in and say, Well, here they were filed in nine months and they were allowed, and here they were filed in six months and they were not allowed.  Is that a problem under our consistency requirement?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It says  ""as promptly as the circumstances allow. ""  And they go back and say there is a range, a three-month range.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You do the same sort of research you have done here, and you find out that -- that there is a three-month range.  Sometimes -- I mean, there are cases and you can show a lot where they are allowed at nine months and then you find cases that are not allowed under six months.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, I understand that you would have a much stronger case if you were dealing with a judge-made rule about timeliness.  If the courts, on their own authority, said, Look, we are not going to look at things that are filed four years late because that prejudices the state, it prejudices us, et cetera.  But here you have something different.  You have a rule, right?  An established rule: Promptly as circumstances allow.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Judge-made, but it's been around for a long time.  This isn't a new rule that is just coming in.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let me get back.  I tried to -- when you made that point earlier, I wanted to follow up on it.  Your claim is not that you don't know or defendants in California don't know that the rule is  ""as promptly as the circumstances allow. ""  do you?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  I thought you had fair notice of that rule.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   ",09-996X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  I don't understand how that works.  The claim is, say for example, you were ineffective because you didn't raise a Batson claim.  Surely he gets to review the Batson claim once he establishes the effectiveness--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --So the lawyer -- the State would be required to provide counsel not simply to raise the threshold ineffectiveness argument, but to go ahead and raise the arguments as to which he was ineffective.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you would be happy with a system that said, no, you don't have to raise it in collateral review, you have to raise it on direct appeal, which is very unworkable, because if you are arguing ineffective assistance of counsel in a direct proceeding, presumably it's usually the same counsel; he's not likely to bring the claim.  That would be worse for criminal defendants than the system--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --that's there now.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the person who decides what arguments you are going to make on appeal is usually the person who handled the trial in these types of cases.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In Arizona, the usual case in criminal cases is that somebody else handles the appeal on direct proceedings?   ",10-1001

Roberts, Jr.  Is it routine, or does it happen often that lawyers who perceive a trial issue that can only be raised on collateral review to think that it makes sense to raise that right away so that the appeal -- and then the appeal is delayed until that's resolved?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  No, you've got to listen to the government.  Mr. Wall.     John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But your test -- and this is, I think goes broader than the articulation of the test -- doesn't give this private attorney much assurance by itself.  It's sort of a multifactor, is he is coordinating, is he under the supervision, is he really doing public service?  I mean, if the idea is to give him sufficient breathing room so he doesn't stop, and when, as in this case, he is threatened that we are going to sue you if you do this, he has to think, well now, am I being supervised by the government?  Am I coordinating with the government?  Or I -- am I telling them what -- it -- the -- the test itself undermines the asserted purpose.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Lawyers -- lawyers are not supposed to be cowed by the exigencies of the situation.  We're worried in qualified immunity with protecting governmental actors, to make sure they will feel comfortable doing the right thing rather than being intimidated in the situation we had here.  Lawyers have that professional obligation in the first place.  So why does a lawyer need the -- the defense of qualified immunity?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Millett.  We'll hear from Ms. Saharsky first.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if they don't work closely together at all and it's just this one fellow conducting the investigation, he wouldn't have qualified immunity?   INTERRUPTING John G.

I mean, the town, whatever, contracts, out-sources, whatever, but it's just run by volunteers.  Is your answer the same?  I'm trying to get at your point about they're working with or coordinating with government employees.  And your argument seems a little derivative.  You are saying the whole point is to protect the government employees and you have to have qualified immunity for the non-employee to do that.  But does your argument apply when there are no government employees around?   ",10-1018
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's all right.  Ms. Saharsky.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your case--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Finish your answer.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your case highlights, I think is a very good example of why the lawyer ought to have qualified immunity.  I mean this is a case where it looks like there's a lot of threatening and bullying going on.  I mean the lawyer says, you know, we are going to figure out a way to name you, Mr. Filarsky.  You're issuing an illegal order.  If you want to take that chance go right ahead.  You might want to take a minute to think about it.  I mean, it seems exactly the kind of situation for which qualified immunity was developed.  We want Filarsky to give what he -- do what he thinks is the right thing in this situation.  We don't want him to be worried about the fact that he might be sued.  And you have a lawyer here saying, well, if you do that I'm going to sue you.  So Filarsky naturally, or some lawyer in that situation is going to think, wow, do I really want to run that risk.  Isn't that exactly why we have qualified immunity?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's easy for a judge to say, because they are absolutely immune--  [Laughter]  --but for the lawyer who is sitting there and saying -- saying, I'm going to sue you, if you were -- well, you are a lawyer, and you are sitting in that situation, isn't that going to enter into your mind?  You say, well sue all you want; I don't care; this is the right answer?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, how do you know?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well he had -- he had the chief issue the order, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And then the chief later on says, well, he told me to issue the order.  I mean, I'm not quite sure that things went exactly as they would if you had qualified immunity.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, particularly -- well, even if -- the reason it's an issue is because he says, look, I have got this stuff at my house.  That's how his -- his defense is.  I haven't used it; I have got the insulation there.  So you think it's still clearly established that it violates the Fourth Amendment for the city to say, okay, well, show it to us if you want to use that as your defense?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if Filarsky was there, you know, hired to help the fire department with these -- and he did absolutely nothing?  He just sits there and watches.  The battalion chief says, I want to do this, I am going to go get the stuff; you bring it all out.  And he just -- he just sits there, doesn't see any reason to offer any legal advice or legal opinion.  Could you sue him under 1983?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Really?  He has an obligation as a lawyer to speak up if he thinks something illegal is going on, that's his job, and he doesn't -- he just sits there quietly?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  This for profits, I -- the significance of that eludes me.  Sometimes people act out of, you know, public purpose, and particularly in these sorts of situations the town needs a lawyer and he -- he's helping out.  What -- if he were purely a volunteer, it would be a different answer?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And, well -- and what if he gives the city a discount?  He is working for half -- half his fee, because it's the city.  He wants to help out, but he can't do it totally for free, so it's 50 percent his normal rate?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are all of these -- are all of these objections applicable as well to the determination of whether there was State action from the attorneys' conduct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But your -- your objection is not that he was investigating workplace misconduct, your objection was that he was ordering people to tell your client to bring out stuff that was in his house.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but telling people basically either execute a search or in effect executing a search, that is a uniquely governmental function.   INTERRUPTING ",10-1018
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Cardozo.     Raymond A. Cardozo  And the thing I would add to that is general damages -- actual damages was in the statute long before general damages surfaced.  It appeared at the 11th hour, and Congress just said let's send that off to the commission.  That's important to keep in mind, because it creates a huge question about what Congress meant to peel off.  There is no explanation of general damages.  It isn't defined.  And it arose at the 11th hour.  But the important thing is the term it kept in the statute was not ""special damages"".  The term of art that has a pecuniary limitation.  It kept the broader term ""actual damages"", and the term it kept aligns with its statement of purpose, the breadth of the waiver of sovereign immunity and a nonpecuniary expression -- a desire to protect nonpecuniary interests that's throughout the act.  Let me wrap up with a couple of observations here.  Congress passed this act to restore the citizens' faith in their government, and it made a solemn promise to the American citizens that in cases of intentional and willful violation, the United States shall be liable for actual damages.  Today, the government is proposing that ""actual damages"" be read in a way that renders this act virtually irrelevant.  That makes a mockery of that solemn promise.  To preserve the vitality of this act, this Court need only give actual damages its most common and ordinary meaning: ""proven, not presumed"".   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Feigin, you have five minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",10-1024
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  The argument you have made, and I certainly understand it, that this is the Privacy Act, and so it's precisely these types of damages that you would be concerned about, really cuts both ways.  I mean, what you are saying is this is a really big chunk of damages, because this is what the whole act was about; and it seems to me that that argument suggests that there is some weight to the government's point that well, if you are going to get into that, you really do need a clearer waiver of sovereign immunity.   ",10-1024
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your -- your argument that 100 percent is certainly true as a matter of logic.  But in the phrase 100 percent.  In other words, you are apportioning or--  you are splitting the fee with somebody else.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You could have -- ""portion"" I suppose could still mean a full portion, ""split"" probably not.  But I mean, the more natural reading is surely a division.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the -- the -- the reason -- one objection to your idea that, well, this covers partial so it must cover 100 percent, is that it's a very different issue if you are talking about partial and 100 percent.  If you are talking about partial, you have a classic case of a -- a kickback.  But if you suddenly say 100 percent of an unearned fee, that's a much more difficult question to decide.  In this case, for example, you get a whole bunch of things from Quicken Loans, including the loan and all this other stuff, and it's kind of hard to single out, well, this part is unearned but this part is earned; it's kind of a whole package.  When you have a portion or split it's an entirely different issue.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but there -- there's a more -- it's a narrower issue when you are talking about a portion.  Say the kickback goes to the appraiser.  Maybe you can decide in that case whether the loan company really had anything to do with the appraisal at all.  When the alleged unearned fee goes to the whole loan company, it's a little harder to say which part was unearned and which parts might have been earned.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's just the way these loans work, right?  I mean, it's the same thing whether you pay 10 percent and no points or 9 percent and 3 points.  You know, which one of those is earned or unearned, it's kind of hard to sort it out.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you,--  Mr. Russell.  Ms. O'Connell.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  What does that mean?  In other words, the rate that was offered, they said you pay 2 points and you get a rate of 8 percent.

Roberts, Jr.  What -- You were you about to tell us what we said in Long Island Home.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which -- putting aside the notice-and-comment point, which I think is at least ambiguous, which -- which of our cases stands for the proposition that whether or not we give Chevron deference depends on the thoroughness with which the agency addressed an issue, rather than simply an announcement of its interpretation?

If you don't comply, you know, we can bring an action any time to enforce this and you'll be subject to the statutory maximum, but during the period, the additional sanction for the -- under the administrative order, or the compliance order, is $10 a day?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it might go to adequacy of judicial review, the adequacy of the judicial review that would come when the APA brings the enforcement action.  I understood your argument to be that there was a significant extortion impact from the fact that these were such significant fines -- doubled, as you say -- that you could rack up for 5 years.  But if it's only $10 a day, that takes a lot of the wind out of your sails, doesn't it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could you -- I don't understand what exactly you might get from the Army Corps of Engineers.  Obviously, they might give you a permit, and I take it that cuts off liability; you can do what you're hoping to do.  They might say you don't get a permit because these are wetlands.  Can they do something in the middle, which is: It's kind of hard for us to tell; you're on your own?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Would collateral estoppel apply to you because of the judicial determination on the compliance order in the subsequent enforcement action?  In other words, you lose.  You seek APA review and the court says: We think it's a wetland.  And then the EPA brings an enforcement action.  They have to establish it's a wetland.  Don't they just attach a copy of the decision?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess I am back to Justice Scalia's question.

Stewart  --I -- I guess the only point I would make is, if Petitioners had wanted a judicial resolution of the coverage question without subjecting themselves to potential penalties, they could have filed a permit application before discharging, they could have gotten review there.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What would you -- what would you do, Mr. Stewart, if you received this compliance order?  You don't think your property has wetlands on it and you get this compliance order from the EPA.  What would you do?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If they weren't in the record, I don't want to hear about them.  You appreciate that rule, that we don't consider things that aren't in the record.  You get a compliance order, you don't think your property has wetlands, what do you do?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You wouldn't do that, right?  You know you will never get an after-the-fact permit if the EPA has sent you a compliance order saying you've got wetlands.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's what you would do?  You would say, I don't think there are wetlands on my property but EPA does, so I'm going to take out all the fill, I'm going to plant herbaceous trees or whatever it is, and I will worry about whether to -- that way, I'll just do what the government tells me I should do.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, what the landowner is supposed to do -- the agency says, because you didn't apply for a permit, you are in trouble, because you didn't give us a chance to say whether we were going to take away your constitutional rights or not, so we can do it.

Kruger  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  In civil contempt proceedings to enforce orders for child support, due process requires a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the simple and straightforward but critical question that characterizes remedial sanctions in this area: Whether the nonpaying parent has the ability to pay.  The--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, just to be clear, your answer to the question presented is no, right?  It was not error for the South Carolina court to say there's no constitutional right in this type of a proceeding to appointed counsel?   Leondra R. Kruger  That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.  We think that there is no categorical right to appointed counsel in all civil contempt proceedings or--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Kruger.  Mr. Bibas.     Stephanos Bibas  --Your Honor, I don't believe they're rubber stamped.  The statistics that I have seen show denial rates of 10 to 20 percent, in some counties as high as 35 percent.  So there is a meaningful inquiry and meaningful denials, and all of those cases would violate due process on Petitioner's logic.  That cannot be the tidal wave to hit the criminal justice system.  That is not an appropriate extension of due process because the issues here and there are simpler, far simpler than in Lassiter, a formal trial-type adversarial procedure where nevertheless no categorical right to counsel was required.  It's important to go back, if one looks at the roots of the right to counsel in Powell and Gideon and Zerpst, Powell talked about the need for the guiding hand of counsel who are skilled in the science of law in order to deal with technical defects in the charging instrument, to deal with incompetent irrelevant or inadmissible evidence.  In proceedings such as this, where there are no formal rules of pleading or evidence, there is not a need -- certainly not a need for a categorical right to counsel.  If there are no further questions, may I conclude?  Litigants can themselves argue the commonsense issue of ability to pay, just as they can address their ability to afford counsel without first having counsel, and the cost of appointing counsel across the board would deter States from enforcing custodial parents' and their children's rights, as it has in New Jersey.

Maybe it's just an entry.  And then you've got to go through entry by entry and say well, now, was that for the 1983 action or was that for the State court action?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that seems -- just -- sorry, I don't mean to drone on, but that seems to me to be an especially odd burden to impose when you're dealing with an area where there is a heavy dose of discretion to the district court in the first place.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, maybe in your case, but there's no reason to suppose there won't be cases where the things are flipped, and the Federal claim, perhaps frivolous for a legal reason rather than a factual one, is the dominant driving force in the litigation and you've tagged on a few other State claims.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's a pretty audacious claim, that you filed such a frivolous cause of action that they shouldn't have wasted so much time responding to it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's a lot of chutzpah.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you shouldn't have filed it.  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I clarify what you mean by ""completely intertwined""?  You mean there is no incremental work just on the Federal action?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you -- you're looking for fees -- your first argument -- even though they can identify fees that were incurred solely on defending the frivolous cause of action?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  All right.  That's an easier case.  What if it's 20 percent spent on the Federal action?  Do you still completely intertwine?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if it's not completely frivolous, but frivolous enough to satisfy a demand for fees?  What if it does take them, you know, 40 hours to prepare the motion to dismiss it as frivolous?  Do they get those 40 hours?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you've got to find the 17 cases.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You've got to look carefully at the facts.  They assume good faith on the part of their adversary that would not file a frivolous claim.  The idea that it's going to be able to -- they're going to look at it and say, this is frivolous, file a motion in Federal court, I think that's a -- doesn't reflect an adequate -- doesn't reflect a realistic understanding of Federal litigation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, that's not how it works.  You say they know they're going to be seeking claims.  They don't know in advance, this is going to be a frivolous claim, the discovery is going to be completely overlapping or it's not going to be overlapping.  And most lawyers do not keep detailed accurate billing records.  That's just an underlying reality.  So I do think it's a significant burden on the district court to say, go back and read these -- read these billing sheets, figure out which is which, presumably have litigation over it.  Someone is going to file a motion for these fees; the other person is going to say, no, no, it shouldn't be 20,000, it should be 15,000.  And our precedent in this area gives a huge amount of discretion to the district courts, just reasonableness.  And it seems to me you're buying into a lot of litigation to decide whether it's 20,000 or 15,000.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand you go back to the first point.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Rosenkranz, I'm looking at the billing sheet, August 14, 2007, 32 hours, miscellaneous cost, online research.  Is that for Federal or State?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Stancil.     Mark T. Stancil  Correct, Your Honor; I think -- I think that's correct.  And I think that's precisely the point of Hensley; and again as this case comes before this Court, whether the district court abused its discretion in calculating its fee award, I frankly -- we submit that this -- the judgment should affirmed under any of these tests.  If the Court has no more questions.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Rosenkranz, you have 4 minutes remaining.     ",10-114X

Roberts, Jr.  If the liability under the State law claims is $100,000 and the liability under the Federal claims is the same, and you win on the Federal claim and you lose on the State law claim, if I were the client, I would say your degree of success was zero.  I still have to pay $100,000.  The fact that you won on one claim but then lost the whole issue -- the whole value on another, I wouldn't call that a degree of success.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And I assume you agree that discretion can end up going either way?  You could submit time sheets that show 35 percent of our time was spent on the Federal case, and the district judge can say, you know, time sheets are subject to -- manipulation is too strong a word, but I'm just not going to give you 35 percent; I'm going to give you 10 percent.  That's a reasonable exercise of discretion.  The judge doesn't have to say a whole lot about it and it's certainly going to be upheld on -- on appeal, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you disagree with the statement in the -- in the Court of Appeals opinion about, only for fees that can be distinctly traced?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understood your adversary to agree with that position.  You'll need to switch sides, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But your argument has focused, in reference to the complaint and all that, on the legal theories.  Your friend has focused on the underlying factual basis, and all the litigation -- all the background work on the underlying factual basis, I don't know why that can be fairly attributed only to the 1983 claim.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  General Verrilli.     Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:  Each party in this case has got a valid point.  Mayo is correct that you can't get a patent by tacking a mental step onto an utterly conventional process for administering drugs and testing their effects.  But that is an issue under sections 102 and 103 of the Patent Act.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That -- in your test for that -- I see on page 9 of your brief you say:  ""A classic patent-eligible process recites a series of acts performed in the physical world that transforms the subject of the process to achieve a useful result. ""  So I have a great idea.  You take wood, you put it on a grate, you light it, and you get heat.  That is -- recites a series of acts performed in the physical world that transforms the subject of the process, the wood, to achieve a useful result, which is heat.  So I can get a patent for that?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  No.  It's not novel, and it's obvious.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, no, no.  Well, let me put it--   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  You can't get a patent for it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --That's patent-eligible?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  But that's our -- that's our point, Mr. Chief Justice, that the right way to look at this issue is under 102 and under 103, and I think--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I was just going to say, what is the great advantage you see of putting this critical question off until the 102, 103 analysis, rather than cutting it off at the beginning, 101, which I understand your friend to say is very important because you don't want people to have to pause terribly long to see if this is something they can do?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  As a practical matter, at the PTO, Mr. Chief Justice, it doesn't make any difference, because the PTO examiner gets a patent application and answers every question, 101, 102, 103, 112, and makes a decision about all of them.  So it's not going to lead to any benefit at the PTO.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about litigation?  It is easier to throw something out at the threshold level, isn't it, than to move further down the line?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Not if one moves the novelty and obviousness inquiries from 102 and 103 into 101.  You've just taken the complexity of 102 and 103 and moved it into 101.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Scalia?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Finish your sentence.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --If one says that it's nonpatentable because all you are doing is patenting the application of a law of nature, you're invalidating all those process patents.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.  Mr. Bress.     Richard P. Bress  --Right.  Your Honor, before Prometheus -- actually, the inventors in this case in Montreal came up with this method -- doctors had no way to tailor for each individual based on their metabolism the right dosage of these powerful but potentially toxic drugs.

And I'm just wondering why it's beneficial to essentially eliminate 101 and say oh, we'll catch everything later on.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, just as -- I'm sorry to interrupt.  Your friend's point is that if you don't do this -- if you don't give 101 some more content, then the doctor is going to have to start worrying right from the get-go, and they say well, is there an exception that I might be able to rely on, as opposed to being able to say right away this -- I don't have to worry about this patent; I can treat the patient in this way.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You are concerned under Landgraf, I think, with whether or not it disrupts settled expectations, and it just doesn't seem to me that this issue enters into the expectations at all when the pertinent act, which is the commission of the crime, not the pleading guilty, takes place.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I would have thought your answer to my colleague would be: No; what they want to regulate is the staying in the country, and they're trying to make that as uncomfortable as possible in order to encourage the individual to leave.  If he can't go to the, you know, the parent's party, the cousin's wedding or whatever, he is just going to leave, and then once he does, he can't come back.  Why would -- why would the government care -- it's a question for them, I'm sure.  Why would they care whether somebody that they don't want to be here stays here?  It seems to me the exact opposite.  So I would have thought your argument -- your answer would be, no, what they are trying to regulate is not the coming and going, but simply the staying.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does it matter in the examples that you just gave that admission to the United States is purely a matter of legislative grace, while we might conclude that teaching, being a member of the bar, whatever, is not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry?  Which privilege was that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose that might have been regarded as such then, but not under current law.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  When they decide to plead guilty.  The operative issue here is when they commit the crime.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So this -- so this--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Miller.     Eric D. Miller  --Well, I -- I think -- we don't question that that's something that people might have -- have been aware of, and have been thinking about, but it not something that was bargained for in the plea agreement, because it's not something that is affected by the plea agreement.  The statute here is triggered by the post-enactment conduct of entering the country, but also by the -- the pre-enactment conduct of committing the crime.  And as Petitioner has acknowledged, there isn't any reliance in the state of immigration law when you choose to commit the crime.  So I think that's -- that's a difference from the scenario that was addressed in Judulang.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Miller.  Mr. Bibas, you have 6 minutes remaining.     ",10-1211

I just don't understand how that -- how that works.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I know, and I understand that there is a limitation on actually deporting the person.  But here I think the one thing you want the person to do is leave.  Maybe for a particular event, but maybe he will decide to stay in Greece if once he's there for the -- but it seems very odd to say: We are going to show you how much we don't want you here; we are not going to let you leave.

I've always had difficulty with St. Cyr on the notion that say, someone pleads -- is facing, you know, 10 years, and they plead -- plead guilty to 2 years.  The -- the reason they did that was to, you know, avoid one of these -- positions.  It seems to me it is to avoid 8 years.   INTERRUPTING John G.

The PTO says: Look, we are not -- we are not going to issue a patent because you didn't show us that the valve in the back of the thing or whatever, was -- was novel, and we think that's important.  And the applicant goes to, under 14.5, to the district court and said: Well I didn't submit that evidence because I didn't have any idea that that was going to be a significant issue, and I am, you know, sorry, but I have a good basis for not thinking of that and here it is.  Is that the type of new evidence that could be admitted?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So this is an exception?  I thought you were telling us earlier you generally can't get--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Panner.     Aaron M. Panner  Well, Your Honor, it wouldn't be on the same record.  If it were on the same record, then presumably the -- the issue that would be presented would be quite similar.  The only time I can see that -- so in other words, if there were a different record, it's true that the Federal Circuit's review of the district decision would be -- it would be the difference that this Court recognized in Zurko.  It would be the court -- court standard of review, which is -- gives perhaps slightly less weight to the decision of the district court than the court agency review.  But that doesn't seem like an advantage.  In the -- in a circumstance at least where an applicant has prevailed, the applicant would be more likely to see the victory taken away by the Federal Circuit.  Unless the Court has questions?

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  The problem I have with your submission: you say there are basically two routes to get review of the denial by the Patent Office.  The first is under 141, you appeal to the Federal Circuit, right, and in that situation, you're limited to the record before the agency--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --on which you lost.  And there is deference to the agency, which ruled against you.  Under 145, you can add new evidence, you could address questions that the PTO raised, saying you don't -- you haven't dealt with this valve in the back and you could say, well, here's new evidence dealing with that.  There is no deference to the agency.  And to some extent you can pick which judge you want to hear, to the extent you can -- can do that.  Why would anybody proceed under section 141 instead of 145?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that in -- in every case where it's anything other than a purely legal issue, you would go under 145?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, I know.  That's why I am -- I'm really confused, because I take it that people don't often use 145, right?  They almost always appeal to the Federal Circuit.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, Ms. -- Ms. Anders told us that there's a procedure before the PTO that lets you deal with these -- these sort of something came up that you didn't think about, and you can address that.

You're following the car and the beeper just helps you follow it from a -- from a slightly greater distance.  That was 30 years ago.  The technology is very different and you get a lot more information from the GPS surveillance than you do from following a beeper.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's a good example of the change in technology.  That's a lot of work to follow the car.  They've got to listen to the beeper; when they lose it they have got to call in the helicopter.  Here they just sit back in the station and they -- they push a button whenever they want to find out where the car is.  They look at data from a month and find out everywhere it's been in the past month.  That -- that seems to me dramatically different.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You think there would also not be a search if you put a GPS device on all of our cars, monitored our movements for a month?  You think you're entitled to do that under your theory?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G.

Your argument is you can do it, period.  You don't have to give any reason.  It doesn't have to be limited in any way, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, isn't the normal way in these situations that we draw these limits how intrusive the search can be, how long it can be, is by having a magistrate spell it out in a warrant?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you're talking about the difference between seeing the little tile and seeing a mosaic.  The one gives you information, the other doesn't.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you get an anonymous tip that there is the same bomb in somebody's house, do you get a warrant or do -- do you just go in?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Then why are you asking for a different rule in this situation?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if we -- I give you that, that it's in public.  Does the reasonable expectation of privacy trump that fact?  In other words, if we ask people, do you think it's -- it violates your right to privacy to have this kind of information acquired, and everybody says yes, is it a response that, no, that takes place in public, or it simply the reasonable expectation of privacy regardless of the fact that it takes place in public?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You can see, though, can't you, that 30 years ago if you asked people does it violate your privacy to be followed by a beeper, the police following you, you might get one answer, while today if you ask people does it violate your right to privacy to know that the police can have a record of every movement you made in the past month, they might see that differently?

Roberts, Jr.  --If my understanding is correct that it's the State's license plate that they require you to have, so your trespass theory it would seem falls apart with respect to that particular scenario.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  It's the size of a credit card.  You slip it behind the license plate.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought it made a difference under your theory, which focused on the question of trespass, because it was attached to an effect owned by somebody else.  This is an effect not owned by the individual.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the trespass theory anyway doesn't seem ridiculous to me.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do you know that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that gets back to Justice Scalia's question, which is you've got to determine that there has been a search first before you impose the warrant requirement.  And it seems to me that your -- the warrant requirement applies only with respect to searches, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  And seizures.  So while it might seem like a good idea to impose the requirement on this particular technological device, you still have to establish that it's a search.   John G.

How do we tell?  I mean, I don't know what society expects.  I suppose if you ask people do you think it's a violation of privacy for the police to do this for no reason for a month, maybe they would come out one way.

Waxman  --Justice Alito, I mean, we are of course all arguing in a vacuum here, because we don't know what the fingerprint evidence if it were tested and run against databases would show.  But let me give you one not at all far-fetched example: the State had -- the county coroner had determined that because of the extraordinary similarity between the murder of a woman in the neighborhood -- very close by the night before and this one, including the very peculiar puncture injuries, the coroner's report in the State's file said this is very likely the same perpetrator.  The State has identified the perpetrator of that other crime.  And we don't know whether even at this day the State has matched that perpetrator's fingerprints with the fingerprints that were discovered next to the victim in this case.  And it wouldn't be far-fetched to say that in a case involving either Brady -- may I finish, it will just be this sentence -- Brady or ineffective assistance of counsel, if the fingerprint evidence did link up in that way, it certainly would go into the habeas judge's evaluation of the merits of those claims.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.  Mr. Phillips.     Seth P. Waxman  Okay.  The first one is to revert back to the prior enforcement regime that existed before 2004, which deferred to reasonable judgments, was restricted to material that is not momentary exposure but is dwelled upon.  And that as Pacifica explained, was egregious material akin to depictions of erotic activity.  The second thing they could do is make this three-factor test -- or however many factors it is -- a test, not just a nonexclusive list of an infinite number of factors that could or couldn't be balanced in any way the commission wants to.  Even if it wants to leave it as factors -- and this is number 3 -- it could at least identify what they are, and apply them consistency -- consistently through adjudication that explains why one over-balances the other, which it certainly did not do in this case.  And it also could clean up the actual form of the words that it uses, referring, for example, to sexually explicit or excretory activities.  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's because broadcasts didn't commonly have this sort of -- these sorts of words or these sorts of images.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We know.  We can -- it was not the case from 1927 until whenever you -- what, 1970-something -- that nudity commonly appeared on broadcast television or the various words we're dealing with here commonly appeared.  So it seems a bit much to say well, they didn't bring any cases for that period.  There were no cases to be brought.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that cuts both ways.  People who want to watch broadcasts where these words or expose their children to broadcasts where these words are used, where there is nudity, there are 800 channels where they can go for that.  All we are asking for, what the government is asking for, is a few channels where you can say I'm not going to -- they are not going to hear the S word, the F word.  They are not going to see nudity.  So the proliferation of other media it seems to me cuts against you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's your argument there, is that it's not a legitimate objective to have a safe harbor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that depends what your audience--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --It depends on what audience you're -- you're trying to get, and the demographic.  If you are trying to get an audience that is older, maybe you will decide this is what is going to attract them.  They don't want sanitized language.  They want to hear the -- the -- all those other words.  If your target is a much younger audience, maybe that will happen.  But the idea that you're -- the problem is going to go away because you are going to be good as you can be, that seems an odd way to analyze First Amendment problems.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Phillips.  Mr. Waxman.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  People understand -- what you have demonstrated I think is that the context matters.  People understand that, including children.  When they hear a bad word when someone hits their thumb with a hammer, they understand that's different than having an adult stand in normal conversations and use the words.  And it seems to me that your position is saying that the government cannot regulate with an understanding of what takes place in the real world.  The government's effort is to try to understand the context.  That's why you get a different rule in ""Saving Private Ryan"" than you get with Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie.  And what your argument seems to be is they can't take context into account.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's what you've got--   John G.

I would think in a case like this perfectly reasonable for the jury to say: Let's take a preliminary vote; we'll go down; and if we all agree on something right away, that's what we'll do.  Does everybody agree on capital murder?  No, some don't.  Does everybody agree on murder?  No.  Does everybody agree on manslaughter?  Yes.  Okay, we all know that manslaughter, he's at least guilty.  Now let's go back and talk about the more serious offense, and some of us will try to persuade the holdouts.

Roberts, Jr.  When -- one of the arguments on the other side that I thought made some sense was the idea that you should focus on a particular point in time when you are figuring out what the amount of the award is going to be; that it doesn't make -- that it's at least odd to say, well, we're going to calculate how much you're entitled to at this point, but in terms of the applicable maximum we are going to wait however long it takes and calculate that as of this point.  Doesn't it make more sense to figure out the applicable numbers at the same point in time?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if we think -- if we think the statute -- in other words, your argument, your response is that the statute is unambiguous and it can't be read in a more sensical way.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Go ahead.  You have been waiting the longest.  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Palmore.     Peter D. Keisler  I think the function of ""newly"" in this statute is something different, Justice Scalia.  And that relates to the questions that Your Honor and Justice Breyer were asking about the relationship between the ""currently receiving"" clause and the final clause.  I think the 19(f), which provides for a COLA, a cost of living increase every year for that narrow subset of the most disabled of employees.  They and they alone get that annual bump-up.  And so that ""currently receiving"" clause is written for that category to make sure that their bump-up isn't capped by a static maximum rate.  The other part of the clause, ""newly awarded compensation"", is about everybody else.  Now, I think the use of the word ""newly"" there is just to distinguish it from the ""currently receiving"" clause, which is escalating year by year.  And those newly awarded compensation, meaning at one point, fixed in time -- only when you are ""newly"" awarded compensation are you then going to have your maximum rate fixed.  And then -- and both Petitioner and we agree -- whatever it's fixed at, whatever year, that stays the same for the duration of your collection of compensation.  If the Court has no further questions, I thank the Court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Gillelan, if I got that right, you have 2 minutes remaining.   ",10-1399

Roberts, Jr.  So if you're walking down the street, you're on a business enterprise, they haven't shoveled the snow, you slip and fall and you're hurt, you go home and say: Good news, I've been awarded damages?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you're doing that -- you're doing that without an award.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So how can you say what the employer pays should be considered an award if it's not an award?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But those aren't going to be the typical cases, I think.  You say there may be cases and I suppose there may be.  I assume what happens -- employers don't just write checks.  They say this is how we calculate what we owe you.  And it is based on the maximum of this year, not any future ones, and if the employee says no, no, no; I have a right to get the -- then the employer will say well, okay, I either agree with that or not, but you don't get a check.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I -- I understand the amounts at issue here.  What is the usual amount that is at stake in this sort of case?  We are talking about the concerns, I guess on both -- about gamesmanship, but how much difference are we talking about?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't know; maybe you don't have statistics, on an average.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The consequence -- I mean, there is a time value of money, too.  The consequence of the employee saying, I'm going to wait 5 years, because I think the maximum is going to be a lot higher is that he doesn't get anything in the meantime, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's reasonable for an employer to say, okay, if you want to wait, I'll wait.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you Mr. Palmore.  We will have Mr. Keisler speak for a bit.  Mr. Kiesler.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's not the way it is used in 914.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But how much of a practical problem is this?  I understand the amounts are here, but if it's five years, and apparently the employee was happy to wait five years to get an award.  Normally if you are an employee and you are disabled, and the employer says, well here's what we are going to give you, and it's based on the maximum of the latest we have.  You're not going to say: I'm going to wait; these wages are going to go up nationally, and I'm going to wait a year; maybe I'll wait for years because I think there's a trend on national average wages, and I'm going to cash in on that; I am going to be without money for the next four years and I am disabled but -- I mean, that doesn't sound to me to be a plausible situation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, no, I mean -- apparently -- I don't know what the employers do, but usually in a situation like this, the employers have good lawyers and they write at the end of the check, you know: This is in full satisfaction of any claims under the -- the whatever.

Roberts, Jr.  I thought it was a situation where you have got a -- a -- a document in -- in, say, French and the person translates it, or interprets it -- I don't want to prejudge the issue -- and -- and then in English and then the person reads the English thing in -- in court.  That's not interpretation at any point, is it?   ",10-1472
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  One -- one of the things that concerns me is the impact of -- of cost allowance on the normal litigation incentives.  An interpreter in court is one thing.  When you suddenly get a situation where the costs could be quite large, particularly in a -- in a disparate way, not necessarily shared by both sides; somebody goes into court; they know they are going to have to -- if they lose, they will have to pay the interpreter this; and the other side comes in and says well, we think we need to submit this 10,000 pages of -- of documents, which will have to be translated and by the way, if you lose you are going to pay for that.  In other words, it is a much more variable element of costs than the interpreter.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what -- so what goes into the exercise of that discretion?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, there are two -- there may be two permissible, but you don't dispute the fact that it is more natural and common to speak of someone interpreting oral communication and someone translating written, correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let me rephrase your answer a different way.  You are not -- you don't know of any situation in the U.S. Code where translators -- or the interpreter means translator?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you checked every one, so there is none, right?  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's an odd result because nobody's going to do it.

As far as I can tell, this is something that the statute just doesn't deal with, and I don't know that you characterize that correctly as ambiguous.  It's just kind of off the table.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it doesn't have to grapple with everything that's not there.  I mean, there are a lot of things that the statutes don't address.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It seems to me that they don't have to grapple with everything that's there.  You just have to say this doesn't address it.  So whoever is asking for the affirmative, which is you, loses.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're saying: We think this law should allow -- should provide for this, should extend for this.  And it's one thing to say, well, the statute's ambiguous; it talks about children in one category but not another category, so the issue's there, we don't know what they meant.  It is another thing if it's something that's totally not on the table.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you don't usually -- your phrase is exactly what bothers me.  We don't usually base a decision on our general intuition, and the idea of prudential standing that we have jurisdiction of the case but we're not going to decide it is contrary to Chief Justice Marshall's famous line that if we don't have jurisdiction, we can't decide it, but if we do, we have to decide it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'll give that you on the zone of interests, but there you're dealing with administrative law and a very narrow proposition.  I think it's Justice Kennedy's point, or at least the point of his questions, that these issues meld into the merits and, at least for anyone who is troubled by the idea that we are not going to decide a case even though we have jurisdiction to decide it, maybe that's the better place to address it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is it -- I don't want to make -- try to make a case for you, but why is it that much more difficult?  It's just -- I mean, it's sort of like the negative commerce clause, right?  The fact that EPA has the authority to regulate in a particular area means that the ball has passed from the courts to the agency, to the executive branch, and they've made an implicit decision not to regulate a particular question.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess that would be a preemption question rather than -- rather than a displacement question.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.  General Underwood.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what is the -- what factors go into the cost-benefit analysis that would have to be undertaken to decide what level of emissions are reasonable in light of the threat of global -- global warming?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Obviously the greatest benefit to reduce global warming would be, of course, to shut down the power plants, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because -- right.  But I mean, across the economy, the whole problem of dealing with global warming is that there are costs and benefits on both sides, and you have to determine how much you want to readjust the world economy to address global warming, and I think that's a pretty big burden to post -- to impose on a district court judge.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We're dealing with an electric grid that connects I don't know how vast an area, but certainly a vast area here.  And the fact that they can reduce their emissions in a way that doesn't affect their customers is based on the fact that other power plants that are part of the grid will serve part of those -- will serve the customers' needs to some extent.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I -- I suppose there were reasons that Congress adopted that approach, and your suit would override those determinations.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How much -- how much regulation do you need before you would admit that there is displacement?  Is it -- is it a preemption analysis that you're adopting or a displacement analysis?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is -- what is your test for displacement?  When do we tell whether there's displacement or not?  Has there been some displacement in this case but just not total displacement or--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --That sounds like -- that sounds like preemption to me and not displacement, or at least preemption with another label.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, maybe you can tell me in what -- to what extent displacement is different from preemption.  Tell me in this area you're going to have displacement but not preemption.  Or I guess it's the other way around, in which there's going to be preemption but not -- well, what's the difference?  You said in response to Justice Kagan that if they've made a considered decision that this is the amount and no other amount higher or lower, then there would be displacement.  In what way is that different from preemption?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think you're right that under your theory they operate pretty similarly and I thought the whole point of Milwaukee v. Illinois was that they are two very distinct propositions.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why do you stop at U.S. emissions?  What percentage of worldwide emissions, every one of which I assume harms your clients, do these five power plants represent?  Infinitesimal, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  From power plants or total emissions?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you agree -- General Katyal began his argument in fairly dramatic fashion by saying we've never in 222 years had a case where the relief, the damages and the relief sought, were as broad as they are here.  Do you have anything to rebut his proposition?  Any case where it has been as broad as it is here?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What's your best -- what's your candidate to rebut his proposition?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  A broader case with respect to the infliction of damage and the need for relief.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, not as many as contribute to global warming?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, no, it's not, and it's not true of every litigation in this sense, that everyone is harmed by global warming.

It seems a bit more fundamental than the examples you're giving.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, not -- not fundamental in the sense of is it important or not.  I guess that -- ""fundamental"" is not the right word.  Maybe ""structural"" or -- or something like that.  It's sort of the whole basis for the decision that's going to be made.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that just means that the district court is acting in concert with Congress to take action that undermines the long-term institutional and constitutional basis of the judiciary, and the districts courts have very different reasons and incentives to do that.  That doesn't mean that all bets are off, and just because they're involved in the process it's not a concern.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Englert.     Roy T. Englert, Jr.  No, but really, the 157(b)(5) question is -- is easy, but the strongest argument Mr. Richland makes on the merits of the 157(b)(5) claim is that Congress meant only bodily injury when it referred to personal injury.  But section 522(d)(11) of the code uses the term ""bodily injury"", so we know that when Congress means bodily injury, it says bodily injury.  It's also been suggested that the phrase ""personal injury or wrongful death"" is a phrase to which the canons of interpretation ""noscitur a sociis"" and ""ejusdem generis"" somehow apply.  That's not why Congress used personal injury or wrongful death.  Until 1846 with Lord Campbell's Act, the common law of England was that a wrongful death claim didn't survive, couldn't be brought by the -- by the heirs, because the victim of the tort was dead.  It is quite common all around the country to use the phrase ""personal injury or wrongful death"" to make clear that the tort being covered is a tort that resulted in injury to someone who survived or is a tort that resulted in death.  So there's nothing surprising about the use of that phrase.  It doesn't mean bodily injury.  And for those who look at legislative history, there is legislative history indicating quite emphatically that the members of Congress who were responsible for adding 157(b)(5), amending 157(b)(2)(B), amending 157(b)B-O -- and putting the abstention provisions in section 1334(c) really meant for bankruptcy judges to keep their hands off personal injury claims.  The main claim in this case that conceivably could have given the Bankruptcy Court jurisdiction, if I lose on the other issues, was Pierce's defamation claim, not Vickie's intentional interference claim.  We would respectfully suggest they're both personal injury tort claims, but it's particularly clear that Pierce's defamation claim is an injury to his personal interest in reputation.  So either by resolving the constitutional issue or through the canon of constitutional avoidance, or simply because it is the best reading of 157(b)(2), this Court should affirm the Ninth Circuit.

Melissa Arbus Sherry  On a prospective -- not -- not directly in that the words ""report"", ""hearing"", ""audit"" or ""investigation"" are still included, but it did narrowly and further define what that means.  It added a Federal context, and so this Court had decided in Graham County that there was no Federal nexus required for the second category of documents and going forward with the 2010 amendments there now is.  And so, on a prospective basis -- may I finish?  On a prospective basis, State audits, State reports would not be subject -- would not bar a qui tam case, unless if this Court holds otherwise they're produced in response to a FOIA request.

Roberts, Jr.  --So how are you ever going to know that the defendant would have accepted the plea agreement?  Because by not accepting it he has a chance of going scot-free.  He's going to have a fair trial, that's the assumption; and he may be acquitted.  So how is a judge supposed to say -- I mean, presumably the defendant will always say, I would have taken that deal, because it's better.  So how is a judge supposed to go back and decide whether that's true or not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is the judge -- how is the judge ever going to know, be able to decide whether the defendant would have accepted the deal or not?   INTERRUPTING John G.

I understand that to be taken out of the case by the concessions on the other side.  I'm talking about the prejudice question.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is a judge supposed to know?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  People have different -- some people are willing to take the chance.  Okay?  Let's say the there is a 20 percent chance that the person will be found guilty.  Some people will say, I'm willing to take that chance because I just don't want the chance of -- of going to jail.  I am willing to roll the dice.  Other people will say no, that's too much.  Whether you want to go to jail may cut one way or the other, but how is a judge supposed to decide?  Ask him, are you -- do you take chances?   INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even if it demonstrates the non-navigability of the particular stretch, but we would still speak of the transfer of commerce as being along the river.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The sort of the case or analogy I was thinking of is if I say I fly from Washington to Tokyo, and someone says,  ""No you didn't; you flew to San Francisco, then you walked however many yards from one gate to another, and then you flew to Tokyo. ""  And I'd say,  ""Well, yes, there is a gap there when I walked -- part of the distance where I wasn't flying. ""  but people would still say you flew from D.C. to Tokyo.  Now why isn't this just like that, that the commercial path, the commercial waterway people think of as the Missouri.  And yes, occasionally you have got to get out, and, you know, we can debate how long the portage is, but it doesn't it interrupt the notion that that whole pathway would qualify as a navigable waterway.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I would think, though, if you start drawing these lines, they become very difficult, in some rivers anyway, to -- to apply.  I'm sure there are seasonable fluctuations.  They may be navigable in some seasons, but not in others.  The line at which you pass from navigability to non-navigability may be difficult to ascertain.  It seems to me once you start chopping the highway of commerce up, it does create all those difficulties.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your -- your answer a moment ago gives me pause.  You -- you said the United States would not be bound by this litigation, but could bring its own quiet title action.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's kind of odd.  Maybe this is -- maybe this is Justice Alito's earlier question.  It's kind of odd that the more navigable the river is, the more claim the State has.  The less navigable -- you're talking about sportsboats and drift fishing -- then it's Federal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Garre.     Gregory G. Garre  --Your Honor, it was an 11-day portage.  At the time of Statehood, it was a one-day portage.  I think what's significant is he wrote it after that portage.  And yet he recognized that there was not a finer example of a navigable river through a mountainous country.  That assessment is consistent with this Court's precedents for more than 140 years.  It's consistent with the actual use of the Missouri as a continuous highway of commerce along the very stretch at issue here.  We don't believe that PPL or the United States has -- has provided a legal reason for this Court to overturn the judgment of the Montana Supreme Court that the Missouri or the other rivers at issue in this case are navigable.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but I'm not sure it has the same consequences.  It seems to me that regardless of who prevails in this case, the State will be able to exercise regulatory jurisdiction over the waters.  You know, you can't fish during these seasons, or there are different limits on how many fish you can take.  And so will the Federal government.  It will be able to apply Federal law to the river regardless of who owns parts of the river, regardless of who owns the land underneath.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Without regard -- But I would say without regard to whether they happened to own the land under the river or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We haven't talked much about the Madison.  What is your best piece of evidence with respect to the Madison for the proposition that it was navigable at statehood?   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, isn't that logically not -- doesn't that logically not follow?  ""You may not sell meat if it's been adulterated. ""  doesn't mean that you can sell meat so long as it's not been adulterated; right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  One is a limitation, not a grant.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  But they don't -- you don't know whether they are going to become meat until after the Federal process of post-mortem inspection and all of that and your rules seem to prohibit that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but I mean your -- your argument up to this point has been that this doesn't interfere with the Federal laws because the Federal laws are designed only to deal with meat that is for consumption.  And you say with your -- with respect to your animals, that's not what it is.  But here, as I understand the Petitioner's and the government's position, it is that nonambulatory animals can be turned into meat for consumption.  So you don't know whether it fits under the definition of the State law until you've violated it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your argument is that because the act doesn't speak to whether or not cats and dogs and horses can be sold as meat, you can also say it's not within the scope because it doesn't speak to specifically whether nonambulatory animals can be sold as meat or not.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that seems to me -- what you're saying then with respect to animals that are slaughtered in a slaughterhouse is that the difference is that the State law says you can't sell that as meat while the Federal law says you can.  Right?  In other words, you're saying, well, just because the Federal law says you can, doesn't mean that the State can't say you can't.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Correct?  Well, isn't the exact flip side of saying you can sell it is that -- that you can't sell it, is that you can.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I just don't -- and maybe this has already been asked, but I'm not sure from a juror's perspective that it makes terribly much difference the exact formulation of this instruction.  I think a juror who sees an employee is suing the railroad, and it turns out that what the railroad did had very little or nothing to do with what happened to the employee, they don't need an instruction about natural, foreseeable causes.  They're just not going to give the awards, or they're going to give the awards even though the railroad didn't do anything that affected the employee.  It's a -- it's a nuance that I just don't think has any practical significance.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  My point is that I don't see much practical difference between what you argue is the correct instruction and what your friend argues is the correct instruction.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, law students, professors, and some judges have had trouble defining the concept of proximate cause for centuries.  I don't know why we expect a juror to be able to navigate through those nuances, either.   John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But counsel, how -- the supposition that it results in more speech, let's take the independent expenditure example.  You've got one candidate running against three others.  There's an independent expenditure on behalf of the one candidate.  That means, say $10,000.  That means each of the other three get $10,000 of their own.  Now, that might promote more speech, but the effect may well be for the independent expenditure to say, I'm not going to spend the money, and so the other candidates don't get the money and you have less speech.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How would you -- what would that evidence look like?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, other than somebody saying it, I'm just curious what the evidence would look like.  You're -- it's -- you're proving a negative.  You're saying, well, this person didn't do something because of this, and that's pretty hard to do.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so the idea is this is a way of encouraging candidates to take the public financing, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Would it encourage more candidates to do that if you doubled the amount that was available for every additional amount that the privately financed candidate spends?  He spends $1,000 over the amount and the publicly financed candidate gets $2,000.  A lot more people are going to do the publicly financing route if that were the case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's kind of an odd line to find in the First Amendment, isn't it?  That you get a 100 percent matching as opposed to, say, 110 percent or 150 percent?  Somewhere in the First Amendment the line is drawn on the amount?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it doesn't work?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  On that, there's a back and forth about the record and common sense.  As a matter of common sense -- I think this has already been asked -- if you knew that a $10,000 expenditure that you would make that would support a candidate would result in $30,000, 40,000, 50,000, depending on how many opposition candidates there were available for them, wouldn't you think twice about it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if you're thinking twice and one way you're thinking is not to do it, that sounds like a sufficient burden.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Our cases, as you know, have drawn a distinction between expression and disclosure.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your focus on persuasiveness -- your focus on persuasiveness is a particular view of the political process that may not be applicable in every case.  Political scientists sometimes tell you that it's not persuasion, but simply playing to your base, getting them more actively involved.  So it's not the somewhat more academic view that people are going to sit down and just regard which one is persuasive.  Is that a permissible objective for the State to pursue, to value a particular view of the electoral process over another?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Phillips.  Mr. Jay.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, do you agree that under our precedents, leveling the playing field for candidates is not a legitimate State purpose?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I checked the Citizens' Clean Elections Commission website this morning, and it says that this act was passed to, quote, ""level the playing field"" when it comes to running for office.  Why isn't that clear evidence that it's unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING John G.

You know, the answer to your -- the answer to your question was women don't have as many positions because managers discriminate against them in -- in hiring and in promotion, yet you still have the same subjective delegation system.  Could you have a class of women who were harmed by this subjective policy, even though it was clear that the policy of the corporation favored equal employment opportunity?   John G.

This company has a thousand stores, and sure enough in a thousand stores you're going to be able to find a goodly number who aren't following the company's policy, who are exercising their subjective judgment in a way that violates the right to equal treatment.

Yes, interconnection is an important policy, and Congress said we have to provide it at points within our networks selected by competitors and we do that.  But Congress didn't say and the FCC has never said that we also have to provide them whatever it is that they want to use to get to that point.  And there really is, and I think some of the questioning pulled that out, though they want to say I think because the government won't endorse the absolute position, the Petitioners were taking in their opening briefs, that this is only about things that used to be ordered as unbundled elements or things already in the ground.  But their position, their interpretation of the statute has no stopping point.  It would cover anything a competitor might ever want to use to get telephone calls to the interconnection point.  And they've never defended that limitless reading.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, the attorney-client privilege is policy-based and I'm concerned about the policy implications of your position.  Our system has concluded that it works best if people have candid advice from their lawyers, and my concern here is if you're a lawyer -- you are a lawyer -- and -- and you're asked for your advice by a trustee--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --and if you know that that is going to be shared with the beneficiary, you're going to give bland, mushy, hedging advice rather than direct and candid advice to the trustee, because it's going to be shared more widely beyond the trustee.  And that's -- that hurts not only the trustee, but also the beneficiaries, whose trustee does not have candid legal advice.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So how does -- I appreciate the point, but how does a trustee get candid legal advice?  In every case, isn't the -- the lawyer -- concerning his dealings with the beneficiary, with the trust: I don't know if I have to do this or I have to do this.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And it seems to me if the -- if the information is always going to be shared with the beneficiary, the trustee is always going to get hedged advice.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's always a question of liability.  If he messes up and doesn't manage it the way he's supposed to, he will be liable.  So the distinction you draw doesn't seem to me to be a workable one.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So I'm the trustee, and I say I would like legal advice as to whether I should renegotiate this lease with the government.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, I want that advice so I manage the trust correctly, and I'm concerned if I don't manage the trust correctly I'm going to be sued.  Now is the document from the lawyer responding to that inquiry privileged or not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if he says this is what I did and I might be liable, it's privileged.  If he says this is what I'm going to do--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --So under your theory if there's a claim of privilege on -- on -- on the government's behalf, presumably the district court would conduct an in-camera review to determine whether it was retrospective for liability or prospective for responsibility?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they -- they could be retrospective, too, right?  The government exposes itself to liability, obviously, in these areas as well.  That's the basis for your suit, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose the government as a whole has an obligation to act in the best interests of the citizenry, right?  Why doesn't the same theory apply to any citizen?  Look, government, you're supposed to -- you're acting in a fiduciary statute -- status with respect to me.  You're supposed to be acting in my best interests.  If you're getting advice from the, you know, Department of Justice about what to do, I'm entitled to get that.   John G.

Mr. Palmore.     David C. Frederick  Mr. Chief Justice, if I could put it this way, the pushback for the but-for test in its broadest sense is that there isn't a natural kind of a way of confining some restriction to it.  And so if you look at the statute in terms of what it naturally must have meant by Congress, there is a natural limit, and it is not just complete but-for causation, but there are an effort -- there is an effort to try to restrict the scope of the compensation.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it's a little -- it's a little different when you are talking about a labor practice and an activity that results in an injury.  Labor practice by its terms is going to have applicability to a particular location.  So you would expect them to use that type of language.  It doesn't carry the same negative implication you are suggesting under 1333(b).   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if -- But what if that exposure is not pertinent to what they are doing?  Let's take the individual, 98 percent of the time on the rig and 2 percent on land, and an emergency comes up and they need a new part and they say: Here, go -- you know, go drive to Reno where they have a new part and bring it back.  And he skids off the road and is injured.  Is he really covered by the Offshore Act?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, so he is -- he is injured by a hazard on the road to Reno.  He's -- I don't know how many miles that is from the offshore, and yet he's still covered by the Offshore Act?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry; I don't understand the answer.  So he's covered by both?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Please.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Frederick.     John G.

What do you do with somebody who's -- 3 months he's on the shelf, and then 3 months he's back -- back on land 3 months?  Does it depend when the injury occurs, whether it's when he's on the land part of his job or on the shelf part?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I have given you all the totality.  He is working 3 months, and then he's -- you know, it's seasonal or something, and 3 months he is on -- on the land.  That is the totality of the circumstances.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why?

Roberts, Jr.  Does it extend to new categories of copyrightable works?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, one way it could, I suppose, is that it shows that Congress is interested in making sure that American authors overseas have reciprocal protection, an issue that could come out in a variety of contexts.  And if I'm sitting there writing a great novel, I will have the confidence that my government will ensure that I get protection when it becomes a bestseller in China; right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's -- that's an incentive.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I'm talking about -- but the same issue can come up again, you know, whether it's in the area of formalities, whatever.  There may be another problem where there is a dispute between other countries and our country.  And I will know that in the past, the United States has taken action looking out for -- for the interests of American authors.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's an incentive.  Now, it may be, as I think it was described in the court of appeals decision, a ""meager"" incentive.  You may be more interested in other protections.  But it's -- we haven't really required much more than that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  General Verrilli.     Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  I think -- I don't think so, Justice Alito.  I think they could have followed the model nationally of prospective copyright only, and extinguishing the prior copyright, but they didn't make that choice.  They made a different choice.  Now, my friend suggests that the 1790 Act was just a transition, but of course, the same thing is really true in an important sense of section 514.  It's part of a tradition of a transition of the United States into the international system, which has required an adjustment of our rules in order to bring us into conformity with the international system.  And beyond the example of course of the 1790 -- and by the way, with respect to that language in the 1790 copyright who have or have not copyright, that's just a rerun of an argument that the Court rejected in Wheaton v. Peters.  In Wheaton, the Court said that -- that language in the 1790 Act was referring to pre-publication common law copyright, not post-publication common law copyright.  Beyond that, it seems to me pretty clear that what that language is referring to -- of course, Congress presupposes the existence of copyrights, or at least State statutes that created some copyrights -- but what Congress did was act far more broadly.  And -- so I do think -- and then when one looks at the examples of patents -- I think the -- the Oliver Evans example, and that case, is an important example, early in our history.  Congress creates a new patent term to an expired patent.  President Jefferson signs it.  Secretary of State Madison issues it.  Chief Justice Marshall upholds it as a circuit justice, and the Court upholds it against a charge that it's impermissibly burdening people who act in reliance on the expiration of the prior patent.  There wasn't a word in this Court's decision in that case about any potential constitutional infirmity with doing that.  And one would think if this was such a significant and viable principle of constitutional law, that someone would have brought it up in those cases.  In fact, the striking thing about reading the Evans decision is that the Court clearly looks at this all as a matter of legislative policy judgment.  It says, you know yes, you're right, it might have been an argument, a good argument in favor of creating some reliance interest here, but that's a judgment Congress should have made if anybody was going to make it.  It didn't -- and there is no reading of the -- there is no required reading of that statute that has to protect the reliance party.  So I don't -- I just think when you look at the patent protection, when you look at the 1790 Act, when you consider the fact that when Congress expands exclusive rights, as it did for example with respect to musical compositions but did in the 1976 Act with respect to lots of exclusive rights, it does so with existing copyrights.  And all of that points up to the wisdom of what this court said in Eldred, that within very wide margins, these are matters where legislative choice, these are policy calls that require the balancing of a complex set of interests, the drawing of a complex set of lines made even more complex by virtue of the fact that we are now trying to make a transition into full participation in an international system, which is of vital importance to protecting one of our most valuable economic exports, intellectual property.

One day I can perform Shostakovich; Congress does something, the next day I can't.  Doesn't that present a serious First Amendment problem?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's -- that's -- one answer is that Congress has done this before.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So do you have an argument other than they have done this before?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it's pertinent under the First Amendment in other areas, right?  It's a different analysis if your claim is the government should open up a park as a public forum, than if it's been a public forum for 200 years and the government decides to close it down.  Maybe they can do it but it's a different question.  So why isn't this a different question, whether they can extend copyright protection that's already there?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about Jimmy Hendrix, right?  He has a distinctive rendition of the national anthem, and all of a -- assuming the national anthem is suddenly entitled to copyright protection that it wasn't before, he can't do that, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So he is just out of luck?  And that's just one example of many, where you take existing works and you have a derivative work or something that is distinctive to you.  So those people are just out of luck?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even under -- even under rationale basis scrutiny, it seems to me that you run into Justice Breyer's concern that the government interest is vanishingly small when it comes to promoting progress under the Copyright Clause, so that the interest weighed on the other side of the -- the restriction of free speech rights, it's hard to say that that's necessarily going to tip the balance in every case.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you referred to the ministerial exception, but of course your position extends beyond ministers.  How do we, how do we decide who's covered by the ministerial exception and who is not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let's say it's a teacher who teaches only purely secular subjects, but leads the class in grace before lunch.  Is that somebody who would be covered by the ministerial exception?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, different churches have different ideas about who's a minister.  There are some churches who think all of our adherents are ministers of our faith.  Now, does that mean that everybody who is a member of that church qualifies as a minister because that is part of the church's belief?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Every one of our adherents stands as a witness to our beliefs.  And that -- you know, not every church is hierarchical in terms of different offices.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You may.  Ms. Kruger.     Leondra R. Kruger  --If the only way that the Plaintiff has to show that that may not have been the employer's real reason was a subjective judgment about the quality of canon law scholarship, then judgment has to be entered for the employer, because the plaintiff has no viable way, consistent with the Establishment Cause, of demonstrating that wasn't the employer's real reason.  If on the other hand the plaintiff has evidence that no one ever raised any objections to the quality of her scholarship, but they raised objections to women serving in certain roles in the school, and those roles were not ones that were required to be filled by persons of a particular gender, consistent with religious beliefs, then that's a case in which a judge can instruct a jury that it's job is not to inquire as to the validity of the subjective judgment, just as juries are often instructed that their job is not to determine whether an employer's business judgment was fair or correct, but only whether the employer was motivated by discrimination or retaliation.

Roberts, Jr.  Is there anything special about the fact that the people involved in this case are part of a religious organization?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that a no?  You say it's similar to other cases.  Expressive associations, a group of people who are interested in labor rights have expressive associations.

You can't limit your -- the type of rules that you say are not -- are okay and are not if the First Amendment doesn't apply at all?   INTERRUPTING John G.

They're biased in favor of whichever party happens to be in the majority.   John G.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That would be a viable First Amendment--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Thank you, Mr. Elwood.  Mr. Rosenkranz.     E. Joshua Rosenkranz  It would be subject to scrutiny for sure.  It would be subject to First Amendment scrutiny.  And that would be justified on the ground not of the closeness of relationships that are formed, but on the ground that you don't want legislators here and now as they are sitting in the chamber thinking about generating business with their future clients and changing their votes because of that.  That's the justification.  But there's no such justification here.  The commission has never articulated why political loyalty is so toxic that it needs to be banished from politics.  And so, just on the -- on the directness of the burden yet, for a political activist who is engaged in these sorts of relationships, the burden of being told, you've got to choose right at the outset, are you going to represent -- are you going to help this candidate get elected or are you going to lobby?  That is worse than a fine, because a political activist wants to do both precisely because they care about the ultimate results.  And for the candidate himself who is deciding right upfront which of the universe of players am I going to take as volunteers, they need to know upfront whether this relationship will be viewed as toxic, and if it is, they will not engage in that relationship.  This is no less direct than the burden that this Court recognized as unconstitutional in the Davis case, the Millionaire's Amendment Case, or in Burdick, where the only burden was that the paid petitioner would have to register to vote, which is a nominal burden, but those whose consciences were affected by a registration were kept out of the process.

Gannon  She -- although it -- the statute itself refers to aiding, assisting, procuring or advising, it's not a traditional aiding and abetting statute.  It doesn't require there to be an underlying primary violation.  It's an independent offense.

Roberts, Jr.  --And I think it's kind of a glaring factual nuance to the case, kind of, that he didn't seek cert. And he also didn't seek State collateral review.  I mean, if he had tried one of those or both of those, we -- we probably wouldn't be here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Normally I think if it looks like a mess procedurally, or whatever, the normal assumption is you let the lower court figure it out.  Send it back, and I -- I think the research is that in actually most cases in which we GVR, the court reinstates the judgment below for one reason or -- or another; but the idea that we parse through them carefully -- I think if it's arguable, send it back and let the lower court sort it out.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The problem is that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I appreciate your point that you may or may not have been able to bring it.  My -- my concern is that you have, I guess as someone put it, the perfect storm here.  You have a person who did not file cert, and he could well have gotten relief if he had, through the GVR process, and who did not seek State collateral review, and he could well have -- you say probably wouldn't.  But the State said certainly would have.  Somewhere in there.  At least he would have had a fair chance--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --or a chance.  But because he didn't seek cert and he didn't file State collateral relief, we have this more complicated scenario.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it seems to me that AEDPA contemplates that.  It refers to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.  So naturally you would have a different result with respect to claims that were adjudicated on direct review and any claim that was pushed over to collateral review.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm sorry, but i mean, my point is that it seems a pretty weak criticism of a result that it requires you to go claim by claim, when the statute specifically requires you to go claim by claim.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The objection there it seems to me would have to be with Congress.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Eisenberg.     Ronald Eisenberg  --Your Honor, I'm not sure if I agree with that factually.  In the Spisak case, for example, I don't know that it was necessary for the State to make that argument.  The State thought it had a strong argument on the merits.  That's exactly what happened in Horn v. Banks, as well, Your Honor, which is a case that actually supports our position.  In that case, the State court applied on collateral review the rule of Mills v. Maryland.  Now this Court later held in that same case that Mills was a new rule that would be Teague-barred, but the State didn't know that at that time, and the State had a well established body of law applying Mills.  And thought -- the State thought it could reasonably dispose of the claim on merits of the Mills issue, so it did so.  The case came to Federal habeas corpus review.  It wouldn't have been barred, review on the merits would not have been barred by 2254 because the State collateral review court applied Mills and made a merits determination.  So the defendant would have been entitled to merits review under the deferential standard.  The problem is Mills was a new rule and so the independent bar of Teague comes into play.  The Third Circuit refused to apply that independent bar; that's why this Court reversed in Horn v. Banks; and so it neatly many illustrates another example of a situation where Teague actually does survive despite 2254.  There are other doctrines that, based on this Court's case law, that have been overshadowed to an even greater extent than Teague was.  Abuse of the writ, the Keeney v. Tomayo-Reyes concerning evidentiary hearings.  Certainly Congress had the right to do that, and in fact these issues were addressed to some degree even in the court's seminal deference case in Williams v. Taylor.  In Williams v. Taylor for example, it was Justice Stevens' position in dissent, arguing in dissent, that the statute really only embodied Teague.  When the statute said clearly established all that Congress meant to do was to codify Teague.  He said it was perfectly clear that that was the case.  And he argued, particularly in footnote 12 of his dissenting portion of his opinion in Williams v. Taylor, just as Petitioner argues today that the fact that Congress in other portions of AEDPA, particularly in section 2244, used language talking about finality of judgment and talking about retroactivity, the fact that Congress did that in 2254 means that it was thinking about Teague and that it really meant to extend the Teague rule throughout the entire statute, that Teague really flavored the entire statute.  The Court necessarily rejected that argument, and in fact in reference to another prior case of this Court, Wright v. West that had been argued by Justice Stevens in his dissent, Justice O'Connor speaking for the Court said:  ""Congress need not mention a prior decision of this Court by name in a statute's text in order to adopt a rule. ""  Now I think that's clearly what Congress did, and I think it's -- that the Court clearly recognized in Williams v. Taylor that the deference rule, 2254, constituted a new rule which sat side by side with Teague and operated in different ways even if in some cases, many cases that mean you never have to get to the Teague bar, because the 2254-bar came into play first or more easily.

Your friend makes the argument that of course in a typical appellate case, you don't go back and revisit the facts, but that appellate court is expected to apply the law at the time it renders its decision.

So why aren't the consequences of that arrangement attributed to Maples as well?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Garre.  Mr. Neiman.     John C. Neiman Jr.  The -- my point was that Butler did not simply agree just to move these people -- move these people's admission.  Butler said he would be local counsel.  And the role of local counsel is defined by Rule 7 and includes an obligation to attend hearings, conferences and the like.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Thank you.

Let's even go further and say the prosecutor knows that nobody representing Mr. Maples received notice.  What happens then?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, I know it would be more substantial.  That's why -- my question is what happens?  Are you prepared to acknowledge that in that case, Mr. Maples had been abandoned by all of his lawyers, it was known to the prosecution, and therefore, the failure to file the notice should not constitute an adequate and independent State ground barring collateral relief?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why did he do it?  Why did he do it, then?  Just gloating that -- that the fellow had lost?  What was the point of it?  He must have thought there was a problem, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you accept -- I don't mean to interfere the question, but so you accept the idea that there is a distinction between malfeasance and abandonment.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So then the only thing we are talking about is whether on these particular facts there has been abandonment or not.  Right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  From your perspective.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You agreed with me earlier that abandonment is an exception to the adequate and independent State grounds.  So under your view of the case, Coleman was not necessarily controlling.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it correct or does the notice -- most of the notices I see list the people who have been served.  Were the New York people listed on the notice that went to Butler?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then he knew he wasn't the only one getting notice.   John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, Justice Ginsburg is quite right.  That -- that was not the issue in Mathis.  The argument in Mathis was: We're questioning him about something else, so we don't have to give him Miranda warnings.  And that's the question that the Court decided.  I don't think it had any discussion about whether -- there was certainly not the argument of whether he was in custody or not.  The argument was this is a different crime, so we don't have to give you Miranda, and the Court rejected that.  So how does that clearly establish the law on which the court relied in this case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you know, where exactly in Mathis?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's only about five pages long.  Can you show me where they have that discussion about custody, as opposed to a discussion about what crime is being discussed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Exactly.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Exactly.  It's implied.  Inferred.  How--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Is that clearly established law?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you agree that this is not -- what you want to derive from Mathis is not part of the holding of Mathis?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's an extension.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not sure you answered mine from before.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do you think that your argument or the decision of the court below was implicit in or an extension of Mathis?  Mathis says you don't -- you're -- you are not free of Miranda just because it's a different crime.  How does that answer the issue before the Sixth Circuit in this case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I thought what we have been arguing about is not the nexus issue, but instead whether in light of the circumstances or under an absolute rule there is custody.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And what is the clearly established law set forth in our cases that answers that latter question?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I -- Since we are talking about the Sixth Circuit decision, what it says is, this is on page 10 A,  ""The central holding of Mathis is that a Miranda warning is required whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population and interrogated, i.e., questioned in a manner likely to lead self-incrimination about conduct occurring outside of the prison. ""  Is that a correct description of Mathis?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought Mathis rejected the argument that it depends on whether the crime is the one you are in prison for or something else.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the first part, Miranda warning is required whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population, okay?  And interrogated, i.e., questioned or whatever.  Now does that address all of the issues?  Is that -- Where in Mathis is the discussion about whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, where in Mathis?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If the argument were that Miranda was not required because this concerns a different crime than what you are in prison for here.  I understand the idea that under AEDPA that Mathis is clearly established law.  The issue here, however, as the Sixth Circuit put it is a warning is required whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population.  And I jut don't see that anywhere in Mathis.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't the best you can say, not that Mathis found but perhaps that Mathis apparently assumed that he was in custody, because there is no discussion of it?  There is no discussion of the custody--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Yes, they give a factual recital, he was in his cell and all that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is dicta?  Dicta is something that is said that is not necessarily to the holding.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't have anything that is said about it here.   ",10-680X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand the advice of counsel, but what is the reasonable expectation of that's been altered?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you're saying that the expectation is when he pleads guilty to a violent felony, that he expects, well, if I am deported because of that I am going to be able to seek discretionary waiver?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How often are these waivers granted?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But in terms of the expectation interest, we have to visualize someone who is facing a serious charge and is entering a plea bargain, where presumably the consideration of what he's pleading to, how much of a sentence he's going to get, all that, are dominant considerations.  And he's also going to say: Well, I have been advised that I will be able to apply for a discretionary waiver, so I'm going to plead guilty.  That's a fairly unlikely scenario, isn't it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  I'm not questioning the fact that he was advised, but presumably the lawyer will also advise him: Oh, and you also have to pay the $250, you know, restitution, whatever, fee.  I am just questioning how significant that advice will be when someone's determining whether to plead guilty or not to a violent felony.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you counsel.  Mr. Gannon.     Curtis E. Gannon  I -- I appreciate your chance to let me clarify, Justice Kagan.  In our brief in opposition, we stated that an alien could avoid the statutory counterpart rule by leaving the country.  That meant that by getting himself into an exclusion proceeding, the statutory counterpart rule then would not be applicable.  It didn't mean that had he left the country, come back if they did an exclusion proceeding and they put in a subsequent deportation proceeding, that the statutory counterpart rule wouldn't apply.

It seems to me there's a lot more information here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Here you had a police officer who assembled information he had, truthful information, in the affidavit, submitted it to his superiors, who were lawyers.  Then it was submitted to the magistrate, who was a judge.  And what you have to say, it seems to me, is that a reasonably competent officer -- not objective good faith or anything like that -- a reasonably competent officer would say: You know, I know the lawyers in the office said this was okay and I know the judge said it was okay, but I know more than them; I know not only that it's not okay, but it's so clearly not okay that I shouldn't have qualified immunity.  That seems to me a pretty heavy burden to put on -- to put on the cop on the beat.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We have been talking -- we have been talking about this for some time as if we are reviewing the adequacy of the warrant.  We are not.  We are reviewing the reasonableness of these officers' determination that there was probable cause.  Do you think it is at all pertinent in addressing that question that the officers submitted the affidavit to support the warrant to Deputy District Attorney Jane Wilson, who reviewed it and signed off on it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I didn't ask if it's dispositive.  Is it relevant in any way?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Your answer, and again--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --it seems to me we keep separating these two inquiries.  It's not whether the warrant showed adequate probable cause; it's whether or not the officers were reasonable in believing that it did.   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that gets to a point that I am having trouble getting my arms around.  It seems to me what your position is, what you want us to focus on, there are three possible arguments.  One is that there is injury in fact in this case.  I see some of that argument in your briefs.  Two, that Congress presumes injury in fact.  Injury in fact is still required, but that is presumed.  I read that to be perhaps what the trust cases say.  Or three, that injury in fact is not required at all.  Now, which are you arguing?  One, two or three?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay, statutory right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could I?  I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I want to pause on that question.  You said violation of a statute is injury in fact.  I would have thought that would be called injury in law.  And when we say, as all our standing cases have, is that what is required is injury in fact, I understand that to be in contradistinction to injury in law.  And when you tell me all that you've got or all that you want to plead is violation of the statute, that doesn't sound like injury in fact.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Now, that goes back to the first proposition.  That is an argument that there is injury in fact here.  So it seems to me that -- I don't mean this in a pejorative sense, but it seems to me that you slide back and forth between one, two, and three, which makes it hard for us to get a decision.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Potential value.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, we said in the Whitmore case, and this is a quote:  ""Allegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements of Article III. ""  Potential value sounds to me like possible future injury.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that is injury in fact?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you tell me what this case is about is whether or not you've shown injury in fact, it's not a significant -- significant case, and your client has to prove that at trial.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I thought -- and maybe it's a unique circumstance in this case, but Ohio says this is going to cost you the same no matter what you do.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  But then again, that's an argument about was there or was there not injury in fact.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That sounds, again to use a word that we have said is inadequate to support standing, that sounds conjectural.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, no.  We are talking about not what Congress found; but what the injury in fact is.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You will agree, won't you, that the idea that it's certainly possible or whatever your formulation was, that the quality here wasn't good enough or that the entire quality across the board might be better, that's conjectural, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now we in point -- now we are at level two: It's hard to prove.  So is that your argument, that Congress presumed injury?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you would accept $1 in this case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, no, that -- that gets -- I didn't mean to be facetious, but it gets to the question of whether or not you have to actually show injury-in-fact.  Your allegation in this case is for damages, not just nominal damages but damages.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you want -- I'm sorry.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you want to get out of this contract?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you want to get out of this deal?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I didn't see -- I didn't see an allegation for a decision or -- or -- so you are perfectly happy as far as we know from the complaint with this deal, you just want the extra $500 per class member without showing any injury--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --You -- you don't want the conflict-free transaction because you don't want to get out of this contract.  You are perfectly happy with the contract.  You want $500.  You don't want a conflict-free transaction because even if it was a -- were a conflict-free transaction, the price would be the same, in Ohio.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Now there the answer to my question, and I don't mean to focus on a peculiar structure but your answer was on part 1.  You said no, not necessarily.  Here there was an injury-in-fact, she might have gotten a better deal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I ask you, just to follow up.  You said whether or not there is further economic harm.  So you say economic harm is required--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --because there can't be further economic harm if there isn't economic harm in the first place.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Further harm that happens to be economic, not further economic harm.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Lamken.  Mr. Yang?     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why do--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --What -- why do we always say injury in fact then?  You say so long as the harm is a violation of the law in legally protected interest.  Our standing cases always say injury in fact as opposed to injury in law.  And you are saying if you violate the law, you have sufficient injury.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because -- they also go on to say that it has to be concrete.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Real and immediate, not conjectural or hypothetical.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that all of our cases, we could have left ""in fact"" out of all of them.  None of them come out differently because we insist on injury in fact.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The difference between legal harm, though -- isn't that -- I guess I'm just repeating myself.  Injury in fact.  How do you understand that to be different than any other kind of injury?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The two elements, that's the particularized requirement, and I understand that.

John G.

There's nothing wrong with that.  Each one testifies before the grand jury.  Who is the complaining witness?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Urges, urges a prosecution.  One area that causes me concern here are the domestic violence cases, where someone may well report an episode, but by the time it gets to whatever the indictment procedure is, a grand jury or otherwise, is unwilling to -- to testify and pursue it.  And yet that person may be the one who started the prosecution in motion.  Is that individual a complaining witness?   INTERRUPTING John G.

That's where the prosecution is initiating.  You are not subject to prosecution until the grand jury returns the indictment.  So why do we talk about complaining witnesses initiating the prosecution?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, somebody's is not--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --No, go ahead.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Jones.     John C. Jones  No.  And perhaps that's not my position.  First of all, I'm not saying that they're -- what I'm saying with respect to bringing a malicious prosecution claim is that, I think Justice Scalia asked me if there is a completely independent act, but if -- in the scenario that you paint, just the fact that they've talked outside the grand jury, that does not authorize an independent cause of action for a malicious prosecution claim.  What you have to have is an independent act, just like what you had at common law where you had two distinct acts: one, where you actually filed the complaint; now you become the complainant or as the common law said you became the complaining witness even if you didn't have to be a witness.  But then if you were a witness, indeed, that testimony that you gave in the -- in the grand jury or in the trial could be used as to -- to prove your malicious intent in bringing the charge initially.  And that -- that doesn't equate to what we have here in this -- in this scenario.  What we have here is there may have been a discussion outside of the court or outside of the grand jury, but that discussion now ended and now you have an independent act by the prosecutor to bring the cause of action.  So it's a completely distinct, as I see it, completely distinct scenarios.  If there are no further questions, thank you very much.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

I read to the Court some of the ones that the FDA itself wrote.  You would get into these long involved questions about compliance and so forth -- to the effect, Congress wanted to make generic approvals quicker in the Mylan situation.  FDA itself, and I started out my argument reading from that page, page 24A of the reply brief, where the FDA said increased litigation over use codes -- patent listings -- would not assure faster generic entry because you would spend years and years, as we all have, litigating these very issues.  So the Congress had it focused on this, which it never did.  There is not one word in the thousands and thousands of legislation -- pages of legislative history about use codes.

Roberts, Jr.  So why would we give a procedure to an adversary to fix the number when the brand manufacturer is going to fix it as soon as its alerted to the problem?   ",10-844X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but I mean, your -- it is a question for you, because these things don't go for 2 or 3 years, do they?  I thought typically they were wrapped up very quickly, and that's to the advantage of the debtor.  And your position with respect to postpetition taxes has the potential of extending them beyond the kind of quick turnaround that helps everybody.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How long was this -- this one?   ",10-875X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does that make sense, though, in terms of if you are talking about farmers and fishermen and you are talking about the treatment of their central asset, whether it's the farm or typically the boat, and they either want to try -- they want to try to save the farm or the boat, and they go into bankruptcy and the big issue is how that asset's going to be treated and your position is it's not in the bankruptcy at all, it's outside of it.  That seems to me to be at least counterintuitive.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but also I gather it's a fairly typical situation where you have farmers that might want to sell part of the farm.  You know, they have dairy and corn operations or something, and they sell one to try to preserve the other.  And that's -- that's exactly the sort of thing that should be considered in the bankruptcy context, and yet your position says we're going to treat it outside the bankruptcy.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's a big deal if you're deciding how the plan's going to work.  What the amount was here was big for the farmer and the idea of well, we are going to pretend that's not at issue here seems to me to be -- again, not to make a lot of sense.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's certainly not a self-denying position now, right?  You are arguing that these are -- that the taxes of this sort are administrative expenses when that puts you at the head of the line.  You are arguing that they are not administrative expenses, same type of taxes, when it puts you at the back of the line, even though the provision that puts you at the back of the line was designed to particularly help the fishermen and -- and farmers.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I'm talking about the position you are taking now.  You argue for--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --different treatment of these taxes as to whether or not they are administrative expenses -- not solely, but it leads to the result that you get the money first either way.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but then you're saying that Congress changed the rules in a way that, as Justice Alito's question suggested, really doesn't do much at all, when what they wanted to do was provide some real protection for farmers and fishermen.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But those are -- those are small potatoes compared to the sale of a farm and a boat, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  This particular issue of large capital gains from sale of significant assets doesn't typically arise in the Chapter 13 cases.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, in Chapter -- Chapter 13 cases are the ones that you -- that are typically resolved very quickly, right?   ",10-875X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but counsel, looking at Napier, the power that Justice Brandeis said was conferred in that case was to specify the sort of equipment to be used on locomotives; right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So this is equipment that was used in locomotives?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but that's the same -- that's the same thing, thing, I'll give you that, fitness for service.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It doesn't say something that's going to cause harm while it's actually being used.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why does it depend?  You want to know if this equipment is safe to operate, right, to be used, whether -- whether it's going to be used.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you have a boiler that's going to be used, that's within the power that was confirmed.  It's not merely to inspect, as again, as Justice Brandeis said.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess your argument isn't limited to being taken apart.  Your argument does depend on the fact that the asbestos doesn't come out during use; right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but if there is an accident or something does the asbestos come out during the use of the locomotive?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's the old insurance cases we've had, that, you know, when the car, you know, slams into a pole or something, it's not being used as a car anymore, and therefore, the insurance doesn't cover it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Frederick.  Ms. Harrington.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but if you're talking about -- I bet there are a lot of things on railroad cars that you can fix in the shop or you can fix while it's under way, right?  We are not always talking about brakes.  So let's suppose there's one of those things.  You get to the shop and the guy says: Boy, you got to fix this.  And they said: Well, the train's leaving and we're going to go in 10 hours.  And he says: Okay, I can fix it during the -- while it's in use.  Is that covered or not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the line you've been talking about between the repair shop and the locomotive on the tracks, that's not really the line at all.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well then, what's the answer to my question?  This is something you can fix in either place.  It's covered while it's -- if you fix it while the train is under way, but it's not covered if you wait until it's in the shop?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So then it's not whether it's in use or in the shop.  It's whether it is something that affects whether the locomotive can go, Whether it's--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Hacker.     Jonathan Hacker  I do think so, Your Honor.  Of course I don't think that matters because Napier is what it is and has been relied upon for 85 years.  But I think there would be a very good argument that it would be decided the same way today under the Ray case that Justice Sotomayor mentioned, was a very similar kind of delegation of regulatory authority; and the Court held that there was the same kind of field preemption.  There are some differences one could discuss, but Napier is what it is, as I say.  If The Court has no more questions I'll cede the balance of my time.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Frederick, you have 4 minutes.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And it knows -- it knows about Napier and what's been going on for 85 years, and if it wants to pull back on the preemptive effect of the provisions interpreted in Napier, it's free to do that, too.

Carter.  Ms. Schimmer.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't understand how your approach works.  The defendant, the habeas petitioner, the allegation is made: I'm incompetent, there is support for it.  The district court says: Okay, I can't enter an indefinite stay, but you are going to be treated; I want you to come back in 6 months, okay, and we will look at it then.  He comes back in 6 months, and there's been no change.  What happens then?  Another 6 months?  At what point does it become indefinite?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, give me a loose and soft rule.  I mean, is it--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --is it two years, or is it ten years?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Michelman.     Scott Michelman  Well, I suppose there would be some appeal to the notion that the district court might stay the rest of it, simply waiting, Your Honor; but we don't think that's likely to happen frequently.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel?  I'm sorry--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --If -- if we think it's necessary to set some objective limit on how long an inherent authority could be exercised, is there any reason to adopt any limit other than the one that the psychiatrists have suggested, which is, I gather, most people, if they're going to, will recover competence within 9 months?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if we're looking for a little more guidance than that, and feel the need for an objective standard other than abuse of discretion, you don't have any number that has any basis in psychiatric evidence, or anything else, besides the 9 months?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Nobody here thinks today -- no one's arguing that it prevents any kind of stay today, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I didn't understand -- I thought everybody was focusing on the limitation on stays.  And surely AEDPA is pertinent when it comes to recognizing the need for those limits, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, did -- did he begin treatment prior to the district court order on Federal habeas?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, so how -- what is this nine months or one year?  Is that the amount of time he's under treatment or the amount of time from the district court determination?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  General Horne, you have three minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry, I didn't follow that exactly.  What -- what prevents them from picking up where they left off?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, it's adjudicated, okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry, finish your answer.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's a truly suggested by the record standard?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well -- well, how is it compared to a motion to dismiss standard?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it more stringent?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, now we've gone from plausible to truly -- plausible -- well, truly suggested by the record.  I mean, suggested by the record might be plausible.  It seems to me that it's a pretty loose standard that entitles the defendant to a stay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but in that case, the whole basis of the analysis was that, although it was collateral, it really was the first opportunity to raise a particular claim.  You say that, earlier, that trial judges do this all the time in the trial context.  It's an important distinction in our jurisprudence if there's difference in terms of the rights to which you are entitled preconviction and post-conviction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is your -- what is your limit?  You think there is no limit on the inherent authority, that these things can go on and on?  Or as, I mean, your friend on the other side suggested, 1 year as a presumption?  Do you have any limit?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Did you say that the question is whether or not, not whether he is competent today to assist his counsel, but whether he was 14 years ago?   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you think a -- the word ""lawsuit"" typically describes an arbitration proceeding?  If you're subject to an arbitration, would you say, I'm in a lawsuit?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why doesn't a right to sue refer to a lawsuit?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  One way you could do it is that the right to sue is more familiar colloquially.  If somebody, you know, hits your car and you jump out angrily and you say -- you can say: I'm going to sue you.  You are not likely to say: I'm going to bring a cause of action against you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Nelson.     Scott L. Nelson  Well, when you say ""colloquial"", I'm not -- I don't want to take offense with you, but I think that that's selling it a bit short.  This -- this is a statute where Congress prescribed a notice, prescribed it in statutory terms, did it so people would have an understanding of what their rights were, and did it in a way that no reasonable consumer would understand meant oh, this non-waiverable right is not really to sue in the way that I would ordinarily understand the word, and even that way that courts use it, but actually to -- to do something else.  So I -- I don't think it's colloquial in -- in a disparaging sense.  What it is, is something that is designed to convey a clear meaning, and the clear meaning that it conveys is that you have a right to go to court.  Now, of course, even a disclosure that you have a right to go to court wouldn't be enough to get you over the hump if you didn't also have a provision that made that right non-waiverable.  But again, here, what you have is both.  And -- and in doing that, in writing that statute, Congress was doing exactly what the Court had told it, it didn't do in Gilmer, it didn't do in McMahon, it didn't do in Mitsubishi.  It created a right to a judicial remedy that is not subject to waiver.  Unless the Court has any further questions, I will--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. McConnell, you have ten minutes remaining.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could you in an agreement waive the provisions of 1679g(b) that specify what a court shall consider in awarding punitive damages?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, what -- what if you don't want your arbitrator to consider those four requirements?  Could you waive particular aspects?  I mean, that tells you that -- first of all, it says, of course, ""the Court shall consider"" but I take it your position is when they say ""the Court"", they mean the Court or arbitrator?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, one of those rules of construction is that you don't read statutes when -- to the extent they lead to absurd results.  I think you can still say follow the plain language, but that doesn't mean you go so far as to say you can't enter into a settlement.   ",10-948X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about the argument that the consumer retains the right to sue since they can go into court with their complaint, but it's simply the rule that the court will apply is that you have to proceed to arbitration?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's frequently -- that's frequently the way these issues come up.  I mean, people--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --You cannot be forced to arbitrate either under the agreement or any other provision, they will bring their complaint in court, and then there will be a judicial resolution of whether or not the proceeding should go to arbitration.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.  Mr. Gelernt.     Lee Gelernt  I think, you know, part of what the Court's answer is, it's a practical concern.  That it's just too difficult to have different immunities, and the Court -- so the Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that, and I think from a policy standpoint, a practical standpoint, it's felt that that's the right analysis, and there has to be some way to tether the immunity analysis; and history is ultimately, I think -- what the Court has said it's a necessary though not sufficient, and that once you sort of unmoor it from history, it becomes very difficult to keep the two.  So I think what we're talking about here is a -- a statute that has enormous consequences.  It's third parties who have been cooperative, even, who have done nothing wrong, that end up in jail, and to say that there is going to be absolute immunity is very dangerous.  This Court has repeatedly said that the thumb has to be on the scale against absolute immunity.  That's an extraordinary protection, and if there's anywhere where there needs to not be complete insulation, it would be where you have third parties, and -- who are going to jail.  The only other case, prosecutorial immunity case this Court has had where it was a third party and not the actual defendant was Mitchell, and the Court denied absolute immunity.  All the other cases, some of which you have denied absolute immunity, some of which you have granted, it's been the defendant in the full judicial process.  Here we're talking about third parties after 9-11 who repeatedly went to jail.  I think the allegations are very clear that it's at least but-for -- we think sole -- but certainly far more than dual motive.  People were held -- half the people were held more than 30 days, even though the statutory presumption is 10 days.  Many people were held for months.  They were arrested at gunpoint.  They were not immunized; half the people were never called to testify.  It went on in cities all over the country, people being held under horrendous conditions for long periods of time, interrogated about their own activities.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  General, you have 10 minutes remaining.     ",10-98XX
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  The problem, and it's, I think, the problem that I think Whren highlighted is that the -- the allegation can so readily be made in every case under the material witness statute is that this is one of those bad intent cases, and the case has to proceed so that we can prove that.  One of the ways we prove that is by asking everybody who is involved in the process.  Why did you do this?  What was your intent?  I mean, the whole purpose of Whren is to make sure that kind of stuff doesn't happen.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So every time the prosecutor elects not to call one of these witnesses for a variety of reasons, you would have a claim that this wasn't designed to elicit testimony?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you were writing a law review article, you might have done that.  But we're talking about an officer.  I think the first thing you would do is say, well, let me see these material witness statute cases, and what would he have found?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But, again, you're talking about the officer, he reads the statute and then doesn't say, well, but maybe the statute's unconstitutional, so I need to do more research?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the eight -- eight judges taking the opposite position in the hearing en banc below were just being unreasonable?  It would have been unreasonable for an officer making this determination to agree with eight judges from the Ninth Circuit?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What we said in Wilson, I'm quoting, judges -- when judges disagree on a constitutional question, it is unfair to subject public employees to money damages for picking the losing side of the controversy.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I agree with -- I agree with that, of course, but at the same time, it does seem that you're imposing a very heavy burden on the officers in this area when do you have a situation where eight judges, when they conduct their research, come out the other way.  And that type of burden is particularly heavy when you're talking about if they guess wrong, it comes out of their pocket.  And if I'm the officer in that situation, I say, well, I'm just not going to run the risk of, you know, having to sell the house because I agreed with eight judges on the Court of Appeals.   INTERRUPTING ",10-98XX
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't see how that is pertinent.  What you're saying is they don't have standing to challenge program A because they may also be injured under program B.  Do you have an example of a case where we've held that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, there again, it depends how you phrase their injury.  If you phrase their injury as being subject to surveillance under a particular statutory provision that they think is facially invalid, saying that, well, you're not going to get any relief because you're going to be subject to surveillance under a different provision, I mean, they may say, well, we may, or we may not, but we still have the right to cure the injury of being subject to surveillance under 1881a.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.  Mr. Jaffer.     Jameel Jaffer  --those targets' communications, they collect Americans' international communications.  And when they're collecting Americans' international communications, they are monitoring those communications.  The statute allows the government to acquire them, to retain them, to disseminate them.  It requires -- even if it's not foreign intelligence information, which is, as Justice Breyer says -- recognized, is defined very broadly -- the statute allows the government to disseminate that information, just redacting the Americans' name.  The statute also allows the government to -- to retain evidence of criminal activity.  And for criminal defense lawyers, that's -- that's a -- it's a real issue.  So you're right that -- that our communications are not being targeted, but they are being monitored.  I see my time has expired.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  General Verrilli, you have four minutes remaining.     ",11-1025
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Our cases, of course, say, do say “ certainly impending ”, not “ substantial risk ”.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, let's leave that aside.  You have two arguments; one is likelihood of future injury and the other is present obligations or cause.  I want to focus on the former.  Our standard is certainly impending, and you articulated it by saying, substantial risk.  There is obviously a vast difference between those two.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not enough, of course, to know that the Government is using the statute.  The whole question is whether or not your clients have been injured, not whether the statute's being used.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry, do you want to finish?  If it's all right, could you finish the answer?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, it seems to me that the concern you're talking about is present in every area of practice.  If you're representing someone who is being prosecuted, you don't send an e-mail saying, you know, the government hasn't yet asked where you threw the gun, and we've got to be prepared to answer questions on that because, as you know, that's a real probable.  I mean, you don't send messages like that through the e-mails or just talk casually over the phone either.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the plaintiffs aren't going to be monitored under the statute.  Other people are, and your concern is collateral, that the plaintiffs' discussions might be picked up.  But the plaintiffs are not going to be monitored as targets.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's why I'm saying under your circumstances -- what you said is the Government could come in and say: We're not going to monitor these people.  Under the statute, you can say that today.  The question is whether or not your clients' conversations can be picked up in an incidental way.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1025
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, what if the district court -- this proceeding -- you filed the suggestion of -- of mootness, whatever, and the judge says, okay, I have this suggestion of mootness; I also want to address the certification issue; the mootness argument is scheduled for three months down the road, the certification issue for two months down the road; isn't this just a question of what order the district court wants to address these two issues?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Kennedy.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I don't know that you've answered my question sometime ago, but what -- if the judge can simply order the two determinations in a way that certification is addressed before mootness, does that take care of your problem?  Obviously, if you grant certification, there is an ongoing controversy.  And under Roper and Geraghty if you deny certification the relation back doctrine applies.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, there's no doubt that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I'm sorry.  There's no doubt that that -- in that situation, the case goes forward, right?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, that was not the way the case was presented in the body of the petition and I would suppose, if that were your objection, that it wasn't received, wasn't accepted, we might have heard about that, as you suggest.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And if in fact we thought we were dealing with a case in which the Rule 68 offer was not accepted, we might have thought differently about whether to grant it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You rely on the question presented.  Your reformulated question doesn't have that feature in it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What, what benefit does this -- why are you arguing so much?  You will have an entry of judgment in the favor of your client who is, according to you, simply situated to lots of others.  Why don't you just, if somebody comes forward, just take them in, go in, you get a check for $7500 or whatever it is, you get attorney's fees, and you can do that as often as you want?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I know.  But that's the fortuity of the fact that she didn't accept the offer, and we are dealing perhaps with a case on the record as presented to us where she did accept the offer, if you waive that argument.  So assume the case where the offer is accepted.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It doesn't matter in terms of what the judge is supposed to do with your motion to certify if nobody else is in the case?  I mean, isn't that one of the factors.  I don't know if it's even a sort of good-faith pleading if -- if -- you want certification, but there is no nobody else there.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  We'll hear from Mr. Yang now.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not sure I understand.  You think there is a live case, not if he doesn't cash it, but I guess as Justice Breyer was asking, if it's a day late?  You -- you said, well, there was a past injury, it was a day late, it -- it, you know, could be redressed by telling him what?  Pay him again?  Or--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, you would also have what's usually known as no injury.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think a court has to go through the whole process of a trial if the check is a day late and the employer says, I'm sorry, here's, you know, whatever the interest is on the check?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  Could you directly answer my question about--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Yes.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Or the plaintiff says no -- no standing.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And -- and, as we've said, at every stage of the litigation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you're due -- if you're due $100 from your employer, it's a day late, he gives you $100, and he says, well, here's another dollar for interest, that, as you said, doesn't eliminate the past injury?   INTERRUPTING ",11-1059
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is that -- why is that the case?  I would suppose if there's no materiality, that means that the effect on the market price just happens to be zero.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why isn't that common to all parties?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So at certification you just assume that materiality -- you don't have to show it.  If it's always a common question, you assume it in trying to weigh out the number of -- whether or not common issues predominate or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, you may.  Mr. Frederick.     Melissa Arbus Sherry  --I would make a minor quibble on that.  I would say that the market takes account of all public information, but it only -- it only moves based on material information, so that's exactly right.  And so our issue is not with the predicates for the fraud-on-the-market theory.  Our issue is with Petitioners equating the predicate from the fraud-on-the-market theory with the actual prerequisites of Rule 23.  And this Court made it very clear in Shady Grove that the only question at the Rule 23 stage is whether the prerequisites have been met.  The only one that we're talking about here is predominance.  It's a comparative inquiry between common issues and individual issues.  And if I can quickly go back to my point about countervailing policy concerns, as Petitioners acknowledge, a determination of the class certification stage is not binding on anybody -- in that case on the ultimate fact-finder, or in any other case.  And so the problem with Petitioners' position is that it would require relitigation of the materiality question at the merits stage to the extent the class is certified.  Or if it's not in every other case that is brought on the same issue.  That doesn't serve the efficiency purposes that underlie Rule 23.  The -- in terms of absent class members, he suggests that absent class members would somehow be prejudiced, but as Your Honor, Justice Kagan, pointed out, the only prejudice is that they wouldn't be able to relitigate the very same issue.  That is protected by allowing opt out.  That is protected by Rule 23's adequacy of representation requirement.  And so that's already sufficiently protected.  The most efficient course is to actually focus on common issues.  Materiality is a common issue.  It will result in the same answer for all.  The class rises or falls together.  And class certification is not about only certifying meritorious cases.  In 1966, when the current version of Rule 23(b)(3) was adopted, it was an innovation.  It was a change from the spurious class actions where it was a one-way ratchet, where only the defendant was bound.  In the current rule of Rule 23(b)(3), you want to certify class actions that are both meritorious and those that are not, so it reaches a binding judgment.   John G.

I mean, if you're -- if you're trying to balance, then you say, well, here's an idea, let's give them attorney's fees, but let's not give them costs.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's a very curious way to dilute what was otherwise a defendant-friendly provision.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Finish that sentence.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Blatt.     Lisa S. Blatt  Yeah.  The question, though, was in the case of any successful action when, obviously, they prevailed to begin with, so the question is whether that's superfluous.  But the whole provision overlaps with the court's inherent authority.  And I know it hasn't come up, but I just think it's strange that it says for the purposes of bad faith and harassment, Congress was obviously using belt and suspenders there, so it's not surprising that Congress added “ and costs ” here.  If you look at Rule 54 -- let me just say one other thing, Justice Kagan -- if you look at Rule 54, it also says  ""unless the statute provides otherwise, costs other than attorney's fees. ""  So why -- they didn't have to say that, because in the next provision it talks about attorney's fees.  They just -- they wanted to make clear for whatever reason or maybe they just wrote some really excess, redundant, silly language, but they said costs, meaning anything that's not costs.  It's just that Congress sometimes uses these, and I guess this was the honey and peanut butter thing, that a lot of fee-shifting statutes talk about both attorney's fees and costs, and so they went together and -- they also mentioned it.  Obviously, it's different.  I agree that there's a verb in the first sentence that's mandatory, so it trumps Rule 54.  But with respect to the two objects, Congress was already thinking about attorney's fees and costs anyway and so there's nothing wrong with them saying, in addition to the attorney's fees that you can get in bad faith, once you calculate the attorney's fees reasonable in relation to the work performed, you also get costs.  And the only thing I would say, when we define “ and ” as in addition to, they seem to think that that was an extraordinary reading of the word “ and ”, citing something from something called [dictionaryDOTcom,] and if you just went to [dictionaryDOTcom,] which I had not done before, and you type in “ and ”, the first definition is “ in addition to ”.

Roberts, Jr.  Does it extend to new categories of copyrightable works?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, one way it could, I suppose, is that it shows that Congress is interested in making sure that American authors overseas have reciprocal protection, an issue that could come out in a variety of contexts.  And if I'm sitting there writing a great novel, I will have the confidence that my government will ensure that I get protection when it becomes a bestseller in China; right.   John G.

But it's -- we haven't really required much more than that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  General Verrilli.     Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  I think -- I don't think so, Justice Alito.  I think they could have followed the model nationally of prospective copyright only, and extinguishing the prior copyright, but they didn't make that choice.  They made a different choice.  Now, my friend suggests that the 1790 Act was just a transition, but of course, the same thing is really true in an important sense of section 514.  It's part of a tradition of a transition of the United States into the international system, which has required an adjustment of our rules in order to bring us into conformity with the international system.  And beyond the example of course of the 1790 -- and by the way, with respect to that language in the 1790 copyright who have or have not copyright, that's just a rerun of an argument that the Court rejected in Wheaton v. Peters.  In Wheaton, the Court said that -- that language in the 1790 Act was referring to pre-publication common law copyright, not post-publication common law copyright.  Beyond that, it seems to me pretty clear that what that language is referring to -- of course, Congress presupposes the existence of copyrights, or at least State statutes that created some copyrights -- but what Congress did was act far more broadly.  And -- so I do think -- and then when one looks at the examples of patents -- I think the -- the Oliver Evans example, and that case, is an important example, early in our history.  Congress creates a new patent term to an expired patent.  President Jefferson signs it.  Secretary of State Madison issues it.  Chief Justice Marshall upholds it as a circuit justice, and the Court upholds it against a charge that it's impermissibly burdening people who act in reliance on the expiration of the prior patent.  There wasn't a word in this Court's decision in that case about any potential constitutional infirmity with doing that.  And one would think if this was such a significant and viable principle of constitutional law, that someone would have brought it up in those cases.  In fact, the striking thing about reading the Evans decision is that the Court clearly looks at this all as a matter of legislative policy judgment.  It says, you know yes, you're right, it might have been an argument, a good argument in favor of creating some reliance interest here, but that's a judgment Congress should have made if anybody was going to make it.  It didn't -- and there is no reading of the -- there is no required reading of that statute that has to protect the reliance party.  So I don't -- I just think when you look at the patent protection, when you look at the 1790 Act, when you consider the fact that when Congress expands exclusive rights, as it did for example with respect to musical compositions but did in the 1976 Act with respect to lots of exclusive rights, it does so with existing copyrights.  And all of that points up to the wisdom of what this court said in Eldred, that within very wide margins, these are matters where legislative choice, these are policy calls that require the balancing of a complex set of interests, the drawing of a complex set of lines made even more complex by virtue of the fact that we are now trying to make a transition into full participation in an international system, which is of vital importance to protecting one of our most valuable economic exports, intellectual property.

It's a different analysis if your claim is the government should open up a park as a public forum, than if it's been a public forum for 200 years and the government decides to close it down.  Maybe they can do it but it's a different question.  So why isn't this a different question, whether they can extend copyright protection that's already there?   John G.

Manning  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Congress in two ways signaled its intention to treat the time limitation prescribed by subsection (a)(3) as absolute, that is as not subject to waiver and not subject to equitable tolling.  First, Congress chose to locate that provision in the very part of the statute that defines the board's jurisdiction, that is to say, in the part that determines the class--   John G.

On the other hand, I believe that if the statute is not jurisdictional, it's subject to equitable tolling; under Irwin, the presumption of equitable tolling applies; and, it's very difficult to see how the Secretary is warranted in narrowing equitable tolling beyond the traditional grounds on which equitable tolling would be available.

""  ""Complete plan details are contained in a legal plan document. ""  ""If there is any difference between the information in the summary and the legal plan, the legal plan document -- the legal plan document will govern. ""  So when you had the summary, you were on notice that if there were any difference between it and the plan, the plan would govern.  You received a copy of the plan in June of 2012.  Okay?  And as late as August 29th of 2012, two and a half months afterward, you filed a Joint Appendix that didn't -- didn't contain the provision that you say now governs.  So why shouldn't you be held to have waived that?

""  Do you think that's the right standard?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What this Court -- Court has always said, if it's an Article 3 inquiry under standing, and it said that it's not supported by injury that is speculative or conjectural.  It seems to me when you start talking about, well, the Scottish court might do this or the Alabama courts might do this, that -- that sounds pretty speculative and conjectural.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So do you think it's -- I mean, I know you've got a laundry list of things, but, as I understand it, you think it's enough that if the Court issues an opinion, the Scottish court might do something as a result of that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought one of the arguments, maybe it was the Petitioner's and not yours, was that one reason it wasn't moot is because the Scottish courts might look at the case differently.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Cullen.     Stephen J. Cullen  --The mother can get on the plane when she is allowed to get on the plane, and in this particular case, probably because she had to come in under humanitarian parole, there was considerable urgency in this case.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's not quite fair to say we haven't decided whether we're going to appeal.  I mean, the -- the stay motion was made immediately upon the determination of the merits by the district court, and the district court said no.  So, I mean, didn't they do everything they could have done to -- to get a stay?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's out of respect to the district judge, who's just issued a ruling on the merits.  I mean, saying, you know, we have to consider your -- your ruling; not, you know, we're taking you up right away.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It seems to me, and I may be taking the opposite position from one of my colleagues, but the -- the best thing is to hold things up briefly, so that the child doesn't go overseas and then have to be brought back, particularly if you have situations where there can be an expeditious appeal.  And I think most appellate courts would appreciate the -- the benefit of that.  It seems to me, if you -- if you're correct that the decision is moot, it's not going to be a -- there is going to be a rush to judgment by the individual that wants to take the child away.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So everything turns, under your view, on whether or not the district court gives the losing party the 48-hour stay or whether the mother in this case decides to stay in the United States until the U.S. proceedings are done.  The incentives if you prevail are for the custodial or the parent with control over the child to leave immediately.  Even after a motion has been filed -- if a motion for a stay has been filed, that's not a stay.  Get on the first plane out and then you're home free.  That seems to me to be a very unfortunate result.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  I know.  But the point is that the other side says that the decision was wrong.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And, you know, most -- not most, but many district judges don't like to immediately say after they have issued a decision, well, there is a good likelihood that I'm wrong, and therefore, I'll issue a stay.  [Laughter]  So there has to be at least a period before somebody can go up to the Court of Appeals and get a stay, and if you're right, what's happening during that 48 hours or 24 hours is that the parent with control of the child is trying to find the first flight out and once she does, it's all over.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that was because at that point there was an exception to the exception of sovereign immunity.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you're going even a step further to say you get the benefit of the unequivocal test that you've set forth at even the next stage.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You've already -- you've already used up your benefit of an unequivocal requirement when you've got the interpretation of the FTCA itself, which is the waiver of sovereign immunity.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Wait a minute.  You agree with me that you don't get the benefit of your higher standard of interpretation with respect to 2680(h)?   INTERRUPTING John G.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, about that argument, you rely very heavily on the fact that Justice Harlan used the term ""ambiguous"", right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But he was writing very much in a pre-Chevron world.  I -- he was certainly not on notice that that was a term of art or would become a term of art.  And of course, I didn't know him, but my sense is he was very gracious and polite.  And you can see him saying: Well, that's a good argument, but.  He's not the sort of person who would say:  ""This is it, this is it. ""  I don't think you necessarily can take the use of the word ""unambiguous"" in his opinion to mean what it does today.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there -- is there a case where we applied Chevron deference to a pre-Chevron opinion, in other words saying, well, the Court looked at that but the Court said it was ambiguous and so we apply Chevron.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, yes, that's the general principle.  But the point you made just a few moments ago is -- I think is responsive to that, which is: We're not talking about the merits; we're talking about a statute of limitation.

Roberts, Jr.  So does that mean -- the last footnote in the Solicitor General's brief talks about some other methods, including a urine sample.  Not as accurate as blood, but it can help achieve the same result.  One of the things that I think affects the view in this case is it's a pretty scary image of somebody restrained, and, you know, a representative of the State approaching them with a needle.  But I take it you would say you need a search warrant for a urine sample, too?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John G.

You just send in this thing, the judge does it in an instant, it doesn't take very long at all.

Roberts, Jr.  Just to nail it down, your position is that there is no limit in the Federal Constitution on what the agency can demand as a condition for the issuance of a permit?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the Takings Clause does not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure it would have been.  Sure it would have been if they just went along -- to a landowner and the landowner is there minding his own business and they say, well, you own some property, so give us a 1 million dollars to build a football stadium.  That would be -- that would be unconstitutional, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  One of the things the Federal provision, the Takings Clause, is designed to prevent property owners from having to bear the costs that should be borne by the people as a whole.  The football stadium example.  There is no reason that a particular landowner should have to pay for the football stadium simply because he owns property.  The Takings Clause was designed to make sure that those exactions are not imposed on property owners but spread more evenly across the citizens who benefit from it.  And I guess I don't understand why you say that the Takings Clause is the one provision that doesn't apply in that type of situation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The generally applicable regulation in the football stadium hypothetical is not generally applicable.  It says, You are the owner of this property, and if you want to develop it, you've got to build a football stadium.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think that your point goes to the question that has been raised about -- there's no permit issued.  He didn't accept the permit.  And I don't understand that proposition.  Are you saying that if you are confronted with an unconstitutional condition, you have to accept it, and then you can challenge it?  You can't simply say you denied that on the basis of an unconstitutional condition, and that's wrong?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  I'm trying to get to the Federal.  You often fall back to the State provisions.  I'm looking at the Federal Constitution, and assuming the State provisions give you no relief, is it your position that he has no claim unless he accepts a permit with unconstitutional conditions?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Wolfson.  Mr. Kneedler?     John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about -- what about the football stadium?  Do they -- can you pick a particular landowner?  I mean, you took a case in which there is no question under Nollan and Dolan about the relationship, proportionality, and nexus.  Let's put those to one side because the issue is whether Nollan and Dolan apply.  Can the government say, okay, you want a permit, we will give you the permit if you fund the new football stadium?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the one constitutional provision that is concerned with protecting property owners from having to bear burdens that should be borne by the public at large is not applicable?   INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Would your position be the same if the issue were not the amount sought but rather the substantive claims?  Say there are two different claims the class member -- the class could raise.  One would yield damages of $4,900,000.  The other would yield damages of $10 million.  Do you have the same objection in a case in which the prospective representative only pleads the first claim?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but you do seem to have a difficulty with your position about how far it goes.  You make the point in your briefs about the statute of limitations question.  In other words, it's not just how much they claim, but where they decide to cut off the statute of limitations and so forth.  It seems to me that it's a bit of a slippery slope if you start saying we're going to look at what the class could recover in deciding whether or not, not simply whether or not this representative is adequate, but whether or not it's below or above, above or below $5 million.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your approach leads to particularly perverse results.  You're at the position of arguing that, you know, they are seeking less than $5 million, but we're responsible for a lot more damage than that.  And of course, you don't concede it, but you do say: If in fact we're liable, the damages are going to be a lot greater.  I assume that admission could be used against you under principles of judicial estoppel.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let's go by seniority.  Justice Alito.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you're assuming that it's a bad thing for the class members to have their claims limited.

Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Frederick?     David C. Frederick  --Sure.  In his hypothetical, that's true under Federal rules, too.  If you're applying Federal Rule 23 and you have a large number of class members and the case gets settled for X dollars, the individual class member is held to the duty of deciding whether to opt out because that individual class member thinks I may have been able to get more than what is being offered in this class settlement or to attack the adequacy of the representation because the aggregate amount is not high enough.  It's a problem that applies in both Federal and in State court.  It's not unique to State court at all.  If the Court has no further questions, we'll submit.   John G.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if you had a case where a lawyer brings an action in Miller County and says: I want to represent the class of people with these claims and these claims, whose names begin with A to K.  It turns out that's $4 million.  And in the next county, at the same time, he files a case saying, I'd like to represent these people whose names begin L to Z.  In each of those cases, it's $4 million.  I take it you don't have any objection to that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But is a counsel who proceeds on that basis, is there any reason to question his adequacy, let's say he's fully representing, bringing all the claims and all the damages.  He's just decided to break it up from A to K.  Somebody from L is not going to say: Well, he's inadequate when he's representing him just because he could have represented everybody in the other action.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you realize, of course, you are on pretty thin ice.  You are talking about a Senate Report and now you are talking about proposals that weren't enacted.  Your friend on the other side focuses on the statutory language which tells you how to find out how much is at stake.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Another thing he might be worried about is that if this actions is allowed to proceed, although on its face it's worth $4 million, they're going to have to make a determination whether to settle for a particular amount or not.  And if they make a determination that they've got to settle for whatever it is, 20 -- you know, $20 per class member, that is going to set the limit for other classes, including the class members who opt out of this action, the class members from Missouri.  And the point is that, for a variety of reasons, that this gives extraordinary leverage to the individual class representative of a sort that -- precisely the sort that Congress was worried about.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's going to be worth a lot more, because if you go to trial, you're going to have a judgment that they should have been giving the general contractor whatever--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --pickup it is in every case.  And so that is going to be extremely valuable.  It's going to be worth a lot more -- but the downside, it's going to be a lot more than $5 million.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's very difficult -- one reason, it's very difficult to speculate about Congress, what they speculate about what they would have intended.  Presumably, they may not have thought about the idea that there will be class actions worth a lot more than $5 million, but the plaintiff's lawyer will only ask for less than $5 million.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why did you decide to file in Miller County?   ",11-1450
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I mean, it's often the case that -- that children don't want to go into the family business and it's often the case that some of them do and some of them don't and the idea that one of the children who wants to put the money back in the family business is -- you know, you wouldn't think that was wrong when the other children want to take the money out or put it somewhere else.  That's not at all unusual.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But there is a shortage of accounts at the end of the day.  It's just a question of what day it is.  When he takes -- takes the stuff and it's a lost -- it's either viewed as a lost opportunity or an increase in the risk to the beneficiary, and that's a loss to them at that point.  The fact -- it's like a bank robber giving back the money.  There is no loss to the bank, but it's still crime.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Bensinger?     Curtis E. Gannon  Well, we certainly do think that that may well be the ultimate answer.  We think that would be further away from the core of defalcation, but it's not this case, so we would urge the Court to affirm.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  I understood your answer to Justice Kagan to be that you -- there must be a loss, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  Does there have to be a loss for there to be a defalcation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So taking the money out is sufficient for defalcation even if it's brought back in full and even if there is no lost opportunity.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But there is still a loss.  I mean, when you're investing obviously the return is part of it, but also the question is what risk you assume.  And the trust would have suffered because during that period they were incurring a greater risk.  That's one reason you set up a trust, so you don't -- you protect people from that risk.   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your understanding of jurisdiction and what you're arguing for today is nothing more or less than this is a provision as to which Congress did not give the agency law-making authority.  You do not defer to the agency with respect to this provision because it's outside its jurisdiction in the sense that it gets deference.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  All right.  Now, the reason -- the reason we are hearing all about jurisdiction and it's kind of dressed up--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --is simply because the means by which Congress made clear it was not giving the FCC authority to get deference, however that is phrased, is this 7(a) which speaks about nothing will limit the authority of the States.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If it weren't for that, if it were some other type of provision, we wouldn't call it jurisdiction, but we would just say the FCC doesn't get deference to it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  General Verrilli?     Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  You've analyzed that under Step 2 of Chevron, Justice Sotomayor.  You decided the permissible construction of the statute, whether it's reasonable or whether it's arbitrary and capricious, that would depend on what the record looked like.  But certainly, a court would exercise review over that matter.  If the Court has nothing further?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.  Mr. Goldstein, you have 4 minutes remaining.   ",11-1545
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's right, but your argument it seems to me can't be -- let's say you have a general statute and you've got a provision at the beginning that says this is -- authority to interpret this is delegated to the agency.  And you go along, but then all of a sudden in, you know, section 123 it says it doesn't get any deference interpreting this provision.  Now, you would not say that the first general one controls the specific withdrawal of deference, would you?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, you would say you don't get deference on 123.  And as I understand the case, and that's why I persist in thinking there's no great disagreement here, your friend on the other side is saying that, particularly given 7(a) and some other things, you should read 7(b)(2) as if Congress had said: Agency, you don't get any deference here.  You can read it that way, they say, because 7(a) says nothing shall limit what the State can do other than what's here in the statute.  And if you let the FCC, if you give them deference, you're letting something else limit what the State can do.  So why -- and then you dispute, it seems to me, just whether that you should call that jurisdiction or not, because people think of jurisdiction as meaning, oh, you don't get through the door.  But if what they mean by jurisdiction is simply that the agency gets no deference on this point, then it seems to me everybody's saying the same thing.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ambiguity in the provision that says, agency, you get no deference, or ambiguity in the substantive provision at issue?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but if there's no ambiguity on the provision that says you get no deference, then it doesn't matter whether there's ambiguity on the subsidiary one, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right, well--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Your friend on the other side has another set of arguments about why you should treat this particular provision differently, and that is because it concerns the authority, or lack thereof, of state and local government agencies.  Now, does that play any role at all in your analysis?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We are not talk -- you know, obviously the dividing line between state authority and federal authority is a more significant one than some of the other questions as to which agencies get deference, which is whether rates are reasonable or not reasonable.  And this provision is written in terms of the preservation of state authority.  And your view would give the federal agency deference under Chevron, very considerable deference, in defining when there should be federal authority and when there should be state.  Is that at all a pertinent consideration?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Normal -- I'm sorry I interrupt you, but the normal rules of statutory construction include a clear statement rule?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Who has that -- who has to be clear on their statement?  Which way?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That it intended to intrude upon state authority?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, it wasn't going to be that.  That -- the idea that there is no difference between the federal judiciary defining the limits between state and federal power, and having an agency of unelected bureaucrats responsible to the executive saying when the state controls and when the federal controls, those are vastly different propositions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it also said, it also said in (7)(a) that those are the only limits, not add on to this any limits that unelected bureaucrats might decide to impose, and will give them -- and the courts must give them vast deference in enforcing those limits.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it AT&T versus--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But in rejecting that argument in Section 2 of the opinion, the author of that opinion in nowhere, in no place applied Chevron deference in answering that question.  It was entirely de novo, unlike in Section 3 when it was finally decided, Okay, we've got the answer here and now we will defer to the agency on the substance of the determination.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does it cite--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --in Part 2, which is--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten pages of analysis of the Chevron case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does it say they are applying Chevron deference?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're talking about (7)(B).   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is there about (7)(A) that you think is ambiguous?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but your argument there is basically saying when the statute says something is reasonable, it means that the Commission doesn't have -- it's a jurisdictional question whether it's reasonable or unreasonable.  But it seems to me that this provision is quite a bit different.  It talks about the authority of a State.  And usually when we are talking about the authority of which entity can govern, we view that as jurisdictional.  There may well be cases at the margin that are -- that are difficult.  But your argument is basically reasonable or unreasonable is the same as State or Federal.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, I'm not talking about the federalism values.  I'm talking about your argument that, oh, once you say you can draw a jurisdictional line here, people will argue you can draw it everywhere.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's exactly right.  That limits it.  And -- and the question then is of course whether that's enforced in court -- enforced in court or before the agency.  Right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Whether the standard is defined in -- by direct judicial review or by the agency, with deference to the agency.   ",11-1545

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, some -- some time ago, I thought you were just about to tell us how much money the city says will be at stake if you prevail.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And -- the city says that's the total amount that's at issue if you prevail, if the taxpayers prevail on this claim.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there an easier thing to administer than the system that was struck down in Allegheny Pittsburgh?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  When you paid, that's what your assessment was.  And they argued well, this is easy; that's enough.  And this Court said no; it's an equal protection violation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Stancil.  Mr. Clement.     Paul D. Clement  --Well, I think the one -- I don't think there is a demographic difference.  I think the one concrete difference that really is a difference is from the city's perspective, they are looking at two groups all of whom are going to have to pay a new higher monthly fee; and I think they can a rational decision that says look, you know, one of these groups has to make two monthly payments to the city for sewer and water.  That seems a little crazy.  So why are we -- what we will do is we will just make everybody in the city in terms of or their ongoing payments to the city for sewer and water, we will treat them all exactly the same.  One fee.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Stancil, you have 4 minutes remaining.     ",11-161X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's simply because, as we said in Allegheny Pittsburgh, the basis for considering the equal protection claim is the rights that you're given under State law.  In Allegheny Pittsburgh it says you have the right to be treated equally with respect to assessments.  And you weren't.  Here the law says you have the right to be treated equally, or whatever it is, the apportionment, and they weren't.  All that you're saying there is that State law gets to set the base.  And if the State law says, we don't treat people the same in extending sewer hook-ups, then that takes away your equal protection clause.  But it just sets the base.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The change in policy -- the change in policy is from treating people equally to treating people unequally.  I don't see how the fact that they are changing that policy addresses the issue at all.  They're going from a system where everybody was subject to the same assessment to a system where some paid something and other people paid 30 times that.  Yes, it's a change, but it's the change that presents the problem.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And the city retains that option in this case going forward.  The problem with your reality is you are dealing with a situation, you are saying well, here's a violation and the law can -- and what does the law do?  The truth is this is exactly 180 degrees away.  There is no violation and the law creates the violation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think you are dealing with an entirely different case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Excuse me.  I don't see the answer to Justice Scalia's question.  You are saying this would be a rational system going forward, but you also promised the people that they would be treated equally over a certain period.  When you start out it's not equal, because somebody pays $400 and somebody else pays 10,000, and -- but over the 30-year period, it's the same.  That's why it's equal in the beginning, even though somebody pays 400 and somebody pays 10,000, because they are going to pay the same over the period.  Then you lop off the period.  So you are not treating them equally, when you started.  You can no longer say, don't worry about the inequality, it will sort out in 30 years.  Now you can't -- you have no way of telling them why it's not unequal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  There is a provision -- you said I would search in vein for this provision in the Barrett Law.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I went and searched and 15--  [Laughter]  --15(b)(3) says: The costs shall be primarily apportioned equally among all abutting lands or lots.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It says costs.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where -- where do I look to find that when they say the costs shall be apportioned equally, they are not referring to the costs, but they were referring to the assessments?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The costs of the project are funded by the -- the sewer hook-ups, and some people pay 400 and some people paid 10,000.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You just said it's not popularity.  In page 1 of your brief you say the Barrett Law method eventually proved to be politically unpopular.  Sounds like it's popularity to me.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You -- you mentioned Heckler v. Mathews.  In Heckler v. Mathews, the Court said, quote:  ""Ordinarily, extension of the withheld benefit rather than nullification is the proper course. ""   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So while it is true that you can cure a violation by levelling up or levelling down, ordinarily, extension of the benefit is the proper course.  And that's for the reason Justice Scalia gave, because otherwise, there would be no equal protection case brought.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what wrong -- what did the Court mean when they said  ""ordinarily, extension is the proper course? ""   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  When -- when you say ""the other case"", do you mean every other project?  Because that's what, a class action; right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if everybody -- if everybody entitled to a refund came forward, it would cost you $2.7 million.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  3, $3 million.  And you say the real problem is the huge administrative costs in trying to figure out who you owe it to.  If it's that huge, all they do is -- who somebody comes forward, asks for a refund, verify that they are a -- you know, were a homeowner on the project, give them the refund.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The most it's going to cost is $3 million.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Amnesty -- I don't get -- amnesty is entirely different.  Amnesty is for people who did something wrong.  Nobody did something wrong here; it wasn't wrong to pay with installments.  So the amnesty -- don't apply.   INTERRUPTING ",11-161X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't that -- isn't that pretty much what he bargained for when he insisted upon security before giving the loan?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you're depriving the secured creditor of the opportunity to hold on to the asset, because he thinks it is, for perhaps a short period, unreasonably devalued.  Right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Did I cut off your answer to Justice Alito?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, this is a case, though, where you would not want the asset sold.  In other words, looking at it he thinks for particular unusual situations, this is vastly undervalued; I am holding an asset that is going to appreciate if I hold onto it.  So he doesn't want the asset sold.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is the doubtless equivalent of his claim?  Measured by the current market conditions, or does that include some premium based on the assumption that it's going to increase in value over some period?   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Or -- or he is entitled to realize the indubitable equivalent of his claims.  You really do just kind of elide the fact that the statute says ""or"".   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your -- your friend on the other side suggests that (ii) and (iii) address different ways of protecting the secured creditor.  (ii) is procedural, right?  You can go through these procedures and you can cram down so long as you are going through these procedures, which include credit bidding, or you can cram down if you ensure that he receives the indubitable equivalent, a substantive protection.  What is wrong with that reading?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but there is, of course, a good reason which is consistent with the policy of the Bankruptcy Code, which is you do want to look out for the other creditors as well.  And if the secured creditor is getting indubitably the value of this security, why don't you weigh in the balance at least the interests of the other creditors?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, maybe in this particular case, but that's not going to be true in every case and we are asked to issue a ruling that is going to apply in every case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I know, but the whole premise of why this problem arises is that the security is worth a lot less than -- than it was obviously when it was purchased.  Or a lot less than -- a lot less than the claim that it was meant to secure.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How does it work in practice?  Is this something that is subject of extensive negotiation?  The secured creditor says, well, I'm interested in bidding in a credit bid, but I appreciate that that's going to make it difficult for you to get cash.  And you've got these unsecured creditors who would want -- and so, what?  I'm not going to credit bid, so long as -- or I will only credit bid up to this particular amount; or, let's sit down and work out a deal, negotiate over exactly how we're going to handle my security.  Is that really how it happens, or is that not -- or not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You said earlier we have never said that the specific has to be a subset of the general.  How -- how would it otherwise be specific, and the one general?  It seems if they are not a subset, then they are alternatives.  I don't see how the whole doctrine makes any sense if the specific is not a subset of the general.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So when we say our doctrine says the specific controls over the general, the specific is a subset of the general?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. Harrington.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You have got a whole cadre of U.S. trustees that presumably can look out for the interests of the poor United States.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought we were worried about the situation where it's a creditor.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In those cases, of course, the trustee's there, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but of course it could bid up if it thinks that there are going to be other bidders, right?  It has a lot more flexibility than the other bidders to -- to the extent of its security interest.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That just begs the question.  Congress gave them a right -- I mean, that's what we are deciding, right?   ",11-166X

Now, that does seem to expand beyond the Federal government's determination about the types of sanctions that should govern the employment relationship.  You talk about supply and demand.  The Federal government, of course, prohibits the employment, but it also imposes sanctions with respect to application for work.  And the State of Arizona, in this case, is imposing some significantly greater sanctions.   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Before you get into what the case is about, I'd like to clear up at the outset what it's not about.  No part of your argument has to do with racial or ethnic profiling, does it?  I saw none of that in your brief.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So this is not a case about ethnic profiling.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if that state does -- well, that's a question of enforcement priorities.  Well, let's say that the government had a different set of enforcement priorities, and their objective was to protect to the maximum extent possible the borders; and, so anyone who is here illegally, they want to know about and they want to do something about, in other words, different than the current policy.  Does that mean in that situation the Arizona law would not be preemptive?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but you say that the Federal Government has to have control over who to prosecute, but I don't see how Section 2(B) says anything about that at all.  All it does is notify the Federal Government, here's someone who is here illegally, here's someone who is removable.  The discretion to prosecute for Federal immigration offenses rests entirely with the Attorney General.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  So apart from section 3 and section 5, take those off the table, you have no objection to section 2.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Exactly.  The Federal Government has to decide where it's going to use its resources.  And what the state is saying, here are people who are here in violation of Federal law, you make the decision.  And if your decision is you don't want to prosecute those people, fine, that's entirely up to you.  That's why I don't see the problem with section 2(B).   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Only under section 3 and section 5.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let's say you're worried about--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --There you go.  Right.  For the notification, what could possibly be wrong if Arizona arrests someone, let's say for drunk driving, and their policy is you're going to stay in jail overnight no matter what, okay, what's wrong during that period by having the Arizona arresting officer say, I'm going to call the Federal agency and find out if this person is here illegally, because the Federal law says the Federal agency has to answer my question?  It seems an odd argument to say the Federal agency has to answer the state's question, but the state can't ask it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You think there are individual cases in which the state can call the Federal Government and say: Is this person here illegally?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So doesn't that defeat the facial challenge to the Act?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It is--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --It is not an effort to enforce Federal law.  It is an effort to let you know about violations of Federal law.  Whether or not to enforce them is still entirely up to you.  If you don't want to do this, you just tell the person at LESC -- if that's the right -- is that the right acronym?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --LESC, look, when somebody from Arizona calls, answer their question, and don't even bother to write it down.  Okay?  I stopped somebody else, is he legal or illegal, let me check -- it's, oh, he's illegal.  Okay, thanks, good-bye.  I mean, why -- it is still your decision.  And if you don't want to know who is in this country illegally, you don't have to.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Under 2(B), the person is already stopped for some other reason.  He's stopped for going 60 in a 20.  He's stopped for drunk driving.  So that decision to stop the individual has nothing to do with immigration law at all.  All that has to do with immigration law is the -- whether or not they can ask the Federal Government to find out if this person is illegal or not, and then leave it up to you.  It seems to me that the Federal Government just doesn't want to know who is here illegally or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if they just rolled in Whiting?  [Laughter]  That's a pretty good one.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  General, you have been trying valiantly to get us to focus on section 3, so maybe we should let you do that now.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, keep going.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I had a little -- wasn't sure about your answer to Justice Kennedy.  Is the reason that the government is not focused on people who are here illegally as opposed to the other categories we were talking about because of prioritization or because of lack of resources?  You suggested that if the -- every illegal alien that you identify is either removed or prosecuted, that that would cause tensions with other governments.  So I -- I don't understand if it's because you don't have enough resources or because you don't want to prosecute the people who are simply here illegally as opposed to something else.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And your concern is the problems that would arise in bilateral relations if you remove all of these people, or a significant percentage or a greater percentage than you are now.  Nothing in the law requires you to do that.  All it does is lets you know where -- that an illegal alien has been arrested, and you can decide, we are not going to initiate removal proceedings against that individual.  It doesn't require you to remove one more person than you would like to remove under your priorities.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that arises under 3 and 5.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But not 2.

Roberts, Jr.  --Thank you, Counsel.  Ms. Harrington.     Sarah E. Harrington  Well, we raised an exhaustion argument as an alternative ground before the district court.  The district court construed this case as seeking review of the board's decision, not seeking review of the agency's decision.  Petitioner did not challenge that district court holding before the circuit in her opening brief.  She didn't flag that as issue in the cert petition papers, and so I think, although now she's suggested in the merits briefing that this case -- this Court maybe should really just decide whether she's seeking review of the agency decision instead of the board decision, in our view that's not really a question that is presented in -- in the case any longer.  In our view she is seeking review over the board decision, the board decision decided that her appeal was untimely, that there wasn't good cause to excuse the untimeliness.  There is no indication anywhere in the statute that Congress would have wanted that kind of board decision to be reviewed anywhere other than the Federal Circuit.  And so in our view it does not fall within -- in the exception to exclusive Federal Circuit jurisdiction provided in (b)(2) because it does not decide the issue of discrimination.

I mean, we think of a -- we review cases on procedural objections all the time and we think of those as judicially reviewable.  It's -- it's a real stretch to say simply because it says “ judicially reviewable ” it means judicially reviewable on the merits.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could you say that again?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  A little more slowly.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  It's subject to judicial review.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, the next--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Okay.  So I thought that your argument in the brief reduced to the question that an action subject to judicial review in one section is not judicially reviewable in another.  That's right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  More slowly.

Roberts, Jr.  --even if I accept your argument that that's not the same as subject to judicial review, isn't it an odd backhanded way to get to your position?  This is not something about -- a provision about what's judicially reviewable and what's not.  It's a notice provision.  It says these actions have to be filed within 30 days after notice of judicial review.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And then you say that judicial reviewability is the key linchpin that bases your argument, when it's really just in a sentence about notice.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, yes, that's where the phrase comes in, but it does seem an odd way to establish that that is the critical element that tells you which provisions you can take forward when it just says your time is 30 days after you get notice of judicial review.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And here the government says, aha, judicial review, we think that does not mean subject to judicial review.

Because I look at the government's brief and they have fairly extensive analysis of -- of the error, why they think it's not important, why they -- you know.  But I don't see them saying you don't look at the error at all.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, exactly.  In other words you look at the prejudicial effect of the erroneous admitted evidence and see if that altered the outcome.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  They say, immediately after the sentence you gave us, they say  ""looking at the evidence as a whole. ""   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you,--  Mr. Brindley.  Mr. Yang.     Anthony A.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You are going over the evidence.  And I may simply be asking the same question Justice Kennedy asked earlier.  But let's say you have a situation where it's the same thing, and at the -- you, know, and improperly admitted evidence has the defendant saying:  ""I'm guilty. ""  And the evidence is the same as all you've set forth at pages 2 through 9, very complicated, who's driving what, you know, kind of car and where they are meeting.  And the jury goes out and comes back in two minutes: You know, the guy said he was guilty.  Is that a situation in which we are supposed to then go back, look at all the complicated evidence and see if a jury would have convicted?  Or can we with a fair degree of confidence say that the error is what led the jury to convict?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, when you began, if I'm remembering correctly, you said there were two ways in which your position was different from Mr. Brindley's.   John G.

Clement  I would start by citing -- I know it's not always in fashion to cite lower court opinions, but I would start by citing Judge Posner's opinion in Yi, because the Seventh Circuit there, a, a very distinguished panel, Judge Posner, Judge Wood, and one other judge, the three of them considered this question -- Judge Sykes, I'm sorry; it slipped my mind, a very distinguished judge.  [Laughter]  The -- it -- the point being that he said along these lines that the 70 years of history makes a significant difference.  And here's the thing.  Just like you expect an agency to confront a change of position, you would at least expect an agency to confront the retroactive consequences and in that sense address them and make sense of it.  And I would just simply say this, which is if you had a rulemaking you could bring in all of the affected parties, including the current sales representatives, who are not the ones bringing these lawsuits, whose jobs are going to be changed, and you could make a comprehensive view, as opposed to just getting one side of an ongoing litigation and then making a decision about an amicus brief.

And the next guy comes in from the other company and he says: Okay, when it comes up I'll think of your product.  Are those two sales or no sale?   John G.

I mean, there are many things that people know about themselves that are objectively verifiable where Congress would have an interest in protecting.  High school diploma.  It is a crime to state that you have a high school diploma if you know that you don't.  That's something you can check pretty easily.  And Congress can say: We want people to finish high school.  It's a big thing to have a high school diploma.  So we want to make sure nobody goes around saying they do when they don't.  What about that case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The substantial interest is the one that I've just said.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I want to follow up on Justice Scalia's question, because I'm not sure I understood.  The government's position is that there is no First Amendment value in a false representation of fact, by which I understand you to mean not parody or something like that, but a statement that's intended to be understood as true.  There is no First Amendment value in that statement.  It may be protected because of the ""breathing space"" argument, but in whatever context, in whatever guise, there is no protection in that false representation as such.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose it might have something to do with, whether called collateral or not, I mean, I would think the concern in the midst of a political campaign is you have the U.S. attorney or the deputy district attorney bringing a -- filing a prosecution of someone 2 weeks before the election saying, you lied about this or that and maybe there would have to be a deposition or maybe there would have to be a trial.  Nothing like that is involved here.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Verrilli.  Mr. Libby.     Jonathan D.

You want to make it as narrow as possible, because, again, we're supposed to start from the presumption that we -- we have the right to say pretty much what we want to say, and then we start to limit it where.  Again -- and, I guess, it goes again back to what this Court said in Stevens and Entertainment Merchants, which is, is it one of these historically unprotected types of speech that is not entitled to constitutional protection?

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, not exaggerate -- lie.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that was for literary purposes.  No one is suggesting you can't write a book or tell a story about somebody who earned a Medal of Honor and it's a fictional character, so he obviously didn't.  It just seems to me very different.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's not a statement about one's self.  This is--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Excuse me.  Sorry.  [Laughter]  Seems to me that the Stolen Valor Act is more narrow than that.  And I would say, in that situation, you would not describe what the individual in Justice Breyer's hypothetical was as simply telling a false statement about himself.  It is about whether there is someone hiding in the attic.  It is not about himself.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In order to--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --It seems to me that that's missing the limitation that the government has read into this statute: Not damage, not for parody, not to avoid the discovery of someone who should be hidden, not in order to do something with respect to one's grandson.  It's just a purely false statement about one's self.  What -- what -- what is the First Amendment value in that, again?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, of course they do in countless areas, the state does, whether you're talking about defamation, trademark, perjury, all sorts of things.  You can't adopt that as a general principle and apply it without regard to the situation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't understand the government to argue that the speech at issue here is totally unprotected.  I understand them to argue -- I mean, it is totally unprotected.  I understand them to argue that it can be limited under its ""breathing space"" rationale.  In other words, it's not within one of the categories of totally unprotected speech.  You do have to analyze it under the First Amendment and you analyze it to determine if it chills protected speech.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, not under your theory, right?  I mean, it's still a sanction for telling something that you say is protected under the First Amendment, whether you get 6 months or a Medal of Shame doesn't matter under your theory.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do we -- how do we know that?  He was politically active, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Doesn't it help a politician to have a Congressional Medal of Honor?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it seems to me that your willingness to say that this statute is valid so long as there's some benefit to the person who lies, it's an awfully big concession.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if he -- so if he makes this statement at a debate when he's running for office, then you can prosecute him, because getting the office is presumably something of value.  It presumably has some pecuniary aspect to it.   ",11-210X

Roberts, Jr.  Could I say, just for a moment, let's suppose the tribe -- the -- Mr. Patchak brings a nuisance action against the tribe for running a casino and imposing all these difficulties on the surrounding previously rural community.  He says this is a nuisance.  And the tribe answers and says: No, we can do this under the Indian Gaming Regulation Act.  And Patchak then says: Well, no, because you don't have valid authority under that Act because the Secretary shouldn't have taken the land into title.  Now, that is not a quiet title action.  That is a nuisance action.  Can he have that adjudicated in that suit?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right, right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  But there'd be no--   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  He was arrested later, when approached by the Secret Service agent, lied about whether he touched the Vice President; at that time, in a non-protected area, was carrying a bag, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And wandering around.  Turns out that he was looking for his son.  But if you're the Secret Service agent, you see somebody who said your policies are disgusting, that person touches the Vice President, he comes -- he lies to you.  He comes back, he's carrying a bag and he's wondering -- wandering around, do you think it's reasonable at that -- well, I guess you don't--  [Laughter]  To arrest the person?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The reason it's multi-faceted is because I'm trying to capture what might have been going through the Secret Service agent's mind at the time.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what was going in a reasonable Secret Service's agent's mind at the time.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what you have under your theory, a person should put on his car a bumper sticker that says ""I hate the police"" and every time they are pulled over they will have certainly a plausible case is you violated my First Amendment rights.  It's not because I was going 60 miles an hour, it's because of my bumper sticker.  And the police officer at that point says, you know, I can't give a ticket to this guy without being hauled into court on personal liability because he's got a credible case that was for First Amendment grounds.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  You already got the officer in court.  I mean you get a speeding ticket and most times they don't show up because they have got other things to do.  Now he's got to show up in district court, in state court to defend against this.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that a case that you could state.  He pulled me over, he gave me a speeding ticket, but the only reason he picked me out is because I had a bumper sticker saying ""I hate the police"".   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does that go to trial?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why doesn't it go to trial?  I mean, what, does it go -- do you have to depose the police officer, why did you stop him?  Did you stop anybody else for going 65 miles per hour that day?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the only way you could find out is you put in the evidence, here's the bumper sticker and you put the police officer on the stand and you say why did you do it.  And all of a sudden, I don't know why everybody doesn't have a bumper sticker.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They didn't arrest him until after he lied, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, summary judgment, that's -- you're already been in court a long time when you are talking about summary judgment.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, there is an easy way out of it.  We could agree with the--  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  One thing about your analysis that concerns me is that you seem to have a very black and white view of what is going on in the officer's mind: did you stop -- did you arrest him because of retaliation or was it legitimate security?  And I suspect that the people engaged in this type of thing have intuition.  I mean, they don't sit there and say, well, let's see; is it because he says he didn't like the war in Iraq, or is because he is wandering around, looks like he is looking for something with a -- with a bag?  I mean I assume they sort have experience and they calculate all this in and say I've got to do something.  And how do you parse those different motivations.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  One reason that I in fact don't like the answer is be -- because what the agent is now going to have to factor, in addition to the hostility of the -- the views, the touching of the Vice President, the lying about it, the wandering around with the bag -- is in the back of his mind -- you know, if I'm wrong, I may be held personally liable in damages for taking some action that some jury somewhere is going to say is based on retaliation rather than my obligation to protect the Vice President.

Roberts, Jr.  You say the same way.  What is that way?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  There are student lists in each classroom that have race identified with the students.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, you go back to what they checked on the form.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's a yes or no question.  You go back to what they checked on their application form in deciding whether Economics 201 has a sufficient number of African Americans or Hispanics?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is that number?  What is the critical mass of African Americans and Hispanics at the university that you are working toward?   INTERRUPTING John G.

We have an obligation to consider it in every case, and what you gave us is one footnote in which you said it's hard to see how she could establish cognizable jurisdiction.   John G.

We have findings by both courts below -- and I'm reading from the court of appeals opinion at Petitioner appendix page 33.  ""The district court found that race is indisputably a meaningful factor that can make a difference in the evaluation of a student's application. ""  If it doesn't make a difference, then we have a clear case; they're using race in a way that doesn't make a difference.  The supposition has to be that race is a determining factor.  We've heard a lot about holistic and all that.  That's fine.  But unless it's a determining factor, in some cases they're using race when it doesn't serve the purpose at all.  That can't be the situation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You have to agree that it makes a difference in some cases.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G.

You said that the -- it is all right to have as-applied constitutional challenges presented to the MSPB or not presented but then reviewed in the Federal Circuit.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay, but -- but within the statutory scheme, are you saying that a claim that this statute is, while not facially unconstitutional, unconstitutional as applied to me?  Where does that go?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think it's probably mine.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where does -- where does that claim go?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What type, summer interns and FBI employees?   John G.

There is no reason to get--  [Laughter]  I don't -- I don't mean that facetiously.  I mean what they're saying is that there is some level of de minimis personnel actions when you're talking about the vast Federal bureaucracy that we don't have to really give the whole panoply of rights.  And FBI agents, I assume it's because of the sensitive nature of what they deal with.  So I guess what I'm saying is do you want us to focus on the millions of employees who would now be going to district court or do you want us to focus on the small number that have facial constitutional challenges?

It's -- it's your position that the MSPB does lack this authority in fact; right?  It's not just the MSPB's position.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I don't like that.  [Laughter]  I mean, the idea of -- the special masters floating around freely every time you get one of these cases?  I mean, what -- inevitably what's going to happen is that you're going to have a more or less permanent special master who gets all these things.  You're not going to appoint 85 special masters if there are 85 of these sorts of claims.  It seems to me you've got an agency there that's expert in the interrelation between the different provisions in the statute.  And why don't -- you know, why don't -- they make fact-findings all the time in -- in areas within their authority to decide.  It seems to me it's ready-made for sending these things back.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if -- I guess the party doesn't -- doesn't even have to raise its constitutional claim before the MSPB, does it?   INTERRUPTING John G.

But I understand the argument to be that that's the problem that your permit imposes on you; in other words, that this is where the monitoring station is supposed to be.  What is it monitoring if not discharges from the MS4, for which you're responsible?  The Government suggests that there could be different rules about whether you have to show the allocation or if that's your responsibility.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  --particular pollutant you can discharge.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You wouldn't do that unless you expected to discharge some.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why did you put the monitoring sources where they are if that wasn't what was going to measure your compliance with the permit?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the Government says that that question -- you're saying, I understand, there are other discharges -- well, you're by far the dominant discharger, but I understand there are others, and they may contribute as well to what the monitoring station says.  But the Government's position is that, well, that's how you wrote the permit without any allocation; and, that whatever allocation issues you have may be between you and the other dischargers, but that doesn't affect the showing of liability.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where is that?  I know we've got the permit.  Where does it read that way?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what -- what percentage of discharges come from you as opposed to the other members of the MS4--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Give me an estimate?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what goes into these discharges besides the rainwater runoff?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your -- your hypothesis is in some of these minority dischargers, that for some reason their rainwater would have a different amount of pollutants than your rainwater?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Where is that requirement?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where is that requirement that you're now doing?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you are not doing it now?   John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, where is the permit's own terms?  Your friend cited JA 93, which says each permittee is responsible only for a discharge for which it is the operator.  So where does the permit clearly show the opposite?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Looking at 109, it strikes me as a little bit circular to say they have the responsibility to carry out inspection and surveillance and monitoring to ensure compliance with the permit; and, their point is, well, we're not -- we're not not in compliance with the permit because you haven't -- there hasn't been an allocation of the discharges to them.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I think that might be -- I think that might be right, but that gets back to the question of whether the permit is -- is poorly drafted.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And I guess the idea is they're changing the permit so to cure that problem.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, this is all fine and good.  Your friend, though, says you should have cross-petitioned because the relief you seek expands the judgment below, and there are all these cases saying you can't do that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I understand that, but -- it seems reasonable, but they do cite a lot of cases that say you can't do that.  You can't just sort of say, oh, I give up on the others, because the judgment, I guess, is one whole, and you would be changing the judgment.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where on 4 to 5?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are the provisions -- excuse me, the provisions we've been talking about, the three that you cited and the one that your -- are they boilerplate?

Go ahead.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, the--   John G.

And the Ninth Circuit recognized that as an exception to their rule.  Isn't that really going to cause all sorts of collateral litigation?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry?   John G.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it's -- well, if 80,000 is reasonable, the only way to get that is to ask for 100?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It makes sense if you're looking at the reality of the budgeting process because in one case, that one line item appears on the Department of Interior budget; and in the other case, it appears somewhere else in the Judgment Fund budget.  And they can say it's not our fault.  The Judgment Fund -- the court made us do it--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Phillips.     Carter G. Phillips  Well, I think the question is it's unclear what Congress really wanted in this case, and therefore, you ought to construe the -- the scheme in a way that is most favorable to the tribes.  And if that means that the scheme operates so as to protect the integrity of the appropriations process and the spending process for a particular year, and prevents us from being able to seek relief outside of this contract support cost appropriation limitation, that makes perfect sense to me, leaving open obviously the availability of the judgment fund at the end of the day so that the tribes do not in fact have to bear the full burden of -- of this arrangement as opposed to -- as opposed to anyone else.  I mean, that's -- again, we do provide -- we've performed the services.  We don't know.  We do it in good faith.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let's say you have a work room.  There are five people who work there.  And the employer has a rule that the senior employee gets to pick the music that's going to play all day long.  And the senior employee says to one of the other employees, you know, if you don't date me -- I know you don't like country music; if you don't date me, it's going to be country music all day long.  Now, that affects the daily activities of that other employee.  I would have thought, under your theory, that means that that senior employee is a supervisor.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that could be -- that could be far more severe than, for example--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --It could be far more severe than simply saying, all right, you know, you're going to -- as in this case -- you're going to be cutting the celery rather than, you know, baking the bread, or whatever.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but, I mean, there are places where the environment -- you know, an assembly line or something like that -- where the task may not be that different, but how you -- the environment in which you have to perform them may be far more significant than whether or not you're attaching the door handles or the front fenders.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, exactly.  And I would have thought the benefit of the Seventh Circuit's test was that you don't have to go through those case-by-case basis.  I think we can have a reasonable debate about whether the music you have to listen to for eight hours is objectively a significant enough interference with the daily activities to qualify under your test.  But the Seventh Circuit test makes clear -- it doesn't give any kind of immunity; it just makes clear what type of analysis is going to be applied to the allegation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Srinivasan?     Sri Srinivasan  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  When a person controls a subordinate's daily work activities and subjects her to harassment, that person qualifies as a supervisor for purposes of the Faragher-Ellerth vicarious liability affirmative defense framework.  When it controls daily work activities and, therefore, for example, can compel the cleaning of toilets for a year, the principle that the agency relationship augments the ability to carry out the harassment is implicated in that the victim will lack the same ability to resist the harassment or to report it as would be the case if the harassment were conducted by a coworker that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about -- what about the music hypothetical?   Sri Srinivasan  --Well--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where -- where do you think your test comes out on that?   Sri Srinivasan  --I think it comes out, most likely, against concluding that the person is a supervisor.  And the reason is that, under the EEOC enforcement guidance, that accounts for situations in which the authority is exercised over a limited field, a limited number of tasks or assignments.  And this is at page 92(a) of the petition appendix.  And I think that would qualify under that provision because it's limited.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why -- it doesn't really have to do with the number of tasks.  It isn't an assignment of tasks.  It's something that clearly affects the daily activities of the employee in a way that could be used to implement or facilitate harassment.   Sri Srinivasan  It could, Your Honor.  I don't disagree with that, and I don't disagree that there are going to be cases that raise issues at the margins.  But one way to think about the spectrum of options available to the Court today is to envision that on one end, you have harassment that's perpetrated by a coworker, and you consider the types of harassment that that might entail.  And on the other end, you have harassment that's perpetrated by a supervisor with authority over tangible employment actions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And -- and your tests sort of use that, just as you've posed it, as some broad continuum in which we're going to have countless cases trying to figure out whether music falls closer to this end or, you know, what -- the senior employee controls the thermostat, is that closer to this end or that end?  Or cutting onions?  It seems to me that every single case has its own peculiar facts, and courts are going to be -- have to figure out where on the continuum it resides.   Sri Srinivasan  Well -- well, I guess, Your Honor, as Your Honor put it to -- to Petitioner's counsel, the competing approach would be the approach adopted by the Seventh Circuit; but, that approach has some serious flaws.  For example, it wouldn't cover the supervisor's conduct that was at issue in Faragher itself, where the supervisor threatened that he would make the harassment victim clean the toilets for a year if she didn't succumb to the harassment.  And I think that's a pretty significant cost.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do you know that?  Are you just saying they have not generated actual Federal -- Federal court reported cases?  Do you have any idea how this works on the ground when people complain about the exercise of authority by a coworker who has specific responsibilities that might be reviewed as supervisory?   Sri Srinivasan  --Well, they haven't -- I guess that's two components to the answer, Mr. Chief Justice -- they haven't generated reported or underreported decisions, as far as we've seen.  And this is not scientific, and it's just based on our conversations with the EEOC lawyers who are charged with dealing with right to sue letters and the like.  They haven't encountered these sorts of situations.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The EEOC lawyers think the EEOC plan is working just fine.   Sri Srinivasan  Well, that -- I -- I understand that that's not entirely surprising, but--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You've -- you've talked several times about this going along the spectrum.  Where -- where are we supposed to cut off the -- where's the cutting line in the spectrum?   Sri Srinivasan  --Well, I think that the -- control over daily work activities is where we would draw the line.  And that's what has come up the most in the cases.  The reported decisions have conflicts on -- have a conflict on that issue, and that is where the EEOC guidance draws the line.  Now, I think it would be helpful, if the Court were going to issue an opinion that adopts that line, to elaborate on -- on that line a little bit in the following sense: That relaying instructions that are -- that are disseminated by one person wouldn't count for those purposes.  That's in the EEOC guidance.  And -- and it's the functions of a job that actually matter, not the job title.  That is also in the EEOC guidance.  So I think there are some aspects of the EEOC guidance that elaborate on that line about control over daily activities that I think I would commend to the Court, that it might well--   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Every -- every time -- every time you adopt a rule rather than a multifactor analysis, there are going to be particular cases that fall outside the rule that look like a harsh result.  Now, here it simply affects the nature.  It doesn't give any immunity for harassment, it just affects the nature of the showing that might be made.  You have no difficulty, as representing an employer, by saying that in every case an allegation of this sort is made you have to go through a case-by-case description of the particular responsibilities, whether it's the thermostat, whether it's the music, whether it's the assignment of everything that the employee does, and decide on that basis whether or not you should compensate the victim, or -- or whether or not you should go to court?

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What were the mothballs there for?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay, then--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, that's my question.  Are we talking about the expectation of privacy in the marijuana or the expectation of privacy in the odor?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well -- well, no, that can't be right, because if you're letting smoke out that -- that -- I don't know, from the burning of a body or something, you don't say, well, because he's trying to conceal that you can't rely on the smoke.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So I guess the question here is, if you appreciate the fact that the odor is coming out to the extent that you're going to put mothballs all around the house, it seems to me that you -- you may have an expectation of privacy in the marijuana plants, but you don't have an expectation of privacy in the odor, because you're emitting it out, out into the world, and it's the odor that was detected.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's like saying you put the -- the drugs in a -- in a bag to protect them from observation on the outside, but you use, you know, a clear bag rather than a, you know, opaque one or something.  You didn't -- you weren't very successful.  And -- when you began you said assuming that's what the mothballs were there for.  That is what they were there for, isn't it?  There is no other reason--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Well, our Fourth Amendment cases are very clear that they don't turn on the subjective intent of the particular officer.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought you just said it depends on whether or not he's going up to the door to sniff or going up for something else.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, sure, if he's down on his knees; but, what if he goes up to the front door and sniffs?  I mean, he's--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --he's got to breathe.  I mean, how do you tell whether it's different?  I don't understand.  He's going up to drop off, you know, tickets to the Policeman's Ball, and he smells marijuana.  What is that?  Is that a violation or not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it depends on -- but if he's going up to sniff, it is a violation?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can odors be in the equivalent of plain sight, plain smell?  In other words, the officer goes up to drop off the Policeman's Ball tickets, the door is open, he sees the dead body.  The officer goes up to sell the Policeman's Ball tickets, and he sees -- he smells the marijuana.  Okay in both cases, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So this depends upon how strong the odor is.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If the -- let's say it's a townhouse that goes right up to the sidewalk.  If the police go by with their dog intending to sniff, and the dog alerts, on the sidewalk but two feet away is the front door, that's okay, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's okay?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let me make sure I understand you.  The policeman is walking down the sidewalk with his dog, the dog stops and alerts.  That doesn't constitute sufficient probable cause to get a search warrant to go into the townhouse.  There's been no entry onto the property, just a policeman walking with his dog.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  He's walking the dog.  He's not out searching.  He's walking the K-9 dog, and the dog alerts on a house without any trespass.  You think that's still bad?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is the constitutionally protected area in this case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even though it's the sidewalk where people -- there's an implied license for people to walk up to--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --No, it's the front part.  But there is an implied license to walk up to the front door, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe this is the same question Justice Alito asked earlier, but people have different senses of smell.  So what if there is some person who has, you know, the best sense of smell in the department, and they say, well, let's use him to go do the knock and talks when we suspect drugs; that way, he may discover the odor of marijuana when other people wouldn't.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's -- there is a little confusion about the Government's position, there was in the court of appeals.  Is it -- I'm quoting from your friend's brief, and he says:  ""The Federal Circuit adopted a categorical rule that temporary government action can never be a taking if the government does not intend to create a permanent flooding condition. ""  Is that an accurate statement of your understanding?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, there are pretty clear findings in the Court of Claims on the question of causation, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, so if the Government comes in and tells a landowner downstream that every March and April we are going to flood your property so that you can't use it, from now on, that's the way -- that's part of our plan, that's a taking for those 2 months, correct?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No?  The Government says you will not be able to use your land because of what we are doing for 2 months -- you have been able to up to now, but from now on, for March and April, you can't.  That's not a taking?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'll grant you that it can decide whose land it wants to take.  I just want to know why that's not a taking.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if the Government says we've got to release the flood waters and what we're going to do is we're going to have water trucks pull up behind the dam, we're going to load them up and we're going to drive them downriver to this person's property and we're going to dump the water there?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But your answer is that would be a taking?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I thought--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Again, I think the Court of Claims' findings are to the contrary.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They said the Government knew that this water was going to go right here, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if the Government decides for purposes of flood control -- I don't know -- I don't know the ecological way -- but the water has to percolate or whatever down in this area.  So it goes onto this person's land and it cuts down $5 million worth of his trees.  The same purpose, to assist in flood control.  No doubt that that's a taking, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure, sure.  And so the Government then comes down and says, we're going to flood your land and we know -- again, looking at the factual findings -- we know that will result in your trees dying, but because we're doing it for flood control, that's just too bad.  Different case when they go in with a chain saw than when they go in with the water?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, just before you get off, because I think part of the confusion, at least for me, is the difference between what the Federal circuit decided and what you're arguing.  You seem to be arguing that it doesn't make any difference, it's not -- whether it's temporary or permanent, right?  The Federal circuit thought it was dispositive that this they viewed as temporary and not permanent.  So it seems to me that you're fighting, and you're fighting a lot of the court of claims' very exhaustive findings, to present a different argument.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It seems to me that if we disagree, and we think it makes a difference that it doesn't have to be 50 years, but it might be something less, then maybe you've preserved all these other arguments or maybe not, but--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I know, but you agree -- you agree with the Federal circuit, but then you're presenting all these other arguments in which it doesn't depend.  So, if we disagree with the Federal circuit, it seems to me that we ought to say that, and maybe you can make these other arguments about it's too far downstream or--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Or upstream, under your theory.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It strikes me that that's a valuation question.  But I understood you to say that if there was a pipe coming out of the dam and it went to somebody's -- right to the property line of somebody's land and that's where you dump the water, that would be a taking.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  I thought the factual findings in the trial court said that was this case, that you knew when you opened up the dam that this is where the water was going to go.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about 6 years later, when it was doing the same thing and the water went to the same place?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Capable is in the statute, purpose is not, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Before you get to Evansville, let's say it moved around, which is one thing, but also it had a raked bow; it wasn't square.  Then -- then it starts to look more like a boat.  It moves around more frequently.  Its mooring -- I mean, if you have a sailboat and you pull it up to a dock, you hook up for water and plug in for power.  It doesn't seem to me to be terribly significant.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Aren't you just begging the question?  You keep saying it was not a vessel to begin with.  Why -- doesn't it just restate the question?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, doesn't your argument beg the question?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it changes -- one -- the same thing is not a boat sometimes, and it is a boat.  You've got a casino that's tied up for a month.  During that time, it's not a boat.  And then they move it around to go to the other side of the river, and during that time it is a boat?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But -- but I'm just -- the hypothetical -- the hypothetical I posed was meant to pose the question, well, sometimes things do both, and how do we tell which it is--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Gannon.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I -- can I interrupt you just there on the dredging?  You say the function of the dredge was to carry people and equipment.  I would have said the function of the -- the dredge is to dredge in the middle of the river.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right?  And so -- and I don't know which of us would be right, so it seems to me that that function test is a very difficult one to apply.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I know what it said.  I guess I would say, obviously, it serves a waterborne function, but I'm not sure the first thing I would say when I see one of these dredges in the middle of the river is its purpose is to move people and equipment.  I would say its purpose is to dredge.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but that's saying that it has to be able to move, and I agree with that.  But its purpose is still to dredge, not to move.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You could use it if you had a -- you know, a transportation boat, right?  Any equipment you need to move, you put it on another boat and drop it off.

Smith  --When there are substantial interests of the government as employer that are served by the sacrifice.  What you've said over and over in Duryea, in Garcetti, and in a whole line of cases is the government gets to have leeway as an employer when there are real interests at stake, and that in that situation, the employee could be put to the choice.  Thank you, Your Honor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  General.     Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The line drawn in Abood is sound.  It has the force of stare decisis behind it, it is completely consistent with this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence, and it requires affirmance.  If I could, I'd like to turn to the questions that Justice Kennedy has raised because I do think it gets to the key issue in the case.  I think the key point, the key takeaway in this case, is that the context we are dealing with here is the government as proprietor and manager of its own operations.  And this Court's case law has said over and over again that in that context, two things follow.  First, the government's interest in the effective and efficient carrying out of its own operations is entitled to very substantial weight, more substantial weight than it would get if you were looking at the government as a sovereign regulating the citizenry.  And second, yes, Justice Kennedy, indeed as Your Honors' opinion in Garcetti and Your Honors' opinion in Borough of Duryea recognized both times, the employees' First Amendment interests are diminished to the extent that the government has more latitude when the government can show that the obligation it is imposing is in furtherance of the government's legitimate interests as manager of its own operations.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  General Verrilli, does Medicaid have anything to do with this case?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Yes.  Let me do my best to try to clear that up, Mr. Chief Justice.  I'm going to give you the best answer I can to your question.  Remember Medicaid of course is a joint Federal/State program.  The Federal government provides funds; the State provides funds.  Here we're operating within a waiver program in which the State is given considerable latitude to set wages and set rates so long as it is saving money as compared to the institutionalization of this population.  My understanding is that HHS will review wage rates set to make sure that they meet very general parameters.  They were of the kind described in the Douglas case that was before the Court a couple of years ago.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right, right.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Are they high enough to make sure the services providing -- they're provided effectively and are they -- and are they constrained enough--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  Your statement of interest -- your statement of interest explaining why you are here today discusses the effect of the Medicaid program.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --Right, but it's not that the -- but the Federal Government isn't approving the specific hourly wage rate as Medicaid reimbursement within this program.  That's a judgment that the Medicaid program leaves to the considerable discretion of the State.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If the union wants to talk about Medicaid rates with the State because they would get a higher wage or could get a higher wage if Medicaid reimbursement was higher, is that within the -- their functioning as a union rather than a political group?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Not as I understand it.  I think applying the line of Lehnert, that that would be on the impermissible side of the line.  That would be effectively seeking to change public policy by changing what the legislature or the--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, so if the union wants to say, look, the only way our people are going to get higher wages is if there's a higher Medicaid reimbursement rate for this service, that is not within the scope of collective bargaining?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --I think -- my understanding is that that would be -- the question there was at which side of the line that the Court drew in Lehnert is that on.  I think that's probably on the -- on the impermissible side of the line.  But that's where the fight would be.  It would be over where that line should be drawn, not over whether the -- whether the State, as manager of its own operations, can use collective bargaining with a fair share, as Justice Scalia mentioned earlier, in a way that private employers routinely do.  I mean, I do think that's the fundamental point of Abood, that private -- that the government as employer, as manager of its own operations, ought to be able to make the same kind of choice that private employers make when they think it advances their interests in efficiency and sound operations.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Please finish your thought.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --before it was reaffirmed in Lehnert, before it was reaffirmed in Ellis and before it was reaffirmed unanimously in Locke.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.

Roberts, Jr.  If you hire a homecare provider to provide homecare services, isn't how much the person is compensated -- you have a Medicaid program, a cooperative program with the Federal Government.  Doesn't it set the rates with which those services are reimbursed?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, right, it's a cooperative State/Federal program.  But isn't there -- are you saying the wages have nothing to do with how much the -- the Medicaid reimbursement for these types of services?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But they don't just give you a bunch of money and say, well, here it is, you figure out how much you want to -- I mean, I thought this case had something to do with the fact that Medicaid was used to reimburse these employees, and you're saying it has nothing to do with that at all?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I just want to know, not what their challenge is.  I want to know where the money comes from.  It comes from Medicaid, and I assume Medicaid sets some parameters about how much you can reimburse homecare providers.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you can negotiate whatever rates you want with the homecare providers regardless of what Medicaid says about those services?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, yes.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  One thing.  Mr. Smith, the first word in your brief is ‶ Medicaid ″.  I don't understand, because the argument can be made that Medicaid reimbursement rates is an important public policy issue, not simply a labor issue.  Now, let's say you have a teachers' union, okay?  They think it's a very important public issue.  They have a platform.  They engage in activities to get higher Medicaid reimbursement rates.  Is that something that a nonunion member would have to pay for or would they -- would that expense be segregated out of what they must pay?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Teacher -- teacher union, okay?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  They have a political position on Medicaid rates.  They spend money to advance that position.  If you're a teacher, but you're not a member of the union, do you have to pay for that expenditure?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  Same -- same public -- same expenses for Medicaid--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --but you're a home care provider.  Your union spends to get higher Medicaid rates.  You're not a member of the union.  Do you have to pay for their political activity to raise Medicaid rates?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So one -- I'm sorry.  If I could just finish the thought.  So the same speech with respect to one union is a speech on a matter of public concern, but with respect to another union, it's not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So it's Medicaid.  Now, is that part of the chargeable expenses or not?  This union wants to talk about Medicaid reimbursement rates.  Can a nonunion member be compelled to share that expense?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean Medicaid reimbursement rates.  That's what I mean by Medicaid reimbursement rates.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So in this case -- in this case, if this union negotiates over Medicaid reimbursement rates, it is chargeable.   INTERRUPTING John G.

But, of course, perhaps they don't prosecute the cases involving tiny amounts, so that most of those cases, or some percentage of them, may, in fact, also involve the serious type of conduct addressed by the Federal statute.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You can finish, finish your answer, please, Mr. Clement.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I think there's -- I see two different problems and I'm not quite sure how they come out.  One, you cannot assume that the legislature's plan should be treated as if it were precleared.  The district court in Texas cannot assume or presume what the district court here in D.C. is going to do.  But on the other hand, it can't presume it the other way.  In other words, it can't draw its interim plan assuming that there are going to be these section 5 violations, because that's presuming what the Court's going to do the other way.  So how do we decide between those two -- you have two wrong choices.  How do we end up?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Clement.  Mr. Srinivasan.     Sri Srinivasan  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The fundamental flaw with Texas's approach is that it directly inverts the burden established by the Voting Rights Act.  Section 5 places the burden on a covered jurisdiction to show that a proposed voting change is nondiscriminatory in purpose and effect, and the change can't go into effect unless and until the State carries its burden in that regard.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's exactly right, but you see it only on one side of the problem.  You say, well, you can't treat it as if it's being pre-cleared because that would be prejudging what the court is doing in D.C. But you have no trouble with them saying, assuming that there are going to be these section 5 violations, in drawing additional majority-minority districts, which is just assuming in the other way what the court here in D.C. is going to do.  I don't know how you lean one way and say, it's horrible, you can't use it because it hasn't been precleared, but it's all right in drawing the interim plan to treat it as if preclearance has been denied.   Sri Srinivasan  I don't know about that, because I think what a district court is supposed to do when preclearance is pending is not accept all the challenges.  What it is supposed to do is to apply traditional districting criteria to the benchmark.  So I guess--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And if you look -- and if you look at Joint Appendix 146 to 147, it looks the exact opposite.  It looks like they're drawing minority coalition opportunity districts to draw them, because they have anticipated how they think the district court in D.C. is going to come out.   Sri Srinivasan  Well, that's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think we point to that in our brief as an area in which the district court could give further explanation on remand.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You do.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We will let you go on for a little longer.  We may have a few more questions.   Sri Srinivasan  Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  I appreciate that.  I guess what I would say, Justice Kennedy, is, if you use the unpreclear plan as the starting point, which is what Texas proposes, you are giving effect to that, notwithstanding the preclearance requirement of section 5.  And with the covered jurisdiction, that is something that section 5 doesn't allow.  Now, I do think it's important to consider Texas's preclearance submission in the context of the other statewide preclearance submissions that have been submitted in this election cycle.  If you look at the government's brief at pages la to 3a, I think what that bears out is that there is not a fundamental problem with section 5 or the way section 5 operates.  The problem insofar as it exists is with respect to the particular submissions that Texas has made, because there were 20 submissions of statewide plans for administrative preclearance.  In all 20 cases, the Attorney General precleared them.  In 19 of the 20 cases, the Attorney General precleared it within the initial 60-day window.  Now--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I have -- Your position -- I understand you're straddling a position.  That's why you are sitting in the back rather than the front row between the two parties.  But it's a little unsatisfying because what you say we should do when we are all under the gun of very strict time limitations is we should send it back to the district court so it can give a greater explanation of what it's done.  Isn't that going to be very wasteful?  And it's kind of an odd order from this Court to send to a district court saying, you know, tell us more.   Sri Srinivasan  --Well, I don't know that it is, Your Honor, and I have two responses in that respect.  First, and this goes to a question that Justice Alito asked earlier, what is this Court supposed to do in this situation?  And I think one thing that could absolutely happen is if there were a remand the D.C. district court could complete its preclearance proceeding, which would be illuminating the what the Texas district court is supposed to do.  And to have guidance on that--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe -- brief answer, please.   Sri Srinivasan  Yes.  Sure.  I think insofar as the coalition districts and ability districts emerge from growth, there is nothing suspect about them.  The one example I point to is District 33.  If you look at Joint Appendix, pages 146 and 147, it's not clear what the, what the district court was doing in that regard.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Garza?     Jose Garza  Well, I -- I think that our position is that section 5 is clear that this Court should not start with the interim plan, but if the Court disagrees with me, I think that that's a much more reasonable approach than the one offered by the State, for the same reason argued by the United States: that is, that in the State's argument, you really turn section 5 on its head, because one of the principal benefits for the minority community in having section 5 is it alters of the burden of proof.  And if you maintain the burden of proof on the State before it can implement any portion of its newly adopted but unprecleared plan, that's far more preferable than shifting the burden, which would be inconsistent with section 5 in its intent.  I don't think I have anything else.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't think we do, either.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Clement, you have 3 minutes remaining.     ",11-713X

Roberts, Jr.  And that's right, but it goes the other way when you say they can't approve something that's been challenged.  Aren't you assuming that the plaintiffs are right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that's an inquiry that belongs to the district court in D.C.--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --The constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act is not at issue here, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Maybe you could turn to the issue that I see on Joint Appendix 146 and 147.  They don't say a minority coalition opportunity district just happened to emerge.  It said that district 33 was drawn as a minority coalition opportunity district.  And we have never held that it is appropriate or even permissible to draw a district where you are putting in together two minorities, two different minority groups.  And it seems to me that that raises all sorts of different concerns.  It's one thing under the Voting Rights Act to say that this group votes as a bloc and has been discriminated against in its ability to elect representatives of its choice.  It's another thing to say that two different minority groups are put together because they share some particular view so that one candidate is going to be each of theirs candidate -- candidates of choice.  That goes quite a step further from what we have upheld under the Voting Rights Act.  And here you are have of the district court creating that in the absence of any State expression of a desire to create that type of -- of district.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  New district 33 was drawn as a minority coalition opportunity district.  I don't see how that can be read any way other than saying -- saying when we sat down and drew it, we drew this one as a minority coalition opportunity district.   INTERRUPTING John G.

It seems to me that you're requiring that there be a larger number of police present at the site conducting the search, being lookouts for anybody that might come back, being able to detain people who are leaving as they approach.  There's no immediate threat, but there's certainly a threat.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it requires more unless they want the guy to get away, I guess, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We talked about -- we talked about officer safety.  What about the safety of others?  Suppose the place being searched is adjacent to a playground and there are, you know, dozens of children playing in the playground.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why in the world would anybody spend any money to try to improve the seed if as soon as they sold the first one anybody could grow more and have as many of those seeds as they want?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's true, that's true in the case of any patented article, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the patent system is based, I think, on the recognition that contractual protection is inadequate to encourage invention.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you only need one -- I mean, you throw the seeds on the ground, one or two of them are going to grow and you still have the same case, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry, maybe I didn't read this right.  I thought what he did was plant all the commodity seeds, and then applied the Roundup so that all that was left was the Roundup Ready-resistance seeds, and then he used those.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How come that's not a problem the first time you plant?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  I mean the very first time, you get nothing but Monsanto Ready -- Roundup Ready seeds and you plant those.  Are you telling us you have the same problem with them growing at different rates and all that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that doesn't make the commodity seeds any different?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Sherry?     Melissa Arbus Sherry  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  I'd like to start by talking about this Court's decision in J.E.M., because I think it largely resolves this case.  J.E.M. was a patent case, and the issue there was whether or not you could get a utility patent on a plant.  The argument was that you couldn't get a utility patent because the Plant Variety Protection Act implicitly repealed the Patent Act in that respect.  This Court rejected that argument, and the reason it rejected that argument was because it found no conflict between the two statutes.  The reason it found no conflict between the two statutes is because it said that it is harder to get a utility patent, and for that reason, you get greater protection -- under the Patent Act, you get greater rights of exclusion under the Patent Act than you do under the PVPA.  And it said, most notably, there is no seed saving exemption in the Patent Act, there is no research exemption in the Patent Act.  The consequence of Petitioner's argument would be that this Court would not only be reading a seed-saving exemption into the Patent Act, and a research exemption, it would be doing much, much, much more under the guise of patent exhaustion.  Justice Breyer, as you pointed out, the Exhaustion Doctrine really has nothing to do with this case, and that's because the Exhaustion Doctrine has always been limited to the particular article that was sold, and we are talking about a different article here.  And it's never extended to the making of a new article.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but I mean, this -- the reason it's never is because this is an entirely different case.  It's the reason it's here, because you have the intersection of the Exhaustion Doctrine and the -- the normal protection of reinvented articles.  So I don't think it gets you very far to say that we've never applied the Exhaustion Doctrine that way either.  We have never applied the reinvention doctrine to articles that reinvent themselves like plant seed.   Melissa Arbus Sherry  It's true that the Court hasn't had an exhaustion case specifically involving the sort of replicating technology, but when the Court has talked about exhaustion it has always focused on the specific article that's sold and it has done that for a reason.  The concept underlying exhaustion is that when the patentholder controls that very first sale it gets the one royalty with respect to the actual article sold.  Petitioner's argument isn't limited to the commodity grain that we are talking about.  It's not even limited -- when you talk -- Justice Breyer, you mentioned the three different generations of seeds.  There is actually quite a few more generations than those three.  If the concept is the sale of a parent plant exhausts the patentholder's rights not only with respect to that seed but with respect to all the progeny seed, we would have to go all the way back to the very first Roundup Ready plant that was created as part of the transformation event.  Every single Roundup Ready seed in existence today is the progeny of that one parent plant and, as Your Honor pointed out, that would eviscerate patent protections.  There would be no incentive to invest, not just in Roundup Ready soybeans or not even agricultural technology, but it's quite a bit broader than that.  In order to encourage investment, the Patent Act provides 20 years of exclusivity.  This would be reducing the 20-year term to essentially one and only sale.  It would be near impossible to recoup your investments with that first sale and so the more likely consequence is that research dollars would be put elsewhere.  The other--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So when -- when are the patent rights exhausted in the seed?   Melissa Arbus Sherry  --The patent rights are exhausted in the seed at the same time they are exhausted with respect to any other product, upon an authorized sale.  And so, Justice Breyer, again you had it right when you were saying that you can do what you want.  In our view, once there is an authorized sale you can do what you want with respect to the seed that you've actually purchased.  That is the tangible article you paid for.  But you do need permission from the patentholder in order to make a new generation of seed.  To the extent, you know, any middle ground is warranted, with all due respect, we would point to Congress as the appropriate body.  This Court said--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  Just so I can follow your -- just so I can follow your answer, Monsanto sells the seed to the farmer.  And you are saying if the farmer grows the seed he can sell it to anybody he wants, right?   Melissa Arbus Sherry  --If Monsanto authorizes--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm putting aside all the contracts and stuff.   Melissa Arbus Sherry  --Right.  So if Monsanto authorized that first sale and authorized the planting, they would also have to authorize the sale of the second generation seed because it's a new article.  And that's exactly what happened here.  If you look at the technology agreement -- and it's not just because it's a contract because I think it's significant to the analysis -- Monsanto, upon the first sale of the bag of Roundup Ready seed, authorizes the planting for one commercial crop and it authorizes the farmer to sell that as a commercial crop or to use it for any purpose other than replanting.  That is an authorized sale.  So if you take that second generation seed -- “ second generation ” is a bit of a misnomer, but if you take that seed and you follow it through, all of the patent rights with respect to that particular seed have been exhausted.  But you cannot take that seed without separate authorization, plant it in the ground, and come up with the next generation of seed.  That would be--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That sounds like the patent rights haven't been exhausted then.   Melissa Arbus Sherry  --They have been exhausted with respect to the particular article sold.  When the Court's talked about patent exhaustion, you are not exhausting the rights with respect to the patented invention.  You're exhausting--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You are saying it's exhausted with respect to the one bean?   Melissa Arbus Sherry  --Yes, and that's always the case just as if I sell -- I mean, even if you think in the copyright--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's always the case because it's a very -- the other cases haven't involved this situation where you are talking about a self-regenerating product.   Melissa Arbus Sherry  --But I think there is other technology out there.  I mean, even if you think of software, for example, there are plenty of other products where one reasonable use is to make more.  I can purchase software; one reasonable use would be to make a dozen other copies to give to my friends or sell on eBay.  It's a reasonable use, but it's an infringing one.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, we haven't had that case either.   Melissa Arbus Sherry  The Court hasn't had that case exactly, but it did decide Microsoft v. AT&T, and granted that was on a slightly different issue, but in that case the Court recognized -- that case, it was copies from a master disk and it treated them as separate copies because they were actually separate articles, even though it was really easy to do, even though the actual copying is not done by human hands, it's done by mechanical processes.  In fact, in that case the Court talked and compared the making of software to the reproduction through biological processes, which is what we are talking about here.  And so all we are asking the Court to do today -- I recognize it's a new technology and to the extent new technologies require different rules, Congress is the body that should be making those different rules.  And when Congress has acted in this area in the Plant Variety Protection Act and also in the software context in the Copyright Act, it has not adopted the wholesale exemption that Petitioner is talking for here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure.   Melissa Arbus Sherry  I think the Court does not need to do something about it in this case.  I think Quanta largely decided the issue, even though it didn't say so explicitly, and as far as I'm aware the Federal Circuit has not applied their previous version of the conditional sale doctrine to enforce the post-sale restrictions since this Court's decision in Quanta.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Waxman.     Seth P. Waxman  --That would be true even if this case came out another way, Justice Kennedy.  First of all because grain elevators are prohibited by state and federal law from selling seed, period.  They sell -- they buy grain and they sell grain.  They can't sell seed.  Number 2, almost all varieties of soybeans or other crop plants are currently protected by the -- under the patent -- the Plant Variety Protection Act.  As this Court and Congress recognized, the requisites for getting a certificate are -- I mean, it's like a registration requirement.  And we know from J.E.M. and the relevant provision of the PVPA that it is unlawful to divert crops that are protected by a PVPA certificate for reproductive uses.  So irrespective of all of this, whatever happens, even if there is only 1 percent of patented soybeans in a grain elevator, the grain elevator can't sell it as seed both under the federal and state seed laws and under the Patent Variety Protection Act.  That's why the solution for farmers like Monsanto -- like Mr. Bowman is to simply buy conventional seed, multiply it, you know, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80 times in a single generation and save 1/80th of it to replant in his second crop, if he doesn't want to buy Roundup Ready technology for his second crop and use the glyphosate aerially.  Unless the Court has further questions, we will submit.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Waxman.  Mr. Walters, you have five minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING John G.

Give me an example of something that -- like the consequences in Padilla that would not be covered by your argument?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you had--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --If you had that case, what would you rely on in arguing in favor of the habeas petition?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You would start with Strickland, and you would talk with -- Padilla, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Dreeben.     Michael R. Dreeben  True, but Petitioner is not pressing that basis on this Court.  He's all but disavowed it.  He's not seriously argued it in response to our brief that opposed his brand new ineffectiveness carveout from Teague.  What he has done instead is concentrated much more on an analogy to Massaro.  If I could give one more reason why I think the Court should refrain from entertaining that Massaro-based analogy here, the Court has just begun to embark in the Martinez v. Ryan line of cases on trying to figure out how ineffectiveness claims should be handled on collateral review.  It grants its certiorari on Monday in Trevino v. Thaler, where it's going to explore how does Martinez apply in a jurisdiction that may be more like the Federal system in that ineffective assistance of counsel claims aren't channeled only to direct review, they can be asserted on direct -- I'm sorry -- only to collateral review, they can be asserted on direct review.  They are channeled largely to collateral review, but not as a matter of law.  So the Court has a lot of work to do in figuring out what that decision means.  And I think rather than embark on a brand new process of applying that kind of reasoning in a case where it was never raised below, where the government never really had the opportunity to counter any of those arguments, and the lower court never had the opportunity to consider them, it's not a wise use of the Court's resources.  Instead, resolving the new rule question that has divided the circuits would provide an answer for us and the 28 states that filed an amicus brief that supported the United States on the new rule question, and would result, I think, appropriately, in concluding that Padilla was a new rule, unique among this Court's Strickland jurisprudence up to that time, and is not available to cases on collateral review.

Roberts, Jr.  What do you do -- what do you do with a situation -- let's say there's Oklahoma water available to Tarrant that is closer than the water they would get from somewhere else in Texas.  Do they have to incur the additional expense to get Texas water, or can they take the cheaper route and get Oklahoma water?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Blatt?     Lisa S. Blatt  --So they -- you mean the two compliance rules they cited?  They cited -- so they say -- that's what I was saying that was sort of sad is because what they cited disproved what they were trying to assert it for.  So if you -- you don't even have to read the -- you don't even have to read the compliance rules.  Just read page 19 of their brief.  They say in the same sentence that we have an equal -- there's an equal right to one-fourth of an excess above 3,000.  So that means you take whatever is above 3,000 and divide by four equally.  And then they cite a provision that only divides by 3.  And then the next provision they cite didn't divide the excess, it divided the total water.  I don't know why they -- it's inexplicable.  I can't tell you why they did that.  And the only other thing I want to say on the extrinsic evidence, and I do think -- if you think there's any ambiguity in here, which I think there clearly is, you have 30 years of post ratification, which the States immediately did long-term water planning without so mentioning of this right.  And Tarrant actually offered to buy the same water for $1.7 billion in 2002, which is a little bit inconsistent with the notion that they had this right all along.  They just, in 18 months of negotiating history, never mentioned that they thought they owned the water, they were actually offering to pay 1.7 million.  And the amicus brief filed by the Tribes, on page 4, says we were at the negotiating table and we never heard Tarrant mention this right.  And the other thing, I do think the water planning documents are highly significant because not so much Louisiana and Arkansas, but Oklahoma and Texas take water planning very seriously because of their prior appropriation systems.  There are hundreds of thousands of pages on the Internet and none of them mention this right.  Again, they cited something in their reply brief, but if you go look at it, it doesn't come close to mentioning a right of Subbasin 5.

It seems to me that the legislative history cuts strongly against you, putting even aside Congressman Leach.  The issue was there.  And if they meant to say, well, let's find a term that leaves some types of organizations out, States, but not others, we will just say ""individual"", and people will understand that we don't mean a State, but they will also know that we do mean another type of organization or corporation.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You agree, don't you, that the statement in Oregon v. Ice was pure dicta?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's kind of odd though, isn't it, I mean.  To some extent, this is a little easier case for you, because it does involve a corporation.  But there are statutes where the amount of imprisonment and the amount of a fine can both increase based on a particular fact.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And under your submission if you have, you know, say a defendant is subject to one year and then if a particular fact is found and he's subject to two years, a fine of 20 but then 40, the judge would be constitutionally prohibited from increasing the prison increasing the prison sentence but would be perfectly free to increase the fine--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --probably in a situation where the fine might be a lot more serious than the -- the time in prison.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But he operated -- he operated in a reasonable way.  But we give juries the discretion to be unreasonable.  It would not -- juries often compromise.  So if the instructions and the verdict told the jury you can find the defendant, you know, guilty for 1 day, or whatever it -- is the 30 million -- 50,000 or 30 million -- it would not be at all unusual for the jury to debate and say well, let's find him guilty for 10 million.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --and to carry that through, the judge is constrained by reason in -- in a way that the jury is not, and that's sort of -- that's part of the protection the Sixth Amendment provided.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's a very -- very simple matter for the government to ask for jury findings on the questions at issue in this case, right?   INTERRUPTING John G.

You get a significant amount of that by the covenant not to sue.  Nike can't go around giving out these covenants left and right because if they do, they will undermine their own trademark.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where does it -- where does it do that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So if you take -- if that were taken out, is your case the same or not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess maybe this is the same question Justice Ginsburg was asking.  You're -- you're a lawyer in this area.  You want to write a covenant that will satisfy the fellow on the other side, but what does it say?  Can you do that, or do you have to say: The only way this case can be rendered moot is if the trademark is totally invalidated?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, that's kind of a yes or no answer.  Can you write a covenant that says something other than the trademark is totally invalidated?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you're saying that in this case there's no way -- I mean, I thought it was a practice that was not unprecedented for parties to grant covenants of this sort.  You're saying this is unheard of, nobody can do this?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Dabney--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --if you had the various interests that you're asserting now -- we're not talking about mootness, but we're talking about Article III standing.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm looking at what you're alleging, that you have plans to introduce particular shoes.  People are considering investing in your company.  Your opponent has intimidated retailers.  If you brought a suit by yourself, is that sufficient to establish Article III standings?  Are those the sort of concrete and tangible injuries that we've required?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Just because you plan to introduce a particular line of shoes, you can bring a lawsuit?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  Okay.  Just because people are considering investing -- somebody who came in and said, I've got this company, people are thinking of investing in it, and therefore you want to proceed with your lawsuit?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that surely would not establish Article III standings.  Everybody's cost of operation is increased whenever there's any trademark at all because you have to check and see whether it violates a trademark.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I suggest it might not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Anders.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought your answer to Justice Kennedy's question might be that the -- an adverse decision from the agency covering you is an additional injury, in fact, that gives you Article III standing, unless the -- unless the basis for the agency's decision is you don't have any injury.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if you have an executor and he's administering an estate in which 100 people have equal shares to the estate, and the estate has a claim.  And he brings it on behalf of the estate.  Now, is that covered as a mass action or not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Then it would make -- it would make no sense for a defendant in a class action brought by consumers to ever settle the case.  It's going to have to pay twice.  It's going to have to pay consumers, and then it's going to have to pay you because you can: Say, well, we want restitution and we are not going to distribute it to the class members, but we're entitled to it.  And I assume the amount of the restitution is based on some estimate of the class, the consumers' claims.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there -- what is your understanding under Mississippi law, which you know a great deal more than I do, about any limits on a parens patriae action?  Let's say there was one purchaser in Mississippi of LCDs, whatever, or two or three.  Could you bring a parens patriae action on their behalf?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I know but I'm trying--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Unlikely as a practical matter or as a legal matter?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Did the State interest that's being -- the State interest that is being asserted is damage to the consumers?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because it harmed members of the population of Mississippi, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Damage to -- having less money is a damage to the consumer.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What prevents -- what prevents attorneys general from around the country sitting back and waiting until every -- as private class actions proceed, and as soon as one settles or the plaintiffs' class prevails, taking the same complaint, maybe even hiring the same lawyers, to go and say, well, now we are going to bring our parens patriae action.  We know how the trial is going to work out or we know what the settlement is going to look like, and we are going to get the same amount of money for the State?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's got not nothing to do with it, does it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sure it's a serious matter when a plaintiff class recovers for, as in this case, an antitrust violation or whatever.  What's the answer?  I'm sorry, repeating my question.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the answer is that there is nothing to prevent 50 attorneys general, 51, from saying, every time there is a successful class action as to which somebody in my State purchased one of the items, we are going to file a parens patriae action, the complaint is going to look an awful lot like the class action complaint, and we want our money?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry, counsel, but you told me the State's own interest was in protecting its consumers, so it would be able to file this suit every time its consumers have been harmed as demonstrated either through settlement or suit.  That's the State interest, protecting its consumers.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you can't provide any reason why they wouldn't do so, and presumably would start doing so with greater frequency if you prevail in this case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It doesn't have to be the same case.  It can be the next case on the court's docket.  The first case is In Re: LCD Litigation and the second case is State of Mississippi v. LCD Manufacturers.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And in every one of those cases, there had been private class litigation prior to the filing of parens patriae?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Massey.  Mr. Curran?     Christopher M. Curran  But -- but even if it somehow could be considered, I don't think that -- that sentence is definitional.  That certainly is one alternative to -- to conventional class actions that Congress was concerned about.  Our point is it wasn't the only one.  Congress was trying to close loopholes and trying to prevent abuses and a miserly interpretation of the class -- of the mass action definition would undermine that -- that purpose.  Now, in my remaining time perhaps, Justice Kagan, at the end of the day there was no carve-out in the statute for attorney general actions, even though that was sought.  But the Act does reflect some sensitivity for federalism concerns.  It's got an exception for situations where States are the primary defendants, or State officials are the primary defendants.  There is also a notification to State attorneys general when there's a settlement of a class action.  Those kinds of provisions show that Congress was trying to be sensitive and it was horse trading, it was cutting deals, it was log rolling, coming up with an Act here that was at once sensitive to federalism concerns, but also trying to solve the very real abuses that it had identified.  And on the federalism point, the Attorney General's brief has a lot of citations to Eleventh Amendment issues, and some of this Court's precedents dealing with State sovereign immunity.  I submit that those precedents and that Amendment deal only with situations where the State is a defendant.  And here, where we are talking about the State as a plaintiff, and the only intrusion we are talking about is removal from State court to Federal court, that is not on the same playing field as the authorities relied on by the Attorney General.  A couple of other things.  There was a suggestion in the reply brief that the complaint here was not in fact a copycat case, a copycat complaint, but instead was a summary of the Federal indictments, and that that explains the eerie similarity between the class action complaint and the Attorney General's complaint.  That's just factually not right.  Some companies who were defendants, like my client, Toshiba, was never charged or convicted of anything in this case, yet we're a defendant in this case, and that's because we were a defendant in the class action case that was copied.  And in fact, the indictments against some companies bear very little resemblance to the complaint that the Attorney General has filed here in terms of the duration of the conspiracy and the subject matter of the products that are alleged -- were allegedly price-fixed.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  You need the express permission of the base commander to drive down the road.  It's just that he has given it to the public at large.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because it's been ceded by the United States for the convenience of the traveling public.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought you just answered the question from Justice Sotomayor by saying, no, no, the utility easement doesn't work because the military commander has not granted permission to anybody else to use that easement.  Here we have a public road easement, and you said that's different.  And my question was: No, it's not, because the military commander has given permission to use easement.  Now, I want to know what distinguishes the two cases.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's usually the sort of determination that's left to the military commander.  I can think of a lot of reasons why the commander would not want a gathering of people on the road but would be willing to let people drive through the road.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it indicates, as the -- the barment order does, that he does see some kind of threat by allowing somebody in there who's vandalized the base in the past.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there -- can there be a temporary forfeiture of First Amendment rights?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm talking about what this case is about, which is the temporary exclusion.  Would your case be the same if Mr. Apel was barred for one year?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, he can traverse it.  He can traverse.  There -- there's no question of that.  Could he be barred from participating in protests for a year because he vandalized the base?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, why don't you take an extra 5 minutes, and -- and you can begin by answering the question: You know, the government disaggregates the discussion, and their first point in their brief is that greenhouse gases can be regulated with respect to sources that are already covered by the PSD program.  That position does not implicate your concern about the broad reach of EPA regulation, does it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand.  But they would only be applying that with respect to sources that are already required to operate under PSD permits.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You have three and a half minutes left.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  About the Best Available Control Technology, I think I have an idea of what that looks like with respect to sources already regulated, because they're relating to the NAAQS.  You know, filters, scrubbers and all that; I'm sure it's oversimplified.  But what does Best Available Control Technology look like with respect to greenhouse gases?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  All right.  But am I -- am I right because the greenhouse gases do not affect ambient air quality in a way that the current or the NAAQS provisions do?  I mean, you're dealing with regulation of energy usage, right, as opposed to emissions of lead, emissions of the other NAAQS provisions?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The same sort of thing as with, for domestic uses, the energy efficient light bulbs?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but my point is it relates to energy consumption as opposed to particulate emission.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you -- if you regulate -- I'm talking about your two distinct arguments in your -- in your brief.  If you prevail on the first: In other words, greenhouse gases may be regulated with respect to sources that are already subject to permitting, my understanding, it gets you to 83 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Prevailing on the second argument gets you to 86 percent.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So this is a fight -- putting aside your first argument -- about an additional 3 percent, and yet according to the Petitioners that brings in this huge regulatory problem, of, you know, regulating the high school football game and -- and what-not.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The lights at the game.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  I didn't get an answer to -- hear an answer to Justice Alito's question and I think it's an important one.  There are currently criteria pollutants under the -- under the Act.  Let's assume you find out that there's a particular substance that does cause harm to ambient air quality that is not already covered, and you publish a NAAQS for that, can you decide that 100 and 250, you want to regulate at a different threshold, just like you have here.  I mean, is this a particular assertion of authority only with respect to greenhouse gases or does it cover any pollutant under the Act VERRI: Well, if you're -- if you're going to use the NAAQS approach and designate it as a NAAQ, as a NAAQS pollutant and pollutants, and that wouldinclude this standard.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can you public a NAAQ for greenhouse gases?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Let's pick -- there is a pollutant that isn't currently regulated, and science advances to the point where you think it should be regulated.  Can you change the 100 and 250 thresholds for that new covered pollutant?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's the 80 -- that's the 8386 question, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that has local effects.  I mean, everybody knows there's smog in Los Angeles versus Montana, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You've got to follow -- you've got to follow the plain text of the statute there.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, but the plan of the statute is 250 tons per year, too; and you've changed that to 100,000 tons per year.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  --You had already gotten going.  I didn't want to disturb -- you don't think that greenhouse gases should be regulated at the 250-tons-per-year level, right?  You said Congress did not intend that, and it would be absurd.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what level do you think they should be regulated at?  In other words, what intelligible principle are you taking from the statute to say we're going to -- we're at 100 now.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's -- I was just going to say, that just is because of, in the latter case, because contribution happens to be used in both an affirmative and a negative sense.  The question is, for example, whether somebody who fatally stabs somebody and someone who fatally shoots them have each significantly contributed to the bad result.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Or -- or not significantly contributed in -- in -- contributed in varying degrees.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, when you mention the fact that the States didn't address the good neighbor requirement, of course you hadn't come up with their budgets that they had to meet at the time that they had to promulgate their SIPs.  Now, at a different point in your brief you emphasize how incredibly complicated it is for States to determine how much they must reduce their emissions to take care of the fact that they significantly contributed to downwind pollution.  And yet you would impose on those States the burden to issue the good neighbor program without knowing how much you expect them to -- to meet.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you were working for one of the upwind States and you were facing this 3-year deadline and EPA had not told anyone how it intended to interpret the State's obligations under the good neighbor policy, what would you have told the State to do.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  So -- but the head of the State EPA comes to you and says: How much do we have to reduce our emissions to satisfy our requirements?  And you would tell them what?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that kind of glosses over the fact that, as you say elsewhere in your brief, this is a -- is your analogy, right -- a spaghetti matrix or something?  And so there's no possible way for the State to know how much of a burden you expect them to address.  And Yet you're saying, well, you've got to do it and you've got to do it within 3 years, or we're going to take over the responsibility.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But could I address the first thing first?  I'm not sure that's right.  I think EPA has an easier job dealing with it as a group.  They say, look, here are these States, here's what you have to do.  But any individual State has no idea what its particular role is going to be in your group resolution.   INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  We're dealing with a term that could be read in many different ways: exceptional.  Right?  Maybe that means one out of a hundred; maybe it means ten out of a hundred.  And why shouldn't we give some deference to the decision of the Court that was set up to develop patent law in a uniform way?  They have a much better idea than we do about the consequences of these fee awards in particular cases.  And since we're just -- as Justice Kennedy pointed out -- dealing with adjectives, you know -- meritless, frivolous, exceptional -- why don't give some deference to their judgment?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you agree with the Solicitor General's test that fees are authorized when they are -- I'm quoting -- ""necessary to prevent gross injustice""?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well now, I was surprised at that because I would have thought your friend on the other side would say that.  I mean, gross injustice sounds like a very tiny portion of cases, lower than meritless.  It's -- injustice is bad too.  It's doesn't mean you just loss, but there's something very unjust about it.  Gross injustice, well, it's just some more adjectives, and it's the test -- I gather that's the test you adopt.   John G.

Such awards can be proper in unusual cases where the losing party has committed bad faith or harassing conduct during the litigation or has advanced objectively unreasonable legal arguments, just as courts had held under the 1946 statute.  The Court should restore this understanding of Section 285 and make four additional points that we think will clarify the inquiry for the District Courts:  First and most importantly, the Court should say that baselessness and bad faith do not both have to be present in a case in order to justify a fee award;--  Second, the Court should -- the Court should say that District Courts can grant fees based on a combination of different factors even if no single factor would necessarily support the award on its own;--  Third, the Court should say that an objectively unreasonable argument can trigger a fee award even if that argument is not so unreasonable that it's actually considered frivolous;--  And fourth, the Court should say that clear and convincing evidence is not required.  I'd like to turn to Justice Scalia's question and the discussion that occurred earlier about the battle of the adjectives, so to speak.  We think that, as I said earlier, that a fee award should be appropriate or can be appropriate in a case in which there's an objectively unreasonable litigating position or objectively unreasonable arguments that are made in a case.  We appreciate that that's not a 100 percent precise bright-line test, but we think it's similar to -- it's in fact the same as what the Court has said in other contexts, such as EJA in the Pierce case--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So where does gross injustice come from?  I understood that to be your test.  You say,  ""Fees are authorized when necessary to prevent gross injustice to the defendant. ""  I think, again, you have your long laundry list that doesn't say anything about gross injustice.   Roman Martinez  Well, I think the long laundry list reflects the kinds of circumstances in which courts operating between 1946 and 1952 interpreting the prior statute, those are the circumstances in which those courts had concluded that there was a gross injustice.  So in other words, we think gross injustice is maybe the umbrella term and--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Phillips.  Mr. Phillips.     Carter G. Phillips  That it's not in the -- that it's not before us.  The rationale of clear and convincing obviously is that -- is whether you assume that patent is being implemented in good faith or being -- being brought in good faith and therefore creates sort of a presumption in favor of the -- of infringement and legitimacy; and then clear and convincing evidence is obviously designed to make it harder to get over that hurdle.  Again I -- I'm not here to defend the clear and convincing evidence standard.  I -- I read the concurring opinion in the Federal Circuit as well and -- but it seems to me clearly not in this case.  It's not subsumed by the question presented and that's -- that's an issue that the Court ought to wait for another day.  Hopefully I won't have to defend it at that time.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you say on page 17 of your brief that this Court has applied the manifest-injustice exception to limits created by Congress.  What's your best case for that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you mean, acts of Congress?  Your sentence says, applied at the limits created by Congress.  I read that to mean statutes of limitations, but that's wrong?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  With 2255, remind me?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And said what with respect to time--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Said what with respect to the time limits?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So when you said limits, you didn't mean time limits; you meant substantive limits?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Procedural limits.  Do you have a case that applies it to time limits, which of course is the question we have here.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  You said limits created by Congress.  So just -- I mean, I should read “ limits created by Congress ” not to mean time limits, but procedural or other limits.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  I guess that's the point of my questioning and your friend's position.  There have never been any time limits created by Congress that have been abrogated by a manifest-injustice exception.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  And the difference is in Holland we are dealing with equitable tolling, which had applied as far back as, you know, whatever the law goes to limitations; in other words, equitable tolling which is different from the abrogation I think that you are asking for.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not sure that's right.  They don't want to definitely file within one year if they don't have anything to say.  You know, if it takes a certain amount of time before they either acquire it legitimately or can find somebody or, I don't know, in this case, the codefendant dies, everybody has no reason any more to object and pin it on him.  There are a lot of reasons that it's in some of these prisoners' interest to drag things out and then to file.  They don't have anything to say within the one year and need time to either, from your point of view, legitimately develop the evidence, or, from your friend's point of view, to concoct it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your friend responds to that point, I think, by saying that every State allows collateral review in that instance and that what we're talking about is simply preclusion of the second bite at the apple or a third bite at the apple, I guess, by -- by assumption in the Federal system.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Saharsky.     Nicole A. Saharsky  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The only question before the Court is whether the courts below were right to bar this suit entirely on laches ground.  And on that question, we agree entirely with Petitioner, that the suit should not have been barred at the outset.  But it is the government's view that laches is available in extraordinary cases to bar copyright infringement claims brought within the statute of limitations for 2 reasons.  First of all, laches, like equitable tolling and other equitable principles, was a background principle that Congress acted against when it enacted the statute of limitations and it said nothing to bar it.  We've already had the discussion here at Court today about the text and how it doesn't bar it.  But second, for the reasons that Justice Kagan gave, the copyright situation is unique in that there is this separate accrual rule which allows a person to sue many years after the infringing conduct started so that it makes sense to at least be able to consider laches.  Now, our view, though--   ",12-1315

They -- they can all get together and say we want to prepare an antitrust expert report about what American Express is doing, and they do, and then presumably, one of them can use it in the arbitration.  Any problem with that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, again, that doesn't seem too difficult.

Roberts, Jr.  What is -- tell me how the no -- no sharing of information and confidentiality, how does that work again?  You can't, if you're a trade association, get together and say, I think we should have a study of Amex's whatever.  And then you put together the study, and then one of your members says, you know, that's a good study, I'm going to go -- go to arbitration.  They can't do that?   INTERRUPTING John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Finish your answer.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but it's not exactly -- this is not the only clause that provides for arbitration.  It is not the standard boilerplate so you could say when he interprets it, he's really making a decision about arbitrability.  And you can follow -- I mean, you may disagree with it, I may disagree with it -- but you understand the reasoning.  It says, no civil action be brought, all such disputes will go to arbitration, this is a class action, this is a civil action, so it must go to arbitration, and therefore, it's there.  Now, you -- you may not agree with it, but it -- it at least purports to be an interpretation of the language rather than a general rule.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Katz?     Eric D. Katz  But here, both sides, Mr. Chief Justice, expressly asked the arbitrator.  This is not a question of arbitrability because both sides wanted the arbitrator to make that decision.  Then even after 2010, when it came to light that Bazzle -- there was a plurality and the issue of whether it's a question of arbitrability is an open question; Oxford didn't go running to court then.  Instead, it went back to the arbitrator and said, we want you to reconsider your 2003 decision.  And the arbitrator again went through the analysis of interpreting the agreement and the representations made by the parties about what that agreement meant.  I submit we have to -- if we trust arbitrators to handle such important issues as civil rights issues and other very important matters of singular importance, we have to expect that they will follow the precepts of this Court and the FAA as to what constitutes grounds for class arbitration.  I think the Third Circuit should be affirmed, if there are no other questions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Katz.  Mr. Waxman, you have 2 minutes remaining.     ",12-135X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think that's inconsistent with the law that's developed -- actually in fairness to the arbitrator, after he'd made his initial decision, which is that if you have something that just says disputes and doesn't address the issue of class arbitration at all, that you can't have class arbitration.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could you get back -- I'm sorry, go ahead.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Getting back to Justice Breyer's question, I thought his -- First Options is fairly strong authority for him, because there you have a situation with the arbitrator determining that a particular entity or individual is bound by the agreement.  And we said that's something that we will review de novo without deference.  Why isn't it the same here?  In other words, not everything an arbitrator says is subject to the deferential standard of review, even if he purports to say I'm interpreting the agreement, which I think the arbitrator in First Options did?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the difference is in First Options.  The one thing First Options says is the question of who's going to be bound by arbitration is decided by the court de novo.  And in the class context, you are binding 19,999 individuals who did not agree to be bound, depending upon the particular interpretation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And this may not -- I'm not sure it's relevant, but it -- it might be.  I thought the purpose of arbitration was to decide these things quickly.  This has been going on 11 years, right?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not -- it's not a facetious question, because I think one of the concerns about class arbitration is that it -- it eliminates the supposed benefits of arbitration, because you can't have sort of quick and rough and ready determinations when it's going to bind 20,000 people.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but surely--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I'm sorry.  Finish your answer.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But under -- under -- that provision, the partiality provision, is addressed to favoring one party as opposed to another party.  I think Justice Kennedy's question goes to an institutional concern about an arbitrator making a decision of this sort that goes, not to partiality between parties, but a problem about the way the system would work, that would create an incentive for an arbitrator, implicit or explicit, to reach a ruling that expands his authority.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't understand that point.  Are you saying the first episode of domestic violence wouldn't qualify?  You keep talking about a pattern of behavior.

Roberts, Jr.  So it's not a limiting term at all.  Anytime anything happens, you would say there is physical force involved.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if I did the same thing to two different people and one is injured and the other isn't, I am using physical force one time but not the other time?   INTERRUPTING John G.

So if they bump against the wall and that injures somebody but doesn't injure another person, it's use of physical force in one case but not the other?   INTERRUPTING John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Rothfeld, you still owe Justice Breyer an answer.   INTERRUPTING ",12-1371
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's not true.  There are numerous statutory regimes where Congress has decided, for example, it's valuable to give people a period of time to negotiate or discuss before you can go into -- into court.  I mean, the EEOC and other sorts of things saying, let's everybody, you know, step back.  You have to negotiate for six months or you can't sue for another eight months.  And a lot of times nobody think that's going to change anything, but you can understand Argentina or any other country saying, look, before we're going to arbitrate, you know, try our courts, you may find -- you may be surprised, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's -- it seems to me that this is a difficulty for you, the structure of the treaty.  I mean, if you just end it after one, nobody would say, oh, they must be contemplating arbitration or arbitration is in the background.  They would say, look, you have got a dispute, if you don't resolve it you bring it in court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Nothing about arbitration even in the background.  Then they say: If you want to go to arbitration, you can.  So when you look at just the structure, it seems to suggest that Article I, 8(1) is not part of the arbitration provision.  It stands there and says, this is what you do, and then the arbitration kicks in later.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your argument would be better there if this was Article VIII, you know, arbitration of disputes or, you know, parties can arbitrate but first they must do this.  No, it just says settlement of disputes.  The first thing is you can go to court here.  The second thing is if you want to arbitrate, you do this.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you want to accept the invitation to arbitrate that is in 8(2).  If you don't, if you go to 8(1), which doesn't say anything, then presumably the decision of the tribunal will be binding.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Anders.     Ginger D. Anders  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The government's position in this case is based on the fact that this case involves a bilateral investment treaty in which the state parties set forth a standing offer to arbitrate in the treaty itself.  Because it's the treaty that determines whether there is an arbitration agreement in this case, principles of treaty interpretation have to be used to assess whether there is an agreement.  So therefore, applying the domestic law presumptions that are set forth in Howsam to this type of investor-state arbitration we think would not be appropriate.  Howsam shouldn't apply by its terms because the question here is a question of treaty interpretation, not a question of the likely expectations of parties to a domestic commercial contract.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Briefly.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Blackman?     Jonathan I. Blackman  No.  But in this case what would happen would be what happened in First Options and often happens, one party invokes arbitration and the other party says, I never agreed to arbitrate with you.  It would be very imprudent for the defendant in that case to do nothing and default.  And you said in First Options specifically, you don't need to do that.  So you present the issue to the arbitrators and you would then argue that there's no agreement and the arbitrators would say, well, there is an agreement or a condition was excused.  And ultimately, on judicial review, on your facts, undoubtedly a court would be likely to find, well, of course, they did their best.  They tried to comply with a condition.  But that doesn't affect, to use my friend's terminology, the question presented, which is who decides in the first instance and then finally.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the problem is--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --You're -- it's a point on which I'm regularly confused.  You just said if we had this provision in a contract with -- a private contract that said you must sue us, but there you have already a formed separate agreement to arbitrate.  And it seems to me clear that those, what do you call them, preconditions or whatever, that that -- the argument that that's for the arbitrator to decide.  They may well decide that, you know, you didn't comply so you don't get to arbitrate.  But it seems to me, typically, under First Options and Howsam that is for the arbitrator.  Now, what makes it distinct in your case?  What, is it just the order that they're in or what?  Or is it something special about a sovereign's agreement?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It all gets down to the question, how do we tell, you know, the contract formation from the blue paper, right?  I mean, if it says, you know, we agree to arbitrate and we use these rules and those rules say you have to have it on blue paper and it's not on blue paper, they say, oh, we didn't agree to have it not on blue paper.

Our cases are focused on the concern that the State is going to impose on the manufacturer a different duty than the Federal government.  That's not what's going on in a strict liability regime.  They're saying, we're not saying you should have a different structure, we're not saying anything about warning; we're saying if you do this, you're going to have to pay for the damage.  It's not -- it's not a different duty.  And I think that's what's underlying the argument that, well, you can just stop selling, because you don't have to adjust how you're going to make the drug.  You understand that it's going to be the same as the Federal drug, but our system is, you pay for the damage.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But is that meeting a standard under State law that your friend's argument says, that's not what we're talking about here.  The standard is the same.  It's just a question under strict liability that if you follow the same Federal standard and market this in our State, you're going to pay the compensation for the reason of, you know, spreading the costs.  We don't want you to do something different.  We just want to say that you want to do the same thing as the Federal government, and then you're going to have to pay.  It's different than the -- at least that's how I understand their argument, which is that it's different where the situation says, yes, you can market it and avoid payment, but only if you do it our way.

They said the risks outweigh the benefits, period.  So you should not market this at all.  And it does seem inconsistent with the -- the Federal regime.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what do you in that case?  You've got one jury saying the risks outweigh the benefits; can't do it.  And then you're saying well, later, there might be another jury saying yes, you can.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you are saying there is a huge difference between saying you didn't put the warning in, so you are liable for $9 million, and saying, you are liable for $15 million, but if you put the warning in, you are only liable for 9 million?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But -- but just to get back to my -- to my question.  You say there is a difference between saying, you have to put on warning and you are going to be liable if you don't, and saying, you are liable no matter no matter what, because it's strict liability, but if you put on a warning it's reduced.

That -- that may be true in terms of who they want to represent, but -- but a State can't authorize anyone to proceed in Federal court, because that would leave the definition under Article III of the Federal Constitution as to who can bring -- who has standing to bring claims up to each State.

Perhaps you could address your jurisdictional argument?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose there might be people out there with their own personal standing, someone who performs marriages and would like that to remain open to everyone but would prefer not to perform same-sex marriages, or other people.  We seem to be addressing the case as if the only options are the proponents here or the State.  I'm not sure there aren't other people out there with individual personalized injury that would satisfy Article III.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You should feel free to move on to the merits.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not sure, counsel, that it makes -- I'm not sure that it's right to view this as excluding a particular group.  When the institution of marriage developed historically, people didn't get around and say let's have this institution, but let's keep out homosexuals.  The institution developed to serve purposes that, by their nature, didn't include homosexual couples.  It is -- yes, you can say that it serves some of the other interests where it makes sense to include them, but not all the interests.  And it seems to me, your friend argues on the other side, if you have an institution that pursues additional interests, you don't have to include everybody just because some other aspects of it can be applied to them.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, that's only because Proposition 8 came 140 days after the California Supreme Court issued its decision.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And don't you think it's more reasonable to view it as a change by the California Supreme Court of this institution that's been around since time immemorial?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so your case -- your case would be different if Proposition 8 was enacted into law prior to the California Supreme Court decision?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's just about -- it's just about the label in this case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Same-sex couples have every other right, it's just about the label.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure.  If you tell -- if you tell a child that somebody has to be their friend, I suppose you can force the child to say, this is my friend, but it changes the definition of what it means to be a friend.  And that's it seems to me what the -- what supporters of Proposition 8 are saying here.  You're -- all you're interested in is the label and you insist on changing the definition of the label.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do we know -- how do we know that that's the reason, or a necessary part of the reason, that we've recognized marriage as a fundamental right?  That's -- you've emphasized that and you've said, well, it's because of the emotional commitment.  Maybe it is the procreative aspect that makes it a fundamental right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  General Verrilli?     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't think you're going to get away with not starting with the jurisdictional question, do you?  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Breyer.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't want to -- I want you to get back to Justice Alito's other points, but is it the position of the United States that same-sex marriage is not required throughout the country?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you can go on.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you are willing to wait in the rest of the country.  You saying it's got to happen right now in California, but you don't even have a position about whether it's required in the rest of the country.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's got to happen right away in those States where same-sex couples have every legal right that married couples do.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you can wait in States where they have fewer legal rights.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can I ask you a problem about--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I -- it seems to me that your position that you are supporting is somewhat internally inconsistent.  We see the argument made that there is no problem with extending marriage to same-sex couples because children raised by same-sex couples are doing just fine and there is no evidence that they are being harmed.  And the other argument is Proposition 8 harms children by not allowing same-sex couples to marriage.  Which is it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you also tell me there has been no harm shown to children of same-sex couples.   ",12-144X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  In -- in the situation that Justice Alito hypothesized of the person who's doing this several times a month and has the ad in the Yellow Pages, is that -- is that person subject to regulation as a dealer?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Palmore.     Joseph R. Palmore  Right.  I think if -- if the Petitioner changed his mind and decided not to actually transfer it, I think, as a technical matter, that wouldn't affect the legality because what mattered was, was he making a purchase on behalf of another and entering a false statement at the time he made it.  A fact question could arise in a -- in a situation like that, which a defendant could argue, I wasn't actually making the purchase on behalf of someone else, and that argument is supported by subsequent events.  But I think we were -- I was about to say that the one critical purpose of the statute, obviously, was to keep firearms out of the hands of ineligible persons, but another critical purpose was to offer the tracing of firearms and to prevent the anonymous stockpiling of firearms.  And with respect to that purpose, I think the facts of some of the cases underlying the circuit split on the second issue of materiality are quite salient.  Those are all cases in which eligible parties wanted to anonymously obtain large quantities of firearms for illicit reasons.  They were eligible, but they had -- they wanted to not have their name associated with the transaction.  So Polk, which is the Fifth Circuit case, which is actually on Petitioner's side, that person wanted to anonymously acquire firearms to create a stockpile to attack an IRS building, to kill police officers, and to assassinate a judge.  But he was eligible.  In Frazier and Morales, which are the Eleventh and Sixth Circuit cases addressing this materiality issue, there were straw purchases on behalf of eligible buyers, but they were, again, wanting to anonymously stockpile weapons and not have their names associated with them because they were smuggling them out of the country.  And the Petitioner's view of the statute in which a straw purchaser can satisfy the requirement that the first transaction, at the point of sale be recorded would completely satisfy the statutory requirements, would greatly impair the ability of ATF to trace firearms and to have an accurate record of who that first purchaser of the firearm was.  If there are no further questions, we'd ask that the judgment of the court of appeals be affirmed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Dietz, you have four minutes.     ",12-1493

Roberts, Jr.  I think it's very -- it's very problematic to talk about the overriding purpose when you're dealing with a very sensitive compromise.  There's, as far as I can tell, nothing in the language of the statute that talks about straw men or actual buyers or anything like that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but there wasn't -- there wasn't a strong lobby in Congress saying we're the group that supports Ponzi schemes, so maybe it makes more sense to have a broad construction of that provision.  This language is fought over tooth and nail by people on the, you know, gun control side and the gun ownership side.  And to say -- you look at it and say well, the purpose is this, even though there's no words in the statute that have anything to do with straw purchasers, I think, is very problematic.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you agree that in Justice Alito's example, that person is regulated as a gun dealer, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The Yellow Pages.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  They're putting an ad--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Now, this -- this -- now you're talking about the second question.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And the provision that makes the -- the information that's required, makes it material -- correct me if I'm wrong -- is 922(b)(5), right?  That's what requires--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Okay.  Now, all that says is you have to keep the information of the person to whom you're transferring the firearm.  So your argument has to be, when somebody sees the person, they realize that that means not somebody who's buying it for somebody else, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.  I know.  If I assume -- if I assume you're right, then you're right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because then 922(b)(5) says, but the fact that it's -- has to be the actual person who ends up with the gun.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  General Verrilli.     Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --Your Honor, so long as the treaty -- it's a valid exercise of the treaty power, I think a fortiori if all you do is implement the treaty in haec verba, it's a valid exercise of Congress' power.  And I will say, I said earlier that this is serious business.  I understand that principles of federalism are serious business also, but federalism is a two-way street.  And with respect to the exercise of the treaty power, the Framers made a judgment that this power was going to be exclusively in the hands of the national government.  And it needed to be exclusively in the hands of the national government in order to ensure that the United States could be a full sovereign on the world stage.  Now, it is true that the subject matter of treaties is different now than it was at the time of the founding, but the Framers understood that.  They were careful not to impose subject matter limitations on the treaty power because they were wise enough to know they could not foresee what might be important for the United States to be able to negotiate about on a world stage in order to participate fully as a sovereign.  And the Chemical Weapons Convention is a deeply apt illustration of exactly why the Framers were wise in ensuring that there were not subject matter limitations on the exercise of the treaty power.  The Chemical Weapons Convention -- the United States' leadership in the Chemical Weapons Convention has made a big difference in ensuring that this norm, which is in our national interests, our foreign relations interests, and our national security interest, is a norm that the nations of the world have agreed to and that we are then in a position to have leverage to insist that the nations of the world abide by it.  It is leverage we are trying to exercise right now.  It is critically important, and I respectfully submit that the line that the Petitioner is asking this Court to draw is not consistent with the intent of the Framers, with this Court's precedent or with the national interests that I have described.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.  Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining.     ",12-158X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  General, let's suppose there's a multilateral treaty, the -- the international convention to ensure that national legislatures have full authority to carry out their obligations, i.e., that the national legislature has the police power.  And Congress passes a statute saying we have the authority to prosecute purely local crimes pursuant to this international convention that the President has signed.  Any problem with that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And just to press it further, the -- the point is that it's a transfer of authority from the States to the national legislature.  I don't know why you'd look to the national legislature to say, well, we'd never do that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  At a time when the Senate was elected by the State legislatures.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't know why it would not be a valid exercise of the treaty power.  A case like Medellin caused serious conflict with our international obligations because we held, look, the Federal Government does not have the authority to tell the sheriff in Texas what to do.  That caused a great deal of strain in -- in our international relations.  And I think the United Nations could well say, look, we don't want treaty parties to have to deal with whether it's somebody in this State or somebody in that province who has the authority, so every signatory must have the authority.  It doesn't strike me as not reasonably related to international obligations.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  I know your -- I know the case--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --So the -- the purpose of my hypothetical was try to find out if there's any situation in which you believe an erosion or intrusion by the Federal Government on the police power could be a constraint against an international treaty.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it seems to me that if you say there may be an outer bound but this case isn't one of them, you're subjecting yourself to the same criticisms that have been leveled against the other side, that you're proposing a case-by-case evaluation with respect to each treaty.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But there are a lot of treaties, particularly I think Justice Alito pointed out, after the World War II era where you have international conventions affecting everything.  We have international conventions on the abduction of children, international conventions that -- human rights.  They cover a vast swath of -- of subject matter.  And it seems to me the only thing you're saying that is a limit on what the treaty power can be as a source for is some determination, no more -- less -- no less arbitrary than the lines other people are asking us to draw between what's appropriate under the treaty power and what's not.  And I just would like a fairly precise answer whether there are or are not limitations on what Congress can do with respect to the police power.  If their authority is asserted under a treaty, is their -- is their power to intrude upon the police power unlimited?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  The treaty is valid.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you would rather have the Court determine, if we're concerned about the intrusion on the police power, whether treaties are valid or not than whether -- determine whether particular implementing legislation is valid or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know this case.  The point of the hypothetical is I'm trying to get your general principle.  I can imagine treaties that you would say are within the treaty power, again, particularly in the post-World War II era, but that could give rise to implementing legislation that I think would be extraordinary from the point of view of the framers and the power that it gave Congress to intrude upon State authority.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's -- it's kind of question begging.  I mean, the whole point is that some people think we do have exactly that in this case.  Now, usually when we have a case that implicates significant and serious bilateral concerns, we get a lot of briefs and all that from our -- our treaty partners.  Is -- is there any concern that's been expressed in any concrete way by them about whether Mrs. Bond is prosecuted?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  Yes.  So nothing in--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I'm sure that the people who've worked in the national branch of government, particularly for the State Department, would like to have as much authority as they can get to negotiate treaties.  We're concerned about limitations on other.  Do we have any briefs from State legislatures, State authorities, concerning intrusion on their prerogatives?   ",12-158X

Yablon  --You should say that those inferences are not adequate to overcome the inference that you draw from this type of participation, particularly here.  I mean, consider the change in judge.  The reason this hearing occurred before the magistrate judge is because the defendant sent a letter to the district court asking -- explaining his problems with his counsel.  He got a response from the magistrate judge.  So in the defendant's mind, the magistrate judge and the district court are effectively one and the same, and you would not want a system where district courts are encouraged to send these issues to magistrate judges, so magistrate judges can engage in these kind of comments, but then the district judge can basically just cleanse it.  It is going to affect the way that the process plays out.  Now, the speedy trial issue, if I may just -- we can equally draw the inference that that was only done because counsel wanted to put some pressure on the government to actually reach a deal.

There's a -- a plea bargain on the table for one year and the judge says, you should know that I -- I have these cases a lot.  The last ten cases that went to trial where the defendant was found guilty, I sentenced them to a minimum of 12 years.  Pure facts.  The facts might have the effect of pushing the defendant one way or another, but it's also factual information of which he ought to be aware.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, we do need to have a good sense of how far your -- your per se structural argument is going to reach before we decide -- in deciding whether it's appropriate or not.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what about the hypothetical that I posed?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if he -- if it's my example and he says, this is what I've done the past ten times, so you ought to think long and hard about whether a bargain for one year is a good deal.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's kind of a fine line to -- to draw, isn't it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now -- well, but you've answered a lot of these questions by saying, you know, it's hard to draw the line and, you know, maybe in that case, maybe in this case.  Most -- our precedents where we recognize structural error and -- and plain error are ones that are pretty easily categorized.  Did a magistrate conduct voir dire or did he not?  You know right away one way or the other.  Did he participate enough?  You know, well, if he told them how many times he sentenced people this way, it's not, but if he said you ought to -- you ought to pay attention to what I'm telling you when you'd consider whether to plea or not, well, then it is.  It -- it seems to me in the typical plain error cases, we're very -- the categories are very sharply defined.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I would say in both of those examples, the line -- the gray area, if you were, is really quite narrow than here, where almost every time you've been asked a question about a difficult hypothetical, you say, well, maybe, maybe not.  And I think that's quite different than saying is the court closed or not or was the person -- you know, did he represent himself in fact or not.  And those just strike me as much easier cases.   INTERRUPTING John G.

He's not on parole, he's not a probationer.  You concede that the DNA evidence can be taken from him, correct?   John G.

I mean, if you're in the interview room or something, you take a drink of water, you leave, you're done.  I mean, they can examine the DNA from that drink of water.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Doesn't that compromise the -- the expectation of privacy?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, it's not a--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --My question was not trying to get at whether it's a search or not, it's whether -- it's getting at the reasonableness of the expectation of privacy that the -- your DNA is protected from examination when it's left wherever you happened to have been.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I mean, isn't that part of the -- isn't that part of the question, whether there is a legitimate expectation of privacy in a person's DNA?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I know, but you're simply just -- you're -- I guess that's begging the question.  And -- but I'd just be repeating my question -- how legitimate is it to you to expect privacy in something that the police can access without you even knowing about it, without any voluntary or involuntary -- if you take a drink of water, if you leave behind a cigarette butt?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  There are two different, two different interests.  One is we want to solve unsolved crimes; and the other is we want to be sure -- we have someone in our custody and we want to be sure, before he is released back into the community, that he isn't a person who has committed five violent crimes before that.  Now, your brief says, well, the only interest here is the law enforcement interest.  And I found that persuasive because of the concern that it's going to take months to get the DNA back anyway, so they are going to have to release him or not before they know it.  But if we are in a position where it now takes 90 minutes or will soon take 90 minutes to get the information back, I think that's entirely different, because there you can find out whether -- it's just tied in with the bail situation, do you want to release him or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's because, that's because we are not yet at a situation where it takes 90 minutes.  Sure, it's not going to do you any good if it's taking 4 months or whatever it took in this case.  But if it's at the point where it's 90 minutes, it would be critical to make that determination.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let's put it this way.  Let's say the judge or the magistrate is going to make a bail determination and he says: Well, it's important to me to know whether you are going to commit another crime.  So we are not saying you have to give a DNA sample, but it will enter into my calculation if you refuse to do it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what does that mean?  Is that okay or not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, we do it -- doesn't that sound just like a Breathalyzer?  You are pulled over, they say, we want you to take a Breathalyzer test.

Roberts, Jr.  My hypothetical was not that you had two days and you made it in time, but that before the -- the time -- after the time expired or you were ready to file on time, but then you decided on further research, oh, this isn't going to look like we're going to comply.  We thought we had the time, but we don't.  You should still go ahead and file, right, so that you might be able to get the fees?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's a tough position, isn't it?  I mean, if you have got a difficult and tough and complicated case, well, you get no fees; but if you've got an easy one, well, then you get fees.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought you were -- I thought you were giving us that argument when you said under the fees all you need is reasonable and good faith.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So is one reason that should affect the exercise of discretion is that you didn't comply with the statute of limitations?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is the -- what's the relationship between your position and equitable tolling?  I mean, your case, I think, is unusual in that there was a fair amount of confusion about when the statute of limitations might run; that's your position.  I would think a lot of the cases where the attorney doesn't meet the limitations deadline will involve things like, you know, I was delayed by Hurricane Sandy or -- or whatever, or we were trying to file, it got lost in the mail.  Are those things that -- I mean, should that be considered under the rubric of equitable tolling, or under -- under your idea where you don't have to file on time anyway?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand that, but I would assume the more typical case is when you miss a filing deadline is because the lawyer, whether for good reasons or bad, missed the filing deadline.  And I'm just curious if you would -- if it's not sufficient to support equitable tolling, whether it is, therefore, unreasonable when it comes to attorneys' fees?   ",12-236X

Congress could pass a new law today that says, We will give Federal benefits.  When we say “ marriage ” in Federal law, we mean committed same-sex couples as well, and that could apply across the board.  Or do you think that they couldn't do that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, no, my point is: It wouldn't -- you don't think it would raise a federalism problem either, do you?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So just to be clear, you don't think there is a federalism problem with what Congress has done in DOMA?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G.

It's not very responsive to my concern I'm trying to get an answer to.  You don't think federalism concerns come into play at all in this, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know the equal protection argument.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So as soon as one State adopted same sex marriage, the definition of marriage throughout the Federal code had to change?  Because there is no doubt that up until that point every time Congress said “ marriage ” they understood they were acting under the traditional definition of marriage.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you don't think that when Congress said “ marriage ” in every one of these provisions that they had in mind same-sex marriages?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Obviously, you don't think there's an equal protection problem--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --but a federalism issue, Congress said, we're going to recognize same-sex couples -- committed same-sex couples -- even if the State doesn't, for purposes of Federal law?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I just am asking whether you think Congress has the power to interfere with the -- to not adopt the State definition if they're extending benefits.  Do they have that authority?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  I know that.  You're following the lead of the Solicitor General and returning to the Equal Protection Clause every time I ask a federalism question.  Is there any problem under federalism principles?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  With Congress passing a law saying, we are going to adopt a different definition of marriage than those States that don't recognize same-sex marriage.

Somebody calls and said this happened, this happened, this happened.  He was acting crazy.  And the next one, this happened, this happened, this happened and he's crazy.  Do you think you lose immunity in the latter case, but not the former case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You would lose in both.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  I know.  But I'm trying to find out if you think there's a difference between the person's subjective, uneducated evaluation, “ he was acting crazy ”, and a difference between that person saying “ he's crazy ”.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you're not suggesting it would be a different case if they just said he's unstable as opposed to he's mentally unstable, are you?   John G.

I have leverage against this official and if you want him to recommend yes on your investment, you have to pay me a certain amount of money.  And you can transfer that.  You've got everybody in, say, you know, the association or whatever and you can auction that off.  It seems to me it's perfectly transferable from the defendant to anyone else.   INTERRUPTING John G.

And if you have an application coming up and you want a favorable recommendation, you can go to the -- the individual that has the leverage and say, I will pay you this much money if you can get the person to give me a favorable recommendation.  And that's transferable from the person with the -- the leverage to -- to someone else.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Harrington.     Sarah E. Harrington  But this Federal crime of extortion brings with -- brings with it the baggage of the New York State extortion law, and the New York cases said in that law the word “ property ” includes the running of a business and doing a job.  It's true that that wasn't the property being extorted in those cases, but that's what they said property means.  And if you are worried that those things can't be obtained, you don't need to worry -- you don't need to have a special definition of property to take care of that, because the Hobbs Act already requires that property be obtained before there is extortion, so there is no need to have a redundancy built in for that.  Again, I can understand how -- how the main Hobbs Act, sort of heartland cases which involve the co-opting of a brick and mortar businesses, seem like easier cases.  And you might want to draw a line between the running of a business and the doing of labor.  But a person has a property interest in doing their job the same way that they have a property interest in running a business.  The fact that they work for someone else shouldn't mean that they have less of an interest in doing their job than if they run their own business.  Doing a job is a source of economic value to a person and the Court should construe it as property, and the right to exercise control over doing their job is also property.

Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no -- yes, I know.  I'm assuming it isn't, that they discover this process and it leads to a -- a particular product.

Roberts, Jr.  General Verrilli?     Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Enforcing the distinction between human invention and a product of nature preserves a necessary balance in the patent system between encouraging individual inventors and keeping the basic building blocks of innovation free for all to use.  Isolated DNA falls on the ineligible side of that divide because it is simply native DNA extracted from the body.  The claim that it is a--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I -- I thought the basic general approach here was we have a very expansive view of what is patent eligible and then we narrow things through things -- issues like obviousness and so on.  Why -- wouldn't it make more sense to address the questions at issue here in the obviousness realm?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --That's a little--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you got something that's big, it seems to me pretty obvious that you could take a smaller part of it; that the idea -- a smaller part of something that's bigger is obvious.  Now, yes, you can have a patent on the process of extracting that small part, but I don't understand how a small part of something bigger isn't obvious.  And if it is, I don't understand why this -- these issues aren't addressed at that stage.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --Well, I think my answer to that, I guess, Your Honor, would -- would point first to Mayo, in which the Court recognized that the threshold test under Section 101 for patent eligibility does do work that the obviousness test and a novelty test and a specification test do not do; and the work that it does here, I would respectfully submit, is to ensure that the natural substance, the product of nature itself, is not subjected effectively to a monopoly, because if it can be deemed to be a human invention solely as a result of the change that occurs when you extract it from the body, then that means, as a -- as a practical matter that you have granted a patent on the gene itself because no one else can extract it because extracting it is isolating it; isolating it violates the patent.  And so as a result of that, no one else can try to develop competing tests for breast cancer, no one else can try to use this gene for recombinant DNA.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm -- I'm not sure that's responsive to my concern.  Your answer said well, here are a lot of reasons why this shouldn't have patent protection.  My question goes to whether we ought to focus on those reasons at the eligibility stage or at the obviousness stage.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Well, the Court identified in Chakrabarty and then reiterated in Mayo that -- that it is -- that the right answer to that question, Your Honor, is to focus on them at the eligibility stage, because the -- because getting the balance right is of critical importance.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Briefly, please.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Yes, you certainly can, and that illustrates the difference.  That patent is just for the use; it doesn't tie up all other potential uses of the substance and that's the key.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.  Mr. Castanias?     Gregory A.

And everybody will raise that argument.  Everybody raises ineffective assistance of counsel anyway, and they will just add onto it this plea assertion.  I mean, shouldn't it be -- the Sixth Circuit really went out of its way saying there is no requirement of corroboration at all.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think the Sixth Circuit was wrong in what you are characterizing as dicta?  You think it was wrong to say that, and that the other circuits which require something in addition, that that's the rule that we should adopt?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I thought -- maybe I'm misremembering, but the Sixth Circuit distanced it itself from the other circuits, didn't it?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, it does seem to support to notion that this is something that should be left to the collective bargaining process.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, the point would be that the steelworkers gave up something when -- you know, it's part of a bargain.  Okay?  If they say, all right, we're not going to count this time, but, you know, you've got to give us ten more cents an hour or, you know, greater cafeteria facilities or something.  It's a normal part of the bargaining process.  And it seems to me that if they're willing to give it up to get something else, what's -- what's the benefit to them of saying you can't do that?

Ann O'Connell Adams  Well, Justice Breyer, they're not.  SWEB, the subsidiary of Petitioner, paid the British income tax in the same years that it paid this windfall tax, in 1997 and 1998.  And Petitioner got a dollar-for-dollar foreign tax credit for its portion of that British income tax that was paid in those years.  For any other tax that's imposed by a foreign government that's not the income tax or that's not an excess profits tax or a war profits tax, the company can get a tax deduction.  That's how classes -- or other taxes are normally treated.  You deduct from the amount of income that you are reporting to the IRS via the dollars that you paid toward that foreign tax, and the -- the value of that deduction depends on the marginal tax rate that the taxpayer is paying.  So you might get 35 cents on the dollar for every dollar that you can subtract from your income tax base.  But the dollar-for-dollar credit in section 901 is reserved for foreign taxes that have the equivalent features of the U.S. income tax, and the windfall tax simply doesn't.  It's written as a valuation formula, and it's not just written that way, but that's the substance of what it's trying to do.  It's imputing a value on each company for what the U.K. government should have charged, and it's subtracting out the amount of money that it actually received.  And I think that's an important point to keep in mind when determining what is the -- the substance of the tax, is that the U.K. government is not just going out into the world and taxing companies that it thinks are particularly profitable, to try to get more money.  The U.K. government used to own these companies, and it sold them at too low a price, and the windfall tax is an effort to get back some of that value that it should have asked for when it sold them.  Whether that's a good idea or a bad idea, it's not an income tax, in the U.S. sense, and it should not be entitled to a credit under section 901.  Thank you.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, the amicus did, but I don't think we should do a better job of getting money from people than the IRS does.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, that's a good articulation of the argument you haven't made.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought you were saying that that argument was wrong, because you looked to the predominant character of the tax and that it's either a tax -- it's either an income tax or it's not.  It wouldn't be an income tax on the vast majority of the companies where it was the same and not on the companies where it was a large value or the other way around.  You look at the predominant characteristic and you decide whether it's a tax or not on that basis.   INTERRUPTING John G.

The next year, we think its value is this because they made, you know, 10 million.  So we are going to impose this tax.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Based solely on the amount of income?   John G.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if you had a decision by the Minnesota Supreme Court on common law contract principles and it said, you know, when the parties use the word ‶ sole ″ in a contract, we interpret that to mean subject to reasonableness constraint.  The parties here use the word ‶ sole ″.  Would the application of that principle violate -- would that be preempted or not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, ‶ reasonable ″ means -- I mean, you know, the -- the airline says ‶ sole ″ means sole.  We don't have to explain why we did it.  And the Minnesota court said: No, when you say ‶ sole ″ it has to be reasonable.  It can't be, for example, for no reason.  It has to be for some articulated reason.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let's say going forward.  Going forward, the parties know that this decision is out there and they say ‶ sole ″.  So it means they're using the term subject to the gloss that's been put on it by the Minnesota Supreme Court.  So what about in that case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We would assume then that the parties knew whenever they used the word ‶ sole ″, they actually meant subject to reasonableness as interpreted by the Minnesota Supreme Court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you're not going to give me ‶ reasonable ″ for anything?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if you're going to give me ‶ reasonable ″ -- in other words, the parties' express terms do not say ‶ reasonable ″; in fact, the most natural reading is that it's not reasonable, but they take the contractual -- the interpretation that the Minnesota Supreme Court has adopted, I don't know why the same rule wouldn't apply when the Minnesota Supreme Court says there is an implied condition of reasonableness across -- across the board, and that the parties contract against that background just like they do when there's a specific interpretation of the word ‶ sole ″.   John G.

I mean, it seems to me that the loosest State from the point of view of the preemption is going to set the standard.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought your answer might have been that, yes, in fact, the property is entitled to greater protection because it's going to be used to hire counsel that will keep the person out of jail long term, even if he can be put in jail pending the trial.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And I suppose if the government knows it's got to go through a hearing where it has to lay out part of its case, it may well decide at that point it's not worth it.  So it's not 24 or 25.  Who knows how many hundreds of times the government would have sought to seize the assets but didn't because they knew they would have to justify it at a hearing.   John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But none of that goes to his ability to hire his counsel of choice.  I mean, that seems to me to make this case quite different.  It's not that property is more valuable than liberty or anything like that.  It's that the property can be used to hire a lawyer who can keep him out of jail for the next 30 years.  So the parallels don't strike me as useful.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand the theory.  In reality it's not terribly -- it's not great insulation from the overweaning power of the government.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't see what this case, frankly, has to do with the grand jury at all, or review of the grand jury determination.  You don't have to put forward in this hearing what you put forward before the grand jury at all.  You could put forth different stuff.  You could put forth less of it.  Maybe you don't want to show your -- your whole hand.  Maybe the party on the other side, they don't want to show their whole hand too, so they don't want to show all this other evidence that's going to prove -- prove their innocence.  It's an entirely separate proceeding.  Now, maybe the fact of the grand jury indictment should be given some weight or not.  But it's not reviewing a particular determination.  It's the judge making a determination on what he or she has before him at that particular hearing.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  It's not, in the sense that before the grand jury you say: Okay, here, we showed the grand jury these six things and they said yes.  You look at those six things; there's the probable cause.  At this other hearing, you say: I've got -- I'm going to show you these two things, and the other side has these three things, and the judge at that point says: Well, you don't have enough to restrain the property.  It's not reviewing the other determination.  It's an entirely separate proceeding.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's because they didn't have the good lawyers they wanted to hire.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry, are you talking about cases in like the Second Circuit and the D.C. Circuit where you do have these hearings?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I raised this point earlier.  It may be because the government, particularly when it may have tenuous probable cause basis, decides it's not worth it to go through this hearing to seize and retain the assets.  And it just seems that the statistics are phony in the sense that where the impact of this is going to be is not in reported cases; it's going to be when the U.S. attorney says it's not worth it, it would jeopardize the trial on the merits, and so they don't even go through the process of restraining the assets.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  More that the facts, since the funds are traceable anyway and they'll have an opportunity to get them at the end even if they don't get their restraining order, makes it not worth it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're making it sound like you would lose the whole case.  This, to some extent, is a little bit of a side show.  You want to send the Kaleys to jail and you want the assets that you think are traceable to it and that's all well and good.  But it's not like the whole case falls apart depending on whether or not you can restrain the assets or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, but they're--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Sure.  But now you've touched on something that I think is very pertinent.  They are used to pay restitution to the victims.  I mean, the whole point here, and presumably it's something that your friends on the other side would raise in one of these hearings is there are no victims.  Right?  That's the theory, and maybe it will fall apart and the judge will say, of course, there are victims, but as I understand it, the hospitals, you know, gave them to the people; the companies didn't want them back because they would have to give a credit.  You know, I'm sure the government has a different view of the facts, but that's a good example.  Okay, this is going to be used to pay restitution to the victims.

You have got no problem with that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You as a tribe, you as a tribe would have no objection to that action?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  We've talked about this prosecuting the employees.  I suppose if you bring a criminal action against one of the employees, the State would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this was not Indian lands?   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What Judge Sentelle said in his opinion for the D.C. Circuit is that based -- agreeing with everything you've said, that means that the misstatement of basis might be obvious on an individual partner's returns.  What's wrong with it might be obvious.  But it still is made on those returns, and therefore that doesn't fall as a partnership item.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Stewart, if I could focus at a somewhat higher level of abstraction.  I understand the general underlying thrust of your friend's position to be that overstatement of basis goes to, you know, miscalculations.  It was actually $20,000, you say it's $40,000, and that's where the penalty comes from.  Well, this case is quite different.  We are kind of wiping out the whole transaction and then you're kind of artificially saying, well, if you wipe out the whole thing, when you come to basis it should be this and that.  And -- and it's not sort of a fraud or misstatement with respect to the basis itself.  It follows from a broad sham determination and that sham determination is made at the partnership level, not the partner level.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand that.  But if you were telling people what happened here -- maybe you would -- I don't know that your first statement would be: They overstated their basis.  I think you would say: They engaged in a completely sham transaction, which had -- which had some obvious, as the D.C. Circuit put it, some obvious consequences.  But still, the -- the driving determination was that it was a sham transaction.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Garre.     Gregory G. Garre  --If the noneconomic substance transaction penalty that was enacted in 2010 was on the books, what would happen is a court could determine the applicability of that penalty, which is based on what the partnership did at the partnership proceeding, and we would agree that penalty applies.  All the problems are solved by what Congress did to address this particular situation.  The Government is trying to put that square peg in a round hole.  And if you add everything up, I think what's -- what's interesting about the Government's reply brief is it doesn't contest that -- that if there's any ambiguity here, the statute has to be read in favor of the taxpayer.  And that's because of the canon that this Court has recognized that tax penalties are strictly construed in favor of the taxpayer.  Here, at a bare minimum, there is ambiguity as to whether the Congress that passed the valuation misstatement penalty ever intended it to apply to this fundamentally different situation where no one disagrees about the numbers reported on the return.  Again, if you go to the partnership return, the transactions are accurately reported.  If you go to the outside bases, it's true that they reported a loss, but that's because they were following the IRS' rules about how you treat contingent liabilities.  So that number is actually accurate under the IRS' rules.  That's why the IRS has to come up with a sham to get rid of the property altogether and say that we are going to pretend that it doesn't exist at all.  But, again, that's not a valuation misstatement.  When the penalty talks about correct amounts, about accuracy, about value, it's trying to get at the number that the thing is worth.  It is not concerned with a situation in which the IRS is claiming that the property doesn't exist at all.  That -- that is a different problem.  Congress addressed it in a direct way, in a noneconomic substance penalty.  So this Court doesn't have to worry about this problem being unaddressed.  But what it should do is correctly interpret the penalty that Congress enacted, which was on the books when these events occurred, which is the valuation misstatement penalty and not the all-encompassing basis overstatement penalty.  I think if you're going to read one of the amicus briefs, read the Shakow amicus brief.  It talks about all the additional situations which IRS or Congress never applied this penalty to which would be swept in by the government's position here today.  Thank you very much.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Stewart, you have five minutes left.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Perhaps--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Let me -- let me pose perhaps a less friendly question.  [Laughter]  What do you do with your friend's hypothetical?  On the tax returns you say: I gave a painting to a charity worth a million dollars, in fact he did not.  And he says: What you are doing is you are going to go in and say: That wasn't worth a million dollars; it was worth nothing.  When in fact what you should be saying is: You didn't give the painting at all.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but if you determine that the partnerships were shams, that's like saying that there were no partnerships.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And if you say, you know, I didn't really give the painting, that means that there wasn't any painting.  It seems to me they're pretty closely parallel.   John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You say that -- you say that that's not true because individual partners may respond differently to the partnership determination with respect to basis.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  And now, I suspect that those will be only in rare circumstances.  And I guess that's why the D.C. Circuit said, even though the result here may be obvious, it nonetheless depends on the outside basis determination.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And I think what I understand your friend to be saying is it's not just that it's obvious, but it's ineluctable, and therefore, it doesn't depend on the outside partnership determinations.

Neal Kumar Katyal  No, Your Honor, our brief at Page 36 points out that under Kansas law it's an element of the offense, they carry the burden of proof.  In the Sixth Circuit decision in United States versus Davis, I think, explains that in a circumstance like this, like involuntary intoxication, the defendant is not interjecting some new issue into the trial.  The defendant is simply rebutting the premeditation argument which is their burden to prove.  And if you accept their argument here, you're essentially saying that the defendant's own words can be used by the State to shoulder the load against him.  And that is something foreign to the Fifth Amendment.  It may be something you want to do for policy reasons.  I understand that.  But it is not something this Court has ever accepted.

You don't want to take him away from his family, because that will penalize other people.  And then Congress thinks that's not a good idea and they take that away.  Is that an ex post facto violation?  It increases the factors of -- or the risk that the defendant will get a higher sentence before he could take advantage of the fact that he had, you know, a particular family situation.  Later, he could not.  That's a change in what the sentencing court must consider and is to his prejudice.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, under -- under our modification of the guidelines approach, isn't that just a list of factors that the Court should consider, or must consider?   INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you're pushing this start to the statute of limitations period, and your answer to the problems is: Well, don't worry.  If it ever turns into something that's going to be enforced, we won't enforce it, or it won't be enforceable without a judicial determination about equitable estoppel and all these other things that are very difficult to apply.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but there's no -- there's no employer who is going to have a plan put together and say, well, I'm not going to do this unless the statute of limitations for claims runs from the proof of loss.  And if you tell me it's got to run from the exhaustion of remedies, I'm just not going to give a benefit plan.  That's an implausible scenario.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's hard to see what you mean by the exceeding rarity.  I suspect there are more than nine cases where people are looking at the running of the statute of limitations and they're saying, well, I've got to sue if I don't get this and when do I have to hire a lawyer.  And the last thing you want in this process is to get lawyers involved at the claim procedure.  And they say, well, there's only 10 months left, I'd better hire a lawyer, you know, and instead of the informal resolution, you've suddenly got lawyers involved.  Why isn't that a legitimate concern?  On the other hand, if you wait until the claim is exhausted, you may -- you may not need the lawyer at all.  But if you don't know when that period is going to run, you'd better get one early -- sooner rather than later.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, she was very prudent.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, she didn't know when it was going to run, you'd better get somebody in there right away.  The typical lay person who's got a claim for $9,000 in disability benefits or whatever, you know, may not know.  Better get a lawyer to tell her.  It just seems to me that you keep it as an informal resolution -- inexpensive resolution process if you tell somebody look, you don't have to worry about getting a lawyer until we tell you whether we're going to deny your claims or not.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's my point.  I'm not talking about the need to go to litigation.  I think there are probably more than 9 people who had to hire lawyers before they even had a decision.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, and it's probably a claimant that doesn't have all that much experience in the legal system and doesn't know how long does it take, you know, to get a complaint ready and -- I don't know.  It just seems to me that the problem of a statute of limitations that runs before the claim even accrues requires people to worry about their legal rights in a way that -- the simple rule about when your benefits are denied, that's when the period starts running.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it would be -- when you say it would be written that way, it would be by not claiming one step in the method, I assume, which changes the whole patent.

Roberts, Jr.  I suppose that's true in every case we hear.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You could.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. Anders.     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Federal Circuit's holding that a party may be liable for inducing infringement under Section 271(b), even though no one has committed direct infringement, is wrong for two primary reasons.  First, Section 271(b)'s text makes clear that to be liable for inducement, a party must induce conduct that constitutes direct infringement under 271(a).  And second, I think in expanding 271(b), the Federal Circuit departed from the approach that this Court has -- has repeatedly employed in interpreting Section 271.  I think the Federal Circuit was understandably concerned about allowing inducers to perform some stops of a process themselves to escape liability, but this Court has twice held in both Microsoft v. AT&T and before that Deep South v. Laitram that judicial concerns about gaps in 271's coverage should not drive the Court's interpretation of that provision.  That is because any time that you close a gap in 271, expanding patent rights, you are invariably implicating competing concerns and it's for Congress to resolve those concerns.  So to go to the -- the concern about circumvention, I think if Congress were just considering the -- the traditional active inducer who simply induces a party to perform all the steps of a process, that person compared to someone who performs some steps himself and induces someone else to perform the rest of the steps, there's no obvious policy reason to distinguish between those two actors.

The standard is that -- which you're complaining about -- that the error has to be so well understood and comprehended in existing law to be beyond any possibility of fair-minded disagreement.  And it seems to me if shortly after the instruction was requested the court itself said, oh, that's different, we're not talking about that, it certainly suggests that it was a subject of fair-minded disagreement.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not only that.  Your position must be that that is so clear as to be beyond fair-minded disagreement.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but you're saying it has to be clear, objectively beyond reasonable disagreement, to say that when the court says lack of remorse in a sentencing guideline case it still thinks there's a different rule for lack of remorse in a selection case such as this.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but nobody is suggesting that the SEC can't take action with respect to the noncovered securities.

I'm sorry I interrupted you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Goldstein?     Thomas C. Goldstein  No, sir.  My point is not that when the SEC says it that it becomes true.  We certainly don't agree with that.  My point is they is haven't articulated -- before they said the opposite and today they haven't articulated anything that is more than the kind of metaphysical go from here to here to here.  And it asks too much when we start from a statute that carved these CDs out.  Congress said, we have this idea of a security.  We have this idea from the National Securities Markets Improvements Act that the States regulate noncovered securities.  And so we are going to say that the preclusive effect of SLUSA does not reach these things like the CDs that we leave to regulation by the State.  So this case clearly falls very easily within the text of SLUSA as being not precluded.  Then you ask: Well, am I going to stretch the language of the statute to say, well, even though these are noncovered CDs, because securities were involved, I think SLUSA should still apply.  In asking whether you should stretch the language, you would say, well, what's the point of the phrase “ in connection with ”?  Why did Congress give it that kind of capacious reading, but didn't say fraud about securities or fraud involving securities.  It did say “ in connection with ”.  And what your precedents have said over and over and over and what has been the dividing line that has prevented 10(b)(5) from swallowing all fraud is these are misrepresentations that affect the regulated market negatively.

I mean, do you think that the abstention applies in the case of every regulatory proceeding?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, how do you -- how do you tell which--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I'm sorry, it's going to what?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, don't all -- it's sort of like the important State interests.  I assume the State's not doing anything unless they think it's important.  And any type of administrative proceeding, remedial or otherwise, has to a have some bite to it.  There has to be something that is going happen to you if you don't do what they tell you to do.  So in that sense, I mean, almost every administrative proceeding is coercive.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, my point is it doesn't seem like much of a limiting test, if you can say any time -- sort of any time anything bad can happen to you as a result of an administrative proceeding, that's coercive.  It doesn't seem like a serious constraint on the application of Younger.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is -- I'm sorry.  I was just going to say why is that?  Presumably, the State is resolving that dispute pursuant to some State law or State regulation, State policy.  I don't know why the -- the State interest is unimportant simply because it's the resolution of a private dispute.   ",12-815X

John G. Roberts, Jr.  The problem is you're each -- you're each using the child as the tool in the objective that you have in representing the parents.  On the one side is the allegation of inequitable conduct in concealment.  On the other side is the interest in settlement.  That's a dispute between two parents, and the child is being used as -- as -- I don't know what -- you know, a tool in implementing those conflicting considerations.  And to the extent that the Convention was designed to deter that kind of kidnapping, it adopted a -- a fairly strict rule.  And you're each trying to say, oh, the rule doesn't mean what it means, because don't worry, we'll take those considerations into account in addressing custody; and on the other side, well, don't worry because there's not that much difference between 12 and 13.  So how are we supposed to decide between those two conflicting considerations of the parents while maintaining the paramount concern, certainly not the exclusive one but the significant one, in the interest of the child.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that cuts against you in some respects.  You say there is such a big difference and therefore it is very important that the kidnapping parent do the best he or she can to conceal the child's presence so they get beyond 13 and into 12.

Jones  The experience -- Justice Ginsburg, the experience of the courts would show that applying agency actually would be more restrictive, I believe, than a zone of interest analysis.  Two of the factors from the AGC test are facially inconsistent with the Lanham Act.  The concerns about the speculativeness of damages, at least as it relates to quantum and the concern about the complexity and apportionment and duplicative damages cannot be applied here in a statute where Congress explicitly abrogated limits on suit related to certainty of damages.  Section 43(a) when it talks about a cause of action to somebody who's likely injured, that shows that those concerns about damages should not be applied.  Similarly, the flexibility and the remedy that can be recovered under the Lanham Act, in terms of disgorgement remedies, injunctive relief and a party's own lost profits shows that concerns about those factors shouldn't be applied either.

If somebody says -- and I realize you dispute these facts -- let's go get them and the guy jumps in the car, it seems to me that that's aiding and abetting the underlying illegal activity with knowledge, of course, that guns were used.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Bash.     John F. Bash  No, Mr. Chief Justice, we wouldn't say that.  This umbrella instruction applied to Count 1 and 2.  The crime you're help making succeed is 924(c).  What I was saying earlier was that, what does it mean to help make a crime succeed?  It makes -- it means intent to make one -- at least one step in that crime easier, knowing the other person bore the intent to do the crime.  And I think that's how we normally think about it.  If there's an armed robbery, and you say, well, I'll drive the getaway car, I think you would naturally say in ordinary English you intended to help make that crime succeed even if you didn't bear a specific intent with respect to the gun.  I certainly think on -- you know, if this had been objected to below, it might be a different matter with Mr. Elwood, but he did not object to this below.  He didn't -- he didn't raise this -- this wording issue even in the court of appeals.  He raised a sufficiency challenge with respect to foreknowledge.  But he -- even in his court of appeals brief, he didn't say that the instructions in this case were wrong because it said “ used ” versus “ would use ”.  So I don't think the issue is properly here, but I think it would be a sensible resolution if the Court were to remand these case-specific issues after clarifying the basic standard of aiding and abetting to the court of appeals to work through the forfeiture and waiver of harmless error and so forth.

Of course he wants the crime to succeed because he doesn't want the people to be there and being pressured by investigators or whatever to say, okay, you know, who was in on -- who was in on this with you?  So if you're -- if you're being paid for a crime, to assist in the commission of the crime, you want it to succeed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  He has a stake in it.  If the guy is caught, the police are going to say, where did you get the gun?  He may turn him in or not, but it's certainly a danger, a danger that wouldn't be there if the crime succeeded.

And -- and the problem, the difference, all things don't lead to the same place.  1404 says to the district court: Look at a hodge-podge of things, including the interest of justice, and -- and figure it out and, you know, maybe they will give the contract some weight or maybe they won't, and if they do, it's not clear how you weigh the contract against the interest of justice.  It gives a broad discretion.  It says they may transfer.  1406 is an entirely different animal.  It says you shall dismiss or -- or transfer.  It's sort of a -- you know, you have the safety valve to transfer.  And I don't know why you -- you so cavalierly dismiss: Oh, it's in the contract, of course, but we've got more witnesses.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that couldn't have come as a surprise.   INTERRUPTING John G.

I want to do business around the country so long as, if I am going to be sued, it's right here.

But you also have to step back and look at the great mosaic.  This statute is in part about our march through history to keep promises that our Constitution says for too long were unmet.  And this Court and Congress have both taken these promises seriously.  In light of the substantial evidence that was adduced by Congress, it is reasonable for Congress to make the decision that we need to stay the course so that we can turn the corner.  To be fair, this statute cannot go on forever, but our experience teaches that six amendments to the Constitution have had to be passed to ensure safeguards for the right to vote, and there are many Federal laws.

And they come in and they recover a million dollars, right?  So what's appropriate in that case?  The other side will say: Well, we settled on a million dollars, pain and suffering was really 20 million and we came down to a million.  So what's fair allocation in the case of the medical expenses?  It seems to be an entirely artificial judgment.  To the extent it's not, it depends on the views of the two parties negotiating and I thought we established that that is entirely subject to manipulation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's -- it's a little better than that, but go ahead and answer.  [Laughter]   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You've said several times that the way you do this is based on the judge's experience and so on with -- with the cases.  And I think what your -- your friend on the other side is saying is that's pretty much what's going on here except over time -- I mean, would it be all right if over time the judge says, well, typically, sometimes it's 25 percent, sometimes it's 35 percent, over time, it's sort of 33 percent.  And so we're going to have that as an absolute rule so that we don't have to go through these proceedings every time just to make sure that it's 30 percent rather than 33 percent.

Roberts, Jr.  What if -- what if the other -- the parties I guess are coming in and saying, well, that's not how juries work.  They don't care that this measure of damages is particularly calculable.  They come to a general view.  You've got medical expenses, you've got pain and suffering.  They make a judgment about that.  Would that be a good argument to make?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So how would it take it into account?  You said, well, because the medical expenses are readily calculable, we assume that that's what the jury meant first, and then the other stuff is extra so the State can get it.  But maybe sometimes they just come to a -- a total figure and they don't care how it's allocated.  You say, well, that's an argument they can make.  Well, what's a judge supposed to do in a particular case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So this is a real, significant increase in the burden on the State under the Medicaid program.  You're saying yes, you can try to recover recovery from third-party tortfeasors, but if you do that you've got to set up this apparatus where everybody can come in and you've got to prove what the allocation was and all that.  So -- I mean some -- 34 States haven't done that, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, yes, for your purposes.  But I'm interested in my purposes.  And I'm trying to figure out whether or not that's a significant financial burden on the State -- if they're going to go about trying to recover this money, that they've got to provide some apparatus, administrative, judicial, whatever, to make a calculation that I still don't understand what it's addressed to.

For instance, the 95-point rule in this agreement was post-Yard-Man.  I mean, it was bargained to -- previously, it was somebody with at least 10 years of service gets 100 percent paid, and they made that a little bit less generous for people who are hired after the change was made.  They adopted the 95-point rule with -- as you know, it's proportional to that for people with less than 95 points in age and service.  So it's -- there -- changes were made, but the basic pattern of retiree gets these benefits with a full company contribution, the language about the retiree receiving a pension, which, in my mind, very plainly does speak to duration, as does surviving spouse, until death or remarriage.  I don't know how you read those words to mean anything other than duration.  So there is enough in this contract to support the interpretation that the retirees placed on it.  The Court properly tried the case, received extrinsic evidence, ruled that it was, indeed, a lifetime promise.  If this Court has any doubt whether traditional principles of contract interpretation were applied without presumptions, as I said earlier, we would be willing to welcome a remand for a determination under traditional principles of contract interpretation.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I know you're saying that you win without YardMan, but -- but it still seemed to mean something to the Sixth Circuit.  And the many other courts of appeals that have addressed the question have distinguished what they're doing, saying, you know, we're not going to follow YardMan.  We're going to apply normal principles of contract interpretation.   John G.

I want we think there's a class; we think it's this many; we think their damages claims are, you know, 15 million.  What do you think about that?  You don't have to -- then that's the end of it.  You don't have to say, we'll take ten, or anything else.  They need to know at least what you want.   John G.

It doesn't prohibit you -- the relationship between the State and the taxpayer is between, you know, John Q. Public and the State.  And John Q.

Roberts, Jr.  So, so long as the drug offense is related to, then the paraphernalia offense is related to?  So it doesn't make any difference that we're dealing with paraphernalia?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's why I would have thought your answers to me would have been different because you would want to say that the paraphernalia is an additional hurdle.

Roberts, Jr.  Wait, what was the answer?  If you have it--  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  A couple of sentences ago you said that a sock, when it's used in connection with the drug activity, is sufficiently related to the Federal Controlled Substances Law.  What about a gun?  Those are often used in connection with drug activity.  So is a law concerning gun possession or gun control or whatever, a State law that relates to the Federal Controlled Substances Law?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, yes.  But if a statute addresses socks, it does.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It was addressing socks when used in connection with drug activity.  I'm talking about guns when used in connection with drug activity.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I would have thought the opposite inference.  If it's not such a big deal that the State is willing to let him cop a plea to drug paraphernalia, why should that be the basis for deportation under Federal law?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but, I mean, the only -- it's because you give “ relating to ” such a broad construction that you get the -- what I think is the unusual situation that I talked about, which is that the State thinks it's a very minor offense and yet it can become so significant that the person's deported.

Roberts, Jr.  And they hadn't -- they hadn't done -- they hadn't addressed the same issues the first time in 2006?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And it's instructive to look at this Court's decision in Christopher.  Christopher had to do with the interpretation of another part of this same exemption for outside salesmen.  But the Court there recognized that various functions are incidental to sales activities and, even if they don't necessarily encompass the direct face-to-face activity, preparing for that meeting and doing research on that particular customer's view is part of sales activity.  The 2006 opinion letter did not really take that view.  It really just said that face-to-face interaction was the part of sales.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Or the administrations might have changed.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's often the case when you have a procedural challenge.  I mean, the idea is they're not challenging the particular interpretation, but you don't doubt that the agency could have come out the other way and maybe if there had been notice and comment, they would have been persuaded that they should -- or that they shouldn't change the interpretation.

Kneedler  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start with the point about whether the FSIA simply incorporates due process standards, and we think it does not.

Roberts, Jr.  So in line with the discussion we had earlier about specific jurisdiction, is your argument that general jurisdiction is enough to support based-upon under the statute?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I thought you talked about just all of the different commercial activities that the Austrian airline engaged in in the United States.  And if it's all of the different commercial activities, that sounds like general jurisdiction, not the specific jurisdiction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If -- if you get on the train in Vienna, and you buy your ticket in Vienna and you get on the train in Vienna, there is on the train operator some duty of care, isn't there? Without regard to -- in other words, there's nothing special about buying a ticket in the United States that gives rise to a unique duty of care that's any different from the duty of care that the railroad owes its passengers in Austria.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand.  But there's nothing unique about the standard of care based upon whether it's a Eurail Pass or something else, is there? I'm just trying to suggest that you're putting an awful lot of weight on the standard of care created by the purchase of the ticket.

Roberts, Jr.  What did the re -- what did the recodification do?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that language -- that language comes from decisions of this Court, exactly.  But interpreting the precise language that was put into this act in the same context is the Tucker Act.  They were addressing a problem under the Tucker Act, they used that language.  And whatever criticism you want to direct to the prior decisions of the Court, they have issued -- they had issued rulings on those when the Congress was looking at the FTCA.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that's a -- a principle that obviously doesn't cut across the board.  In private actions in State court, for example, you do not have to give the administrative agency notice within two years, there are all sorts of things that don't have a particular carveout that don't apply--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --No, no.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  You're misunderstanding my point.  In other words, just because the law says the United States will be liable to the same extent as a private party, it doesn't mean that all the rules -- I mean in State court -- it doesn't mean that all the rules that apply in -- that you interpret them the same way across the board.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You may.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If the -- if the actions are not regulatory, why -- why did Amtrak's performance drop dramatically as soon as the Court issued its decision in this case?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, I know -- if I could -- there's -- the issues are pretty intertwined here, so I know it's a difficult thing to keep track of for you.  But if -- if -- and for us.  But if we think that the regulations have a regulations -- not to load the question--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Okay.  Metrics and standards are regulations.  And if we think there is nothing in the statute that requires -- well, I guess it doesn't -- doesn't -- doesn't really matter.  If that's the case, is the arbitrator an officer of the United States?  In other words, if he is the one that ends up issuing what we will hypothetically conclude are regulations, I assume he has to be an officer of the United States.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thanks.  I know it's a -- if he is an officer, is the government's issue a principal officer or an inferior officer?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.

Dupree Jr.  --Well, I -- I take the point that the FRA is involved in the development of the standards, but I don't think it follows from -- from that premise to say that Congress can give a private company and the Federal government joint ownership of the pen in drafting the regulations.  That's the problem.  And with regard to the issue of government control over Amtrak, the government conceded in the D.C. Circuit that it did not control Amtrak on a day-to-day basis and that includes, for present purposes, the rulemaking at issue.  In fact, Congress certainly did not view the Federal government as controlling Amtrak in the rulemaking, because if it did, it would not have inserted the arbitration provision.  Congress clearly understood that in the context of this rulemaking, the Federal government did not control Amtrak.  That is why the arbitration provision is in there.

Do you go through the anti-Bush crowd or through the pro-Bush crowd?  You've got to decide right now quickly.  I'm serious.  You have to make a split-second decision.  Which way do you go?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  They are both the same.  That was one of your propositions, that there is no way to distinguish there.  It's too late.  You've taken too long to decide.  It's a serious point.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You've got to decide like that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  I know.  But if we're trying to decide whether viewpoint can ever be a security justification, we have to consider all of the possible situations.  So again, if you had to decide right now do you go through the anti-Bush crowd or the pro-Bush crowd?  Guns are going off, explosions.  Which way do you go?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Really?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but with respect, my point is that we do have to adopt a general principle, and if we say viewpoint can never be a consideration, then you have to say when there is an emergency going on, it's just as likely there will be a problem if we go through the pro-Bush demonstrators or the anti ones, which seems to me to be, on its face, implausible.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So then you think there -- well, there may be situations in which viewpoint alone may be a security consideration.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, Iqbal says a little bit more than that, not that you just have to allege facts.  In Iqbal, and just quoting here from page 681, the Court goes on to consider the factual allegations in the complaint to determine if they plausibly suggest an entitlement, and they go on to say, but given more likely explanations, they do not plausibly establish this purpose.  So based on just your complaint, we have to determine whether there are more likely explanations.  And we have in your complaint the idea that they are at the front of the alleyway, it's a six-foot wooden fence.  Can we -- we certainly can look at those in deciding not simply whether you've pled the cause of action, but whether it's more plausible than those other justifications.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's what we said in--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Just to make sure, we're talking about the 15 minutes between--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Between when and when?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And the first -- they first cleared the alley, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And then the movement that you're concerned about.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, doesn't it make sense, just hypothetically, if you're the Secret Service agent and you suddenly have this challenge dropped in your lap at the last minute, you say, okay, here's the thing, the first thing we've got to do is clear the alley, right, because that's right up against where he's standing.  So you take care of that.  You clear the alley.  Then after you have more time to assess the situation, you say, okay, now we've got to get these people who are at the foot of the alley, we've got to move them.  In other words, they had to act not in an emergency situation, but reasonably quickly and they did it step by step.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But here's where we get back to Iqbal.  It doesn't have to be so compelling.  It simply has to be more likely, is the quote from Iqbal on 681, and it has to be an obvious alternative explanation.  And that's enough, no matter what you've alleged.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So discovery is your answer.  And of course it is.  You've got allegations.  You're going to go to trial.  The first thing you're going to do is file interrogatories, you're going to file requests for admission, you're going to file discovery requests to the Secret Service.  And the district court's going to have to allow some of that, isn't he, if he's allowed your allegations to go forward?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The first thing you'd want -- I say the first thing you'd want to know is whether this was a departure from established policy.  So the first question in -- if I were drafting interrogatories would be, what is your policy with respect to moving demonstrators at a presidential event?  What do you do?  And I can see the Secret Service saying, well, that's kind of a bad thing to make it public because there are people out there who want to kill the President, and if you go through your discovery and say, this is how we look at that situation, this is what we do, that gives people a -- a guideline for how to break through the security arrangements.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose you would then seek discovery with respect to those 12 other episodes, because you're saying those are viewpoint discrimination, how can you decide until you know the facts of those?

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  I lost you a little bit.  Why -- why is it going to be a very different type of result?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is the jury going to be instructed in any way on what you just told us was the reason we should view those as differently?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Wouldn't there be evidence or instruction on, you know, consumer impression, you have to take into account what happened between these two marks?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It seems to me that it's rather critical to the contrast you draw.  I mean, what you're saying is the jury might get it right or the jury might get it wrong, and I would say, well, the Federal Circuit maybe got it right or the Federal Circuit got it wrong.  But in terms of what the factual issues are going to be, and those would include what's happening between the two marks, it seems to me the jury has got information just the way the Federal Circuit.  I don't see the difference between the two other than you think -- you think the one result is right and the other would be wrong.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If it's viewed as a question of fact?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Again, if I could just -- what is it that you think a jury could not be instructed on in addressing that same consideration?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess the stare decisis point is -- is minimized, though, if you appreciate the fact that these marks are -- each one is sort of sui generis.  I mean, I don't know what precedential value I can get from looking at, you know, the dolphin changes on page 50 by the fact that there is a case about the Loctite Corporation behind.  I mean, I'm sure some are similar, but it seems to me that each one is -- is significantly different, so I don't know the significance of the stare decisis in this context.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Van Den Bosch.     Sarah E. Harrington  Some version of that.  It's more complicated than that.  I don't want to because that's not the issue here, I don't want to waste the Court's time, but it's some odd version of that.  If I could just say a word about Petitioner's reliance on history, Petitioner identifies a number of cases in which judges, you know, going way back, in which judges have decided tacking questions.  But none of those cases are cases where a jury was impaneled to decide the infringement issue.  Those are all cases that were decided on summary judgment or motion to dismiss, that were tried as bench trials, or that were suits for injunctive relief.  And so the treatment of tacking in those cases tells us nothing about what we should do when a jury is actually impaneled.  And as far as I know, Petitioner has not identified and I'm not aware of a single case from any period of time in which a jury was impaneled to decide an infringement issue and the judge took the issue away from the jury.  There just isn't such an example.  And that's because generally when you have civil trials and you have a jury impaneled, these questions of ultimate determinations of factual issues and even when they go to the ultimate legal determinations they're decided by juries who are properly instructed.  Now, I say that there's a lot of -- a lot of overtone in Petitioner's argument that we're worried about juries getting it wrong and there is an argument that the jury got it wrong in this case.  But I think that shouldn't drive your decision about whether juries or judges should decide this -- issue, because juries, just like judges, can get things wrong all the time and we have mechanisms in place to correct erroneous jury verdicts.  You can argue that the jury was improperly instructed.  That wasn't an argument that's ever been made in this case.  Or you can argue that there wasn't sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict.  That was the argument that Petitioner made on appeal to the Ninth Circuit.  The argument was rejected and Petitioner has not asked this Court to review that determination.  So, however you feel about whether the jury got it right or wrong in this case, that shouldn't tell -- that doesn't tell you whether the jury should or shouldn't have had the right to answer the question.  We think it's clearly a fact-based question and it should go to the jury.  Just one last point if I could.  The Petitioner has basically asserted that you should only really look at the two marks themselves and that will almost always tell you what you need to do, and when you look at precedent you just look at those two marks.  And as the Justices have suggested, it's -- you know, just looking at how other marks in the past have been treated doesn't always tell you the full story.  And even in the American Mobile Phone case, one of the dispositive considerations in that case was not just looking at the marks and how they looked and what the words were, and it wasn't just the fact that there was an intervening mark that was similar, they looked -- the Court looked at, or the TTAB and then the Federal Circuit approved it, looked at how the two different marks had been used in the Yellow Pages and whether they had been used to advertise the same kind of products or different kind of products.  And that just shows that tacking is a very context specific inquiry.  You need to look at how the -- how the marks are used in advertising with respect to the products and, you know, how the consumers actually perceive those marks.  And, of course, if a company is in a position where it's contemplating amending its mark and it wants to have some sort of certainty about whether that will be allowed, it can go to its consumers and do consumer surveys and say, you know, do you think if we changed it this way would you still have the same consumer impression?  It can, in other words, gather the evidence that it would have introduced at trial if tacking came up at trial.  Also, and this -- I guess this can be the last point if there are no questions, but a mark owner can seek to amend its mark with the PTO.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Hughes, you have 6 minutes left.     ",13-1211
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you emphasize that the consumer perspective is what's important, but there are other aspects of tacking as well that seem more suited to a court than to a jury.

Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Harrington.     ",13-1211
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  In a case such as that, is there anything preventing the Plaintiff from getting a stay of the District Court judgment? The third strike, seeking a stay of the judgment, and if in fact it is because of a failure to state a claim, so has more merit than one of the frivolous ones, I suppose the Court of Appeals could grant a stay, and the problem we're addressing would totally go away.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, but that's a problem that is always presented when you have to ask a District Court to stay its own judgment.  But you can also ask the Court of Appeals, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, you stay the judgment.  Because the judgment -- I mean, that's the typical reason you ask for a stay is because the judgment is going to have some very adverse consequences that should be suspended pending appeal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The remedy will be stayed in effect, of the third strike.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are you suggesting that the District Court cannot stay the disposition of the case? Or that a Court of Appeals has to review it or going to be asked to review it can't stay it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry, isn't that what stays do? They suspend the effectiveness of the judgment and by doing so you stay any collateral consequences of it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Lindstrom.     Allon Kedem  It does.  I think you would end up with Respondent's position.  But one additional point on prior occasions.  Although Petitioner disagrees with our reading of the phrase ""prior occasions,"" he does agree with us that if Congress meant ""prior occasions"" to include an appeal -- to applying the situation from an appeal of a third strike, it would have said so explicitly.  So if you simply go with that background understanding, you would still end up with our position. Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shanmugam, you have four minutes left.

Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I -- when we normally have a standing inquiry, you -- there can be some people who have standing under a particular statute and some who don't. Is -- is your position simply that you have to look at whether the plaintiffs have been injured in fact, and that some plaintiffs will be able to proceed if they can make that showing and others may not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Consovoy.     Malcolm L. Stewart  The -- the other point I would make -- I -- I agree with that. And the other point I would make about Defenders of Wildlife is the statute at issue in that case said any person can sue to complain about particular types of Endangered Species Act violations. And the Court said, that's just too broad.  Congress can't do that. But it didn't say, therefore, the authorization to sue is a nullity, and we don't have to worry about whether this plaintiff has standing to sue. It analyzed in depth the allegations and the evidence that the particular plaintiffs in Defenders of Wildlife had put forward and said this is insufficient. And then later, in Bennett v. Spear, the Court applied the same Endangered Species Act provision at the behest of a plaintiff who did have standing. So it isn't the case that, if Congress fails to draw exactly the right line, people who would have been within the right line are out of luck.  I think the allegations of the complaint are -- are the important thing to focus on. With -- with respect to the defamation analogy, I'd say Congress, in one sense, is broader than common law, and in another sense it's narrower. It's broader in that the statute certainly sweeps in categories of types of falsehoods -- May I finish? -- types of falsehoods that wouldn't have been defamation per se at common law. On the other hand, it applies only to Consumer Reports, documents that are intended to be used for concrete, primarily economic purposes. Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

You don't want people calling you.  The company publishes your phone number, but it's wrong.  That is inaccurate information about you, but you have no injury whatever. Can that person bring an action for that statutory damage?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But -- but can you have -- do you have standing? Do you have injury in fact when you don't want people calling you; the company publishes a false telephone number.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  The injury they identify is we don't think companies should public false -- publish false information about you. Is it the end of the standing inquiry to say they published false information about me, or do you have to ask were you injured in some way by that publication?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's in -- so what -- what would you say the injury in fact, not in law but in fact, is in that case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But our cases have always said actual injury in fact.  And I thought that meant that that was different than actual injury in law. You're saying when we say injury in fact, we really mean injury in fact or injury in law?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's a very different question.  I understand generalized grievance. You can't just say -- even I think you gather -- any citizen in the United States can sue about this.  You have to particularize it to some extent. But that's a different question as to whether there's actual injury.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Alito.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought they had some -- I thought they had some disclaimer that Spokeo does not verify or evaluate each piece of data, It makes no warranties or guarantees about any of the information offer -- offered.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is that saying if it's not accurate you're a -- he's a liar?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think that's what the disclaimer is saying.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I want to -- as I understand -- I take the falsity out of the -- the hypotheticals to get exactly what your position is on the -- the breadth of Congress' power. So let's say the statute says anybody who's publishing information about you has to pay the individual $10 a year.  They think that's a good way to regulate it.  It's information about you, good, bad, or indifferent, pay them $10 a year, no more, no less. Spokeo, or whatever that business is, pays you $20 one year. Now you've been -- the statute has been violated with respect to you, a particular individual. Can that -- and there's statutory damages of $10,000. Can that individual sue?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, does that individual have injury in fact because the statute has been violated with respect to him?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no, no, no.  You have to have published information about an individual. Every individual who you publish information about gets $10 a year.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So there'd be no standing -- that person would have no standing, even though Congress gave him standing?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if the statute --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- says $10, no more, no less, he gets $20, does he have standing to sue under that statute?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, no.  Any -- you have -- I said this just before.  They have to have published information about you.  If they don't, they don't have to pay you anything.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The Ninth Circuit didn't address that question, did it? I mean, as I understand it, I'm looking at the footnote, you know, on page 9A, it says it doesn't matter because you -- the statutory injury in law is enough.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Stewart, let's say your -- your -- Congress thinks that the president is not doing enough to stop illegal immigration.  So it passes a law that says, anyone in a border state -- so it's particularized -- who is unemployed may bring an action against an illegal immigrant who has a job.  And they get damages, maybe they get an injunction. Can Congress do that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I think that's kind of avoiding the hypothetical.  I mean, let's -- (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But presumably you would raise those issues after the action's been filed, and -- and, you know, you could raise those issues as an amicus defending the action.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, we're talking about Congress says, Well, these people who are unemployed, illegal immigrants have jobs, they should be able to sue to stop that because the -- you know, because they -- Congress thinks the president isn't doing enough.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, you know the -- you know the objection behind -- behind my hypothetical.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which is Congress can say, basically, to a group of citizens, you get to enforce one of our laws because we're giving you a cause of action.  It doesn't matter whether you've actually been injured or not; we just have to particularize it to some extent. And I would have thought that the -- the president would be concerned about Congress being able to create its own enforcement mechanism.  I thought that you would be concerned that that would interfere with the executive's prerogatives.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How -- how -- the difference is that this is dealing with the requirement of a case or controversy which has always been recognized as at the core of Article III jurisdiction. And we have a legion of cases that say you have to have actual injury. That's what makes it a decision appropriate for resolution by the judicial branch.  And it seems a little bit more important than saying you can challenge particular statutes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Was it -- then that's not what the Ninth Circuit based its decision on. The Ninth Circuit says he had standing by virtue of the alleged violations of his statutory rights, without respect to whether there was harm to his employment process or related anxiety. So I would suppose, if we're going to decide it on that basis, we have to determine that the Ninth Circuit's rationale was in -- was wrong.   INTERRUPTING ",13-1339

Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Murphy?     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Court should affirm the Sixth Circuit's judgment in this case because Petitioners have not established a credible threat of criminal prosecution and any other injury, to the extent it is adequately alleged, is not certainly impending.  And I'd like to begin with the prior probable cause finding.  Petitioners repeatedly characterized the prior probable cause finding as a finding by the prior panel that the -- the speech at issue there was probably criminal.  That's not what the finding indicated.  It's a very, very low standard.  It's not a standard that -- it's -- it's well below a preponderance of the evidence, so ""probably criminal"" is way too high.  It's just -- it's analogous in the civil context to -- to a malicious prosecution case; one of the elements is to establish that a prior case lacked probable cause.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are you ready--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Are you prepared to represent to us that if they do the exact same thing the next election that they did in the last one, that you will not take action against them?     No, I'm not -- I have not -- I do not have authority to disavow.  But their -- their argument that you need to disavow is inconsistent with some of the Court's cases suggesting that the threat implied by the existence of a law itself is not sufficient.  And so they -- they fall back on this probable cause finding as suggesting that it creates the objective evidence necessary.  But because -- because the probable cause finding is so low and because there are so many steps between the probable cause finding and the potential criminal prosecution--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess it was in the case of COAST; the problem is other people are going to be intimidated from helping them engage in their political speech.  What was it, a billboard?  The billboard company said--     No more advertising.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --I'm not going to let you put your sign up on my billboard, I might be liable.  So, I mean, they may have a certain fortitude and proceeding based on all the reasons that you've given, but they need third parties to help carry out their message and there is no reason to think those third parties have any commitment to their political message at all and the slightest whiff of, oh, this is going to be legal trouble, they say, forget about it.     I guess two responses.  Keep in mind that at JA-27 in the letter to Lamar, Driehaus indicated essentially that we reserve the right to proceed against you in the commission or in a court of law, indicating that he was already contemplating a defamation action.  So if this statute -- talking about the redressability prong of standing with the directness test with respect to ripeness, he could have said the exact same thing and it would have chilled them Lamar from--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, no, but a defamation action, people sue everybody all the time.  No one's going to take that seriously.  In fact, it's probably going to redound to the benefit of SBA and COAST to say the congressman is, you know, bringing a defamation action.  It highlights it, but it's another thing to have the State involved making a determination that there's probable cause that you lied.   John G.

I understand you to acknowledge that it's accurate to some extent, but that the exceptions or the -- the extent to which it's not accurate over -- override the extent to which it is.  In other words, you're each sort of dealing with at the -- at the -- if not at the margins, you know, most of the time it's sufficient, you say too much of the time it's not.  How am I supposed to review the economic literature and decide which of you is correct on that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, your submission is that we should jettison the Basic test because economists now believe that the efficient market theory is not sufficient -- sufficiently accurate or true to support it.  So I thought -- I mean, you review a lot of the economic literature in your briefs.  I assume you wanted me to look at it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, how hard is it to show that the New York Stock Exchange is an efficient market?   INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's a statement that is inconsistent with RFRA, isn't it?  The whole point of RFRA is that Congress wanted to provide exceptions for the religious views of particular -- including proprietors, individuals.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah.  But the wisdom you cited is the idea that you don't have imposed, on the basis of religious beliefs, exemptions or -- or limitations.  And it seems to me that was the whole point of RFRA, to tell the courts that that is exactly what you should do unless the exception satisfies the strict scrutiny test.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's his argument for distinguishing it.  But there are others, including the fact that it is more you avoid all of the problems with what to do if it's a -- you know, there's a 51 percent ownership of the shareholders, if you simply say that it's in this type of Chapter S Corporation that is closely held.  Whether it applies in the other situations is -- is a question that we'll have to await another case when a large publicly-traded corporation comes in and says, we have religious principles, the sort of situation, I don't think, is going to happen.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's a question of State corporate law.  It's not a question of who can bring an action under RFRA.  Could I just raise -- eight courts of appeals, every court of appeal to have looked at the situation have held that corporations can bring racial discrimination claims as corporations.  Now, does the government have a position on whether corporations have a race?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that -- so that a corporation does have a race for purposes of discrimination laws.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So those -- those cases involve construction of the term ‶ person ″?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the person -- the corporation can bring as a person a claim of racial discrimination.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about the grandfathered plans?   John G.

Can you make a representation to us about how long the grandfathering is going to be in effect?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can you give me an approximate time, if not a precise one?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if you can't tell us, and I don't fault you for not being able to tell us, when the grandfathering is going to end, shouldn't we assume in our analysis that it is current and, as far as we can tell, not going to end?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, isn't that because you're talking about building ramps and things like that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Those were decisions -- those were decisions that Congress made, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the grandfathering is not a decision that Congress made, is it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that of course is an issue that's being hotly litigated right now, right?  Whether the employees can get the coverage when you're talking about the religious organizations.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you're relying -- you're relying on it to make your point with respect to the accommodation, and then you're criticizing your friend for relying on the same thing in making his points.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if Congress feels as strongly about this as you suggest, they can always pass an exemption, an exception to RFRA, which they have done on other occasions.  And they haven't done it here.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, we've already discussed that there is no case holding that they can't, right?   INTERRUPTING John G.

He hires them to do something else and then the employee screening is certainly not principal.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well then, I guess I don't understand what “ principal ” means.  You're saying everything that is related somehow to the job is principal.  I would have thought principal has to do with things that are more significantly related.  You would say, typically, if somebody asked what do you do, if you were one of these people, you would say, oh, I fill orders for Amazon.  I mean, it may be part of that that you go through security at the end of the day, but that doesn't make it a principal activity.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Then I don't know why don't you say “ activities ” rather than “ principal activities ”?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know you say it because you want to fit under the statute, but I'm saying I don't understand.  It seems to me you're just saying anything that is required for the benefit of the employer is a principal activity.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The workers are told: You've got to check out.  It's something they are told they have to do.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And under your theory that would be a principal activity.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  All of this is subject to collective bargaining.  In other words, you're sitting down and you say we want it to be $15 an hour and you're asking for a dollar raise and you'll say, look, one reason we should get it is because we have to wait a half hour to get out or whatever, and that's -- whether it's compensable time or not, that can certainly be a factor that goes into the collective bargaining.

This is between Section 8, which is about the SEC stop orders, and Section 11, and the key language is that there has to be the misstatement of material fact or the omission that makes the because the omission is present makes this statement not misleading.  So this is nearly identical language, and the SEC has taken the position for many years that in fact a lack of a reasonable basis is a serious problem even if the person sincerely believes it.  Those are the cases cited in our brief, and the reason we're here today is it will severely hamper the SEC's authority, as well as the authority of private persons to recover, if you can just put things in registration statements without even having a basis for them.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but as as your friends on the other side point out in their example at pages 22 to 23 of their brief, if you do the internal consistency test, it ends up not being equal.  What it ends up is imposing a special tax they even call it special, right, the special nonresident's tax on those who live in one State and work in the other, that people who live in the State and work in the State do not have to pay.  That doesn't sound that sounds unequal, whether fair or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's the case now.  If we uphold the situation where you charge a special nonresident tax in a way that is a special tax on people who live in one State and work in the other, then you're free to raise that to whatever amount you want.  The fact that it's a smaller amount now doesn't -- if we say it's okay, then you're free to raise it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It is now.  Do you think there's could -- you increase the special nonresident tax beyond the lowest rate that the county tax is?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I was just going to say it's not a question of yielding.  The way you test under our precedents whether one State has to yield or not is to say, well, let's suppose each State does exactly the same thing, neither one is yielding.  And as indicated earlier, the example in the Respondents' brief is that if each State did what we're talking about, people who work in one State and live in another would pay higher taxes overall than people who live within one State and work in the same State.  And that sounds to me like a tariff.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.  Mr. Feigin.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Except if they also imposed the special nonresident tax, and that changes the whole scenario.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But they are linked they are linked together.

I mean, you -- your argument would be the same if this is a temporary sign about where the soccer game was going to be?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I -- I'm sorry.  That was the significance of my prior question.  What -- what they're really saying is that political speech is more valuable than speech about where the soccer game is.  In other words, I thought you indicated that your argument did not depend on the fact that the sign was a sign for the church.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Don't you think that political speech is more valuable than directions to the soccer game?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your point is if it's -- if it's stuck in the ground with a little stake--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --then it can be treated one way, but if it's in concrete -- but--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --It seems to me that you are trying to find a, I don't know, a difficult way to deal with an issue that could be readily addressed just by seeing if the sign is for a limited event.  In other words, what if somebody -- every time -- you know, the stake in the ground at least could last for three weeks, so every three weeks, they come along and stick the stake back in the ground.  You are saying the only way they can distinguish is by looking at whether it has a stake in the ground or whether it's in concrete, and yet that seems to me that doesn't help the -- that doesn't answer the city's legitimate concern.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Cortman.  Mr. Feigin.     Eric J. Feigin  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  We agree with Petitioners that Respondents' ordinance here is unconstitutional, but we think that a context-specific intermediate scrutiny approach should apply in evaluating speech-permissive exceptions to a sign ordinance where those exceptions are based on the same longstanding traditional rationales that justify the sign ordinance as a whole.  A wooden application of strict scrutiny in this context would suggest that it's presumptively unconstitutional, for example, for a town to limit signs on public property but have an exception if you want to paint your street number on your curb.  Now, that doesn't make a great deal of practical sense, and that's not an example I just made up.  That's essentially the ordinance that this Court upheld, albeit without specifically addressing this particular issue, in Taxpayers for Vincent.  On a theoretical level, the normal reasons for deep judicial skepticism of exceptions to a regulation of speech don't apply in the context of that street address exception, exceptions for danger or safety signs, or other types of exceptions that track the normal safety and nonproliferation rationales for a sign regulation.  Those kinds of exceptions don't create any inference that the government is attempting to favor one viewpoint or another, that it's trying to limit the set of ideas that are going to come into the public marketplace, or that it doesn't truly believe in the safety and nonproliferation rationales that underlie the sign regulation as a whole.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I mean, you -- you obviously know the difficulty with that, which is how does the government decide when there should be an exception or how does a court decide when there should be an exception and when there shouldn't be?  I mean, I understood the whole point of the strict scrutiny for content-based restrictions is to find out which are the types of speech or the particular types of regulation that should be given an exception, rather than starting with saying, well, you don't apply this scrutiny because there ought to be an exception.   Eric J. Feigin  Well, I think the main problem with strict scrutiny in this context is it sends a signal to legislatures that they are on safer ground if they enact a broad and undifferentiated restriction on signs than if they try to tailor it only to those types of signs that actually cause the problem that they are trying to prevent.  And I think that the way the Court can manage the situation is to see whether, under intermediate scrutiny, there really are safety and-or nonproliferation rationales that track onto whatever exception is being drawn.  So if we could use, for example, Justice Sotomayor's example of the ""For Sale"" signs.  A town might permissibly have an ordinance that limits the number of signs you can have on your lawn to two, two signs of any type; but it might also say, you know, we're not going to count ""for Sale"" signs against your quota of two and the reason is that ""For Sale"" signs are only up on a very small percentage of properties at any given of time, they are up for a very limited purpose when the property is for sale, and they go down once the sale is consummated.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I'm not sure -- I'm not sure your whole approach is not precluded by our decision in McCullen.  There, we said that a facially neutral law does not become content-based simply because it may disproportionately affect certain types of certain topics.  And we said the question in such a case -- in other words, when you are dealing with a facially neutral -- law is whether the law is justified without reference to the content.  So it seems to me that you've got to get over the content neutrality.  Your argument only applies when it's content neutral and yet here we're dealing with a situation where you're saying it's an exception to the content-based rule.   Eric J. Feigin  Well, Your Honor, I think the Court can deal with the competing interests in this case more easily not by getting bogged down in the definition of content-based and content-neutral, which I can address in a second, but by focusing more on the bottom-line question of whether this is an appropriate case for the application of strict scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Sotomayor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Savrin.     Philip W. Savrin  --No.  We think that there needs a be a -- a nuance, as the Federal government has indicated.  So it guides the the content test is a guide for courts to determine which level of scrutiny applies.  And at some level, if content is the on/off switch, then such distinctions as temporary and permanent, commercial and noncommercial, even onsite and offsite, are going to be content.  And we don't believe that that in and of itself justifies strict scrutiny.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Cortman, you have four minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",13-502X

Roberts, Jr.  --I was just saying, putting aside our discussion of Prouse and -- and Herring, why does it make sense to say that you don't take reasonableness into account when the Fourth Amendment only protects against unreasonable searches and seizures?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Fisher.  Mr. Montgomery.     Rachel P. Kovner  --Sure.  The second is an administrability reason.  We think that this is the simplest standard.  You simply ask officers to decide whether -- you simply ask courts to decide whether an officer could reasonably think that a person had committed a crime, and you don't separate was this a question of law or a question of fact and treat one in the rights section and one in the remedies section.  And the third is that we don't think there's a normative reason to treat mistakes of law and mistakes of fact differently.  When an officer makes a stop in this situation, he can just as reasonably be confused as to what the -- the law is under these statutes, as confused as to what the facts are.  And if we're going to treat mistakes of fact as part of the rights analysis, it makes sense to treat reasonable mistakes of law in the same way.  If the Court has no further questions, thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Fisher, you have three minutes left.     INTERRUPTING ",13-604X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's a very broad definition of reasonable.  I understand the idea that when, you know, 99 people out of a hundred think you have to have two brake lights, like you do everywhere else in the country, that it's reasonable for the police officer to think that.  But it sounds to me like you're adopting the same standard that we apply in qualified immunity, which gives the officers quite -- quite broad scope, and that -- that's troubling.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You would not give a pass -- I mean, let's say the case is flipped here and the most reasonable reading of the statute is that you only need one brake light.  And so someone's driving around with one brake light.  You pull him over.  He's going to say: I reasonably thought that, you know, I -- I only -- I only needed one.  And the Court comes out and says, I needed two.  In that case, ignorance of the law would not save him, would it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'd like to focus again on your definition of reasonableness.  Let's say you have two court of appeals decisions.  One says you need two brake lights; the other says you need one.  Is it reasonable for the officer to pull somebody over when one of their two brake lights is burned out?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Kovner.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  So where do you come out in my hypothetical of the two court of appeals decisions?  Is that reasonable for the officer to say,  ""Well, I'm going to pick this one and follow that?

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose -- I suppose you could also say Hamilton in 1787 or whatever it was trumped Storey in 1830, right?  I mean, he said pretty much the exact opposite, that the recognition provision was really just a trivial formality.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you would say in Justice Kagan's hypothetical, maybe the letter that's required to be sent to every foreign head of state would be unconstitutional, but that doesn't mean that the passport is, because the passport is used primarily for purposes of identification, and it's only the letter that makes it something else.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Kennedy.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  General Verrilli.     Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --I think that's, with all due respect, too easy an assumption, Your Honor.  The difference between when this statute was enacted and it did give rise to very serious problems that we had to work very hard to try to get under control.  The difference between then and now, there's two very important differences, and they lead to a very important conclusion.  The first important difference is it won't be one branch of the United States Government saying that this should happen.  It will be two branches of the United States Government saying it should happen.  It won't be that we will -- that this statute will have been enacted, but it won't be enforced.  It will be enforced.  And the consequence of those two things together is that the credibility of the executive the credibility of the President on this fundamental question of where the United States stands on the status of Jerusalem until the parties work it out will inevitably and seriously be called into question and into doubt.  Foreign governments, foreign peoples will not be able to have complete confidence that the position that the President announces on behalf of the United States is, in fact, the position of the United States.  That is exactly why Section 214 violates the separation of powers, even if you conclude that Congress might have some residual power, which we obviously strongly disagree with.  The official position of the United States is that Jerusalem, we don't recognize any nation's sovereignty over Jerusalem until the parties have worked that issue out on their own.  And what this -- what this statute does if it was enforced will undermine the credibility of our -- of the President's ability to maintain that critically important diplomatic position as we move forward.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.  Ms. Lewin, you have four minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",13-628X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what if there were a law that said precisely pretty much what you just said?  The law says, okay, Mr. President, you can recognize whoever you want, but if you recognize this -- this country, this government, we're going to treat it as if you hadn't recognized this government.  For all purposes of domestic law, we're going to pretend -- we're going to operate on the assumption that you have recognized this country.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so that law would be unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, isn't that exactly what the Taiwan Relations Act says?  What it says is,  ""The absence of diplomatic recognition shall not affect the application of the laws of the United States with respect to Taiwan. ""   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let's say the President -- let's say the President did not want to recognize Taiwan and Congress passes a law that says for every purpose under American law, we will treat Taiwan as if it had been recognized?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If it had -- if it were such a big deal, why did the Chief Executive at the time sign it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So we should give no weight to the fact that the Chief Executive signed the law that he is now saying has such a dramatic that his successor, but I gather the position is the same -- is now saying has such deleterious effects on American foreign policy?  Well, as a general matter, does that have any consequence at all?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no.  I know, I'm not suggesting it does, although that's a separate question.  But it does go to the credibility of the assertion that this is going to have such dramatic effects on American foreign policy.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's partly because the Executive Branch made such a big deal out of it.  I mean, they issue a statement saying, this is unconstitutional and all that.  They could easily have said, this is no big deal, they're just letting whoever is born there pick the name they want to put on--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --nothing to see here, move on, and we're proving that by going ahead and signing it.  And over the -- over the intervening course, the executive has litigated this.  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy that it's going to be such a huge deal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if it just says “ Disputed ”, parentheses after it, “ Disputed ”?  Then I gather they wouldn't be lying.  They would be telling the truth.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's disputed as a matter of the government of the United States.  Part of the government says this -- well, actually, no, I mean, Congress is not saying under my hypothetical, this is Israel.  It's saying there's a dispute about it, which I would think is about as true a statement as you can make.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let's say there's a -- that passports are printed in Country A, not the United States, and there's a printing plant there, and Congress passes a law saying, no, you must have the passports printed in Country B because we don't think you should recognize Country A.  Does that interfere with the President's recognition power?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because Congress wished the President would not recognize Country A.  So in response to that, we're directing that passports that are now printed in Country A be printed in Country B.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought your position was that the President has the exclusive right to decide what interferes with his recognition power.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But just like the signing statement.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Just like the signing statement, which said precisely what Justice Kennedy suggested, that the Executive could do at this point.   ",13-628X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I -- I mean, you're really just making your case too easy.  I mean, one of the difficult issues in a case like this is where to draw the line.  And you just say, well, we want to draw the line at half inch because that lets us win.  And the next day someone's going to be here with one inch.  And maybe it'll be you.  And then, you know, two inches.  It seems to me you can't avoid the legal difficulty just by saying, all we want is half an inch.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but we have to decide this case pursuant to a generally applicable legal principle, and that legal principle is one, it seems to me, that demands some sort of a limit.  And if you're unwilling to articulate a limit to the principle itself, it becomes a little bit difficult to apply it, say, well, we don't know what the limit is because you're only asking a half inch.  We'll apply a -- a theoretical legal structure and -- and say you fall within it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the -- the problem with deference, I think, is that if you accept the fact that there is a point at which it does become a problem, the full beard, Sikh with the -- the turban, then you -- then there's the question of how you draw the line.  And drawing the line, it strikes me, may be the point at which you will consider deference to the prison administrators.  You take deference entirely out of the equation by saying, look, we're only asking for half an inch.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Professor.  Mr. Yang?     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Go ahead.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It sounds like statute.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where -- where are you on the full beard?   John G.

Just litigate a dozen cases till we settle on one and three quarters inches, or what?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What I'm doing, it's the same question I asked your friend--   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  --which is what's the legal principle?  And if there is no direct legal principle, then isn't it a situation in which you would employ deference to the administrative judgment?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Curran.     David A. Curran  --I don't think it would be that difficult.  I mean, I'm not in the prison environment.  It really wasn't raised on this record.  My clients might think that it is, but based on the information I have, I would agree that sounds like that would be something that could be done.  And I do think it's important to distinguish sort of the rule that I would propose and that's in the Couch case, and that is -- what I think is very similar to what the government's offering here, is really an effort to marry strict scrutiny with deference in a way that doesn't invite empiricism.  This Court's strict scrutiny jurisprudence hadn't always demanded examples, especially in the prison context.  And I think that it's important that we do be allowed to have prophylactic rules in some settings.  Justice Ginsburg asked, well, what about literature?  We have a rule that says racially inflammatory literature of a religious nature that incites violence isn't allowed in the prison.  And Justice Ginsburg in the footnote in the Cutter opinion seemed to think that of course that's a concern that prisons ought to be worried about.  That's not susceptible to any kind of empirical proof, I don't think.  And as I understand my friend's understanding of the rule, we are in a land of strict scrutiny really that's akin to content-based speech restriction analysis, where prophylaxis is to be condemned, we ought to really be using after-the-fact deterrent measures against maximum security inmates, that have already shown themselves not to sort of comport with that view of how to behave.  And I think that's particularly dangerous in the prison setting, particularly in our prison's environment.  Thank you, Your Honor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

So we know it's not true that these are exclusively used in criminal activity.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what number would be enough?  I mean if we had 100,000 registrations, does that mean that it's no longer conduct that presents a serious potential risk?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then -- then is possession, possession of explosives, an offense under this enhancement provision?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even though the statute -- even though the statute says use of explosives is covered?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You'd say, well, under the catch-all phrase, mere possession is covered.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's a second step, unlike the others.  When you're engaged in a burglary, the -- the risk is there.  When it's mere possession, the risk isn't there.  You have to take an additional step of taking it and using it in a crime.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, or the homeowner could happen to have a short-barreled shotgun and shoot the burglar.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Then the violence doesn't depend on any additional act by the burglar.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  I didn't mean to suggest in Begay we specifically addressed vagueness, but the -- my -- my point was that Sykes provides a particular test, but as your friend has pointed out, Begay, it seems to me, points in an entirely different direction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that -- that phrase, it seems to me, could just as clearly be viewed as adding confusion.  And that's one -- the various hundreds whatever statutes you cite, I don't think -- certainly not many of them, I'm not sure any of them, involved that aspect of it.  In other words, it's not just a question of whether it's serious potential risk, but otherwise, what is its relationship to the enumerated offenses.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  But the problem is -- the problem is not what the government argues when it gets into court.  The problem is what the prosecutor threatens when he's entered into plea bargain negotiations.  This is the point that Justice Ginsburg touched on.  You are putting the defense counsel in a position where they have to interpret the vagueness in making the decision when -- whether they want to plead to five years or risk the mandatory minimum of -- of 15. And your guidelines say a lot, but I thought one of the things your guidelines say is that you should prosecute the -- the maximum extent that you can, right? Isn't it you should charge the maximum if you -- if you charge and then the prosecutors go in and say, look, I could charge you this much and -- or I could -- or I could -- I mean, I could add this charge to what I've got and then you'd face 15 years.  And defense counsel said, well, all right.  Let me see if we're guilty of that.  And he's going to read that and have no idea whether they're covered by it or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No idea is an exaggeration, sure.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not enough of an -- not enough of an idea to risk an extra ten years for their client.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But what do you think --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about one that you think is easy, kidnapping? What if the statistics would ever show that in 40 percent of the cases, they're talking about the parent that does not have custodial rights, you know, taking the child from school and not -- not returning him or her, whatever.  I mean, that doesn't pose, I would say, not a serious risk of potential violence.  The parent is not going to harm -- harm -- harm the child.  And yet you say that's an easy case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe it's easy if it's at the margin, if one percent of the cases are.  I don't know whether kidnapping is prosecuted more often in a case like that or in another, you know, more, you know, violent case where it's extortion for money as opposed to just wanting more custody of the child.

You said if there's -- because there are so many years involved, people will litigate hard.  I think because there are so many years involved, people won't litigate at all.  I mean, if -- if they're facing when -- if they go to trial such a large enhancement, I think they're going to be compelled -- it gives so much more power to the prosecutor in the plea negotiations which is, of course, where almost all of the cases are disposed of.

It's an extraordinary leverage that the broadest interpretation of this statute would give Federal prosecutors.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but -- when you say this -- I understood your friend to say “ tangible object ” is only used in record statutes.  In 1512--   John G.

And that's a point that's not present in the statutes that you were citing.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, isn't that like the Bond decision?

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You -- you've referred several times to subsidiary facts.  You know, the difference between questions of law and fact has not always been an easy one for the Court to draw.  What do you mean by a subsidiary fact?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what's your definition of subsidiary fact?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Jay.  Ms. Anders.     Ginger D. Anders  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Just to start with the distinction between factual findings and legal inferences here, we think that factual findings are those that are based, at least in part, on evidence that is outside the patent and its prosecution history and that concern matters that are distinct from the patent itself.  So those could be factual findings about what kind of data a particular scientific technique produces or how the inventions, prior inventions in the field worked.  Those are factual findings.  We then think that when the district court takes those findings and now it can understand the -- the concepts that are described in the patent because it's made those findings, when the district court takes those findings and then looks at the patent and asks how would a person of skill in the art interpret the words in this patent in light of all the pieces of the patent document and the canons of claim construction, those inferences that it draws are legal ones.  So I think to take -- to take the size exclusion chromatography as an example of this because it's probably easier to discuss it concretely, I think what happened there was that the district court made a factual finding that when SEC is used the type of data that -- that just is spit out is -- produces peak molecular weight, and if you wanted to produce any other measure of molecular weight you would need to do more calculations.  That's the factual finding that the district court made.  It then took a look at the patent document and said, in light of that, what inference can I draw from the specifications referenced to SEC, and the legal inference that it drew was that probably the patent meant to refer to peak molecular weight when it used the term “ molecular weight ”.  And I think the court of appeals understood the factual finding in the same way that the district court did.  I think it accepted that when you use SEC, the data that comes out is MP and you would need further calculations to produce other types of data.  But what the--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Under your view, two different district courts construing the same patent could come out to opposite results based on a subsidiary factual finding, and neither of those would be clearly erroneous, and yet on a public patent that is going to bind a lot of other people, people won't know what to do.  You have two different interpretations of the patent.  What happens then?   Ginger D. Anders  Well, I think that concern is overstated for -- for two -- two reasons.  I think the first is that it's -- it's pretty unlikely that that scenario is going to occur, and the second is that, even in the rare circumstances in which it did, there are reasons to think that that's not actually a -- a problem from a policy standpoint.  So -- so just to elaborate on that, I think because -- because this inquiry needs to remain primarily legal, because even after the court makes fact-findings, it needs to engage in a contextual analysis of the patent as a whole in light of the canons of claim construction, we think that the legal questions are generally going to predominate in the--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's just kind of avoiding the question.  I mean, you can easily envision this case coming up differently in the district court depending upon what district courts find as the, you know, accepted understanding to artisans.  And again, each of those opposite results, neither one may be clearly erroneous.   Ginger D. Anders  --Well, I think another point is that district courts I think have a way, have ample tools to try to avoid that scenario from occurring.  They can, when there are seriatim cases, there can be pre-trial coordination in the same district so that -- so that the situation doesn't arise.  Of course, preclusion will -- will prevent a patentee from having an issue of claim construction decided against it and then coming back and trying to relitigate the issue.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  It's because you have a patent which is a public document that is binding the world in terms of what other inventors can do and another inventor looking at it can say, well, what can I do?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  He doesn't know.  That is very different than just a particular negligence case that comes up.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Ms. Anders.  Mr. Phillips.     Carter G. Phillips  --Well, it's a measure of -- but at least it gives the district court an incentive to do harder work in order to be in a position to lay claim to more deference.  But what we do know here is that the -- the fundamental -- the prosecution history creates to my mind an insolubly ambiguous patent and there's no way out of that box.  And then what the district -- what the court of appeals said is, is there anything in the SEC calibration data or the shifting of this and that that somehow makes this suddenly become definite enough, and the answer to that is no, none of that does anything except suggest to a person of skill in the art that peak could potentially have been a legitimate way to interpret that.  But none of that gets you out of the box.  And indeed, every time their expert testified to this he kept saying, well, it's because the prosecution history refers to peak.  But that's only because he discounted the other half of the prosecution history that referred explicitly and completely to the weight.  And it's in that context that I would hope that this Court, if it decides to go past de novo, if it thinks this exercise is worth the candle, will go beyond just simply saying there's a new standard to be applied and analyze each of the facts of the -- that have been put before the Court by the Petitioner, and make a determination because it's -- one, it would be very helpful to know what the indefiniteness standard means in light of last year's decision in Nautilus and that can be elucidated here.  But two, it seems to me that, whatever else you want to say about this, this is a hopelessly indefinite set of claims.  It is not entitled to protection.  It should be regarded -- it should be regarded as invalid, and my client should be able to go forward with the generics that would bring this medicine to -- at less expense to the population.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you want, on the one hand -- they obviously had to move new voters into the majority-minority districts because they were all underpopulated, and they need to move enough so that the minorities have an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice, but they can't move too many because that would be packing, correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- but they have to do that.  They have to hit this sweet spot between those two extremes without taking race predominantly into consideration?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is that?  Why is--   John G. Roberts, Jr.  --Why is that?  Why do you no longer need as high a percentage of minority voters to maintain a situation where minority voters can still elect their candidates of choice?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Schnapper.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you think it's possible for the State to navigate between not enough minority members in the district and too many minority members in the district without taking race into account.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Race predominantly into account.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so they have to navigate between too many and too few, but without race being the predominant consideration.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you think -- what do you think -- well, it's speculative.  But I think that if Alabama had reduced the number of minority voters in majority-minority districts in any significant way, the Attorney General would have come down on them like a ton of bricks.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  He did preclear the plan that you're challenging today.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  General Verrilli.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You asked for a remand.  The result of the remand may well be Alabama has to redistrict; is that right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And when they do so, that would not be subject to Section 5, correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that's not a concern for you?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Brasher.     Andrew L. Brasher  Well -- and once again, I don't think -- they may have brought claims with respect to each individual district.  I don't think they do.  I think if you look at the complaint, you won't find that.  But even if they did, the only evidence that they introduced about any of these districts are the statistics alone, and the United States agrees with me that that's insufficient for them to have met their burden of proof.  So I don't see how you could reverse the district's fact-finding as clearly erroneous that race didn't predominant, given that all they introduced was statistics.  I think The Court should affirm on the basis of the fact-finding and not reach questions about Section 5.  Unless the Court has any other questions, that ends my -- thank you.   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the other side says it was impermissible for you to preserve the status quo because the opportunity for minority voters in the majority minority districts to participate in the electoral process had improved to the extent that maintaining the status quo would be characterized as packing.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it contextual?  In other words, is 20 feet in her home different from 20 feet in the bank?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it seems -- the reason I ask is that it -- it strikes me that it makes a difference if it's in part of the robbery itself.  I mean, it seems to me to tell the teller to go to the vault or something.  That's what happens in a bank robbery.  If on the other hand, the -- the defendant takes the teller from the bank to the car and then, you know, they -- they block the car, that strikes me as something different even though the distance might be the same.   ",13-9026
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but all the definitions begin by saying accompanying is go with somebody as an associate or companion.  Yes, it is certainly a permissible use and a common use in context to say I accompanied someone across the hall.  But when you are in the context that this present one is of bank robbery, the point of associate or companion, I think, takes on greater weight.  Obviously, an unwilling one.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  All right, you take two bank robberies.  One, the robber comes in, waves a gun, pistol whips five people, grabs the money and leaves.  Okay?  In another the bank robber comes in, just gets the bag of money, says, you walk over here 2 feet with me, so he can get the bag of money and leaves.  The first one you could get probation.  I mean, you're not going to, but there's no mandatory sentence.  And the second one you get at least 10 years.  That doesn't make any sense.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But they didn't care exactly what the minimum was, right, even before the sentencing guidelines, which would obviously have a higher sentence, they didn't care if it was one year because of extenuating circumstances, whatever.  But, they said, forcing someone to accompany you is so much more serious that you get at least 10 years.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Range where?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the point is the idea of someone whose bank is being robbed not being forcibly compelled to accompany someone is fanciful, and all you have to do, again I -- guess it's repeating the question is -- you got two feet and the prosecutor is armed with another 10 years automatically in his pocket, and then you use that to extort a plea bargain of, you know, six years, somebody who might otherwise wanted to go to trial.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that begs the question, I think.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, your U.S. attorney's manual does just that.  It says you prosecute these when anyone forcibly abducts another during the commission of any offense.  That seems to me to be trying to take out those walked two feet.  That's not a forcible abduction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so you think when the manual says forcibly abducts, it means the two -- foot situation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the manual is read -- forcibly abducts, they read as for somebody to move two feet.  That's an abduction?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And so the manual which -- the other provision in the manual which is that you should charge as large an offense as possible means that in the case where somebody is forced to move two feet, you charge the -- that as a forcible abduction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So is two feet consistent with the conduct at issue?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  That is exactly where the prosecutor needs another ace in his hand.  In other words, if he's waving a gun, if he's assaulting the people, if he's shooting them, fine, he's got enough leverage.  But when he hasn't done any of that and all he's done is asked the teller or whoever to accompany him for -- of forced, I'm sorry, the teller to accompany him for a few feet, that's where the prosecutor says I, you know, it's a good thing I've got these 10 years or otherwise he might go to trial.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How would you -- how would you see the evidence of prosecutorial abuse?  When you have these cases, he says I'm going to charge you with a 10-year minimum, and the guy says, my gosh, I can't risk that, I'm going to plead guilty to 6 years or 7 years.  I don't see how that pattern could show up in any kind of statistics.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It would not be a reported case because he would have pled guilty.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  When they plead guilty don't they have to -- I don't remember if this is just limited to the State systems or not -- don't they have to waive their rights to appeal?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I just don't see that as a common sense proposition.  If you're a teller, when are you more scared, when the guy has a gun pointed at you and says get the money or when the guy does not have a gun so far as you can see and says you better come with me over to the vault?

So if the teenager has a lot of friends on his Facebook page then you are going to evaluate it by a different standard; you know, friends all over different age groups and everything else, that's a different standard than if he has only a few friends that have access to his statements?

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's just a belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me.  They can rely on diversity jurisdiction.  It's not a concession that they don't have general Federal jurisdiction.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. O'Connell.     Ann O'Connell Adams  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government's view is that the rule of Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or be sued in a ""court of competent jurisdiction."" The best reading of that phrase in Fannie Mae's charter is that it authorizes the corporation to sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of law. We think there is a plausible story for why Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if you don't find that explanation completely satisfying, the text of the statute should control. The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the Federal courts. In this case, the Court should give Congress the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language ""suit is authorized in a State or Federal 'court of competent jurisdiction,'"" then that means that you have to look to some other provision of law to see if that court is vested with jurisdiction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   Ann O'Connell Adams  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Brooks.     Brian P. Brooks  Well, again, Your Honor, and it's interesting, I've actually personally spoken to some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late '60s, okay? They were all former government officials, because Fannie was, in '68, being extricated from its Federal agency role. Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper. Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of 1970 would have wanted it.  Fannie Mae wasn't.  Fannie Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be torn apart from Ginnie Mae.  That's why the original board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD Undersecretary.  It consisted of a former general counsel of HUD.  They were all Federal officials at that time, and it took multiple years before they could be extricated.  There is just a history here, which makes it different. But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the largest participant in the largest market in the U.S. economy.  Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because the language of the '50s and a complicated history differed a little bit from the language of the '70s, would be a significant policy shift that we would argue isn't justified by either history or policy or text.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  But, I mean, the point is usually when you see language, you know, in -- in interstate commerce, your immediate reaction is, oh, that's Federal jurisdiction as opposed to State. But here the one thing we know is they didn't want it to matter.  They said in violation of Federal or State law. So as I look at it, the -- your instinctive reaction is to say, well, then, of course you don't have to worry about the provision that is in there to limit the offense to Federal -- Federal offenses.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but your assumption is that there -- an element is an element is an element, whether it's substantive or jurisdictional. And that's not the way our -- our cases have treated them, or -- or the general.  I mean, you don't need to rely on it for -- for everything, but the Model Penal Code draws a precise distinction between matters relating to the harm or evil sought to be prevented and facts that relate to jurisdiction, venue, or limitations.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, I know.  But my point is it's required for a conviction.  But that doesn't necessarily mean that you would include the jurisdictional element when you're saying, well, what does the claim -- what is the -- what is the harm or evil sought to be prevented? And in a statute like this, it seems to me that that's what Congress is concerned about, not the technical elements like, for example, venue.  I mean, is venue an element if it's listed under the -- the criminal provision? Well, sure. It's an element that could have to be proved depending on the terms of the statute.  But that has nothing to do with the harm or evil sought to be prevented.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but they wanted to make arsons offenses, whether in violation of Federal or State law.

In other words, just creating a parallel duty -- which I understood you to tell Justice Alito that would be okay.  Instead, they're using a shorthand, ""the Locate."" Is that -- is that all the -- the only difference?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you would have no --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You would have no case if New Jersey passed a law saying, as a matter of New Jersey law, we hereby adopt, you know, everything under the Securities Exchange Act, including, in particular, Regulation SHO.  That is State law.  We're following the Federal law because, you know, we think it's easier to do that than write up our own securities code. That's fine with you?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, it is.  It's saying -- it's saying wherever it says Federal law as -- we just strike that and put in New Jersey law.  They can do that.  They can adopt whatever law -- source of law they want.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Stris.     Peter K. Stris  Right.  So I -- I would put it slightly differently.  If I said that, you know, I think that's -- it's imprecise. Any act of market manipulation in the context of naked short selling will necessarily violate Regulation SHO, but every violation of Regulation SHO is not market manipulation. What Regulation SHO does is it sets a floor. And if you engage in certain conduct, you -- you short a stock, you haven't borrowed it, you have no reason to believe you've borrowed it, the SEC can fine you under statutes where there's no prior right of action.  That doesn't make out a market manipulation came -- claim, Justice Ginsburg.  To prove market manipulation, you have to go a step further.  You have to show that that was done intentionally to try and depress the value of the stock. So the point I was trying to make is if there were an analogue to our State law claim, it's not Reg SHO, it's 10b-5.  And -- and the idea that you can't bring a parallel 10b-5 action in State court and have the State court adjudicate it, that's never been the law.  But they're -- they're essentially trying to do an end run around that analysis by suggesting that somehow Reg SHO is what we are trying to enforce. Reg SHO is not relevant for that purpose. Reg SHO doesn't help us.  Even under Federal law we wouldn't have a private right of action.  Section 9(d) of the Exchange Act, there's no private right of action for that.  Section 10a-1 of the Exchange Act.  These are the ones that deal with naked short selling.  No private right of action.  Has to be 10(b).   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

Roberts, Jr.  By ""inholdings,"" you include the submerged lands that were conveyed to the State upon statehood?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  Now, is there any basis for distinguishing the submerged lands from the -- I don't know what to call it -- the land that are in the other inholdings or do you understand the government's argument to be that they are treated the same?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The -- the rest of us are interested in your answer to Justice Breyer.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. Kovner.     Rachel P. Kovner  I don't think there's any dispute that's what the plain text says.  And the reason I don't think that's ridiculous or irrational, Your Honor, is because when ANILCA was enacted, there was a very well-settled regulatory regime that didn't subject private lands to any kind of plenary authority. So Congress had every reason to -- may I just finish my sentence? Congress had every reason to expect that would remain the rule, nationwide.  And what it was concerned about was that the Park Service would deviate from that approach in Alaska when these new lands were added.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Findley, you have two minutes remaining.   ",14-1209

It's -- it's water that the U.S. holds title to and interests in that water, even though they are not reflected in the title?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It has to hold title to the interest.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's where I kind of stumbled in your argument, because you're not claiming title to the submerged land.  It's clear that's in the State --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- right? You're -- you -- you rely on the reserved water right. Is that ever expressed as ""title,"" as opposed to a -- the words -- ""usufructuary right""?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's just a -- I'm sorry to pause -- pause there. I understood with reserve water doctrine is usually, you know, we need water to do this, so we get -- we have a reserve right to 40 percent of the water, or the initial flow, or whatever.  I've never thought of it as a basis for general regulatory authority.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but if that's right, I mean, it -- it -- it's right because the question is do these things apply solely to public lands.  And you say, well, the second sentence doesn't matter because we say they don't apply solely to public lands. That's not a very significant protection for the inholders.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What does -- you -- on page 24, and I think you have mentioned this several times, so -- you talk about this isn't a problem because your authority is circumscribed and you have the inholdings are -- have substantial protections against Park Service regulation.  What -- what are those protections?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you -- do you think the statute that authorizes you to regulate is the one that says ""the Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as the Secretary considers necessary or proper""? Would you --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but do you rely on that one? Because if you rely on that one, I don't see that it provides any protections at all.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So danger -- danger or harm, is that what it's limited to? Or could it be limited to scenic, environmental, noise impacts?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but your authority is not limited if you get Chevron deference. If you get Chevron deference on determining what you think is necessary or proper, the idea that that's a substantial circumscription of your authority doesn't seem to me to be a valid one.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what's the number? What percentage of people have to have warrants before you can imply that whenever an officer stops someone, it is to, you know, illegally search them because they're very likely to have an arrest warrant?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I suppose that's related.  I mean, your brief had a lot of numbers in it.  And if only one out of a hundred people have arrest warrants, then I think you really couldn't imply that that was the purpose of the stop.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And some of these numbers -- obviously, you have, in particular communities, high numbers, but some of them didn't strike me -- I was surprised how low they were.  323,000 is a big number, but that's the entire State of Florida.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is that? You mean every time a police officer pulls somebody over and runs a warrant check, it's because he thinks it's likely there's a warrant? Might it -- might it be to protect him when he walks up to the car? He'd like to know that the person is wanted for murder, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I guess -- I mean, you do require us to determine whether or not he ran the warrant check to ensure his safety in -- in this interaction, or as an investigative matter.  I mean, does that make a difference?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're arguing something that the State's conceded, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You -- you said that the -- that the stop was made for the purpose of running for the arrest warrants.  I just don't know the basis for that, other than your statistics that in certain areas there are a high number of arrest warrants.  In many areas there aren't. I mean, how -- is it entirely empirical? Do we have to accept and generalize from your empirical evidence which -- that the purpose must be to execute or to check for arrest warrants?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But he immediately runs the arrest -- warrants check when he makes the stop because he wants to know who he's dealing with.  It would be -- it would be, I think, bad police work to not run the warrant check until after you've had an interaction with the person when the danger that you could have found out about might have been when it's too late to -- to act on it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I understand that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're implying -- I'm still trying to get at how you decide what the purpose was.  In your brief you say several times, oh, the purpose is to -- to run the warrants check.  And I just want to know why that's -- why that's the case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let's say that the warrant check is something he does when he arrests people.  I don't doubt that, but it doesn't prove that that was his purpose in -- in the stop.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How often are -- are cars -- people stopped driving, an officer walks up to the car and they're shot? Has that happened a fair amount of times?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It does happen.  So is there no other reason for checking to see if there are warrants out for that person before you walk up to the car? Or before you conduct an inquiry with a ticket?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It seems to me not wanting to get shot's a pretty good reason.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Would your rule apply in that situation?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Would your rule apply in a situation where the officer approaches the car for a purpose that is later found to be insufficient under Terry? You would suppress whatever evidence is find -- found in that situation too, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So it would apply in the stopping of the automobile situation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You -- you disagree with Judge Friendly's analysis in the Friedland case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, with -- with his analysis.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fletcher.     Brian H. Fletcher  Well, you don't -- you certainly don't have to resolve it on the merits.  But I think all you need to do is to say it was not unreasonable for us to think that we had done it here. And I think the way that you know that is because Judge Murphy, in a very persuasive dissent, concluded that we were not only reasonable, but correct in thinking that we'd satisfied our obligations.  And also because not even Petitioner is defending the rule that the district court applied. The district court said you cannot conciliate a claim on a classwide basis.  You have to conciliate on behalf of each and every one of these 67 individuals.  That's the rule the Eighth Circuit applied.  That's the rule Judge Murphy criticized.  And Petitioner doesn't defend it.  What Petitioner said instead is that this was all fine as long as we had a pattern-or-practice theory.  And it only became not fine when we lost on summary judgment on the pattern-or-practice issue.  But I don't think that -- our -- our conciliation can become inadequate only when we lose a summary judgment motion. Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose that the settlement agreements often take into account liability for attorneys' fees --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- how they are going to apportion those.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't know where that -- where that artificial line comes from.  I mean, the defendant wants to win.  And I don't know -- it's getting pretty -- when I was practicing that -- parties didn't come in and say, I want to win, and I want to win on this ground.  They said, I want to win.  I want the case thrown out.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if they don't? What if they don't come back the next day? What if they don't sue in the next district? Then it seems to me the purposes of this fee-shifting provision have not been served.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Wouldn't it be an adequate response to your concern if fees were awarded solely on the ground in which the case was dismissed? That would be -- in other words, the judge would have the discretion to do that.  If the judge looks at this and says, okay, it's clear you're in the wrong venue, you know, and hours of research would have showed you that.  So, you know, it's frivolous on that ground, and I'm throwing the case out because the -- the defendant prevails on that ground. Now, the defendant may have spent a lot of other money with depositions and everything else.  But the judge could say, well, you can file the -- the case again tomorrow.  You probably will.  You just have to go into the next district.  So I a.m. going to award fees. They're going to be equal to the amount of time the defendant had to spend defending against your frivolous venue assertion. It doesn't have to do that.  I mean, you know, if you have the wrong venue, and they spend five years doing depositions because you have the wrong venue, they should probably get fees for all of it.  But if it's just, you know, a small portion, easily disposed of, is that a possible remedy?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then that may be a case contrary to the proposal where it's that discreet.  In other words, your frivolity on that particular point compelled them to incur $4.6 million over many years.  It's not their fault that that issue didn't come up until later in the litigation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's sort of intertwined with the merits.  It's not a venue objection.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah.  Well, it may be a discreet issue, but it's a cause in fact for all the other fees.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Wait.  Wait.  I suppose whether the issue we're debating may not be directly pertinent, my question is whether or not that could be a factor that the district courts could look at in deciding the amount of fees and so on.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, so what you're saying is in -- the judge said they cannot precede again in this case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And why -- why isn't that prevailing? Why aren't they prevailing? What -- they may not prevail in another case or -- that's your argument?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because they have engaged in -- under your theory, they have engaged in an illegal practice.  But they -- they prevailed in this case, but they may be sued by somebody else in another case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you -- yeah, I -- what do you think the significance of Mach Mining is on this issue?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Then why isn't that -- I mean, if -- if the EEOC doesn't do anything at all -- I mean, under Mach Mining, if they don't conciliate, the remedy is go conciliate.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Wouldn't -- wouldn't you think if the reason they're -- didn't -- it was frivolous for them to bring the suit without conciliation, you know, if somebody said, Well, we've got to conciliate, and they said, Oh, forget about it, go ahead, why wouldn't fees be a perfectly appropriate sanctions? In other words, there's no -- under some sense, there's no incentive for them to conciliate, because if it turns out they didn't, they have to go conciliate.  But if they were subject to fees because they ignored their duty to conciliate, it seems to me that might give them some incentive to get it right the first time.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you're not likely to be subject to this sanction in many cases, which is a good thing.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But sometimes -- okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We -- what is the -- I suppose I should know, but, I mean, what is the general practice? I mean, it would be kind of futile to go before the Eighth Circuit and say we think you should overrule your precedent, at least on the panel decision. But that doesn't mean they're not free to raise the argument here.  This is where -- where you should go if you want a court of appeals overruled.   ",14-1375

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The Environmental Protection Agency, which -- the State or Federal?   John G.

A sensible balance is essential in a pluralistic society like ours, in which people of every faith on earth live and work side by side, and the government has got to administer rules that are fair to everyone.

Your compelling interest is that women obtain the contraceptive services through the insurance plan or the third-party administrator hired by the Petitioners, hired by the Little Sisters. In other words, it seems to me you can't say that what you're trying to do is make sure everybody has this coverage.  You want to make sure they have it through the program set up by the Little Sisters, and that's what they object to.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The point is that it's the form in which the services are provided that you object to, not the fact that they be provided or not, because that's not the question.  In other words, the Petitioner has used the phrase ""hijacking,"" and it seems to me that that's an accurate description of what the government wants to do.  They want to use the mechanism that the Little Sisters and the other Petitioners have set up to provide services because they want the coverage to be seamless. Now, maybe that's a sufficiently compelling government interest, the form in which the services are provided, but the interest is not whether or not women receive contraceptive services.  The Petitioners do not object to the fact that the people who work for them will have these services provided.  They object to having them provided through the mechanism that they have set up because they think, you know, whether you or I or anybody else thinks, they think that that complicity is sinful.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  This is -- this is not just a case of the government dealing with a third party based on the Petitioners' objection.  The objection is that the government is hijacking their process, their insurance company, their third-party administrator that they have hired and set up to provide these services.  I understand the distinction between yes, you can do what you want, but you can't compel other people to take actions that are consistent with your religious beliefs. But that's not what's going on here.  It is the relationship between the insurer that the Little Sisters have hired or the third-party administrator with respect to other -- other entities that is being used by the government to provide these services.  It's not just a third party that's being compelled.  They want -- it's not just that they want third parties to take certain action.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They are -- they are not third parties.  They are the insurance company that the Petitioners have hired.  It's the third-party administrator that they have hired.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It seems to me that the balance is pretty clear.  You want the coverage for contraceptive services to be provided, I think as you -- as it said, seamlessly.  You want it to be in the one insurance package.  That's done.  That is the compelling government interest. And on the other side, the question is whether or not people who have sincere religious objections to being complicit in that through the hiring of the insurance company, the third-party administrator on terms where they provided, whether the government's compelling interest outweighs those sincere religious objections.  Is that a fair understanding of the case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there a fairer one?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what is the -- the government's interest in requiring -- requiring compliance by Catholic Charities of Pittsburgh, but totally exempting Catholic Charities of Erie?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The difference, of course, is, as you -- it's properly phrased in the briefing, is the accommodation is the way in which the organizations comply with the mandate.  With respect to Catholic Charities of Erie, though, they don't have to comply to the accommodation or any other way.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They are exempt.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You have to draw the line? Is it -- could you apply the same requirements you apply to the Little Sisters to the church entity itself?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  But you understand the argument.  It's -- and we've said this in cases like O Centro and others, that if you have a lot of exemptions, it undermines your argument that this is such a compelling interest.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it comes down to a question of who has to do the paperwork? If it's the employee that has to do it, that's -- that's no good. If it's the religious organization that has to do it, that's okay?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They're on the Exchanges, right?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  You said, yes, it is a hassle to go to the Exchange, although it's - you know, I've heard about how easy it is.  You get an Exchange, you get it, or you allow your infrastructure, as Petitioners have said, to be used as the vehicle for -- for providing it. I'm not saying it comes out one way or another from your perspective.  I'm just trying to focus on exactly what is at issue.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's a question whether you want the employee to sign a paper or you want the Little Sisters to sign a paper.  In the one case, it's an administrative burden as you've said.

One of the -- a license plate's here for RE/MAX Realty.  You are not going to see that on a postal stamp.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but there is an easy answer to that, which is they don't have to get in the business of selling space on their license plates to begin with.  If you don't want to have the Al-Qaeda license plate, don't get into the business of allowing people to buy their -- you know, the space to put on whatever they want to say.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that might be because they've done that since, I don't know, the time of the pyramids or whatever.  But they haven't had license plate messages since time immemorial, so maybe that is why they shouldn't be considered just like the monuments.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.

But I thought you said, well, of course there's coercion because you can't survive in North Dakota without a car, which I'm happy to postulate, but -- but what is -- what is the basis for that -- that right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so for purposes of analyzing this case, we have to assume that States could prohibit people from driving, period.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Now, as far as the border goes, now when it's -- I understand stopping people at the border.  But what if there's a sign at the border that says anyone who uses the State roads consents to, you know, blood-alcohol testing if they're -- they're pulled over?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose the reason would be that the issue we're talking about, all the traffic deaths, right? I mean, if -- I mean, obviously it's not a realistic contention, but that's -- a lot of the hypotheticals aren't.  I'm trying to get to the basis of, it seems to me that the flexibility that a State has in this situation depends upon what rights the motorist has. And I understand the Fourth Amendment argument, but it does seem to me that if you're making an unconstitutional-conditions argument, it is pertinent to determine what authority the State has in any event.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm not sure that was the -- I'm not sure that's different in this case.  I mean, in the -- in the railroad case, I think what we're saying is that the need for safe transportation on the trains to protect the innocent people there is -- is compelling enough that -- that it falls within the special-needs exception.  And I'm -- again, I'm not -- not sure why that analysis wouldn't apply here. I -- I don't know.  I suspect more people die from drunk driving accidents than from train accidents, and so the special need would seem to be just as -- as compelling.   INTERRUPTING John G.

But your position, if you were taking a considered position at trial, is that the -- the district court was wrong, because that was -- you presented the facts and you defended those facts, under your view.

The way you check is to come up with a district that would achieve the same partisan objectives without respect to race, and you weren't put to that test in this case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  I mean, it makes it -- I guess you have a greater degree of confidence if you have an alternative that said, look, if they wanted partisanship, which is usually a pretty high priority for politicians, if they wanted partisanship, they would have done this, but instead they did this.  But if you're not -- if you're not forced to show that, then you have reliance on, you know, however many quotes you can find, and -- and I get back to the question I asked before.  What do you -- how do you analyze it if it's 10 percent race, 10 percent partisanship and 80 percent who say nothing at all?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that Janis?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  He wasn't in the legislature when this took -- was approved, was he?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I thought the -- the person who drafted the plan -- maybe I've got that mixed up.  It wasn't Janis -- was -- was not in the legislature.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you could have -- you think you could have drawn a map under Cromartie that would show if you wanted to protect incumbency or -- and Republican or Democratic advantage, you would have done this, and instead you did this?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but if you moved those districts, then you'd have to move other districts to make up for -- for it.  And again, I think that's what Cromartie does.  It says we don't have to speculate about 10 percent, 10 percent, 80 percent. What you have to show is that partisanship could not have been a factor, because you couldn't have drawn it any differently without affecting partisanship.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If -- if race and partisanship are co-extensive, which one predominates?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  If race and partisanship are co-extensive, then which one -- it's -- you may say it's an abstract question that isn't that the same but doesn't fit these facts -- but if that's the case, which one predominates?

They say this isn't about partisanship; this is about race.  Okay.  Show us.  You draw the district that would protect the partisanship interest that's going to be different.  And yet the -- the lower court did not subject them to that inquiry.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, okay, if there is evidence that race is at issue.  I will give you a chance to answer the question I asked each of the others.  I wouldn't want to deprive you of that opportunity. (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you're looking to see whether race was the motive.  What do you do if, as I said, you know, 10 say yes, 10 say something else, and 80 don't say anything?

Roberts, Jr.  As I read your brief and the Petitioner's brief, I got the sense that there was quite a bit of difference between the two.  The government seems to be taking a much higher standard before these punitive damages, or however you want to describe them, would be allowed.  You use terms like ""egregious"" a lot.  Your friend uses terms like, you know, ""intentional,"" more than mere negligence.  Is that perception -- do you think that perception is an accurate one?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Phillips  Mr. Chief Justice, I think the problem with that is -- is that it -- unless you come up with -- I mean, I -- you know, recklessness -- I -- or egregiousness -- I don't know what ""egregiousness"" means, and I don't know how you -- how you evaluate that on review. I do know what it means to -- to take an objectively reasonable position.  More than simply something that's beyond frivolous, it is a substantial argument that either the patent doesn't extend to -- to my particular product or the patent itself is invalid. And circumstances where -- where that is true, my hope would be that the Court, recognizing the extraordinary importance of limiting patents and the monopolies that flow from there, would drive the legal decision in this context -- of the legal standard in this context exactly where the -- where the Court adopted it in Seagate. That's the court that has the experience and expertise, and I would hope under these circumstances, in this very unusual situation, because patent law in this context I do think is very different than almost any other tort context, I would hope in the one -- in the -- in the decidedly one-sided approach that 284 is, where it only gives to the plaintiffs the ability to do what they can do and what they want, that the Court would adopt the kind of rigorous objective standard that allows both for the -- both for the determination that the -- that the patent is invalid or doesn't infringe, and that that's examined on an objective basis.

I mean, the way we -- the -- courts have been used to dealing with discretionary standards for a long time.

Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Yang.     Anthony A. Yang  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Peterson.     William R. Peterson  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We agree with the government that orders denying statutory motions to reopen are reviewable in the courts of appeals, and we agree with the government that orders of the board denying invitations for the board to reopen sua sponte are not reviewable in the courts of appeals because they're committed to agency discretion by law. Where we part ways with the government is on how you distinguish between the two of them.  And we offer what we think is the easiest test, which is the timeliness.  If an alien asks the board to reopen within the statutory deadline, within the 90 days, he has a right to reopening that is reviewable under Kucana if the board denies it. On the other hand, if the alien requests reopening after the expiration of the 90-day statutory period, the board is not obligated to grant reopening in those circumstances.  The board could grant reopening only through its exercise of sua sponte authority, and as a result, that decision is wholly in the board's discretion. Now, the government turns to Chenery to suggest a rule that courts must always characterize agency decisions in precisely the way the agencies did. This Court, we think, rejected that argument in Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers where it explained that Chenery has nothing whatever to do with whether agency action is reviewable.  So we see Brotherhood as a remarkably analogous case.  There the request being made of the commission was to reconsider a previous decision, and the court distinguished between two types of ways that a party could ask the commission to change one of its earlier decisions. It could file a motion for reconsideration, simply suggesting that the law was wrong, the earlier decision was simply incorrect on the same record.  The court held that that is not reviewable.  Or the party could file a motion to reopen with new evidence attached, which would be reviewable.  And what the court said was that in determining whether the court of appeals had jurisdiction over the petition for review, it didn't need to focus on how the agency characterized its order.  It could focus on whether that order was reviewable. So in this case, Petitioner acknowledges that if equitable tolling is unavailable, his motion to reopen was untimely.  If he filed 115 days, his only argument in favor of timeliness is equitable tolling.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but normally it's a -- a circuit precedent establishing a particular rule on the merits doesn't operate as a bar to jurisdiction.  I mean -- I mean, they may give you a very short order citing the decision that controls the precedent in the particular case, but they certainly have jurisdiction in reviewing. For example, I mean, let's suppose you've got an argument that you want to overturn the precedent. They would have had jurisdiction to do that.   William R. Peterson  Mr. Chief Justice, we think the difference here is that the deadline isn't simply a question of whether the board was right or wrong in denying the statutory motion.  We see the timeliness as the key distinction between whether the board's discretion was unfettered on reopening or fettered on reopening.  And so the first question as we see it -- that is how we distinguish orders denying statutory motions to reopen from orders denying motions to reopen sua sponte. And so the first question we would say that a court of appeals would need to address is whether the alien's motion to reopen before the Board of Immigration Appeals was timely. If that motion was untimely, then it rested solely in the board's discretion whether to grant or deny reopening.  And for that reason, under Heckler v. Chaney, under Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, the Fifth Circuit properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

You cite in your brief language on Joint Appendix page 195 where the judge says -- I think these are the instructions.  Maybe I'm wrong, but you cite them, where the judge says mere knowledge or acquiescence without participation in the unlawful plan is not sufficient. Is that -- that's the language, I take it, you're talking about with --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- ""the jury was instructed.""   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, on page 194, it says, ""The extent of a defendant's participation has no bearing on the issue of his guilt."" And I just wondered whether your -- it's active participation. That suggests to me something that goes to the extent of the defendant's participation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You haven't talked about Majestic yet, and your friend said that's maybe because you had never raised that below.  Is that -- is that true?

I thought you told me you agreed with your friend that it gives broader scope to the range of evidence that could be admitted beyond charging simply the substantive offense.   John G.

So what is the logic that says it doesn't violate the Sixth Amendment if it's tainted funds, but it does if it's untainted funds?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but is -- doesn't it make sense the -- the sort of substitution rule? I mean, if you've got $10 million in drug activity -- money and you had $5 million, and you spent $10 million, you can't say, you know, oh, I spent the drug money, you can't touch the $5 million.  It seems to me that's what the statute is doing when it says whatever it's a reasonable substitute or assets substituted for.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do -- I -- I don't know how these things actually work.  I mean, the defendant obviously has daily expenses, and -- and that the government's freeze order apparently goes beyond the money she has.  What, does she get an allowance or -- or something?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so if her -- putting aside lawyers, if her daughter's tuition bill comes due, she can't pay that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But she can surely pay the rent or the mortgage?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess you're -- I think this may be Justice Sotomayor's point. Your argument, you're distinguishing tainted and untainted assets, and I understand that.  I just don't understand that if you can freeze the assets despite the Sixth Amendment when they're tainted, I don't understand why it's not the same rule when they're untainted. You may have -- may have statutory arguments, you -- but if you have arguments, it has nothing to do with the constitutional right to counsel.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Your -- your argument in Monsanto focused on the tainted aspects of the proceeds.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It takes the -- it - it establishes that right in the same way as the issue here, without counsel on the part of the defendant, because you -- I assume Kaley applies to tainted assets as well as untainted.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So add to the context of what Justice Breyer was concerned about.  You not only can do that, you can do that without giving the defendant any type of hearing, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought -- I thought under Kaley, the defendant didn't have to be provided a -- a hearing with respect to the pretrial --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- seizure of assets.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, how -- I don't know how these things work.  Let's say you get an order freezing the assets, and it's $10 million, and -- and the defendant comes into the court, whatever, and says, look, my lawyer is going to cost $100,000, one percent of the assets that are at issue here.  Then you would argue, no, even though it's only a tiny fraction of what we're seizing, the Sixth Amendment doesn't even entitle him to one percent of the assets that might -- might end up being forfeitable?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How does it work? Like the -- you know, the daughter's tuition bill comes due, you know, and it's whoever -- you know, who knows how much these days, $60,000.  And the defendant cannot pay that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, why was it -- why would it be -- if he can exercise equitable discretion for the daughter's tuition, why -- why not when the Sixth Amendment is at stake? And, you know, counsel of choice, it turns on that, it would seem to me that if there's going to be a case in which equitable discretion will be exercised, it ought to be in that situation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, and they're all cases in which the defendant has not been found guilty.  And -- and in all those cases, I mean, all you have to do, all the governments have to do, all the State governments have to do, is provide for a fine and argue, then, well, unless we -- if we don't freeze the assets, there won't be money left to pay a fine.  So this could apply -- I guess this is the point.  This could apply to every crime on the books.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It goes to the Medicaid trust fund?   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kovner.     Rachel P. Kovner  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Kansas Supreme Court erred when it found that the State violated the Eighth Amendment by conducting joint sentencing proceedings for the crimes the Respondents committed together.  Joint proceedings can enhance accuracy and fairness, as a long line of this Court's cases hold.  They provide a fuller evidentiary record to juries that are assessing relative culpability, and they prevent arbitrary disparities that may arise when two juries reach inconsistent conclusions about the common facts of a single crime.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. Kovner, is there any difference between the Federal government's position and the position of the State of Kansas on this question?   Rachel P. Kovner  As to the standard, I think there's a small difference.  I think our proposal is that the constitutional standard is whether evidence or argument resulted in a denial of due process or the deprivation of an individualized sentencing proceeding. And that's slightly different from Kansas's standard, because Kansas is proposing a rule that involves analysis of risk, and we think that is part of the statutory rule under Rule 14, as Justice Sotomayor alluded to.  It's also part of the statutory standard that states ""by and large are applying,"" but we think the constitutional question is just, was this person deprived of a fair trial by the evidence that came in? And that's the constitutional question.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I -- I guess the strongest evidence for Reginald is Temica's testimony. It's -- it's pretty prejudicial.  She said he's -- he's the one who -- he said he's the one who shot.   Rachel P. Kovner  I don't think that that's prejudicial evidence, certainly not any constitutional problem with the admission of that evidence.  I don't think that even Reginald Carr is asserting that that evidence couldn't have come in against him.  Rather he is asserting or the State below suggested -- the State court below suggested maybe that -- maybe the State didn't know about that evidence, and maybe just as a factual matter it wouldn't have come in. But there's no constitutional unfairness with evidence coming in on a co-defendant's case that's harmful but accurate as to you.  That's something the Court said in -- in Zafiro.  If it's accurate and relevant evidence that comes in on a co-defendant's case, there's no constitutional unfairness as to you. I think Reginald's primary claim before this Court is that there was a violation of State evidentiary law because some of the other evidence, the evidence of bad influence, might not have come in under the State rules.  I think this Court's cases are clear that a violation of State evidentiary law is simply a matter of State law.  The State could decide that necessitates reversal, but it's not a constitutional error.  That's what this Court said in Romano.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Liu.     John G.

Roberts, Jr.  We will hear argument first this morning in Case 14-452, Kansas v. Gleason and the consolidated cases. General Schmidt.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General. Mr. Green. NOS. 14-452 AND 14-449.     Jeffrey T. Green  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Katyal.       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A man is being put to death under jury instructions that are so confusing that there is a reasonable likelihood that some juries would interpret those instructions to bar consideration of the mitigating evidence and others would not.  That ambiguity and inequity is impermissible under the Eighth Amendment. Now, the State's answer is the instructions allowed the jury in a catch-all provision to consider everything as mitigating.  That's irrelevant.  There are two fundamentally different questions.  The first is the ""what."" What kinds of circumstances count as mitigating? And second is the ""how."" How does a jury determine if those circumstances exist in a given case? So --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The circumstances -- the circumstances that count as -- as mitigating, 4(a) of the -- the Gleason brief, ""any other aspect of the defendant's character, background or record, and any other aspect of the offense which was presented.""     Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice.  We agree that, for example, the jury was instructed that Reginald Carr's child abuse, if it existed, could be a mitigating factor.  The question is: How was a jury to determine whether Reginald Carr was abused in the first place as a child? So the catch-all provision doesn't answer that question. Now, General Schmidt's answer is, well, look at the language of instruction 2.  And, Mr. Chief Justice, I think you were referring to that.  This is what they say -- what he says in their reply brief at page --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  I was quoting from 7.     Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe it's the same as 2.     In 7 -- in 7 -- in 7, I don't see quite the same thing.  But -- but I -- I think our -- out general point here is that this Court has said repeatedly in Abdul-Kabir and in Braverman that the mere presentation of evidence is enough.  The evidence has to be given full effect as a mitigating circumstance. And I understand that different people can look at this -- these set of instructions as a whole and come up with different ways of interpreting them.  But this Court's decision in Boyde says as long as there is a reasonable likelihood that a jury could read them in a confusing way and bar the consideration of mitigating evidence, that is enough. Now, Justice Scalia, you said, well, that doesn't square with common sense.  What about an example like, quote, ""interest-free loans for people with good credit""? Now, our argument is not simply that the jury instruction said beyond a reasonable doubt, though they did 9 times.  It's that they coupled the beyond a reasonable doubt with the language found to exist, that mitigating circumstances must be found to exist 9 times. And so, Justice Scalia --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you say something -- if you're considering whether to retire, you said you should be absolutely sure you have enough money to live on and you ought to think about whether you're going to be bored.     Well --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You wouldn't think you had to be absolutely sure you were going to be bored.       Well, let me just do it, Mr. Chief Justice, with respect to the -- the hypothetical that Justice Scalia said.  If -- if the hypo was interest-free loans should be given to those found to have good credit, found to have good credit, which mirrors these instructions, and then the language used found with a certain standard beyond a reasonable doubt, or whatever, I think it's absolutely plausible that people would read that instruction and say that applies just as much to people without good credit. They'd apply the same standard.  And that squares not just with the experience in the States.  At least 24 States are using this, if -- if not every State.  They can't point to a single State that says found to exist occurs in the jury instructions 9 times.  It's not just the absence of an affirmative instruction, it's that these instructions are injecting confusion and uncertainty. And the distinction here is that you can have two men going to -- having committed virtually the same crime with the same aggravating and mitigating circumstances; one will be sentenced to death, one to life, simply because of a legal interpretation of what the jury instructions say.  That is not --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what burden of proof do you think the jury applied with respect to the showing of mercy?     Well --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  They were clearly instructed that they can show mercy.  So what -- they didn't say anything about the burden of proof.     And Mr. Chief Justice, they were clearly instructed that mercy was a, quote, ""a mitigating factor."" And so they were then told 9 times that they had to find a mitigating factor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think they had -- they would have interpreted that I have to determine whether to extend mercy beyond a reasonable doubt?     Absolutely, Your Honor.  I think this Court has said many times that we presume a jury follows its instructions, and this is a perfect example of that --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know.  But you're -- you're begging the question to say the instruction was this and the jury didn't follow it.     I don't -- I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice.  I think this is a perfect example of how mercy would have been applied beyond a reasonable doubt.  If there was case for mercy after reading all of the -- all the sentencing proceedings, it was that Reginald Carr had been abused badly as a child.  And that's why mercy should have extended.  We are -- we're talking about death-qualified jurors here who already can't extend mercy just simply because death is on the line.  There had to be something additional.  That something additional, in the context of this case, was all about the child abuse of Reginald Carr. And, Justice Kagan, that's exactly what the State, time and again, Joint Appendix pages 250 to 256, said that -- that Reginald Carr did not meet his burden of proof on.  And so this was front and center at the mitigating phase of the trial.  This was extremely confusing, I think, to a jury.  And, of course, this Court's decision in Boyde has a far lower standard than that.  It's simply just was there something more than a possibility, it doesn't even have to be 50 percent, that the jury interpreted the instructions the wrong way.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you think the jury -- if you -- are they supposed to consider things they didn't find to exist?     Oh, no.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think it's a bit of a stretch to say found to exist implies a particular standard of proof.     I don't think so at all, Your Honor.  I think found to exist, that's the most natural way of reading it.  And if there's any doubt, just look at Instruction No. 1.  The first thing the jury was told -- this is at Petition Appendix page 500 of the Reginald Carr petition.  ""The laws of Kansas provide a separate sentencing proceeding shall be conducted when a defendant has been found guilty of capital murder."" That's what they're told after hearing months of testimony about whether or not the Carrs committed the crime under what standard? The beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard. That was the only thing the jury was told, time and again, both at the guilt phases, the 9 times in the mitigating phase of this trial.  It thinks -- it's absolutely reasonable for a jury to have interpreted the jury instructions to say that's the standard that applies here. And boy, if that's the standard that applied in this case, that is unlike any proceeding in Anglo-American jurisprudence to my knowledge.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But what -- what evidence that shouldn't have been admitted wouldn't have been admitted in the -- in the separate trial?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That sounds -- that sounds pretty prejudicial to me.  If the second case, you say, oh, the jury considered this and individual circumstances, you know, these people act together, and by the way, a jury of your peers unanimously found beyond a reasonable doubt that this guy should be sentenced to death; now do whatever you want with this guy.  That sounds pretty prejudicial to me.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Green.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Who -- who -- if you have separate proceedings, who -- who gets to go second? Because obviously that person will have a significant advantage since they'll see all of the evidence presented in the -- in the other proceeding.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And most of the evidence here was overlapping, so that at least you'll have -- you'll be able to see what the State thought about that evidence.  You have sort of a dry run if you're the second person.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that cross-examination is important. Were there any common defense witnesses?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So at least it would be -- it would be helpful for the second -- the person who goes second to know, well, what did the prosecutor talk -- how did the prosecutor attempt to cross-examine that witness, because I am going to call the same witness, and her testimony is going to be a lot better the second time around because you will know exactly what the cross-examination questions are going to be.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. McAllister, five minutes.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought the whole point of our decision in Michigan v. Long was to make it clear to State courts that we weren't going to do this kind of thing.  We weren't going to try to look, well, how many Federal cites, how many State cites.  Unless it's clear that it's based solely on State law, then we assume it's the Federal question and Federal basis in that case.  And -- and I assume your friend was correct about how many times the Eighth Amendment was -- was cited in the opinion.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, presumably, the Kansas Supreme Court is familiar with Michigan v. Long, as we are, and they're on notice that if they start putting the Federal authorities mentioning the Eighth Amendment 8 times, that the court is going to look at it as a decision based on Federal law. The whole point of Michigan v. Long was that -- so that we wouldn't have to do what we've been doing for the last 10 minutes, which is to debate whether a decision that mentions both State and Federal law is based on State or Federal law.   INTERRUPTING ",14-449X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein.     Thomas C. Goldstein  Justice Breyer, there's one threshold point that needs to be made, and that is five members of the Court in Concepcion, as I understand their opinions, would not have applied Concepcion in this circumstance.  They would not extend it here whatsoever, because the four members of the Court who -- you and the other members of the Court who agreed with it would not extend it to the circumstance in which the parties have agreed by contract. And Justice Thomas explained in his opinion in that case that the opinion there -- that the -- the principle opinion depended on obstacle preemption, and there is no argument here that this case implicates obstacle preemption because it's a question of contract law.  So at the threshold, I don't think Concepcion would apply here at all. But your question is bigger.  And that is, look, I'm concerned that if we, as the Supreme Court -- U.S. Supreme Court articulate a question of Federal law, particularly on a statute that's as important as the Federal Arbitration Act, particularly on a statute that is -- is rooted in a concern about hostility of the State courts, we have to show people that we're serious. A couple of things about that. First is, we know the California courts are serious in the wake of -- excuse me.  We have filed a supplemental brief.  The California Supreme Court has decided a case called Sanchez.  And Sanchez dealt with the contract that is written like every other Fortune 500 contract is.  And it talks about if the -- the provision barring class action waivers would be deemed invalid.  And the California Supreme Court said that's controlled by Concepcion.  That is an enforceable arbitration agreement right there.  And so now we are dancing on the head of the pin about one contract that's entirely defunct, and the question of whether the reference to State law, when contrasted in another provision of the contract with Federal law, is so far out of bounds. I think that what you have to do is compare two prospects, Justice Breyer.  One is the concern.  And we recognize the concern that if you write in an opinion that says, nah, we're not going to take too hard a look, that the State courts will run wild.  All I can tell you is that there really isn't evidence of that happening at all.  And the Court has doctrines like discrimination against arbitration that can handle it. The second is a reality.  We know for a fact that if you announce an opinion that says, this interpretation of State law -- because we know what the California law is here.  The California Court of Appeals has told us.  This interpretation of State law is just too bad and invalidated my arbitration agreement, that's now a question of Federal law, and we are going to relitigate what State law means.  That is a boundless rule that is going to be invoked in every single arbitration case.  And so you just have to choose between those two prospects. One is you know what will happen.  You will be going against the very first principle of Federal arbitration law, which is that we look to State law in determining whether an arbitration agreement is formed, or you have the hypothetical prospect.  And what I can say to Your Honor is we have a legislature that is there in the event that the hypothetical prospect comes to pass.  We have doctrines to deal with this.  I am just terribly worried about how it is that you write an opinion that says this is not just wrong, it's really really wrong, and explain why in the face of the other things in this contract, the contrast with other contracts that I have given you are out there.  You do retain the possibility, of course, of not deciding the case at all in the wake of Sanchez, why it is that we need to have an opinion about this, given that this is a contract that doesn't exist anymore, and the California Court of Appeals has resolved it is a question that -- that is, you know, very difficult to answer. But if you are going to write an opinion in the case, please do not do it in a way that just invites litigation upon litigation upon litigation because you, as in Oxford Health, are concerned that this Court got it wrong, just like you were concerned that the arbitrator got it wrong.  It is an unfortunate cost of the Federal system that Congress decided this is the job of the Federal courts.  Not everything is a Federal case. If there are no further questions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Landau, you have three minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",14-462X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but that's --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If -- that may be a problem with the FAA.  But the FAA was adopted because State courts were hostile to arbitration, and Congress didn't like that.  Now, how were they hostile to arbitration? They were hostile to arbitration by adopting special rules of contract interpretation that disfavored arbitration.  And in those instances, what the FAA says is that that's what they wanted to stop, special rules of contract interpretation, ordinarily a matter of State law, but not when it's hostile to the FAA. And what could be more hostile to the FAA than to interpret a phrase that says nothing about the FAA to dispense with our holdings about -- as they came about -- our holdings about what the FAA has to say. And to do that even though there's a provision in the contract that says this is governed by the FAA.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, I understand -- I'm sympathetic to the notion that this is a matter of State contract interpretation, but that is precisely what the FAA was getting after, State judges interpreting contracts under special rules hostile to arbitration.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if we were to look to determine whether it is --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- surely, that's a Federal question.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess I don't understand why it's a question of way out of bounds or slightly out of bounds.  It's a question of whether it demonstrates hostility to arbitration.  And I think the way you show that is you say, well, look, here they found a number of provisions illegal, and they struck the whole thing.  Here, every other case that's not about arbitration, when they find a couple of provisions illegal, they just sever those; they keep -- you know, try to keep in effect the rest of the agreement. That's a different rule for arbitration contracts than other contracts.  It's not a question of way out of bounds or way in bounds.  It may be a hard question in some cases; it may be easy in others.  But it's a very simple question of -- of what the rule is. The rule is does it demonstrate hostility to arbitration contracts?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's -- I understand the point and -- but, as I understand the arbitration law, if you have an arbitration agreement, says you're going to arbitrate workplace disputes, but not safety disputes --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- and if there's an issue, is this a safety dispute or not, that's covered by the arbitration agreement.  The arbitrator decides that. If you have a contract that says you agree to arbitrate with all of our subsidiaries except the one that does this, that's not for the arbitrator because you have to decide if that other subsidiary has agreed or not. Now, this one talks about methods of arbitration.  It doesn't seem to me to be covered by either of those two paradigms.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but just clear up, there is an agreement to arbitrate some disputes between DIRECTV and its customers.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's the arbitration agreement.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Eisenstein.     Ilana Eisenstein  Your Honor, there's no doubt that perhaps the D.C. Circuit's envelope-and-a-stamp may have been a bit of hyperbole. But that said, what the Tribe's argument, that it was the subsequent deadlines that would have led it to delay, is really an astounding proposition, which is that their basis for tolling is the existence of the statutes of limitation.  And that really can't be the case, that the fact that once they filed their claim, it may then follow; that additional limitations periods may kick in; that that could warrant delay in and of itself. But even putting that aside, there were other options that the Tribe could have pursued.  For example, having presented its claim, and if it did so prior to -- it said it hoped to be a part of the Cherokee Nation class action, if it did so prior to the Cherokee Nation class action, and the Cherokee Nation class action was in fact certified, then -- then it may have an argument it's part of that class. To the extent to which the Cherokee Nation class was denied, then the only -- then the presentment requirement was the necessary step to moving forward to presenting its claim individually at the contract, Board of Contract Appeals level or at the judicial level. So I don't believe that the inevitability of further litigation in any way is a basis for tolling in this case. If there are no further questions, thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. You have nine minutes remaining, Mr. Strommer.     ",14-510X

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you say join in the institution.  The argument on the other side is that they're seeking to redefine the institution.  Every definition that I looked up, prior to about a dozen years ago, defined marriage as unity between a man and a woman as husband and wife.  Obviously, if you succeed, that core definition will no longer be operable.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  My question is you're not seeking to join the institution, you're seeking to change what the institution is.  The fundamental core of the institution is the opposite-sex relationship and you want to introduce into it a same-sex relationship.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Coverture was not -- coverture was not a universal aspect of marriage around -- around the world.  And there again, if you look at the basic definition, it is between a man and a woman.  It does not always say between a man and a woman in which the woman is subordinate in legal respects.  So I'm not sure it's still again a fair analogy to your situation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're -- you're quite right that the consequences of waiting are not neutral.  On the other hand, one of the things that's truly extraordinary about this whole issue is how quickly has been the acceptance of your position across broad elements of society.  I don't know what the latest opinion polls show. The situation in Maine, I think, is -- is characteristic.  In 2009, I guess it was by referendum, whatever, they banned gay marriage.  In 2012, they enacted it as law.  I mean, that sort of quick change has been a characteristic of this debate, but if you prevail here, there will be no more debate.  I mean, closing a debate can close minds, and -- and it will have a consequence on how this new institution is -- is accepted.  People feel very differently about something if they have a chance to vote on it than if it's imposed on them by -- by the courts.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. (Interruption.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  General, would you like to take a moment?     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, we're ready. Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But, General, I -- I'm sorry.  Go ahead.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The difference, of course, is Lawrence, the whole argument is the State cannot intrude on that personal relationship.  This, it seems to me, is -- is different in that what the argument is is the State must sanction.  It must approve that relationship.  They're two different questions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I'd like to follow up in a line of questioning that Justice Scalia started. We have a concession from your friend that clergy will not be required to perform same-sex marriage, but there are going to be harder questions. Would a religious school that has married housing be required to afford such housing to same-sex couples?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the first part --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about Federal -- it's a Federal question if we make it a matter of constitutional law.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you have enforcement power, too.   ",14-556X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Kennedy.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I'm -- I'm not sure it's necessary to get into sexual orientation to resolve the case.  I mean, if Sue loves Joe and Tom loves Joe, Sue can marry him and Tom can't.  And the difference is based upon their different sex.  Why isn't that a straightforward question of sexual discrimination?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you want wrap up, counsel?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Bonauto, you have three minutes remaining.     Mary L. Bonauto  First, I just want to say that the idea that the ideas of marriage will change is a false dichotomy.  Right now, different-sex couples can choose to marry and rear children.  They can choose to marry at 70 or 90 because of their commitment to one other.  We honor both marriages.  It is only same-sex couples who are foreclosed from marrying under either vision. Second, we agree that these restrictions are, in fact, linked to gender.  There's official classification here, and they are sex linked in an additional way, and that is ideas about what is a proper relationship for a man to have, a real man or a real woman, and that is obviously not with a person of the same sex. I hear that Michigan loves adoption, and, in fact, Michigan has placed intensely vulnerable children with these petitioners who have nurtured them to a healthy childhood.  Does Michigan deny the marriage because they didn't conceive those children together, when Michigan would let other adoptive parents who are a different-sex couple marry? No.  Michigan is drawing a line because it does not approve of the adult relationship, no matter what the protestations they follow. Next, we hear a line, it's not disrespectful because it's drawn based on biology.  I have to say one casualty of the marriage litigation is an impoverished view of what is marriage and what is the role of biological procreation.  The State's entire premise here is that if same-sex couples marry, then different-sex couples won't and have their children in a marriage. Those two could not be further apart.  People make their own decisions.  It is beyond attenuated. And the idea also that there are other people who raise children -- and good for them, it's something, of course, that I hope policymakers would support.  But it's adult relationships that we're talking about at the foundation here are different adult relationships, and telling same-sex couples who have made that commitment to one another and have committed to raising children that they can't is what is stigmatizing. And then, if I may, my -- my last point is that the only way I can really understand Michigan's points about procreation and biology and so on is when I look, for example, at page 31 of their brief.  And they say that what they care about is people who have children together staying together and providing a long-term, stable situation for their children. That interest applies full force in this context, because by denying marriage to same-sex couples, you are denying not only the protection for the adults, which is independently important, you are denying those protections and that security that would come from having married parents. So with that, thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. The Court will take a brief break and return to the bench in five minutes for argument on the second question presented.

RICHARD HODGES, DIRECTOR, OHIO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, ET AL Oral Argument - April 28, 2015 (Part 2)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We'll now hear our argument on the second question presented in this case. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Question 2 Petitioners are already married.  They have established those enduring relationships, and they have a liberty interest that is of fundamental importance to these couples and their children. A State should not be allowed to effectively dissolve that marriage without a sufficiently important justification to do so. These Petitioners have built their lives around their marriages, including bringing children into their families, just as opposite-sex couples have done. But the non-recognition laws undermine the stability of these families, though the States purport to support just such stability.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.  But, again, I think you're avoiding the presumption on which we're starting, on the assumption, which is that the State's policy for same -- supporting same-sex marriage is sufficiently strong, that they are -- they can, as a matter of public policy, prohibit that in their own State.  And yet you're saying it's somehow so much weaker when you're talking about marriages from other States.     I -- I think there are a couple of points that I'd like to make in order to distinguish this situation from the -- the question in the first case. In the first case, it was very significant that Respondents' counsel was emphasizing that he thought it was merely rational basis scrutiny that would apply.  But that was to the question of whether people should be allowed to marry in the first instance. Our Petitioners on Question 2 are already married.  We know from Windsor, because the Court held, that once married, a couple has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in their marriage. We also know from Windsor that where a -- a sovereign disregards that marriage in a way that would be extraordinary and out of character with tradition, that that requires, at the very least, careful consideration.  And that's --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It certainly --     -- what we have here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It certainly undermines the State interest that we would, assuming arguendo, have recognized in the first case, to say that they must welcome in their borders people who have been married elsewhere.  It'd simply be a matter of time until they would, in effect, be recognizing that within the State.     Well --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because we live in a very mobile society, and people move all the time.     And -- and --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, it would kind of -- it -- one State would basically set the policy for the entire nation.     Well, of course, there would be many fewer such couples raising children within their borders than heterosexual couples who are raising children who are not biologically linked to them. I have to say that I think that the arguments that the State has made are so over and underinclusive at the same time, that they leave the -- the feeling that it can only be pretext.  And we know that that's true, because the State not only can't draw the lines that they are purporting to, they don't draw the lines that they're -- would suggest, and they would never draw the lines that they afford to --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Wait.  I -- I've lost you there.  What -- what lines are you talking about?     A line, for example, that limits marriage to those couples who are able to procreate biologically without any assistance. The States don't draw those lines.  The States have laws that treat adoptive relationships with the same legal effect as biological ones.  They actually have laws that further support and -- and give greater stability --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think your -- your argument is pretty much the exact opposite of the argument of the Petitioners in the prior case.  The argument that was presented against them is, you can't do this, we've never done this before, recognized same-sex marriage. And now you're saying, well, they can't not recognize same-sex marriages because they've never not recognized marriages before that were lawfully performed in other States.     Well, what --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You've got to decide one or the other if you win.     No, I don't think so at -- at all, Your Honor.  And -- and I think that what's -- what's essential and common between us is that we recognize that the marriage that our Petitioners have entered into is a marriage.  It is that same institution, that same most important relationship of one's life that this Court has held out as fundamental --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And maybe --     -- in other cases.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- I'm just repeating myself, but we only get to the second question if you've lost on that point already, if we've said States do not have to recognize same-sex marriage as a marriage. So assuming you've lost on that, I don't see how your argument gets -- you can't say that they are not treating the marriage as a marriage when they don't have to do that in the first place.     Well, I -- I think that that actually highlights one of the problems of trying to decide the -- the two cases differently, because, of course, deciding against Petitioners on Question 1, even if the Court decides in favor of Petitioners on Question 2, would forever relegate those marriages to second class status and would raise all kinds of questions whether those marriages could be subjected to laws that are not quite so favorable as opposite --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Whalen.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  What case is that? What case would you cite to support that proposition?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  This second -- outside of the present controversy, when was the last time Tennessee declined to recognize a marriage from out of state?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Any marriage.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but they weren't playing along with the same definition.  There have always been distinctions based on age and family relationship.  So they weren't playing along under the same definition.  And still, despite that, it apparently is quite rare for a State not to recognize an out-of-state marriage.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I don't understand your argument.  I understand your argument that it's a fundamental public policy question about whether you're going to recognize same-sex marriage or not.  But I don't see the difficulty in following the consequences of that under domestic relations law as treating a couple as married.  And it -- and so the first question is a big step, but after that, it seems to me that the question of how you apply the domestic relations law is pretty straightforward.   INTERRUPTING ",14-556X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, not -- not years but maybe several months.  I mean, you know, yes, you can't take it anymore, but maybe you also need a paycheck or -- or, you know, you're going to be eligible for the bonus in six weeks, you may as well at least wait until then.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but I think the government suggests that this is exactly a case where it's not so easy to figure out when the constructive termination was.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  When the resignation occurred.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that doesn't mean it was easy or -- or hard.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you know that the case -- you know, someone says this is ridiculous, I can't take it anymore, I will resign in three months.  I mean, what is the date of constructive termination then?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  It's -- it's, you know, I think it's fairly common for people to set a resignation date at some point in the future.  You know, a schoolteacher will say as soon as this school year is over, I'm out of here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon.     Curtis E. Gannon  Well, I think that's right, but -- and I think that -- but it's also the case that in many cases, in fact in most cases, there isn't going to be very much time between these two dates, and therefore it usually isn't going to be that dispositive. In this case, we think that the things happened on the same day.  Even under Petitioner's approach, he had some weeks to make his decision.  But the reason why he wasn't prejudiced by being able to take some weeks to make his decision is precisely because he was using annual leave, he wasn't suffering the consequences of a hostile work environment, he hadn't taken the pay cut, he hadn't had to move 400 miles away, and so this was an unusual case where he would have been able to take that much time. And so it looks like, as in -- in practicality's sake, that -- that it hasn't made a big difference.  And that's why we think it would be useful for the Court to say this is effectively the Ricks rule. It should apply to both cases of actual and cases of constructive termination. If there are no further questions, we would urge the Court to affirm.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Carroll.     Catherine M.A. Carroll  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We agree that the Ricks rule should apply here as it does to any other kind of claim under Title VII, and like any other kind of claim under Title VII, a constructive-discharge claim has to challenge actionable conduct by the employer. In applying the EEOC's regulation here, we have to ask, what was that actionable conduct, that matter alleged to be discriminatory, and when did it occur.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You say this isn't going to be a problem much.  I think it's going to be a problem a lot of times.  People are in jobs and they're, you know, suffering this particular type of adverse work environment or discrimination, but quitting your job is a very big deal.  I think you have to plan out when that's going to be, and just because you can't take it anymore doesn't mean that you could quit work right away.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  But this rule doesn't require you to quit in order to be able to raise and seek resolution.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, sure, it doesn't require you to quit, it just requires you to tell your boss, you know, I can't take this anymore.  And now I've got to conciliate with you, but, you know, it creates complications in the workforce if you raise that type of issue.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  It can.  I mean, to be clear, the EEOC regulations require that this must be all done anonymously until the complaining employee says actually, please go ahead and tell my employer so that we can try to pursue alternative --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suspect most employers could figure out who is complaining in these types of situations.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  Well, be that as it may, I think the policy underlying this provision is the recognition that the purpose of all of this is to try to prevent discrimination and to correct it as soon as it has occurred.  It is unquestionably a very short provision, and the Court recognized in Morgan that this very short provision exists because of the recognition that we want these sorts of alleged discriminatory, retaliatory circumstances to be addressed right away. There are safeguards built in.  This provision, I think probably unique among statutes of limitations that I know of, actually mandates that it be extended if, for example, the employee didn't know about the time limit or didn't know -- didn't have a reasonable basis to suspect discrimination.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what is your position on the government's stance?   Catherine M.A. Carroll  On the legal question or the factual --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Factual question.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  We haven't taken a position on that because the court of appeals didn't -- didn't find it necessary to do so.  You know, we --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think it's an example of the difficulty of trying to figure out when the discrimination occurred if you have this last-act kind of thing.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  Well, to the contrary, I think their dispute has a risen because they're trying to apply the date-of-resignation rule and are finding it difficult to agree on when that resignation occurred. As I -- as I said earlier, I think in our -- under the rule that the court of appeals adopted in this case, we think it asks the Court or the agency to engage in precisely the same inquiry that it would have to do whether -- even if there had not been a constructive discharge.  It's still, in every case, about identifying what is the alleged violation of the statute.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wolfman, four minutes.     INTERRUPTING ",14-613X

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what is the -- the standard of proof that you hold Congress to when it exercises jurisdiction over intrastate businesses with an effect on interstate commerce or interstate commerce? Somebody challenges Congress's exercise of jurisdiction because it doesn't fit within the interstate commerce or effect on interstate commerce, and the statute's evaluated according to what standard?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, somebody says -- you know, challenges -- as we've had challenges, in cases like Lopez and others -- that, Congress, you don't have authority to regulate this matter, because it doesn't involve interstate commerce, doesn't have an effect on interstate commerce, and so on.  But how do we -- how do we evaluate that? Does -- well, does Congress have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the -- there is an effect on interstate commerce?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Certainly, Mr. Jones. Mr. Yang.     Anthony A. Yang  Oh, I think that that is his argument.  I think he accepts in his brief the depletion of assets theory and says that the government has to show that this marijuana moved in interstate commerce, or that the dealers sold to people out of State, which I will note parenthetically is a little difficult when we're talking about an attempt, and we're talking about people who trade in marijuana.  They don't always -- are not always forthcoming in their admissions to law enforcement, but that's his theory. Our position is that is not necessary because we know already -- although that's one means of showing an effect on interstate commerce, there are other means.  And the theory here is that the robbery affects commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction. We know that commerce of the United States has jurisdiction includes the inter- or intrastate trade in marijuana, and that, therefore, in this theory -- which is different, it's a different way of proving the same jurisdictional element -- that under our theory here, the evidence was sufficient because there was sufficient evidence to show that these -- the Southwest Goonz, including Petitioners, were targeting these two victims because they expected to gain marijuana from the individuals who they thought were drug dealers. If the Court has no further questions, we'd ask that you affirm.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jones, you have five minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",14-6166
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if there weren't the commercial aspect, then you wouldn't -- you wouldn't -- you would have to demonstrate jurisdiction beyond a reasonable doubt?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, except that Congress doesn't have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt before exercising its jurisdiction that there's an affect on interstate commerce.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if you're prosecuting somebody, you do have to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the elements of the crime have been satisfied.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Beyond a reasonable doubt.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, I -- I suppose it's a -- maybe an academic question, but your conclusion that Congress has jurisdiction over the marijuana trade is based on a different standard of proof than the criminal one. So yes, you can say of course Congress has jurisdiction here, but that has been established only under, I guess, a rational-basis standard.  But now you have to show Congress has jurisdiction pursuant to a much more daunting standard of proof.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is the defendant allowed to present any evidence to the contrary?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It would be kind of silly to say they've got to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt.  All the United States has to do is this, and then -- and the judge instructs the jury that they've satisfied that burden?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- in any -- in a marijuana case, what evidence could a defendant put on that would prevent the establishment of the jurisdictional element?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  That goes to the first question of whether there was a robbery: Was there a robbery? Did it have an affect on -- on commerce within the jurisdiction of the United States?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there any evidence that a defendant could be allowed to introduce going to the second element?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but those are two very different things.  Robbing a house and stumbled upon is one thing, but if you have somebody who is robbing marijuana that's grown for home consumption or whatever, can the defendant say the jurisdictional element is not satisfied because of that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it may -- that may be familiar in the law, but I'm not aware of any case where the burden is on the government to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt, an element of the crime, and you're saying there's no way that the defendant -- no evidence that defendant could introduce -- could rebut the government's showing, in any case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what's your best authority for that proposition?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The tagalong, he got 20 years.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  A year's a year.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  Did you concede that earlier, that it's not covered by the Hobbs Act if the person's not a dealer?   John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it possible -- I hadn't thought about it too much -- that you would have different priorities in training, depending on whether you're dealing with people who've already been convicted of crimes and people who are being detained, like, perhaps people who have been convicted tend to engage in particular activity more than people just awaiting trial?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I know -- of course you're not going to say you can't act with -- with malice, but it would seem to me if the standards are broader with respect to people who have been convicted, you might tell the officers, look, you have more flexibility with respect to people who are already subject to a conviction.  You have to be -- you phrase it the other way -- you have to be more careful with respect to people who are simply being detained. But it's very complicated in a case like this because the Respondents make a very persuasive case that the convicts are actually less of a threat than the -- often than the pretrial detainees.  You go to -- you're going to go to jail if you've got 10 days on a DUI or something like that, but the people who are detained preconviction may be multiple murderers.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We'll -- we'll give you an extra minute since --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- the Court intruded on your time.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bash.     John F. Bash  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If there's one point I would like to convey to the Court this morning which I think is responsive to a number of questions that were asked in the opening presentation, it's that there are two relevant differences between the standard we're advancing and the standard Mr. Clement is about to get up and talk about. One goes to what sort of purpose is required, and the other goes to how you establish that purpose. On the first, Mr. Clement says it is malicious and sadistic intent.  We say it is a punitive purpose.  It is clear as day in the Court's Eighth Amendment cases, Farmer, Wilson, Whitley, that malicious and sadistic comes from the wantonness requirement of Eight Amendment, cruel and unusual. He is just wrong about that.  The only argument he has on that -- that it should be malicious and sadistic is Judge Friendly's opinion that this Court cited in a couple Eighth Amendment cases.  But if you look at Judge Friendly's analysis -- this is on page 28 of the red brief -- he very clearly says that there's a whole list of factors relevant.  Malicious and sadistic is one factor.  It's not dispositive, and all of the other factors are objective. So I don't think you can extrapolate from a few citations to Judge Friendly that malicious and sadistic is appropriate for a due process claim for someone who has not convicted of an offense. And by the way, I think --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you mean -- do you mean -- just to -- you mean voluntary?   John F. Bash  Well -- well, not --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not -- not a -- a mistake with a Taser or gun?   John F. Bash  And it -- no.  A mistake with a Taser or gun would not be an intentional application of force.  It would be a negligent application of force. And I think under Daniels v. Williams -- that's the slip on the pillow case case -- that would not count. The question we're asking is: What does the connection have to be between that intentional use of force and any legitimate penological objective? And bear in mind, the officer has to know all the relevant facts.  So if you have an eggshell prisoner who has some special medical condition that nobody knows about, that's not going to bear on the constitutional analysis.  It's the facts that the officer is aware of. And I think what this Court's decisions in Bell, Block, say is that an objectively unreasonable deprivation of liberty violates the Due Process Clause. And just as confirmation that that is an objective standard in both Bell -- this at page 561 -- and Block -- this is a page 585 -- the Court said there's not even an allegation here that there was a punitive intent or some ill intent.  Therefore, we're going to analyze it under an objective test. And the opinion --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I think it's pretty unusual, isn't it, to have a pretrial detainee in a maximum security prison?   John F. Bash  No.  I -- I was just trying to identify for Justice Kennedy how the standard at the margins might be different, so when you're talking about --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you come up with a hypothetical, I think, is quite unrealistic, so I'm not sure it's responsive.   John F. Bash  I didn't mean to come up with a hypothetical.   ",14-6368

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's a common feature, though, of jury deliberations.  Let's say an aggravator is whether the murder is -- is particularly heinous.  And it can be for -- for a number of factors: One, the victim is a -- a -- a juvenile, so maybe three jurors find that.  Or an officer was also killed, or it was in the commission in the course of another felony. In a typical case, a finding that the murder was heinous, you have no idea whether the juror -- jury as a whole made that determination, or if there were 12 different reasons.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but isn't that true -- I mean, taking it even out of the death penalty context, that's true with every jury determination.  You could have the jury determining that the -- the -- the -- you know, the -- the person didn't commit the offense because his alibi was good, or because, you know, somebody else did it, or, you know, any number of 12 different reasons that they think he was not guilty. It doesn't --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- have to be agreement by the jury on a -- on the particular basis for their verdict.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You may.   John G.

There is no question that there was -- that this is heinous, atrocious, and cruel.  And we would ask that the Court affirm the Florida Supreme Court's judgment.   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sorry, Mr. Lamken. I don't understand the fixation on how many cases we're talking about.  I thought -- I mean, I understand the argument.  But at least I think perhaps the more significant concern is what Congress is doing in that one case, which is you have a body of law that tells you when you can attach funds and when you can't, and instead of letting the court decide, that Congress comes along and says those funds can be attached.  They could do that in two cases.  They could do it in ten.  They could do it in every case involving Iran.  That doesn't seem terribly significant to me.  What seems significant is what they are doing in that case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Olson.     Edwin S. Kneedler  We have not taken a position on that.  That -- that refers tray under a number of issue that were briefed in the court of appeals on -- on that question.  So we have not taken a position on that. Here, we're here to defend this act of Congress which we think Congress enacted to address this particular dispute.  And if -- if a pending lawsuit would prohibit, would -- would interfere with the flexibility of the executive and Congress to solve a dispute by disposing of assets to pay particular judgments, that's exactly what the Court feared in Dames v. Moore -- the pending lawsuits.  Just because one happens to be pending rather than the law or the executive order being adopted before a lawsuit should not be able to tie up the Federal government's control over national --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you -- thank you, counsel. Mr. Lamken, you have six minutes remaining.     ",14-770X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the issue doesn't have to do with liability.  It has to do with the authority to execute --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- which is a -- which is a separate matter.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what if --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if, Mr. Olson, Congress passed a law that said, you know, there are a lot of challenges to the statutory interpretation under a particular statute, say the Health Care Act, and it said in any case involving a challenge to the statutory interpretation of the Secretary of HHS of that act, once it finds jurisdiction, the Court will enter judgment agreeing with the Secretary's purpose.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well -- well, but -- I mean, this Court has a lot of decisions about how to interpret statutes.  And what Congress is saying in my hypothetical is, well, that's good for you; we want you to adopt the Secretary's interpretation in every case involving it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But by -- by saying that, you're saying it's okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think that's a little surprising.  In other words, Congress can pass a statute and then say whenever the statutory interpretation of the executive branch is challenged, you, Court, will enter judgment in favor of the Secretary.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not in a particular way.  They don't care.  They don't think this clause ought to be interpreted this way.  They are just saying whenever it is challenged, you, Court, adopt the Secretary's interpretation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We don't know what the interpretation is going to be.  We just trust the Secretary --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- more than we trust the courts.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But there's a difference between causing -- affording deference and entering a judgment.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let's make it even clearer: The -- the -- the Court has issued its decision saying it agrees with the Plaintiff's interpretation, but the mandate hasn't issued yet, and Congress says, boy, we don't like that decision.  They pass a law saying in that case, this is the interpretation you should adopt.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they don't say, ""We're changing."" What we say, ""We want you to enter judgment in this case in favor of the Secretary.""   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And just so you understand what I'm concerned about. You know, there are places in the world where courts function just the way our courts do, except every now and then, when there's a case that the -- the strong man who runs the country is interested in because a crony is one of the parties or whatever, and he picks up the phone and he tells the court, You decide this case this way.  And I don't care what you thought the law was, decide it this way.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not sure I see what the difference is here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suppose this applied to us as well, right? Congress can tell us how to rule on cases pending before us? You know, they have a committee every year at the start of the term.  They say, well, what cases are up there? They read the briefs.  And they say, well, we think this one should come out this way.  And they pass a law telling us, in case number 15185, the Supreme Court will enter judgment, or, you know, more specifically directed to the pending matter.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it doesn't have to say the petitioner wins.  It sees what the question presented is, and then they say in any case in which, and then read the question presented, you can attach the funds or you can recognize Puerto Rico as a sovereign or whatever else the case involves.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Agree with her what?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not the Plaut -- it's not the Plaut case.  It's not even tweaking the law.  As in here, it's saying, an issue has arisen in this case of whether or not this and this, and in that case, case number 14 whatever, the answer is this. Now, it makes it clear that Smith wins, but they don't just say that.  They say, you're arguing this in this case.  In this case you have to rule in favor of Smith and then the judgment.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And all this Court has to do is sign on the dotted line?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're saying Congress has to be cute about it.  They can't say Smith wins.  But they can say in the case of Jones v. Smith where the critical issue is this, we can change that in a way so Smith wins.  And don't worry about the law generally, because it's just this case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's just a cute way of saying Smith wins.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It becomes a problem -- with respect, it becomes a problem because our job is to decide cases.  And before a lawsuit is filed, there's no case.  But when there is a case, Article III says that's our job.  Their job is to pass laws; our job is to decide a case.  When there's a dispute under one of the laws they pass, that's our job.   ",14-770X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but what the district court determined is that it was -- was not able to tell precisely when the ceiling effect kicked in, precisely when they hit the ceiling, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that -- that is your theory for when pain is possible, when it hits the ceiling, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, is it undisputed facts? I thought you had the burden of showing that the determinations were clearly erroneous. So it's certainly not a case where the facts have to be undisputed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought there were issues of the administration of the drug, you know, the -- the nature of the veins and so forth.  Weren't those present or have I got a different one in mind than the Lockett case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No? I'm sorry. ""No"" what? That was not that or -- were -- were there issues about -- I thought there were issues involving the veins and the ability to make an intravenous connection?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you don't know.  Do you have a guess? I mean, is there a reason that the States moved progressively to what I understand to be more humane methods of execution? Hanging, firing squad, electric chair, death -- you know, gas chamber?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And -- and you're not suggesting that those other methods are preferable to the method in this case, are you?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you have no suggestion as what -- to what would be an acceptable alternative to what you propose right now for Oklahoma. Do you have any -- I mean, the case comes to us in a posture where it's recognized that your client is guilty of a capital offense, it's recognized that your client is eligible for the death penalty, that that has been duly imposed.  And yet you put us in a position with your argument that he can't be executed, even though he satisfies all of those requirements.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you have no suggested alternative that is more humane.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What does the new statute provide?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What other method?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And are you suggesting that that's okay with you?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what do you think? Do you have an instinct about whether or not the gas chamber is preferable to this lethal injection or not?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Kagan, I think it's your turn.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Wyrick.     Patrick R. Wyrick  I appreciate that.  And I want to continue my point about ceiling effect and what evidence they put on.  I -- I told you about the first source, which was the Material Safety Data Sheet.  It says nothing about a ceiling effect.  We pointed that out.  Nothing in the reply brief on that. Their second was the study about rats, the Hovinga study.  We pointed out again -- we read that study.  There's no mention of a ceiling effect.  Again, no response in the reply brief.  Now, that's the evidence that they put before the district court on what they said clearly demonstrates that there's a ceiling effect. Now, after the fact, when we were at the court of appeals, their expert submitted an additional declaration and cited two more sources.  He cited this Hall study, which was the dog study, where they took 5 dogs, gave them a big dose of midazolam and clamped their tails.  And that study concluded, well, we see the midazolam -- the effect of the drug begins to slow at a certain point and hypothesized, well, there may be a ceiling effect, because the drug -- the -- the effects of the drug are beginning to slow. But that study concluded, as we pointed out in the response brief, that if you take the results and you extrapolate out, once you get to about 30 milligrams per kilogram for a dog, you would achieve full surgical anesthesia, full surgical anesthesia. Now, their other expert, he cited the Saari article for the proposition that there is a ceiling effect.  It just cites back to Hall, the dog study, and says, well, there may be a ceiling effect.  And then it goes on to say that, in fact, this drug has been used for general anesthesia as the sole drug, and that its use was discontinued because propofol came along, and it was a better choice. That was their record case for a ceiling effect.  So when they stand up and say that they clearly demonstrated that there was, in fact, a ceiling effect, they're just wrong. Now, the other study that Dr. Lubarsky cited in his after-the-fact declaration that was never submitted to the district court, was the Greenblatt study.  And he claimed that that study showed that at .3 milligrams per kilogram there was a ceiling effect.  We went and read the study.  .3 milligrams per kilogram were -- were never given to the patients in that study. That study was about what happens if we give .1 milligrams per kilogram of this drug? At varying dosages, what happens? We pointed that in -- that out in the response brief.  Nothing in the reply. Their evidence on this ceiling effect is indefensible because if you go and read the sources, they just don't say what Dr. Lubarsky said that they say. Paradoxical effects have fallen out of the case.  This lack of analgesia, again, we've pointed out, is only relevant if someone's not unconscious and insensate.  They just can't avoid the fact that the district court here made this factual finding and said it's a virtual certainty.  If it's a virtual certainty that they're unconscious and unaware of the pain, they cannot establish a substantial probability or an objectively intolerable risk. Thank you.   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it's still based on direct price regulation of the retail rate.  It may be the same point as your Ferrari hypothetical, but if -- if FERC is basically standing outside McDonald's and saying, we'll give you $5 not to go in, and the price of the hamburger is $3, somebody goes up there, the price of a hamburger is actually, I think most economists would say, $8, because if they give up the $5, they've still got to pay the $3.  And your answer is, there's no impact on what the States can do, because they can still say, no, the price of the hamburger should be $2, or it should be $4.  The point is that -- that FERC is directly affecting the retail price.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If we're -- if we're -- obviously, that's true.  But it's just as obvious, it seems to me, that you have to have some sort of limiting principle, otherwise FERC can do whatever it wants.  So what is the limiting principle that you would suggest to us?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General. Mr. Phillips.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The problem is --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- that what FERC is doing basically leaves the States with the pure formality of setting the rate that is going to be directly affected by what FERC is doing. In my hypothetical, if you remember, I mean, they get to say how much the hamburger costs once you get in the store, but FERC can respond to it directly by setting the price to encourage you not to enter the store. If $5 -- we'll give you $5 not to enter, and a burger is $3 if it's -- the State gets to say, no, no, we want it to be $2, and then FERC just says, all right, we'll give you $6 not to enter.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. Saharsky, I don't -- I can't -- I'm not terribly persuaded by your deterrence argument.  I mean, no statute pursues its purposes at every cost.  And maybe Congress decided they could -- they didn't need to take the last 23 cents an hour the prisoner earned to promote the deterrence when they have all these other anti-filing provisions in the law.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, but Congress is talking about, okay, they have to pay the filing fee. Certainly Congress didn't focus, I wouldn't think, on whether it's -- well, I assume they didn't focus on whether it's per case or per prisoner, because it's really quite unclear.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I wanted to talk about that.  I -- the first reading, two struck me as different than one, because in -- in one you're talking about, oh, this is what the Court should do.  But on two you say this is what's required of the prisoner, and it just says up to 20 percent. Now I know one says required two, but it immediately shifts its -- he's required to pay the whole thing, and that's the important point.  But -- but two, it says this is what's required of the prisoner, monthly payments of 20 percent of the preceding month's income.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  To me that seems to be more a prisoner focus than a case-by-case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not sure that's responsive to my point.  I guess what I was saying is I don't think it carries forward the case-by-case basis because it speaks solely of what's required of the prisoner in a way that doesn't address case by case at all.  I mean, that's why this is such a confusing statute.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of 20 percent of the preceding month's income.  To me, I -- well, I would think at least as reasonable as you're reading, to say when you look at what is required of the prisoner, 20 percent of his income, that doesn't have anything to do case by case, because what you would require, of course, is that he pay 40 percent if there are two cases, or 60 percent if there are three, or all of it, if it's above $10.  And I think he -- anyone -- someone looking at that may say, no, he's only supposed to pay 20 percent of his income.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, yes, but he doesn't get off the hook for the other ones.  It's just -- has to pay it further down, you know, it's -- it's like a mortgage.  I mean, you get 30 years, you have to pay it further down.  If you're on 15 years, you have to pay it less.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, it's not like he's getting off Scott-free.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, he pays the 20 percent in every case right away.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You agree with that interpretation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Then I don't think it's fair to rely on it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. Saharsky, I find -- I -- I think others may too.  I find the issue that's before us very difficult to resolve based on the statutory language.  Is there any doctrine tantamount to the rule of lenity in interpreting a criminal statute that applies here? Because the thing that strikes me most is the extreme harshness of your position.  We're talking about earning 23 cents an hour, filing fees of $350, $505.  And the money is used to -- for what? Phone calls to family and friends, stamps for letters, and to buy books.  And you're going to take the last, you know, whatever so that someone who's in there for 20 years can't even buy a book? That seems very, very harsh. And you seem to be willing to interpret the ambiguity in the statute to save the last $10, but you're unwilling to interpret what I think at least I regard as the ambiguity in the statute to allow prisoners -- I mean, they are prisoners.  They're not -- that's perhaps not entitled to any grace, but who in some States earn 10 cents an hour.  You're not willing to interpret that ambiguity in a way that allows them to keep that so they can pay for phone calls to their family.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Just a thought. Well, if you're there for 20 years, maybe you should let them buy a book.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sure they are -- I'm sure they are very good libraries, too.

What is the live dispute in which you have a personal stake to the terms we use under Article III?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- well, what is it you're worried about, that they won't make good on the offer, or --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Voluntary cessation can moot a case whether the plaintiff likes it or not, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if it's certain that they're going to give you the money that you asked for, why isn't the same result applied? In other words, why is it not simply what the plaintiff wants? He doesn't want the money he's asking for, he wants a judgment that he will give him the money.  As far as I can tell, that's your argument.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You put a lot of weight on what the plaintiffs -- but there's another interest here, which is the -- the Court's interest. You're being given everything you want.  You say, well, we've had a past injury. Well, you asked for relief on that, and that is what you're being given.  And yet you say, nonetheless, we're entitled to enlist the Court and the Court's time.

It's not we assume for the sake of argument.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Say the parties do not dispute that defendant's Rule 68 offer would have fully satisfied the individual claims asserted --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- or that could have asserted by plaintiff in this action.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, did the Ninth Circuit proceed to decide the case on the basis of that finding?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Did the Ninth Circuit proceed to decide the case on the basis of the assumption that the district court factual determination was correct?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think that is the same as proceed to decide for question --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- so just to be clear on the facts without getting into dispute, let's say that the offer is for the -- all relief that you have asked for.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not a question of what you think you're entitled to or what they think. Everything you've asked for, including all attorneys' fees.  So there's no question of cost shifting or anything like that.  All injunctive relief. They come to you and say, you write the injunction. You say, there is still a case or controversy that could proceed to litigation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What's -- what is the controversy? In the case I've hypothesized --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- what is the controversy?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You said if the plaintiff is being obstreperous or whatever, you know, the -- just refusing to take it for spite or some reason.  In that case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And what would the judgment say?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If, Mr. Garre, as you're leaving the court -- courtroom today says, here, we will accept an entry of judgment.  One, we'll make sure you get whatever attorneys' fees you want and we will accept an entry of judgment.  Then the -- then the case would be over?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Would it be over?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, well, that's the whole thing; right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  This is all about class certification.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the case comes down to once we put away -- hypothesize that you're getting everything you, as the plaintiff in this case has asked for, it comes down to whether or not you can get the class certified.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you're saying --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you're saying --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Excuse me.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you're saying that it's not because of the possibility that you could get a class certified.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  My hypothesis is you get everything else.  Okay?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The only thing they don't say -- they enter a judgment.  You want a judgment? Here's your judgment.  You want all the attorneys' fees? Here's all your attorneys' fees.  You want an injunction? You know, go ahead and write your injunction. But you say still not because you might be able to be the representative plaintiff in a class action?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of course not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is -- what is the financial stake here?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Well, the cost -- so then that's fully satisfied if the offer covers attorneys' fees?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Now, if --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What was the other one?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The incentive award?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is -- is there any concern that a plaintiff who has received or has been offered all relief that he could receive is an appropriate representative plaintiff of parties who have not gotten all the relief?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the argument is that an individual plaintiff who has gotten everything that he has asked for -- and I realize you argue that isn't the case here.   John G.

Or because what other --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- bases, or I want -- I want -- whatever reason.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  You're promoting -- Go ahead.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, your -- your solution that you suggested is that if there's some doubt the employer should begin a dialogue, I think is what you -- but I think that may promote stereotypes to a far greater degree than what you're objecting to. Let's say you have someone of Middle Eastern appearance who shows up for the interview with a beard. And the employer, like Abercrombie and Fitch, they don't like beards.  They don't want their models, as they call them, having beards.  But he doesn't know if the beard is there for a religion reason or not. So you think it's better to him to sit there and start asking this applicant questions he would not ask anyone else about religion? Why are you wearing a beard? Is there some religious reason for that? It seems that your solution causes more problems.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, is it reasonable for an employer to say, look, I don't want to buy into some problem with a guy who has a beard.  I'm going to say can you shave it? He's going to say no or he's only going to shave twice a week. I mean, isn't he reasonably going to say -- let's say, I don't care if it's religious -- a religious reason or not.  The guy shows up with a beard.  I'm not going to hire him.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  To get --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could you answer my question, please?   John G.

We still have, don't we, the question of what happens if nobody -- and who loses if there's no evidence to move one way or another in a tie? It doesn't matter if you call it a ""presumption"" or not.  Who bears the burden of at least moving forward, and certainly the burden of proof, if one of these errors is on the record?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, does that individual showing, can it be made on the basis purely of the mistake in the Guidelines, there is no extraneous evidence? If you have a case where the erroneous range is 20 to 40 and the judge gives 20, and the correct range is zero to 20, is that a case in which the defendant has established plain error?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't want to know anything more about it because if the judge is within the Guidelines, he doesn't have to say anything more about it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So now let's say -- I mean, this is why the problem is -- is -- whether you want to call it a presumption or whatever, is so difficult.  What if the Guideline was 20 to -- to 40 and the judge said 30, and the correct Guideline was zero to 30? In other words, he's half in the middle of the wrong one.  Do you say, well, maybe it's an error, maybe it's not? What -- what in that case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's -- that's why I don't understand why it's one answer, zero to 20 and 20 to 40, and another answer when it's zero to 30 and 20 to -- when it's halfway as opposed to just at the bottom.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Don't you usually -- don't you usually have a plea colloquy or something in the record in those types of cases?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, no.  If it's -- the sentence is within the Guidelines, the judge doesn't have to say anything at all.  So it's very difficult for the defendant to go back and say, here's what the error was even though there's also a clear error, a plain error in what the original calculation was.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, could you get back to your answer to my question?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the sort of thing that there will be an awful lot of litigation about, don't you think?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you're putting a lot more weight on that -- excuse me -- on that provision if you prevail on your statutory interpretation argument.  And it seems to me that that provision is inevitably going to lead to litigation. How do you tell what's best? It's a combination of price and quality.  It's not any absolute that you can identify, and you know, what's fair, what's reasonable. I -- I think the businesses that you represent would be litigating those terms -- it's hard to say -- almost in every case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You -- you mentioned that the -- you've mentioned several times, I think, that there has to be a veterans -- veteran-owned business that's eligible as -- as -- but don't you think there will be a lot more veteran-owned businesses if you prevail? In other words, if everything is open to the preference, as long as there is, you know, two that get the preference, don't you think a lot more veterans -- won't it make a lot more sense for them to go into business rather than some other line of work?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you shouldn't be telling us that the limitation is that there's only so many veteran-owned businesses, because if you prevail, there will be many times that.   John G.

What we've done is to -- is -- as -- actually, as Congress directed us in Section 8125, they required us to buy these things on national contracts or on the FSS, and so that's what we've done.  And so we strategically source all of our pharmaceutical purchases, or almost all of them, through this one contract where we can get them in a matter of minutes.

Roberts, Jr.  There are expensive, big things that you expect you have to be a big company to provide, like an ultrasound machine, or you mentioned stents. Now maybe if they're commodities, then to provide fair price and best value, it also would help to be a big business as opposed to a small business.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.   Well, but you to get past the statute of limitations problem and to do that, you need to characterize it, as I understand it, as a malicious prosecution claim.  Otherwise, it's time-barred.   John G. Roberts, Jr.   But favorable termination has nothing to do with the Fourth Amendment claim, right?  And whether your prosecution is just favorably terminated or not, the Fourth Amendment claim and, it seems to me, the accrual begins when your Fourth Amendment rights are violated with, say, an illegal search. Whether you eventually are convicted or acquitted, really, you have a claim for an illegal search if there's been an illegal search without regard to favorable termination.   John G. Roberts, Jr.   Right.  But I regardless, whatever the Fourth Amendment claim is.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.   I was confused. thought there was a malicious prosecution claim here, mostly because the question presented says, ""Whether an individual's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure continues beyond legal process so as to allow a malicious prosecution claim based upon the Fourth Amendment.""   John G. Roberts, Jr.   Well, but just a different consequence to whether you terminate a Fourth Amendment right or a due process right under Parratt v. Taylor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.   Well, I know. you just answered in response to the question that one could be both.  But if it's both --   John G. Roberts, Jr.   Well, but -- I the alternative that is argued is that it's a due process claim.  And whether or not they coexist or whether the particular period that you're complaining about is properly characterized as detention without due process as opposed to a claim under the Fourth Amendment would certainly be pertinent in deciding whether or not to say there is a Fourth Amendment claim.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.   Thank you, Ms. Eisenstein.     Ilana Eisenstein   Mr. Chief Justice, and it please the Court: We think that this Court should locate the constitutional right at issue in the Fourth Amendment for the reason that the Fourth Amendment does apply to pretrial detentions as this Court has long held.  The Fourth Amendment requires any prolonged period of detention to be supported by, one, valid determination of probable cause at the outset of that -- at that period of detention. The Seventh Circuit error here was to find that the Fourth Amendment stops operation once criminal charges are filed.  And this Court has long recognized as well that there's a variety of ways to make that probable cause determination, including by the same procedure used to bring the criminal charge itself.   John G. Roberts, Jr.   Well, I nearly that it inspired examples we take to flesh this out, but it does seem to me to be just pretty result-oriented cherry picking.  If once you say, well, here's a claim, now we'd like the statute of limitations part, so we don't take that in.  We -- we don't want to have to show malice, so we take that.  I mean, I don't know if we're still holding true to the approach in Wallace, if you just start picking things in and out depending upon the demands of the particular case.   Ilana Eisenstein   Well, Your Honor, I that Wallace did say that Federal accrual rules in particular were governed by the common law analogy.  We think that that's as far as it goes in terms of choosing from the common law.  The statute of limitations, for example, is barred from State law. But here, the Seventh Circuit's view of accrual flowed from its error as to the scope of the Fourth Amendment.  So to Justice Kagan's proposal that this go back, in many ways we think that's absolutely appropriate, because the Seventh Circuit erred by holding that since the Fourth Amendment stops at the time criminal process begins, it thought you can't have a malicious prosecution analogous claim, because there is no such Fourth Amendment claim. If you peel that error away, we think that, even under Seventh Circuit jurisprudence, they would agree that a favorable termination requirement would apply in such circumstances.   John G. Roberts, Jr.   Thank you, Mr. Scodro.     Michael A. Scodro   Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.   Mr. Eisenhammer, have three minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",14-9496

And that explanation says expressly, at page 483, that race is considered in exactly the same manner, and given exactly the same consideration as every other special circumstance's factor that the university considers as part of its holistic review.

Are -- are we going to hit the deadline? Is this going to be done on -- in your view in 12 years?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand.  I don't know whether that's a yes or no.  But it was important in the Grutter Court that these were a temporary -- as necessary, temporary expedience because we're talking about giving you the extraordinary power to consider race in making important decisions.  And we don't do that as a matter of -- matter of --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- course. And so it was important in Grutter to say, look, this can't go on forever, 25 years.

It's clearly foreclosed by the Court's precedents, but maybe there's a very good argument that the -- those precedents are -- haven't withstood the test of time or whatever. What happens then?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, yes.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it's a very difficult line you're drawing, and -- and I understand Bell v. Hood.  But you're saying he can't do it.  He can't determine that the three-judge court is not required just because the plaintiffs are wrong, but he can make that determination if they are really wrong. And -- and your brief in the analysis and all this, it -- it is always -- it's -- it's like a thesaurus.  It's just a collection of adjectives that all mean ""frivolous,"" ""insubstantial,"" you know.  And I'm not sure it gives a great deal of guidance to -- to a court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you call it -- I guess my concern -- you call it a rule, but it's really not much of a rule.  It's just kind of a -- I don't know, a sense that something is -- is really bad, as I guess I said earlier, as opposed to just bad.  And I think that's an awfully fuzzy line to -- to draw, but fuzzy in -- in when you're talking about jurisdiction where you like to have very precise and clear rules.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let me get back to the question Justice Kagan asked.  It was certainly the case when the law was enacted that the three-judge court was viewed as an anti-plaintiff provision. The idea was that single judges were too quickly issuing injunctions, you know, blocking the state enactments, and they thought that would be likely if you had three judges.  I'm not sure if that's still true today, but it certainly was when the law was passed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Sullivan.     INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  This -- this is a pretty basic question I should know the answer to, but when you talk about dividing the property, is that by any proportion?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You get two-thirds/one-third? It's not -- doesn't have to be 50/50?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The judge doesn't have to say that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right? I mean, the alimony -- they're all -- there's not a set number that this has to be.  And it seems to me that it -- it would be a situation where we're certainly going to take into account the whole picture.  And I think it would be perhaps unreasonable for the judge to say, well, I'm going to look at everything in figuring out the amount of alimony, but I'm not going to look at the fact that he's getting, you know, disability pay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wirken.     Charles W. Wirken  To be divided.  But -- and I -- this is, again, a situation, a case in which there were no disability benefits to divide at the time of divorce when her property rights were vested in her. So this Court should therefore hold that the division of Military Retirement Pay is determined according to State law at the time of divorce and that an order remedying damage to such a share is not preempted by the Act.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Eisenstein.     Ilana Eisenstein  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me start with the concern that Your Honor has about what the effect of Mansell is under the rule that we propose.  States in our view are permitted to give a -- a relief to spouses after a post-divorce indemnification affects the already separated share of the wife, and it still -- the rule of Mansell and the Spouses' Protection Act still retains its effect because the -- the subsequent waiver shrinks the pie that is available for the remedy, but it doesn't change or dictate what division the State court had to take either in the first instance or in giving a remedy to the former spouse.  So we take a broader view of the State courts' ability to respond to changes in circumstance, whether that change be because of a waiver of -- waiver of disability benefits or any other reason.  And that the Act's primary function is to leave to State law the ability to equitably divide these assets in the first place.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It seems to me that -- in other words, you're saying -- you're basically saying there's no real substance to this law. All the court has to do is find some charade to get to the same result. I mean, would it be all right under your view if they say, okay, you get 50 percent of -- all the -- no disability payments yet.  You get 50 percent of the retirement pay.  Listen to me.  But in the event that there is disability pay -- there are disability payments that result in a reduction of the military pay, I appreciate that I cannot divide the disability pay, but your share of the retirement pay is going to go up as if we were dividing the disability pay.  Is that good or bad?   Ilana Eisenstein  Well -- well, your Honor, I think it -- it is -- it is okay to the extent that the court is applying its generally applicable principles of property division to treat the portion that is available under federal law --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The court wants to make sure that the spouse, whether wife or husband, receives half of the military retirement pay, and that -- and going forward.  So she does -- he or she does exactly what I set forth; says, okay, you're entitled to half.  But if there's disability pay, you're entitled to an additional amount exactly equal to half of the disability pay.   Ilana Eisenstein  Well, yes.  I think the statute expressly contemplates fixed sum awards.  And so the -- the --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you have a law that says -- you have a law that says you can't divide disability pay, and yet, you say it's okay to say, well, I'm not going to divide it, but I'm just going to award you an amount equal to what it would be if I divided it.   Ilana Eisenstein  Well, let me be clear.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's the sort of thing that gives, you know, law a bad name.  It's just -- (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It makes a charade out of the statute.   Ilana Eisenstein  Well, your Honor, I respectfully submit that State courts have a lot of experience in treating differently separate property, marital property, separate income, property interest. That is the kind of bread and butter that State courts -- those kind of distinctions are the bread and butter that State courts apply their own state law to. And so this Act --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What does -- what does that have to do with my question?   Ilana Eisenstein  So the question is, your Honor, in terms of the ability -- your Honor was concerned that the State order could be a sham.  But State courts are in the practice of treating as -- defining and treating as what is the quantum of marital property and fairly applying those State rules. So what the Spousal Protection Act does is it throws to the State court the broad authority to treat disposable retirement pay as marital property, along with all of the civil assets.  Having made that division and giving that broad authority to divide the property, presumably it comes with the ability to enforce that division.  And the spouse's now separate property interests are presumably given the bundle of rights that the State would normally give to protect it. And assuming --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but again, the law does something else too.  It says you cannot divide disability payments.   Ilana Eisenstein  Right.  So that takes the pie that can be divided and shrinks it.  It doesn't tell State courts how to allocate that benefit.  And so when it comes to considering the role that disability benefits play, we propose the rule should be that disability benefits cannot be treated under the State law as divisible property.  But it can be a consideration.  And most State courts, under the equitable division schemes, consider the separate --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You know States -- consideration.  You say it can be divided, just in a way that the law prohibits, so long as we don't say it's divided.  So we take half of it and add it to the required military pay.   Ilana Eisenstein  Well -- well, your Honor, we don't -- I don't interpret your Honor's hypothetical as a division of property.  I interpret your Honor's hypothetical as getting a contingent interest in other property that may be available.  The work that --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But money is money. Whether it gets the additional amount from the disability pay or from something else doesn't make a difference.   Ilana Eisenstein  Well, your Honor, money isn't money.  When the State court originally had the -- the broad discretion to allocate anywhere from zero percent to one hundred percent of not only the -- the civilian assets but the disposal retirement pay in the first place.

Is -- is there that difference?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well -- well, that's --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe this isn't that, but that -- that's very legalistic in the sense that you're saying well, you can't divide this, but you have to pay her money so that's she's put in the same position as if you'd divided this. Is that your suggestion?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if I were --   John G.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then maybe I'm the one who insisted on the part of the law that says when it's disability, you don't get to divide that.   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But Justice Breyer's question was about agency regulations.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it doesn't know the specifics of the biosimilar.  I mean, by definition, the biosimilar is similar; it's not identical.  And whether or not it infringes might have something to do with the ways in which it is different.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you're suing saying, this thing infringes our patent.  We don't even know what ""this thing"" is.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You would not -- I don't know if I agree with you on that.  But you would have to sue.  That's the problem; right? What would the patent litigation look like? I have this patent; you're bringing this biosimilar; I'm going to sue you.  The litigation would decide whether the biosimilar infringes the patent, and that would have something to do with whether or not it's sufficiently -- whether it's too similar or whether it's certainly distinct. And what your argument means is that if you have the patent Justice Kagan said, you have to sue.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So this -- no?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Yang.     Anthony A. Yang  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Congress enacted a detailed process for early resolution of patent disputes through patent infringement litigation while FDA is evaluating a biosimilar application.  The statute expressly establishes a series of procedural steps, and then specifies the consequences for both the applicant and the sponsor if they fail to take the steps that would set you off the -- the (l) path.  And all of those consequences address the timing and the scope of patent litigation. Those consequences, which are quite detailed -- we don't have the time to talk about all of them, but they're in the statute, they're in our brief -- are the exclusive consequences.  It would be -- it would muck up the statute for courts to come in and start policing each step of the (l) dance and then send the parties back.  The whole idea of this --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but it rests on a Federal law cause of action that also might not be there.  And in terms of the preemption question, it seems to me that it's very hard to give a comprehensive answer to the questions presented without considering whether, well, thanks for your opinion on what Federal law does, but, in fact, State law, you can get the same injunction.  It's really asking us to put together a puzzle where a big piece is missing.   Anthony A. Yang  I don't think State law is a piece of the puzzle.  Congress does not have the habit of enacting comprehensive statutes and then allowing States to fill it -- figure out --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it becomes part -- so are you arguing the preemption question or --   Anthony A. Yang  Well, we think there are strong arguments.  Again, we've not taken a vetted position on that because it's not been, as the case comes to the Court, what the case is about.  The case is about --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you think that -- do you think the statute can function in the way you're arguing, even if there are injunctions? Based on the State law provisions?   Anthony A. Yang  Can the statute work? I think it would mess up the scheme that Congress -- because if you were to look at ""shall,"" you know, there's -- there are eight subsections, that's clauses of -- of subsection (l)  If at each stage a court is policing and saying, no, no, no, you didn't give sufficient information, you didn't do that, you'd have a series of back and forth in the scheme.

Who's an employee of the government? Is the provision construed to include a contractor? Those are all spelled out in the definitional provision. Now, under your argument, those definitions are off the table and you can litigate for days on end about, does this cover a contractor of the United States? And you're saying, well, normally, you'd say let's look at the definition, and it says -- well, yeah, it says that right there.  But under your argument, no, the definitions are not included.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's a --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's a provision of the chapter --   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  13(a), Section 412.   ",15-109X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your -- your concession runs into the same problem as your main argument.  I mean, if -- if the City can recover for having a more segregated environment, that seemed to be measured by all sorts of things, including tourists aren't going to want to visit it as much. How would you measure the damages if the harm is simply having a more segregated city?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How -- how do you measure that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Peck.     Robert S. Peck  You know, it may be so that a particular business does have that interest.  But I think that it's very difficult to -- to claim the kinds of damages that you've claimed. Remember, one difference between the FHA and -- and Title VII, for example, is that we recognize indirect harms.  We allow neighbors, testers, nonprofit organizations, and cities, and developers, and real estate brokers, all to sue to vindicate that interest. We don't allow the -- the equivalent of a neighbor, a co-worker, to bring an action for discrimination that's been visited upon one of their colleagues.  We don't allow others within that kind of realm to bring these actions.  And I think that's part of the problem that a business that makes this claim might have. So in the end, what I'm -- I'm suggesting is that there are direct injuries by virtue of these two what -- what my friend describes as buckets.  A direct injury to the City in its efforts to secure fair housing by draining those resources, and those resources are recoverable, and that that, indeed, satisfies any kind of proximate cause, as well as an injury to that interest in an integrated community that allows the business opportunities, the social opportunities, the professional opportunities to flow that this Court recognized in the Gladstone case and suggested that the appropriate -- and even my friend in his brief suggested the appropriate damages in such an instance is the loss of property value and property taxes, which, frankly, are part and parcel of this whole mortgage loan industry. So we are not asking for something that's different, that's out of the realm, that's away from what this process is.  But something that's integral to that process. So in the end what we suggest is the City of Miami is not so marginally involved in Fair Housing, is not working inconsistently, and its injuries are so fair afield from it that we are outside the zone of interest, whatever zone of interest applies, because, after all, it's not a very demanding test.  And there is a reason for that, and that's because we are aggrieved in every sense of the word by the discrimination that was propounded here. And at the same time, we think that that statement from Lexmark that I quoted earlier -- that it has to essentially flow from the fact that there was some violation of the Act, is it sufficient too? And in each instance, we think our -- our injury is direct, but even if it were to be examined more minutely, as my friend suggests, those minute steps are all true of the individual borrower who has to take out a discriminatory loan, who has to then default, who has to then arrive in -- in foreclosure, who has to find that he has to abandon that house, and then he can bring that lawsuit still, because all those different steps are -- you know, the -- the -- the financial state of the economy, the -- the nature of his job situation, his family situation, all have effects on that.  But we recognize that this is proximately caused -- his damages are proximately caused from the injury that the Fair Housing Act recognizes. So for those reasons, I suggest that this Court ought to affirm the Eleventh Circuit.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon.     Curtis E. Gannon  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Gladstone, this Court concluded that a municipality was injured if discriminatory housing practices caused a reduction in property values and, therefore, diminished its tax revenues.  Congress recodified that result with its 1988 amendments to the Fair Housing Act, and the Court should hold that the same injury is still cognizable today, whether an Article III rationale or a broad zone-of-interest rationale. If I could turn to some of the points that have already come up today, my friend on the other side says that you can't cut and paste injury from one plaintiff to -- one victim of discrimination to another. That's an argument that Gladstone specifically rejected. In Footnote 9 the Court said that what matters here, and this is what was -- this is what was the breadth of the trilogy of Fair Housing Act cases that the Court decided between 1972 and 1982, is that somebody has had their legal rights violated by discriminatory housing practices.  It doesn't necessarily have to be the plaintiff's legal rights. The plaintiff has to be injured by that violation, but it doesn't have to be their rights that are violated. And that's what we think is the -- is the work that's being done by the atypical definition of ""aggrieved person"" that Congress put back into the statute --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  They haven't even argued that, and they didn't decide.   Curtis E. Gannon  No.  And I -- I think -- I think to the extent they can get themselves into the -- into the Home framework from Havens, then maybe they could say that they have specific costs that are associated with fighting discrimination. But I wanted to say that what we have --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could you give us some more concrete answers? The -- the utility company, you say it's further afield.  Is it covered or not?   Curtis E. Gannon  We think it's not covered.  We think that -- that -- that what this Court recognized in Gladstone is something that Congress was taking account of, and the property value -- the effect on property values is closely tied to discriminatory housing practices.  Congress was entitled to think that that relationship would endure, and as in Lexmark, there is a one-to-one relationship --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the City can sue based on isolated instances of discrimination?   Curtis E. Gannon  To the extent --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought that the basic pitch of the -- of your position is that it affects the community as a whole, and the City has an interest in ensuring the stability of the communities, not that the City could enforce particular instances of housing discrimination.   Curtis E. Gannon  I -- I think it's both.  I think that they do have the community representing interest, and -- but I also think that, to the extent that they can say we suffer a harm from this particular transaction -- let's assume it's just one particular apartment complex or something.  If --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could be one -- one particular home?   Curtis E. Gannon  Yeah.  I suspect that that's one where there wouldn't be that much in it to have the City bring that suit instead of the individual loan owner, but --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't know if there's that much in it.  Can the City bring that action or not?   Curtis E. Gannon  Yes.  It -- to the extent that they can say there is a one-to-one relationship, they are just like the microchip manufacturer in Lexmark. Whenever there is a decline in property value on the part of the -- the primary victim, or the homeowner here, they suffer a corresponding decline in their tax revenue.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the City can bring an action of the sort we're talking about here in the case of one subprime mortgage that results in a foreclosure?   Curtis E. Gannon  If they can say that that -- that's -- that that was caused by discriminatory housing practices --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   Curtis E. Gannon  -- and that it injured them? Yes.  That's just like the -- the residents in Trafficante or the City in Gladstone.  They are able to say, we are injured by this.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal, you have four minutes.     ",15-1111

I understand your argument that you're down the line, but I -- I don't see how you can say that your loss of property taxes is a direct injury.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where -- where is the limit to that? I mean you asked for property taxes, but presumably you suffer loss of sales taxes because of the blight on the community.  It's less attractive to tourists so you lose tourist revenues.  Why -- why would -- would you be able to recover loss in tourist revenues?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And why is that?

In other words, if -- if you had prevailed they wouldn't have to give up a percentage on the possibility that they might not be stating a claim.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if we include language along the lines that don't worry, it's not going to be very much based on the experience in -- in Baltimore and -- and Memphis? (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there -- is there a difference? I couldn't -- the -- the complaint was not clear to me, anyway, between subprime loans and predatory loans.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Malcolm L. Stewart  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address the domestic exhaustion issue first, and I'd like to begin by responding to Justice Kennedy's question about why hasn't the exhaustion doctrine been codified. The Court's historic cases in the domestic exhaustion field have located the exhaustion principle in the language of the predecessors of what is now 35 U.S.C. 154(a)(1)  That is the provision of the Patent Act that says the patent owner has the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the patented invention.  And in addressing predecessor versions of that language, this Court said those exclusive rights in essence don't encompass the right to control resale or use of a lawfully sold article. For example, in Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell, the Court said -- addressed the proper interpretation of the exclusive right to vend, and it said the right to vend was exercised when the first authorized sale was made.  The right to vend does not encompass the right to set resale prices. In motion picture patents, the Court said that its task was to determine the meaning of Congress enacting the predecessor version of 154(a)(1). In -- in order -- other cases, the Court has referred to lawfully sold articles as being no longer under the protection of the act of Congress, or that the exhaustion rule delimits the scope of the patent grant. So it's true that the Patent Act doesn't contain an analogue to 17 U.S.C. 109(a), which is the Copyright Act provision that specifically addresses the scope of exhaustion, but the exhaustion doctrine has historically been understood by this Court as a gloss on the exclusive rights conferred by 154(a)(1) and its predecessors, and unless Congress wanted to change the exhaustion rule, either to get -- get rid of it entirely or to substitute some different triggering event, there was no need for it to amend -- to -- to codify an explicit exhaustion provision by continuing in effect and by tweaking the exclusive rights conferred by the grant of a patent, Congress should be understood to have manifested its intention that historic conceptions of domestic -- domestic exhaustion would continue to have sway. Now, the second point I make about domestic exhaustion is that the court of appeals' err, in our view, stem to a large extent from its misreading of general talking pictures.  General talking pictures dealt not with a -- not with simply a restriction on the use that purchasers could make after an article had been lawfully sold.  It dealt with the conditions on which its patentee's licensee could sell the article in the first place.  And the -- the exhaustion doctrine is also -- often referred to colloquially as the first-sale doctrine, and I think that's a reason -- there's a reason for that.  It's that the presence or absence of exhaustion turns on whether there has been a lawful first sale, and if the licensee departs from the instruction of the patentee and sells the article in a way that is not authorized, there's no lawful first sale, and therefore, no patent exhaustion.  But once the article has been lawfully sold, any restrictions on resale or use that the patentee purports to impose downstream can be enforceable only under contract law or commercial law, not under patent law. And that brings me to my third point about domestic exhaustion, which is one of the arguments on the other side is -- on the Respondent's side is that application of domestic exhaustion principles here would prevent parties from reaching agreements that might be economically advantageous to both of them. And so the Respondent says, well, if I have had particular buyer who only wants to use the cartridge once and doesn't want to pay extra for the privilege of reusing it, if he never intends to do that, why shouldn't we be able to negotiate a deal under which I charge him less in return for his commitment to only use it once? And the answer is nothing in the exhaustion doctrine prevents parties from reaching those agreements and enforcing them as a matter of contract law, if they are enforceable under the -- the law of the relevant jurisdiction. The policy judgment that this Court has historically attributed to Congress is not a judgment that these sorts of restrictions are bad or should be unenforceable.  It's simply a judgment that possession of a patent doesn't give the patentee any greater rights to make or enforce restrictions like this than a seller of similar unpatented property would have under the rules of -- of general contract law. And so, in several of the exhaustion decisions, the Court has distinguished between the limits on patent remedies and the alternative remedies that might be available under what the Court has often referred to as the general law, the body of contract and commercial law that applies to -- to all sellers. I'd like to turn now, if I may, to the question of international exhaustion.  And the position of the United States on -- on this issue is between that of the two parties, it's our view that a patent -- a U.S. patent owner who sells goods -- patented goods abroad should be able to reserve its U.S. rights but need -- needs to do so expressly. And I'd like to start --   ",15-1189

Roberts, Jr.  Not how they would remedy --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What would their understanding have been about the appropriate remedy when they passed the statute?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So do -- do I understand you to agree that when we approach these questions, severance and remedy, that we do look at what the Congress at the time when they passed the law would have done?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We're going to find lots of cases when we address this question that talks about the intent of the Congress that passed the statute.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And I don't think there are any, but -- you haven't found one, and I don't think anyone could find one.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But let's say, when we're looking at a question of congressional intent and a question of this, we look at what a Congress 60 years later would have thought.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then don't pretend that you're implementing Congress' intent when you say we're going to -- we're going to put in place when we're talking about a remedy, not in terms of finding a violation.  Don't pretend that you're implementing Congress' intent when you look at what Congress -- a Congress 60 years later would do.   INTERRUPTING ",15-1191
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I think you're putting a significant burden on Congress to sort of speak up.  There's sort of an estoppel against Congress. If they don't speak up in every instance where they think some prerogative or interpretation is -- is being misapplied or prerogative taken away from them, then there can -- deemed to have acquiesced in it.  And this is a context in which that might be particularly inappropriate, because maybe the particular appointment contravenes your -- your theory. But a significant number of people in Congress want to see that vacancy filled, you know, under -- even though it contravenes these more general provisions, and that might not be a particular battle they want to fight at that time.  I -- I think it's a very serious burden to impose on the Legislative Branch.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is that -- I'm sorry.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is that not -- how is that not an estoppel?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sounds like the point I was trying to make, is: You are putting weight on the fact that they didn't do anything.  And you say you've got other arguments, too, and I appreciate that, but what did they do, then?   ",15-1251

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I was just -- I -- I understood you in responding to Justice Alito to say that the State had to give the money back because they'd acquired it as a result of a flawed prosecution.  Is that right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's not true for some of the payments.  You know, there's a $30 docket fee.  In other words, that's not something that depends upon whether the conviction is valid or not in the normal case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Including the docket fee?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, so that's a different analysis than the Mathews analysis, though.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Banner. General Yarger.     Frederick R. Yarger  Chief Justice Roberts -- or, excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice, if this is their property, if they have a present entitlement to it, it is their property, then due process requires them some procedure to get it back, and that's the question. Is this, as a matter of substantive law, their property or public funds as the Colorado supreme court held, and, therefore, there's -- there can only be a mechanism for compensation from public fund for those losses? And so that is the key question in this case. If there are no further questions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Yarger. Mr. Banner, you have four minutes.     INTERRUPTING ",15-1256
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so do you have any obligation to return the money at all, pursuant to any procedures? Could you just say once -- once you pay the money, we have no procedure for you to get it back. In fact, we won't give it back to you ever.  It's our money, we don't have to give it back.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if you said instead of the $128 for this, the $30 for -- if you said everybody who is convicted owes the State $10,000 and you don't -- you don't get it back if you're later -- if the conviction is later overturned.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's a question, it seems to me, of -- you keep talking about compensation.  The issue is restitution.  And under normal equitable principles of restitution, it, in fact, still is the property of the person from whom the money has been taken away.  And I wonder if your -- your analysis has to be adjusted when you appreciate that it's not compensation.  It's not sort of the normal State, give us some money.  Under equitable principles, it's State, give me my money back.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does your -- does your analysis -- why doesn't it apply to criminal fines? In other words, the fine for whatever the offense is, you know, $10,000.  In other words, it's not money that they paid fees along with the process.  It's the end of the process.  You're convicted, you pay a $10,000 fine.  Why don't -- when the conviction is overturned, why don't you say, well, you know, this is our money now, it's in the State treasury, you can't get it back because of sovereign immunity?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You say your line doesn't depend.  Does that mean you could apply this rule to fines?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Really? Are fines in Colorado unredeemable once you -- once you put them in the treasury?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why should -- why isn't it a violation of the takings clause?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Private property shall not be taken without just compensation.  Don't ask for any procedure or process.  Just give me just compensation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's -- I mean, what are you going to do? You can't -- you can't give them back whatever time they've spent in jail.  You just can't do it, but you can give them the money back.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Was there any -- you know, I -- one source of the difficulty we're having, it seems to me, is that the Exoneration Act was addressed to some -- a situation very different than what we have here.  It was addressed to, you know, someone wrongfully imprisoned for 20 years and the State felt some obligation to remedy that at least in a symbolic way. But in order to qualify for that you do need to show all these other things. And -- I mean, is it completely settled? I guess we have the decision from the Colorado supreme court that that same act applies, and this strikes me as a very different situation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, thanks for agreeing with me.  I don't think that's what I said.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess what I said is that by its -- its -- as I understand the background at least, the act was not addressed to the specific situation.  It was addressed to a different situation, and yet the court below has interpreted it far more broadly, not narrowly but broadly, to cover a -- a very different situation.   ",15-1256
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Elias, welcome back.     Marc E. Elias  I think you can read that decision in the way in which you would read any other decision of a lower court that may be of interest to the Court.  So I don't think it is entitled to any more or less deference than a -- you know, than a -- the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court that it may have had in a -- in a racial gerrymandering case from 1998.  You know, it -- it -- it certainly can -- can inform you, but it is -- you know, can inform your thinking of the -- of -- of the case, but I don't think the findings of fact are entitled to any weight in this case.  I think the clear error standard applies. With respect to a seat in Congressional District 1, I just, because my time is about to expire, want to make the point that this was just a clear error of law.  The Court found -- the Court relied on an incorrect reading of Bartlett.  That led it to believe that it needed to destroy a crossover district, which is -- which is what it did, where there was no evidence of racially polarized voting actually preventing African-Americans from electing a candidate of their choice. I appreciate your indulgence.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky.     Nicole A. Saharsky  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start with Congressional District 12.  This is the serpentine district, the one that basically everyone agrees looks terrible, and the question is whether race was the predominant motive or whether it was politics. Now, this determination, the Court has said on numerous occasions, is one that's reviewed for clear error.  And the district had a lot of evidence before it.  It went through a three-day trial.  And I just want to highlight some of the key evidence that it relied upon in making credibility determinations and in finding that race was the predominant motive. And that starts with Congressman Watts' testimony that Rucho, who was one of the architects of the plan, told him that they had to ramp up the minority voting percentage in the district to over 50 percent. So that's the racial target at the starting point in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act. And then as counsel mentioned, we have that target being hit on the nose, 50.66 percent.  And then we have evidence, direct evidence, of the way that the State did it.  And that came from the mapmaker.  And he said -- although he did also say, first, that he did not use -- he only used politics, did not use race, he made contradictory statements and said that he did use race with respect to Guilford County in that he pulled the black population from Guilford County in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act. And I think if you looked at the record, Justice Breyer, you would see exactly what you anticipated, which is that the -- that the State was pulling in concentrations of the black voting age population.  And the concentrations were so high that that supported this inference that they really were using race.  And there's a chart in the -- the plaintiff's briefs and there's evidence cited in our brief that shows that you really had that concentrated pulling in.  That's how it was done with respect to Guilford County. And then the last thing, and I think that this is important, is that the district court made credibility findings that the political motive had been discredited.  Mr. Clement is right: There is evidence that was there about political motive, but the district court found that it just wasn't credible in light of Congressman Watt's testimony, which the court credited, about the target, and in light of the fact that the political testimony, which was mostly put on by the mapmaker, had been contradicted by the mapmaker himself when he said that he used race and also contradicted by the two architects of the plan, who kept trying to downplay politics in their statements. And so when we look at this, and particularly in light of the clear error standard, you have a -- a three-judge panel that went through three days' worth of evidence, made credibility findings, went through volumes of evidence.  And even the one judge that disagreed with respect to this particular holding recognized that what the majority did was reasonable, referred to it as eminently reasonable, the well-reasoned opinion of the majority.  And in those cases, I just don't think that you can find clear error.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what do you have to say about the Voting Rights -- I mean, the clear error standard with respect to the State court decision as well? I mean, it is certainly something of a fortuity that we have the Federal case before us and not the State case.  And if it were the State case, we'd be reviewing their factual findings on the same question for clear error.  And now you're saying, well, this one is here, so we should apply clear error.  It seems to me that that response is not terribly helpful in addressing the -- the conflict that's before us.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Well, a couple of responses. First of all, the way that the Court deals with potential two-bites-at-the-apple problems is through the Res Judicata/Claim Preclusion and issue preclusion doctrine.  So to the extent that you're trying to figure out what weight, if any, the State court decision has, we think that that is the appropriate lens because this Court --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What does that mean? Whichever one was decided first, or whichever one arrives here first?   Nicole A. Saharsky  Well, I think you would have to ask whether the -- the res judicata principles had -- it -- it would have been the State court being decided first, but you have to ask whether res judicata principles were met.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you're saying we should apply the res judicata principles, and that leads us to favor the State court?   Nicole A. Saharsky  No, I'm not saying that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what -- I don't understand.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  State court was decided first.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And then you say we should apply res judicata.  So what does that mean?   Nicole A. Saharsky  Well, the -- the application of res judicata would depend on North Carolina law in this instance because it was a case out of the North Carolina courts.  And we don't have a position on the application of North Carolina law.  I'm just saying that the way that you deal with this question is through application of the res judicata framework, as opposed to doing something different like saying, now we won't use clear error anymore.  We'll go to de novo review or something like that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You want us to apply res judicata to decide this question, and you don't have a position on what the answer is?   Nicole A. Saharsky  Well, I think if the Court worried about the State court having some effect, that it would ask there whether there was a res judicata bar. And there would be three hurdles, I think, that the State would have to overcome in order to prove -- in order to show that there was a res judicata bar: First of all, whether the argument was waived.  That's addressed in the briefs. Second of all, whether the factual predicate for privity that the State claims is there.  There's also a substantial question on that. And then, third, whether North Carolina law uses a concept of privity that is very expansive, really beyond where this Court was in the Taylor v. Sturgell decision. My point is not that you need to resolve that or that you need to decide it a certain way.  It's just that if you're asking about, how do I -- what do I do with the State court decision, the way that you figure out what to do is by using those principles. What you don't do is simply defer to the State court findings.  I don't see how you would do that, because this case is here on appellate jurisdiction.  You need to decide the case before you.  And we don't think you would do something like use de novo review, because, after all, Rule 52, which mandates clear error factual findings, applies to this Court.  So I think this Court should decide this case as it comes to it, and with -- that is with the clear error standard with respect to District 12.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

The claim is you're not registering on my mark because it's disparaging, and your answer is, well, we run a program that doesn't include disparaging trademarks, so that's why you're excluded.  It -- it doesn't seem to me to advance the argument very much.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why isn't that disparaging of everyone else? Slants Are Superior, well, superior to whom?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But one distinction is the scope of the government program.  If you're talking about a particular discussion venue at a -- at a public university, that's one thing.  If you're talking about the entire trademark program, it seems to me to be something else.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Running the Federal courts is a government program.

Let's say you had a government program putting on a -- a festival or a lecture series. We only want pro-Shakespeare presentations.  It's about celebrating Shakespeare.  And if you disparage Shakespeare, you can't participate. Is there anything wrong with that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but no, it's not.  If you have a disparaging trademark, you can't utilize it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess I don't understand yet your distinction why the only-celebrating-Shakespeare program is -- is okay, but the trademark one is not.  You can't disparage Shakespeare.  You can't have disparaging marks about anybody in the trademark context.  Is it just the comprehensive nature of the government program?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You've said -- you've said several times that the problem is that the government is burdening noncommercial -- the noncommercial aspects of the trademark, but it seems to me that that's an awfully blurry line.  A lot of these trademarks promote the commercial aspect, in fact, by disparaging other groups.  So they figure that it's a way to promote sales.  How do you tell the difference between the commercial aspect of the trademark and the noncommercial aspect?   John G.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Meeropol.     Rachel Meeropol  But an injunctive -- an injunctive claim, while it could stop, currently, current unconstitutional conduct cannot deter future unconstitutional conduct from occurring.  It doesn't deter the future attorney general from creating an unconstitutional policy.  And if national security policy is somehow insulated from judicial review without even a determination that this is the type of national security policy where we could expect there could -- there should be sensitive judgments made, if -- if in that situation there is no Bivens remedy, then there are times when the Court will play no -- will be able to play no role in reviewing what has occurred, because the -- the individuals simply can't get into court fast enough.  Maybe in a situation like this, they're denied from getting into court for a period of time.  And then when they finally do, the claim that the way that they've been treated is stopped.  You know, they're released; someone else is picked up instead.  There's never a chance to actually undertake judicial analysis of what has been occurring. If qualified immunity justifies what was done here, or if Petitioners have not plausibly alleged a claim, those are bases to affirm the circuit.  But if there is no cause of action at all, if individuals who are the subject of clearly unconstitutional national security policy don't even have the opportunity to get into the court, then there is nothing to deter even more excessive exercises of government power in the future.

Now, you may disagree with that approach to the policy, but what concerns me and why the restraint is appropriate in the Bivens context, is that it is a way of challenging national policy through damages actions against the individuals implementing it.  And I think that is an extraordinary departure from where we have recognized Bivens remedies in the past.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess my point is -- is a different one.  I understand the argument that there are constitutional violations.  But the question that you're asking the Court to do is to shape a remedy for that, a remedy that Congress has not provided.  And to look at it in the simplest terms, I mean, it has been 40-whatever years since we adopted an approach to implied rights of action under statutes where we say if Congress wants people to be allowed to bring individual damages actions, they pretty much have to say so. And it seems to me that it's the same approach here except, of course, you're dealing with the Constitution.  And the idea that the Court lacks the institutional competency, okay, there's -- there's a constitutional claim against a national policy.  We think the best way to consider that constitutional challenge is to allow people to sue individuals responsible for implementing it for damages. You shape the policy, the national government in response to 9/11, therefore, you have to pay money because it's been a determination that that was unconstitutional.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand that. But the point made by your friend on the other side, though, of overdeterrence, when you have the attorney general, the director of the FBI, the director of INS sitting down and making -- what are we going to do to respond to this crisis, and -- and people in the -- were of -- old enough, 9/11, sort of have a better sense of what that crisis was like. And if you imply a Bivens actions, one of the things they're going to enter into, what is best, what is appropriate, and presumably also, what's constitutional.  They're going to say, well, gosh, if, you know, I'm wrong, I'm going to -- I'm going to be sued, not because I'm the attorney general, but as an -- as an individual.  And -- and part of the policy that we've announced is that we don't want people forming policy to have to worry about they're going to have to -- to pay if the -- if the policy is found infirm.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what is so fact-intensive about the argument that government officials -- the government is the entity and officials within that same entity don't conspire among themselves, they're just doing their -- doing their jobs?

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Goldenberg.     Elaine J. Goldenberg  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to talk about both the enterprise and the injury points, but I'd like to start with the enterprise point, because Section 1962 most directly affects the government's ability to bring RICO prosecutions and RICO civil actions. And as some of those questions have pointed out, there are a number of predicates that are incorporated into RICO, into the definition of racketeering activity, that have extraterritorial applications.  Some of them have solely extraterritorial applications.  And that is a clear indication that RICO itself extends extraterritorially to the extent that the predicates that are alleged in the case do.  And that is true both of the pattern itself, the conduct of the crimes, and also of the enterprise.  And you can see that, if you look at the kinds of predicates that we are talking about here. As was observed earlier, many of them were incorporated into RICO after 9/11.  Many of them involved terrorist conduct.  And the natural way in which the provisions would operate and Congress would have understood this is that they would have swept in activities by foreign enterprises as well as the foreign conduct itself.  We've given a number of examples of those kinds of provisions in our brief: The killing of the U.S. national abroad, taking U.S. hostages abroad, shooting at aircraft with U.S. citizens abroad with missile systems. There is another example that is, I think, a very clear one, that is Section 2339D, which is receiving military-type training from a foreign terrorist organization.  Although I suppose it is possible that somebody could go and receive that training in connection with their activities with a domestic enterprise, the very natural operation of that provision is going to be that they are going to be carrying out the affairs of a foreign enterprise -- in fact, a very foreign terrorist organization -- that is holding the military-type training and has those training camps. And so we think that it's clear that the provision has -- that Section 1962 has extraterritorial applicability, both with respect to the foreign pattern of conduct and with respect to the enterprise, to the extent that a predicate with extraterritorial applicability is implicated. I've heard Petitioners talk about two reasons why they think that might not be true, both of which I think are incorrect.  One is that the government could just prosecute the underlying crimes themselves and not use RICO, and the other is that -- well, in situations in which you have some people in the United States, you could kind of break them off and call them a domestic enterprise.  And I don't think either of those is a workable approach to Section 1962. With respect to just prosecuting the underlying crimes, of course the very point of RICO was that Congress thought, where there were patterns of serious crimes, that just prosecuting the crime itself was not a strong enough tool for the government, and that it was important for the government to have these special advantages that RICO confirms in order to root out the things that are causing these patterns of crimes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But RICO imposes, it seems to me, as we've even observed in the domestic context, far more significant -- the impact internationally could be far more significant than prosecution simply of the underlying offenses.  It obviously provides the government with extremely strong prosecutorial reach and penalties, far beyond what the substantive elements do.  And I'm wondering why that shouldn't cause us to be more concerned with respect to the comity interests that are at stake when you're talking about extraterritorial applicability.   Elaine J. Goldenberg  Well, I think, as this Court observed in Empagran, when you're talking about Section 1962 or something like Section 1962, where it is the government that is choosing whether to prosecute or whether to bring a civil action, the government has the ability, it has the incentive, to take those kinds of concerns into account and to regulate itself, either to be constrained in bringing that kind of action where it might cause some comity concerns, or to deal government-to-government with another government, to try to make sure that those comity concerns are smoothed over.  It's on the private side, under Section 1964(c), where you have private parties bringing treble damages actions, that the concerns about comity, I think, are much greater, because private parties don't have that same ability or incentive to regulate.  When they are bringing actions, they are trying to get their treble damages.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick.     David C. Frederick  And my answer is, Congress has addressed some of those concerns in the antitrust area with various amendments that affect -- that -- that only go to conduct. And classically, what Congress is getting at is conduct, not remedy.  But in the conduct area, what Congress has done in one of the antitrust amendments for the Sherman Act was to say, we are only going to affect foreign conduct if it has a domestic effect, but it is still a focus on conduct and not on remedy.  Congress is very well-equipped to deal with this issue should it proceed that -- there to be a concern, but Justice Breyer, I would point out that it would be odd to suppose that Congress is intending to turn the United States into a place where criminal activities could occur from the United States that was affecting our closest allies and there was nothing those allies could do about it by going into the United States and trying to vindicate and -- and seek redress for those harms. That would be a very, very stark departure from this country's long history of having respect and -- and provide a remedy for foreigners who are harmed by actions of the United States and its citizens. If I could just address the -- I think I've addressed the Empagran question, because that's the statute that was affected.  And if I could just note that the PATRIOT Act -- footnote 10 of our brief points out that then-Senator John Kerry, now Secretary of State, was very conscious of the effect that this would have on foreign nations and foreign litigants.  And when the PATRIOT Act extended certain of these predicate acts into RICO, he stated on the floor -- we cited the provision in our brief -- the reason for doing that was to give foreign nations that had been affected and who were treaty allies an opportunity to come and seek redress in our courts. The last point is that Mr. Katsas noted the choice-of-law principle, where there is a foreign injury and there is a decision to apply foreign law, and he says, why shouldn't that apply here? That only applies where there is a conflict between the laws that would apply here -- we are asserting that there is a U.S. statutory violation by a U.S. company for actions that it committed in part in the United States.  There's no reason to apply a choice of law, because you have a foreign company that is -- or foreign interests that are asserting a violation of U.S. domestic law. In every instance where Congress made the decision to apply RICO extraterritorially, it imposed important domestic proof requirements.  That is the limiting principle on which the Court ought to decide this case. Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katsas, you have four minutes remaining.     ",15-138X

You said the victim is the --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, it's just one.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You -- you can easily -- you can easily envision situations where private parties prosecuting RICO actions for -- against European entities might implicate serious comity concerns whether the racketeering enterprise is a State-owned actor or an -- an entity that's strongly supported by the -- the government.  And in those situations, how would comity concerns of the foreign government be taken into account in the private treble damages action?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So here we have racketeering --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Here the -- you have racketeering activity that goes to the illegal trafficking and cigarettes, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, I mean, what if -- what if -- and you have a -- domestic crime predicates, what -- what if the cigarettes were marketed through, you know, I don't know, an enterprise very important to the government of -- you know, some government that sells cigarettes, the -- you can imagine other products. In other words, it's -- it's -- here you have sort of an organized crime enterprise.  But the way the racketeering statute works, and we have a lot of experience with this domestically, it reaches far beyond what you would have thought Congress had in mind when it used the word ""racketeering"" and certainly involves otherwise legitimate enterprise.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, does your --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does your argument depend upon the fact that there is no difference from the consumer's perspective if he sees this product is $100, come in and buy it, and then he gets to the cash register and there's a surcharge, no, it's $103, and it's $100, he goes to the cash register, pays cash, and they say, well, happy you, it's $97? And is your argument that a consumer sees no difference in those two situations?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can you agree with the -- the State that that is -- could be to some extent misleading as far as the consumer --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- is concerned?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, under your --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Under your -- under your argument -- I just want to understand.  I understand you say, well, that's -- it's not this case. But under your argument, how would you analyze the -- the hypothetical that I posed?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. We'll afford you a minute for rebuttal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Feigin?     Eric J. Feigin  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to focus on what I take to be the core of the First Amendment dispute between the parties, which I think centers around a merchant who, for example, wants to label a soda as costing $1.95 with a 5 percent credit card surcharge, and the question is whether the State can require the merchant to specifically identify a price of $2.05 before charging a customer who wants to use a credit card that amount. A law like that is very similar to a law that simply regulates pricing or requires a merchant to honor their offers to make or enter into a contract of the sort that we normally wouldn't think is subject to any First Amendment scrutiny.  We nevertheless think that the requirement that everyone seems to agree is imposed here is best viewed under this Court's precedence as a speech regulation because, in effect, it's prescribing how the merchant communicates an otherwise lawful pricing scheme. But to the extent that New York's law, like the Federal law, simply requires a disclosure in dollars-and-cents form of any higher credit card price in circumstances where the merchant has decided to display the lower cash price in dollars-and-cents form, it's a perfectly valid consumer disclosure law under this Court's decision in Zauderer.  We --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's a very -- that's a very patronizing approach.  I mean, you're saying in B when it says it's $10 cash, it's 20 cents surcharge, that they've got to do the math and say, by the way, that's $10.20?   Eric J. Feigin  And let me explain why, Your Honor.  I think there are two good reasons why that has to be done. First, if you're -- or why it's reasonable for --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no, I thought you were telling me that they -- that it's not enough. Even if it's in cash, if they say that's a 20 -- 20-cent surcharge, that violates the statute.   Eric J. Feigin  Your Honor, if all they said was $10 price and 20-cent surcharge --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   Eric J. Feigin  -- and they don't say $10.20 credit card price, that, as we understand it, would be a violation of the Federal statute. But let me please explain why.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Hold on -- now, hold on.  You're saying that the -- the American people are too dumb to understand that if you say $10 plus a 20-cent surcharge, they can't figure out that that's $10.20.   Eric J. Feigin  And the second reason, Your Honor, I think addresses that concern directly. (Laughter.)   Eric J. Feigin  Which is that there is -- which is that there is an administrability concern here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  There's an --   Eric J. Feigin  An administrability concern. Once you start allowing mathematical formulas, you can get into a debate about when the formula becomes too complicated for your average consumer.  You can imagine --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's too much to say $10 plus 20 -- I -- I suppose it's a mathematical formula, but it's for second graders.   Eric J. Feigin  Well, Your Honor, let me see if I can -- first of all --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I agree that percent -- that -- that's Point C, that's not B.  I agree that a percentage is more complicated.   Eric J. Feigin  Well, you --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But 20 cents and $10, that's not too complicated unless you're taking a very patronizing and condescending view of the capabilities of the American consumer.   Eric J. Feigin  I think, Your Honor, under Zauderer, Congress -- or the New York legislature is entitled to draw clear lines.  I think it becomes more complicated if you show up at the store and you want to buy 17 things than if you're just buying the one thing, that increases the complexity of the math problem, and it would be much harder to write a law that allows certain formulas, but not certain other formulas. You could imagine a store that says, if you buy an -- here are our prices in cash.  If you buy an item in credit, we're going to charge you a surcharge equal to the -- a percentage that is the fifth digit of pi.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes, yes.  I -- I'll give you that --   Eric J. Feigin  There's a subset of the population --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- that takes a little longer to figure out.  But you're saying that it violates the law if it says $10 plus 20 cents.   Eric J. Feigin  I think, Your Honor, they're entitled to have a bright-line rule.  You could have a price that's a little bit -- that creates a harder math problem of the sort that Justice Kagan supposed. And again, you could also be buying many items at once.  You could have only a certain amount of money that you want to spend and have trouble figuring out what you're going to be able to fit under that budget --   ",15-1391

I mean, if you take a case, for example, they don't get the Heat Rise test, they get something else that isn't as, in their view --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- dramatic or compelling.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And they have to go through all sorts of -- they're preparing somebody to testify about this other test, and they incur $100,000 in expenses to do that.  Is that something that would be directly caused by the failure to disclose the Heat Rise test?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, let's say they're not.  They say, you know, if we get the Heat Rise test, that's -- that's much more dramatic.  We don't need to worry about, you know, this less compelling test.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Egbert.     John J. Egbert  There has to be causation.  And our position had -- I think we read both the district court decision and the Ninth Circuit decision as a whole.  Admittedly, there -- there are lines that one can pull out that create confusion, particularly in the district court decision, because she was looking at some Ninth Circuit decisions that created confusion for her. But at the end, both of them acknowledged that there's a causation requirement, and we do not shy from that.  We -- because you would then be in the realm of having to use criminal -- the heightened criminal due process protections.  But that -- that is not our situation. We believe that the two alternative findings of fact are sufficient for the award of all of the fees and costs that were incurred.  And, again, when I say all of them, I'm talking about from a -- a point early on in the litigation, not from the very beginning, but early on throughout the end because the Court and the Ninth Circuit agreed that the entirety of the litigation was a sham. Yes, there -- there were other things that were done in terms of medical depositions, but they were all done in the context of an empty charade.  And when you do things in the context of an empty charade, they're still empty.  And so we would -- we believe that the district court did not abuse her discretion in making those findings and that they should be affirmed. Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, but I mean the -- as I understand it, the allegations with respect to the other defendants did not have relationship to the Heat Rise test, and if -- if -- or -- if that's the case, you're saying well, we would have gotten enough money from Goodyear; we wouldn't have cared about the money from the others?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, is that the standard? It could be possible?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Judge Watford -- Judge Watford disagrees with your reading of the majority, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but I'm not sure that she, in calculating the $700,000, applied an appropriate proximate cause analysis.  I mean, those are things like the other defendants and all of that.  I mean, I'm not sure that unless you accept the idea -- I understand your argument, well, it would have settled and, therefore, every -- every expense was caused.  It seems to me that saying the only ones that were proximately caused -- that were not proximately caused were the $700,000 is a bit of a stretch.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh.  So your waiver argument.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which was not -- not -- the Ninth Circuit did not rely on the waiver argument.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I -- I suppose the idea would be that in an opinion, we would provide greater guidance on exactly what type of analysis is to be applied.  And if the district court wants to go ahead and say, well, that's exactly what I did, well, then they -- they can take the case from there.  But I mean, simply because -- and -- and as I look at the calculation, I understand why the 700,000 would be carved out, but I don't think it can be regarded as the application of proximate cause across the board.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but you say it was a sham, but I -- and maybe you disagree, but Goodyear in its -- in its reply brief, details the good-faith defenses it had that were unrelated to the Heat Rise test; in other words, about the cause of the accident, whether other parties were involved, that the tire was already damaged, the -- you know, all sorts of other things, including ones that went to the question of damages, which surely would have been pertinent in whether the case would have settled.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, and -- and it's hard for me to see how the district court would be in a position, except perhaps in an extraordinary case to -- to make the calculation, oh, the parties would have settled this.  I mean, you're involved in this; your friend on the other side is.  You know, discussions about whether to settle the case and a lot of different things go into that calculation, and sometimes they -- they line up and sometimes they don't. But for the district court to -- to make that determination, it seems to me that that would be a very hard calculation.  I mean, things like the extent to which your clients need the money, the extent to which your clients -- what their expectations were, what their stomach for going on with more years of litigation is, I don't know how a district court factors in all those considerations.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm not sure you would call it -- it's not a typical finding of fact to say that based on all of the, you know, issues in terms -- I think the parties would have settled.

Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.  Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Parker.     Robert A. Parker  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are two fundamental errors in the way that the lower courts analyzed the question of probable cause in this case. First, they took certain important facts out of context, viewed them in isolation, and engaged in precisely the sort of divide-and-conquer analysis that this Court has said is inappropriate. And the second is they concluded that because those facts were susceptible to possible innocent explanations, they could not contribute to a finding of probable cause. Neither of those is correct.  When police officers encounter a criminal suspect, they are required to draw fair inferences from the entire constellation of facts, drawing on practical and commonsense experience.  Those facts will rarely be clear and often they will point in different directions. And when they do, this Court has said repeatedly that the possibility of competing inferences supports, not undermines, a finding of probable cause.  That is especially true in the case of mens rea, which is not directly knowable.  The police officer cannot peer into the head of the criminal suspect and know exactly what he or she is thinking. And just like juries and judges must rely on all of the surrounding circumstances to infer what the mental state is, certainly police officers should be permitted to do so under the less exacting requirements of probable cause. This case presents a very good example of why these principles are appropriate.  And I -- I want to be very clear at the outset what we are not saying. We are not saying that no one can accept a secondhand invitation to a party or that they cannot go to a party at the home of somebody they don't know or that, when they arrive, they have to inspect the lease to ensure that the person has authority to invite them. All we are saying is that if a person finds himself or herself in a compromising situation -- here, finding themselves in a vacant home that actually is vacant -- where they, as a matter of fact, are an intruder who is committing the actus reus of a crime, and especially if there are surrounding circumstances that would lead a reasonable observer to think that that may be what really is going on, then the deck is stacked against that person.

Justice Gorsuch is right.  This is not a job that Congress can appropriately delegate to the courts and to enforcement officials on the ground. Congress has written a statute that makes it impossible for ordinary citizens or for law enforcement or for immigration officials to figure out what the law is, and Congress has delegated that function to them. It has done it with two features that this Court described as dooming the ACCA residual clause. First, the piece that most concerned the Court, the Court said was most important, hypothesizing this ordinary case of a crime and, second, then estimating the risk associated with that hypothesized version and whether that meets some vague standard. The government warned the Court in Johnson that section 16(b) was ""equally susceptible to challenge."" The government was right then, and the differences in statutory language that the government has since discovered do not change the outcome.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Poison?     -- conspiracy or solicitation to murder, the crime is done -- it occurs after.  I think the Government's current position, contrary to what it persuaded multiple courts of appeals of, was that that's out. And so that's the example, but in order to get there, the government has to take the quintessential crime of violence and say that it is not --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.

Roberts, Jr.  Johnson talked a lot about the confusion caused by the predicate offenses that were -- were listed; in fact, in colorful terms explained why those compounded the vagueness in the residual clause.  And, of course, you don't have those here.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the statute as a whole might be because you can look at it and say, well, there's one of the examples.  But it seems to me that argument doesn't respond to the point that it makes the residual clause much more confusing if the examples seem to be pointing in different directions and -- and involve different -- totally different consequences.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Basically, what the Court held in Johnson.   INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, very limited though; right? I mean, there's a significant cap on punitive damages.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about an Edelman v. Jordan type situation? I mean, if you name the individual who's in charge of disbursing the funds of the tribe and pursue -- proceed just against the individual, it's still going to be regarded as a suit against the sovereign.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Miller. Ms. O'Connell.     Ann O'Connell Adams  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners' suit is a personal-capacity suit against an individual tribal employee, and the tribe sovereign immunity is therefore not implicated. The Connecticut supreme court reached the opposite conclusion by holding that a tribe's sovereign immunity extends to any of its employees acting within the scope of his employment, even if the plaintiff seeks damages against that employee personally.  That holding is contrary to the settled rule; that distinguishing between a personal-capacity suit and an official-capacity suit depends on the capacity in which the employee is sued, not the capacity in which he acted when he inflicted the alleged harm. It particularly makes sense that tribal sovereign immunity wouldn't apply here because there's a coordinate doctrine of official immunity that applies in personal-capacity suits.  And we think official immunity does, as a matter of Federal common law, apply to tribal employees that it should extend to the scope of the Federal common law.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, one reason it might be a difficult proposition is that the Court has suggested several times that there is some uneasiness with the doctrine of applying sovereign immunity to tribal entities at all. Does the government have a position on that?   Ann O'Connell Adams  The -- well, we think it's -- it's settled at this point that tribal sovereign immunity is a -- is an issue of Federal law, that it applies to commercial activities, including off-reservation commercial activities. The Court suggested in Bay Mills that there may be an exception to tribal sovereign immunity if there were some circumstance in which a -- like, a tort victim or a person with no connection to the tribe, which is the Petitioners here, had no remedy for their injuries because of tribal sovereign immunity.  We don't think those circumstances have come to pass here.  Of course, there's a remedy in tribal court -- or at least there was.  There was a question about whether it's barred by a statute of limitations.  But also this suit, a personal-capacity suit against the driver of the vehicle, is a way that they could potentially recover for their injuries without suing the tribe. But tribal sovereign immunity has -- has generally -- it is understood to be a matter of Federal law.  It arises from the United States' recognition of Indian tribes.  And so because it's an attribute of sovereignty to have not only sovereign immunity, but official immunity, as a matter of Federal law, tribal employees should be entitled to such an immunity as well. If the Court does get into the -- the issue of foreign sovereigns, we would just like to note that it's our view that foreign officials are entitled to complete immunity in United States courts.  You could sue the foreign sovereign under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  And in this case, you would be able to, but we've explained in a couple of different footnotes in our briefs that --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal.     Neal Kumar Katyal  Well, I -- I think the -- the first point is that their argument is so sweeping it extends not just to drivers, it extends to tribal judges, it extends to tribal prosecutors, and, yes, it extends even to drivers of emergency vehicles.  The Ninth Circuit and Tenth Circuit amicus brief talks about police and fire and all sorts of tribal things in which you actually would, Justice Alito, for sure, I think, want them to be fearless in saving peoples' lives and things like that. And, yes, there are times there are rough edges to any immunity doctrine in which you can say, well, in this case how is that policy being served.  I mean take this Court's decision in Imbul v. Packman, which had the, you know, grossest facts imaginable. A -- you know, a state prosecutor who's fabricating evidence, which this Court said unanimously that that person was absolutely immune. So I agree that there are going to be some of those cases, but I think the logic of all of the pre-Westfall decisions, as well as the Westfall Act, is to say, we're not getting into that about -- you know, as long as the person is a Federal employee, then they have official immunity. And here, as long as the person is a tribal employee and as long as -- is -- and because the State of Connecticut does have a remedy against any sort of concerns, so if they were concerned about your situation about fearless driving, they can do -- and negotiate in the compact, as New Mexico has done, for something else and say, look, we want this channeled into State court, we insist that you waive immunity, there are a host of remedies that are available to States in this circumstance and, indeed, Connecticut availed themselves of them in this compact. And now what these folks are asking for is to renegotiate that compact and ask for something up and beyond what the State of Connecticut has provided. If there are no further questions?   John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it sounds to me like you're taking the position that it is a mixed question, which means it has elements of both, but the standard of review -- review should turn on which element the Court is addressing.  In other words, you can have both parties to the case agree, yes, this is the standard of review, we agree, it's well settled, but the facts apply in different ways. Isn't that the factual part of the mixed question and, therefore, shouldn't those determinations be reviewed for clear error?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  In my -- my hypothetical, the -- the latter are completely agreed upon.  It's a dispute about facts.  And, therefore, the -- the ultimate determination, it seems to me, would turn on clear error review.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it has to --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- arm's length was not invented by the Court here. Arm's length is --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- a legal concept that goes back beyond Blackstone.  It's a familiar legal test for lawyers. And it seems to me that the application turns on a variety of factors.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if you had a situation where the underlying -- the legal rule was satisfied if someone was a resident of Nevada? Is that a factual determination reviewed for clear error?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you have a statute and the question is, is somebody a resident of Nevada.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If he is, he gets some benefits.  If not -- is the determination that he is or is not a resident of Nevada reviewed for clear error?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Now, let's say that the determination turns, not simply where his residence is, but also where his domicile is. Is that determination of residence -- that he qualifies under the statute still just a question of reviewed for clear error?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what is -- how do you tell if you're in the first category, which, you know, what constitutes residence may or may not be clear under the law, there may be difficult issues, he spends four months in Florida, whatever, and -- and at what point does that become something that you need to have de novo review of?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I agree with you that they're difficult, but I think it's pertinent whether they're more difficult for the district judge or more difficult for the court of appeals. And it seems to me that a lot of the issues we're talking about here are the sort of things that district court judges, bankruptcy court judges, look at all the time.  But to get the intense factual record on a subsidiary issue and ask the court of appeals to look at it after the district court has already done it -- I mean, the de novo review simply means you go through the factual determination a second time -- I'm not quite sure that's -- that's desirable.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Please, follow up.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought your argument was that under State law, the properties were not formally merged, that the merger was only, I think as the Court put it, an effective merger.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Tseytlin.     Misha Tseytlin  We believe that most of the work under takings law should be done at that second step, usually Penn Central. We believe the first step, the parcel question, should be determined in a straightforward way so the Court can move on to doing the hard work of Penn Central. Thank you, Your Honors.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lazarus.     Richard J. Lazarus  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Just like cities and counties in at least 33 States have done for decades, for more than 40 years, St. Croix County has excluded from its grandfather clause for preexisting lots commonly owned substandard adjacent lots.  During all those decades, no court at any time in any jurisdiction in the United States has held that exclusion amounts to a taking and for good reason: It's fair and it's just.  And the same reason --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's -- and it gets to the questions I was asking early, fairness and justness. But the -- and if -- actually the -- the point is -- last made by -- by your friend, there are two different questions.  What is property and whether there's been a taking.  And I thought the question of fairness and justice is justice is applied to the second question.  I didn't think it was applied to defining what the property was because then you really do get, as he said, Penn Central squared. You're looking at fairness and justice.  How should we define this property? Well, fairness and justice for what purpose? Well, for the Takings Clause. And then once you define it, then you say well, it's fairness and justice for whether there's been a taking. It seems to me that you're just kind of teeing up the definition of property to give you the right answer under the Takings Clause.   Richard J. Lazarus  Your Honor, in -- in this case, in Valley, there is some circularity here, but let me tell you why there is some circularity here. And that is because they're making and taking the challenge to a very odd -- a very odd topic, and that is the absence of an exclusion.  And -- and the reason why there's no exclusion for these kinds of substandard commonly adjacent lots is precisely because government has determined over decades that, in this situation, the economic impact isn't so great.  There isn't so hardship. So the premise of the -- of these ordinances is the absence of hardship.  And since the purpose of the Penn Central analysis or the Lucas analysis for economic impact is to identify when the hardship really is so great to justify the payment of just compensation, it's not surprising that the very teachings of these ordinances is directly relevant to how you evaluate the property.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It seems to me you're -- you're trying to figure out then what the land interest is.  And usually there's a regular way to do that, which is you go down to the county office and you look at what the -- the lines are between your property and somebody else's or your lot and a different lot. You don't look to whether one is below and one is above, or that, and it seems to me that gets into a very complicated situation when for Federal takings purposes you're redefining what State law says property is.   Richard J. Lazarus  What -- what you're doing -- what you're doing, Your Honor, is you're trying to determine the economic impact.  There's no question State law defines what you own, but the question of whether it's a taking -- it's a question of Federal constitutional law, and the economic impact inquiry has to see to what extent there really is this incredibly disproportionate burden they're facing or not. In -- in the Penn -- in the Penn -- oh sorry.  In the Penn Central case, in the Keystone Bituminous case, every one of those cases State law defined as separate property interests, things can be bought and sold, the air rights can be bought and sold, the support estate can be bought and sold, real estate can be bought and sold under State law.  There are distinct property rights under State law, and the Court nonetheless, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, joined them together because the Court wanted to find out whether, in fact, there was that kind of economic burden.  And they even did it in cases involving lot lines.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  He wanted one word.   Richard J. Lazarus  Yes. (Laughter.)   Richard J. Lazarus  Yes.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Prelogar.     Elizabeth B. Prelogar  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin with your question, Mr. Chief Justice, about why it wouldn't be sensible to just look at lot lines here as the starting point for defining the parcel as a whole. And as Justice Breyer just noted, we think the lot lines are certainly relevant, especially insofar as they might shape reasonable expectations about how property owners expect to use their property and what they expect to remain separate and distinct.  But we urge this Court not to adopt a presumption or a bright line rule that focuses on lot lines in isolation.  And we really see two principal problems with that, one of which is practical, and the other is legal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  Turning to the practical point first, especially when you're looking at contiguous commonly-owned property, which is the situation the Court is confronting here.  We think that lot lines will frequently not be an accurate indicator of how that claimant is being burdened by the particular regulation, and that's because when you have those contiguous commonly-owned lots, there's a physical unity that frequently opens up the potential for linked use, linked development, a direct reciprocity of advantage, and shared value. And so when thinking about how to address the parcel as a whole issue, where the whole purpose, the whole point is to get a feel for how the regulation is actually impacting this claimant, focusing on lot lines would exclude relevant considerations about the on-the-ground economic realities.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that's -- I just don't know how that works with -- with property.  Not asking whether there's a takings, but asking whether there's property. You say it -- it depends on spacial, functional, and what's the third thing?   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  Temporal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Temporal considerations. Now, you usually don't say that when you're asking about property.  You say, I owned Lot E or I own Lot F, and here it is on the map; that's what I own. You don't sit down and say: Well, but with spacial considerations I own this much of it, and when temporal considerations, add this, and functional that. It seems to me that those concerns are pertinent at considering whether there's a taking of the property.  But when it comes to what the property is, that's a whole different question, and you don't get into spacial, you get into what the plat looks like in the county office.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  I think it's absolutely the case that for terms -- in terms of defining what's a protected property interest, at the outset you look to State law, you look to lot lines, and no one's contesting here that there's a protected property interest.  But we think that this relevant parcel determination does come into the second part of the inquiry in terms of whether there's been a taking. It's about how do you get a feel for the -- the relevant unit of property that's at issue to determine how this regulation is actually affecting this claimant, and so we would put those considerations on the taking side of the line. This Court has always shown a preference in deciding, as Justice Breyer said, and -- and Justice Holmes' famous formulation whether a regulation goes too far, the Court's always shown a preference for being able to engage in that kind of contextual analysis that focuses on all of the relevant facts and circumstances.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But by saying ""effectively merged,"" you mean not really merged?   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  Absolutely.  We're not suggesting that the lot lines have been erased here. And so we do think that those lot lines continue to have a role to play.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Except with respect to takings.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  No.  We think that they do have a role to play with respect to takings, but that it's also important to conduct the same kind of contextual analysis that's been the hallmark of this Court's regulatory takings jurisprudence.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your -- your point is -- raises my exact concern.  You said ""for all relevant purposes."" The -- the question is what purposes are relevant? And it seems to me that what purposes are relevant is analysis under the Takings Clause. And we all know the -- the issue, I think, that Justice Breyer brought up.  Let's say you have three -- three acres of wetlands and you own a hundred acres.  You say, well, my property is these three acres and you've taken it all.  The law is you don't get -- Mr. Groen doesn't get to define property interests that way because it's gaming the system by saying this is what it is. Now, another one of my colleagues pointed out, there are two halves of the State law here: Half of it is the lot line, half of it is the merger.  And you want to say, well, for takings purposes, all we look at is -- is the merger.  And it seems to me that that's just the flip side of what the landowner can't do.  You can't sort of preempt the takings analysis by saying we're only going to look at this aspect under which, of course, we win.  Just like the property owner says we're only going to look at these three -- three acres under which, of course, we win.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the key point is they didn't do that.  Nobody did that.  And I'm looking at page G -- 3 of the appendix to the County's brief, and that's the basis on which the analysis was done. And it says they did not decide whether lots have been formally merged.  And it's language that is used throughout.  These were effectively merged. Well, I mean, on the other side of it, they can argue, well, we effectively drew lines around these three acres.  And it seems to me that -- that there's a confusion between the definition of ""property"" and the question of whether or not there's a takings.  And if you start analyzing with the takings factors and the way there's property, that muddles the whole analysis.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear the end of your sentence.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what is? That it -- that it's still treated separately?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that makes it seem we're talking about it in justice and fairness. That seems to make it seem a little quirky that these owners are not entitled to treat them separately, while if they -- they just happen to record them in -- in separate names that they would be a entirely different situation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they won't after today, I mean -- or if you win. (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You'll be -- you'll be smart enough to say: Okay.  Husband, you own F; I will own E.  And by the way, you're my successor in interest under E, and I'm your successor in interest under F.  And -- and then we'll be fine.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does it really -- does the whole takings issue really turn on that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I would suppose that in my hypothetical, the husband owner on one side and the wife owner on the other side, they can build a common house on the two lots, can't they?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It makes no difference under your approach that the two lots were taxed separately, does it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So that doesn't make it.  It makes no difference under your approach that there were lot lines separating the two lots; right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are there other aspects in which the two lots are treated separately that make no difference under your approach?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are these lots actually separate under State law?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so that's not quite an answer.  Are they legally separate under State law? They're still shown on the plat as separate lots, correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So to what extent is it wrong for me to understand that the only -- the only sense in which the merger doctrine that you're talking about applies is with respect to a takings claim?

What -- what difference does it make what the purpose behind the law is in assessing whether the burden is substantial or -- or undue? It seems once you get past the -- the assumption that the law has a rational basis and you haven't challenged that, then you look at the burden or the obstacle.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, the question is, I think, whether it's final with respect to the Corps' determination, not with respect to whether somebody else might be able to bring a suit, and -- and I think what Justice Sotomayor is suggesting is that in practice and, what I was suggesting, in law is it's final with respect to the Corps.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it seems to me what you are arguing, then, is that there are exceptions to what is otherwise a safe harbor.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, a great -- a great practical risk.  I mean, the -- the Corps comes in and says these are jurisdictional waters.  And you say, yeah, well, you can go ahead.  You can still dump and do everything you want and take your chances that there will be a different ruling later on down the road.   INTERRUPTING ",15-290X

Roberts, Jr.  I thought your answer might focus on the fact that this is of great benefit to the Agency, because by issuing the determinations, they are able to exercise extraordinary leverage without going through the formal enforcement process.  So it -- it does give them -- it is a way for them to exercise their authority without effective judicial review.  And that's a significant enforcement tool for them.  So they might be unwilling to give it up if they had the option.   ",15-290X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's certainly rendered outside the Constitution.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So this case would come out differently if Congress had not enacted the Indian Civil Rights Act?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what if they -- what if they had? In other words, convictions in a tribal court do count as predicates, and there is no Indian Civil Rights Act.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it would be a case-by-case determination?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers had discussion of a few prosecutions where those claims were raised.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but how would that work in a case like this? I mean, let's say there are procedural deficiencies in one of the predicate prosecutions.  And, you know, the defendant says, okay, well, it was a misdemeanor.  He -- he doesn't seem to be terribly troubled by convictions, anyway, but -- so he says, I'm not going to seek review of that. But then later on, the 117 prosecution comes along.  Is he just sort of stuck with the prior allegedly deficient prosecution because he didn't bring every challenge he possibly could have at that time?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, maybe he didn't have any -- maybe he didn't have any reason to challenge it.  I mean, my hypothetical assumes a -- a predicate offense conviction that the defendant may not have challenged for whatever reason.  And yet when the 117 -- if I've got the numbers right -- action comes up, it turns out it's a lot more serious, which often happens in these multiple offenders.  You know, it's three -- three strikes and you get it.  But you don't necessarily know that the first strike was that -- that big a deal.  It's only when it's accumulated with the others that it is.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't -- I -- I saw that argument in -- in your brief, and I'm not sure I'm quite -- well, I'm not sure I agree with it. I mean, the -- the idea you're saying is that, well, if there's three offenses and on the third one, you get this much enhanced penalty, that that's only for the third one.  It doesn't -- it's not being imposed for the prior two. I mean, I understand that, that you're already been convicted and sentenced under the prior two, but it seems to me as a practical matter it's fair to say that the enhancement is based on those prior two. You can't just ignore the prior two and say, no, no, it's all just about this third offense.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so they knew better than Madison?   INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Breyer.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Goldenberg.     Elaine J. Goldenberg  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start by talking about the way that we read the text of this provision, because I think it's a little bit different than the way that Petitioners read it, but not in a way that changes the bottom line in this case. So the statute says ""Rights and property taken in violation of international law are an issue."" What has to be an issue there are rights and property.  And as we know from this Court's decision in Permanent Mission, that means that at the jurisdictional stage, you have to figure out whether the kind of right that's being asserted falls within the federal law definition of rights and property within the FSIA.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But how often -- how often is that a serious concern? I mean, I understand that the reason you're concerned is that you don't want a reciprocal burden imposed on the United States when it's haled into court in a foreign country.  But does it really make a difference to a foreign sovereign whether it litigates these issues under 12(b)(1), as opposed to 12(b)(6)?   Elaine J. Goldenberg  It does make a difference to the foreign sovereign for the reason that I gave.  It makes a difference to the United States when we're sued in other courts, whether there's a dispute at the jurisdictional stage or later --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But why is that? Why is that such a significant issue?   Elaine J. Goldenberg  Well, as I said, there is something that is a real affront to a foreign sovereign, or can be an affront to a foreign sovereign if another court sits in judgment of something that foreign sovereign has done.  And I think that's --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it's going to be sitting -- it's going to be sitting in judgment, one way or another.  It's just a question whether it's in the context of 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6).   Elaine J. Goldenberg  Well --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I can't believe it makes a difference when the ambassador from whatever country calls home and says, well, I've got bad news, we're being sued in Federal court.  But don't worry, it's only under 12(b)(1), not 12(b)(6).   Elaine J. Goldenberg  It does make a difference. And I think it's particularly sensitive with respect to the expropriation exception, actually.  And that's why taking in violation of international law is such a critical threshold issue that has to be decided at the jurisdictional stage --   ",15-423X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's not the outset.  That's a question of execution of a judgment that's already been in place. This is the issue we're talking about here, is sort of the commencement of -- of litigation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  And the other -- the other statutes you're talking about and the ones set forth in your red brief just seem to me to avoid the question, which is whether there's a different approach in the foreign sovereign immunity. Our ambassadors have to go to these other countries and say -- or their ambassadors, you're being sued.  You have to come into our courts, even though you're a sovereign.  And we don't want you dragging us into your courts, but you have to come in our courts because someone has raised a claim that is not wholly insubstantial or frivolous.  That's a very low standard in that context.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you're talking about the United States sovereign immunity --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- in -- in the United States courts?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  Why does that make no sense? I mean, you -- you establish jurisdiction, and there's an additional defense.  Other than that, there's no jurisdiction.  I don't see why --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Property of a domestic citizen?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Took a close look at it? It was -- I thought it was under the Bell v. Hood standard.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And the -- if there's a dispute about the commercial nexus, that's decided at what stage? 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6)?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's really all we're talking about here, and whether the -- the issues set forth in the statute are ones that should be decided at the early stage or not.  And -- and whether it's -- there's a commercial nexus, you say, well, that's just -- that's part of the jurisdictional provision, so it has to be decided at 12(b)(1)  I don't understand why that answer doesn't apply in this case as well.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what if there's a dispute about the shareholder status of the rights and property issue? There may be rights and property, but we think you own only 49 percent of the shares.  And the plaintiffs say, no, no, they -- they own 51 percent, so they have a right in property. That's a factual dispute that is decided where?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, I know. It's a hypothetical.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's -- well, or it's a jurisdictional determination because you only have jurisdiction if you have rights and property, and you'd only have rights and property if you own 51 percent instead of 49 percent.  Why isn't that like somebody coming in and saying, I'm not a citizen of Kentucky?   ",15-423X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What's the second of your four?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How does the relationship between the district court infringement action and the proceeding before the Board actually work out in practice? If you're suing someone, here's my patent, you're infringing it, and the infringer goes to the -- the Board and says I want you to determine the validity of the patent, and the district court is doing the same thing, or at least determining the scope of the patent and whether or not it infringes?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I would think that's a little burdensome to the district court.  They sort of have to get deeply into the patent case and then take whatever the Board says is the proper -- whether it's valid or not.   ",15-446X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Please, please.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Go ahead.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the one --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think as Justice Ginsburg described it, we're dealing with a hybrid entity with characteristics of the PTO and the district court.  But it seems to me perfectly clear that Congress meant for this entity to substitute for the judicial action. So why -- why should we be so wedded to the way they do business in the PTO with respect to the broadest possible construction when the -- the point is not to replicate PTO procedures.  It's supposed to take the place of district court procedures.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, but I think we ought -- we shouldn't, except as far as the number of broadest different procedures as we -- we can, it's a very extraordinary animal in legal culture to have two different proceedings addressing the same question that lead to different results.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you're just saying that, okay, there's a problem here, and so we should accept another problem that's presented where we don't have to do it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, are you saying in the IPR proceeding?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's happened six times ever.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But there's already been -- there's already been a case where you've had contrary results with respect to the same patent, right? In the same -- in other words, parallel litigation; one says A and the other says not A.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what do you do in that case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you put the district court to all the trouble? I mean, we're talking about district courts that don't do patent cases on a regular basis.  You put the district court to all the trouble of trying to construe the patent, and then the -- the defendant comes in and says, well, guess what? I won before the IP review, and so sorry, but all that was wasted energy.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there -- what -- is the district court free to disagree with the PTO reading of the patent? Could it say, fine, this is a pertinent fact, a mixed question of law, in fact, in litigation pending before me.  And I appreciate the fact that you think this agency thinks this, but my responsibility is to decide this case according to the facts and law, and I disagree with the PTO's reading.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, can it say that I understand what PTO thinks the scope of the patent is, but my responsibility is to interpret it pursuant to a different standard, and under my different standard I have a different result?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if the district court interprets the patent, is -- is that binding on the PTO?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And if the PTO interprets the patent, that's not binding on the district court.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  It just seems to me that that's a bizarre way to conduct legal -- decide a legal question.  I mean, who -- how does it work? Whoever gets to the judgment first, or --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even though they're different standards of proof?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that how estoppel normally works?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the answer to my question is, no, that's not the way estoppel normally works.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there another example where you have a complaint filed that puts an issue before the district court during which the -- the parties can take that issue away from the district court and come up with an answer that then binds -- well, I guess you're saying it doesn't bind the district court.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  And that's because of their -- their view, and then it goes back to the district court, and the district court said, well, thank you very much for your opinion, but my job is to give a different analysis.  I'm not bound by this broadest-possible reading.  And when I read the patent, I think it comes out the other way, and that's how I'm going to decide this case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And this is under --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And this is under a statute designed to make the patent system more reasonable and more expeditious in reaching judgments?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  Just to interrupt.  You're talking about something else.  You mean appeal to the Federal Circuit, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I -- what I was asking --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  What I was asking, I think, is a different question.  The reason it's not -- it's not as if it's an appeal to the district court because the district -- that -- that's an issue before the district court: What is the scope of this patent; what does it cover? And the Patent Office is telling you, well, it covers this, and the district court says, thank you, I apply a different standard.  I think it covers this.  And when that's the case, it's a valid patent.   INTERRUPTING ",15-446X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought you had a clear bright-line rule until I got to page 9 of your reply brief, where you say, ""A jury may remain effectively undischarged despite a judge's pronouncement of discharge."" There are cases where you agree that if the judge says you're discharged, they're not really discharged, and the judge can say, oh, come on back. I've got something else you've got to do.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's pretty lawyerly. (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Saying anytime you're discharged, it's over.  Now, discharge may not be discharge in every case.  Because you recognize that there are cases where the judge says you're discharged but you would allow them to come back.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Presence and control.  Now, that's -- that's the key distinction that you have?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if they're still -- if they're still in the courtroom, he can say, wait, hold up.  You've got to come back and do this.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if they're in the hall outside the courtroom?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Nothing's happened. They're all still there.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What they're worried about -- what they're worried about with the rule about discharge and then bringing them back is that the jurors may have talked to somebody about the case, heard something about it, had information that's going to be prejudicial to the defendant that they shouldn't have gotten.  Why doesn't it make sense to say, well, if they're right out in the hall or, you know, they're down the hall, bring them back in and ask, just as the judge did here, have you talked to anybody about the case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if the jury is discharged and the judge is looking at the verdict and, I don't know, shows it to the lawyers and says, okay, it's 28,000.  The lawyer says, no, that's a three.  It's 23,000.  Can the judge just stop the jury and say, well, here, what is it? Is this 28 or 23?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but does, in a certain sense -- I don't know if I -- it's certainly not a clerical error, but it is a simple error.  I mean, the point is the judge told the jury, you have to award this amount in medical expenses, and the jury didn't.  Why doesn't that fall under a different category than the, you know, questions of certainly guilt or -- or liability or no liability?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you mean with respect to the amount they were -- they were obligated to award?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the only sense -- the only sense in which it was contrary to the evidence was that they didn't award the $10,000.  They awarded zero.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If they had --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The policy arguments, I think, ring a little hollow.  This is just not going to come up very often, right? So the idea that this is going to cause all sorts of problems, only in the rarest, rarest case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And yet, when it does come up, we have this concern that Justice Breyer pointed out, that it's a big waste of money to have the jury have to start -- I guess a new jury, right -- have to be a new jury -- start all over again.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal.     John F. Bash  And we think it would be reasonable for a district court to say, and even for this Court to say, as a matter of giving guidance to lower courts, that once jurors have returned to their daily lives, they've probably spoken to friends and family about the case.  They've taken off their jury hats for more than a de minimis period.  It's so likely that there's going to be prejudice that we're just not going to allow that anymore. I'd also say there's a more formal limitation, which this Court has said in cases like Casey and Quackenbush, that once final judgment is entered, a court can't rescind interlocutory orders. I think there would be a question about when that occurs in this case.  We don't think it would ever get that far under the prejudice standard, but it might just be when the Rule 58 judgment is entered, which in this case happened the same day as the second verdict. In a case I did last year, it happened five days later. It often happens very soon.  Or you might say that once the notice of appeal is filed, or once the time is expired for filing post verdict motions, that's when the final judgment occurs.  So there'd be that more formal bound on the time limit, but I think in practice there would be an actual prejudice limit that would bound it very tightly. I just want to emphasis, this case has come up -- this issue has come up for the United States. It's come up in, actually, a surprising number of lower court cases.  And if you look at the cases cited in both parties' briefs, they're almost invariably very short periods. I mean, this is a judge wanting a do over after a few minutes where he made a mistake.  This is not people calling things back months later.  There was the five-month case that Petitioner cites, but as Mr. Katyal noted, that was reversed as gross error by the California Supreme Court.  We don't think our standard would allow that.  But where there's a minutes-long error, judges ought to have the opportunity to fix that if they can. I know Mr. Shanmugam said that it hasn't been the case in any of the cases cited in the briefs that juries retired for future deliberations, but actually one of the circuit split cases that the United States was involved with, the Third Circuit case Figueroa, the judge discharged the jurors and then realized there was a bifurcated felony possession count to try.  And it was only a few minutes, and the judge brought them back, and they were reinstructed.  There was evidence presented on that count, and -- and then they deliberated further. So it does happen.  It's -- it's rare, hopefully, because it's a mistake.  But it's not so rare that I think it -- it warrants a bright-line rule that would impose really serious costs on -- on parties and litigants. If there are no further questions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Shanmugam.     INTERRUPTING ",15-458X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So I'm not -- I'm not sure you're the one that should be complaining about a rule that's not very clear.  I mean, yours is basically look at all the circumstances, have the judge ask the questions, and particularly -- it's a variant on what I asked earlier -- particularly if this doesn't come up very often.  It seems to me to be -- make some sense to say it's a bright-line rule.  We don't want to waste courts' time, you know, figuring out whether there's adequate prejudice, how far is too far. Let's just have a clear rule.  If the judge says discharged, you're discharged.  And if he's made some mistake, you know, he'll be more careful in the future.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The rules -- the Rules Committee is, I would say, unlikely to address this for the simple reason that it doesn't come up very often.  I gather no Federal cases at all.  So the Federal Rules Committee probably has bigger fish to fry. How -- how long was the trial in this case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bash.     ",15-458X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, suppose arranging a meeting could be official government action, if that were your job.  In other words, you're not just a secretary, but your job was to manage the Governor's schedule.  You decided who met with him, you decided when, and that -- that's your job.  That's -- so anything that individual does, I suppose, would be an official act.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure -- sure.  It depends on who's making the referral or the call, right? In Justice Breyer's hypothetical, if it's a congressperson calling somebody and saying, could you look into this matter for my constituent, the person should look at it, I suppose, and then -- and that's one thing.  If it's the President who calls and says, I want you to look at this matter for my constituent, that might exercise considerably more influence.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben.     Michael R. Dreeben  So, Justice Kagan, what the crime was here was the Governor accepting things of value in return for being influenced and taking ""official actions"" to legitimize, promote, and secure research studies for Anatabloc and Star's products. That's at Supplemental JA 14. It then alleges that he would do this as opportunities arose in the course of his official actions.  And because he's the Governor and he has a tremendous amount of influence throughout the government, he appoints all the board of visitors of VCU and UVA.  He sets the budget.  They know that he's an important guy.  He has lots of opportunities to do this in different ways over time. And if you look at the pattern of what he did, directing people to meet with Star's representatives, arranging events at the mansion in which Star could bring together its chosen guest list, the doctors who it wanted to influence with the Star people who were trying to influence it, the Governor is taking every step he can do short of saying to UVA, do the studies, which his chief counsel told him would be inappropriate and wasn't going to do. So I -- I think that if you look at the indictment the way that it's actually structured, it talks about a person who, as opportunities arose, was going to engage in ""official acts."" This is a theory of corruption that Justice Sotomayor's opinion in Ganim in the Second Circuit validated, and it was cited in Skilling as a perfectly valid theory of corruption. And, therefore, the individual ""official acts"" really form a composite window into Petitioner's mind.  Did he intend to allow his official conduct to be controlled by the things of value that he received? And taking them all together, even if the Court has trouble with any individual one, they allowed a rational jury to inference that, indeed, he did. And the only way that Petitioner could win, if you agree with me on the sufficiency issue, is if you conclude that jury instructions must exempt certain types of official actions, like directing your Secretary of Health to take a meeting, which is a very kind of significant event in the life of a cabinet member and a governor, or hosting an event at the mansion, can't possibly count, because it somehow should be viewed as social, when, in fact, what the Governor is doing is allowing his benefactor to get all the people in the room who he wants to influence to do the studies. So in my view, there was nothing wrong -- if I can complete the sentence -- in the way that the indictment structured the crime in this case.  The ""official acts"" were exemplary.  They were proved, and the jury could properly find them. Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Francisco, five minutes remaining.     INTERRUPTING ",15-474X

Bush, former White House counsel to President Clinton, former White House counsel to George H.W. Bush, former White House counsel to President Reagan.  And they say, quoting their brief, that ""if this decision is upheld, it will cripple the ability of elected officials to fulfill their role in our representative democracy."" Now, I think it's extraordinary that those people agree on anything. (Laughter.)   John G.

And then that person calls you up and says, can you meet with so-and-so? All he wants to do is sit down with you and persuade you why you should file a brief supporting his case.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  -- if you have a governor whose priority is jobs for his State, and there's a CEO who's thinking about locating a plant in his State, but he can only do it, he says, if he gets tax credits from the State. So the governor is talking to him, and he says, look, why don't you come down to my, you know, trout stream and we'll go fishing and we'll talk about this.  And the governor does that.  He has a nice day fishing for trout, and they talk about whether they can get tax credits, deferred taxes if the CEO opens his plant in the State.  Now, is that a felony, because he's --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- accepted an afternoon of trout fishing, and he discussed official business at that time?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I thought -- I didn't think the government put any weight on the amount of the quid; in other words, you know -- okay.  I don't know how much an afternoon of trout fishing is worth, but I -- I gather you get -- you can be charged for that and -- and pay for it. I thought that didn't matter.  I thought it was whether he was engaged in an ""official act"" under circumstances in which a jury could find he did it because of the gift.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And -- and so if all he's doing is talking about ways to get jobs for Virginia, and he's talking with the person who's going to make that decision from the private sector, based in part on whether or not he gets, you know, tax credits, it would seem to me that under your definition, that governor is guilty of a felony.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does that make a difference, the nature of his decision? Let's say he had a policy.  He says, I think every case in which a defendant is convicted of first degree murder, that we ought to seek the death penalty and leave it to the jury.  Maybe the jury will agree or not, but I'm going to seek the death penalty in every case where there's a conviction of first degree murder. Would you have the same recusal problem?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Oh, no, I know that, but it's a categorical decision.  In other words, he doesn't look at the particulars of that case.  He has a policy that he's adopted -- you know, whether you think it's a good policy or not -- that doesn't depend upon the particular facts, simply on the facts of what the conviction is.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if you had a situation where he was directly involved in a matter that had nothing to do with the issue that came up later? You know, he -- the -- the assistant comes in and says we've got a real question here, you know, he wants a third extension of the trial date and should we oppose it or not.  And he thinks about it and says, yeah, let's oppose it.  And then 29 years later, there's an issue about a -- you know, a Brady violation. Is he recused from sitting on that Brady violation case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Can you give me -- can you give me -- much weaker? Can you give me a yes-or-no on my hypothetical?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  There is a concern about sandbagging, though.  I mean, if you do have a case where somebody has that information, I think the best thing to do would be to, you know, put it in a -- the back door, take your chances on -- on getting an acquittal.  And if you don't, then you say, aha, the judge could have recused him or herself, and our -- our remedy is we get to go back and do it all again.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, Strickland's very different.  I mean, you may think it's pretty unlikely that attorneys are going to deliberately commit error so that they have a later problem.  But it's another thing if you're talking about a fact about the judge's prior involvement.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not against you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess it's not a case of sandbagging, but it's somehow related in that the information you're talking about would have been information that seriously undermined the defense your client was presenting.  In other words, the information goes to the nature of a prior relationship. And his whole argument and defense was, I didn't know, you know, who this person was.  I had no contact with him at all. So, you know, in what sense does that -- the material that you're complaining about now is the last thing he would want to have come -- come out at his trial.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that -- well, just so I understand, you're saying the evidence might have been sufficient to persuade him not to lie?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The independent evidence you're complaining about involved the defendant himself, correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I -- I understand your -- the first two of your three points, but I don't understand how the third works.  This is -- you're concerned that the -- the Chief Justice cited his record with respect to capital cases in campaigning for office.  I -- that certainly wouldn't be a -- a recusal issue without the other two points, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So how does that have anything to do with the argument in this case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's an evidentiary point for you.  It's not an independent ground for recusal.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Eisenberg.     Ronald Eisenberg  May I, Your Honor? Your Honor, I think the answer is what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court states in its Section 2 of its IOPs.  On every court of every size, it is the duty of each individual justice to make an independent determination following his oath to do the right thing, and that is why the court is not automatically invalid.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  I -- just so I understand the scope of your argument, you would be arguing the same thing if there were three judges? One should have recused, that leaves two?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But there could be --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The main circumstance is -- would seem to me to be is a -- a real fact matter is what the deliberations of the judges were like.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you're arguing -- you're arguing the government's interests, but it -- it rings a little hollow when we see that the government is on the other side.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I was just going to ask: I thought your very -- the very first question was that you didn't -- that your answer was that you didn't seek any sanction other than dismissal.  So I'm not quite sure your fallback argument is before us.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  Did you ask for the application of any rule other than dismissal?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if we go back -- and I haven't done this -- and look at the way the case was litigated, is there an argument from you that says, okay, if you're not going to automatically dismiss this case as we argue, you should do this as a second alternative.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Singh?     Tejinder Singh  -- not exactly.  So for the first 60 days, the government definitely can't waive the seal.  The seal can only be extended past 60 days of the government's motion, so there is a certain amount of discretion involved on whether the seal will continue. We think it kind of makes sense to afford the government more weight after that 60-day period. Here, the first seal violation didn't happen until day 103, and so, you know, we are kind of in that zone.  So I think the government's -- should -- say should account for a lot, especially in this case. As a general proposition, you know, we are not urging like blind deference to the government or deference on the issue of statutory interpretation, but we are saying it's very clear that Congress is principally concerned with protecting the government. And when the government tells you -- and, yeah, there will always be a balance here, right? The government's interest may have been harmed by a seal violation, but they weren't in this case. By the way, that's an important point.  You know, there is a finding about that.  State Farm admitted -- you'll find it at Joint Appendix page 67 that they didn't learn about the lawsuit before the seal was lifted.  And so, you know, there is no harm to the government here, but there would be harm from -- for a dismissal, right? They all have to pick up the laboring oar in a massive discovery effort to carry the case forward.  It will cost a lot of money; it will prevent them from pursuing other frauds. And those are the types of interest that Congress was trying to deal with in 1986, because in 1986 it was clear that there was a tidal wave of fraud against the government, more than the government could possibly hope to address using its own resources.  And relators were marshaled as force multipliers to help with that effort.  And every time the government has to take over for a relator, those resources come from somewhere.  Even if the government gets a bigger recovery on the back end, those resources come from somewhere.  And they take attention away from other frauds that the government could be pursuing, and they undermine Congress's objectives. And so when -- in the rare case where the government steps in and says, dismiss this case, because they have already intervened or some other innocent credit factors where they decide it's important to send a message, we think courts should really listen. In this case, where the government has done the opposite, we think they should listen, too. Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bash.     John F. Bash  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Given the focus of the earlier portion of the argument, I will -- I'm happy to answer questions about why the automatic dismissal rule is wrong, but I will jump right to what we think the standard should be, how we think the Court ought to write the opinion, and then how we think the Court ought to dispose of this case. We think the standard for how to remedy a seal violation incorporates the basic background flexibility that district courts have always had to remedy violations of protective orders and sealing orders as informed by the basic purpose of this provision, which I think, as everyone has acknowledged now, is to protect the government by making sure that potential targets of criminal and civil investigations are not tipped off. And the reason you need that in the FCA is because the filing of the complaint does something very special.  It triggers the duty of the government to come in and say whether it's going to intervene. So that's why, Justice Sotomayor, it's not the factual allegations of fraud.  It's actually the filing of the complaint because that is what triggers a duty on behalf of the government to investigate and then tell the Court whether it's going to intervene. As far as the standard in the way this Court --   ",15-513X

But if you unregister -- if you don't unregister, that's not included under the Federal law? Why would -- why would Congress draft a law like that?   John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, all right. How is that the case since subsection (a) refers to each jurisdiction where the offender resides, is an employee or a student? When he's in the Philippines, there's no such jurisdiction covered by SORNA where he resides, is an employee, or is a student.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But how is that --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where is under (a) something that says it's the jurisdiction where you used to be required to register?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, but he only has to keep the registration current if there is a jurisdiction where he -- covered jurisdiction where he resides, is an employee or is a student.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, maybe he should have.  Maybe he should have.  But he may also have thought, when it says at least one jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a), and subsection (a) says where he resides, then maybe there's no jurisdiction involved under --   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  I understand -- I understand your argument about 16914(a)(3), but how many -- what's the -- the penalty for -- the maximum penalty for violating this provision?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah.  I think it's --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- ten years. So you think somebody is supposed to look at this and say, should I register? Obviously he doesn't want to register or unregister, whatever it is.  And he says, okay, it says ""involved,"" but that's different than described in.  And (a) says ""jurisdiction where the offender resides,"" and there's no place to register where he currently resides.  And then he's supposed to say, ah, but 16914(a)(3) says ""resides or will reside.""   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's an awful lot to ask a -- a layperson to parse at the penalty of ten years for being wrong.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  For a registration violation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understood -- I -- if I understood you correctly, there is still a category of people under your interpretation today that would not be covered under the new law, because you have to file an itinerary, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Well, okay. This person files an itinerary saying I'm flying to the -- the Philippines.  And if he takes up residence there, then he's still violating the law, under your interpretation?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if his purpose is I'm going to visit the Philippines, and while there, he decides I'm going to set up permanent residence here, then you would be able to prosecute him under this provision, even though the new law doesn't cover it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  His purpose is to visit the Philippines.  And while in the Philippines, he decides to set up residence there.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you -- you read 16913(a) as saying, where the offender resides or resided, is an employee or was an employee, is a student or was a student.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  This -- this is not an administrative law provision.  It's a criminal statute.  The Attorney General's guidelines can't expand a fair reading of what Congress made illegal under Federal law.   John G.

And then it -- well, exactly, except you have the burden, as I understand it, under the law, of carrying the burden of indicating that -- a double jeopardy violation.  And if you don't know, you can't carry that burden.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Alito.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the basic point that was made in Yeager made over and over again is that when the jury is hung, the jury hasn't done anything.  So the defendant in that case was able to carry the burden that the jury hasn't done anything.  So we're right back to the typical Ashe case. But this is very different.  Now what you're saying -- and the way you phrase things, I think, is significant.  You said, well, what do we know? We know the jury might have done this.  Well, that means you don't know what the jury did.  And again, it seems to me that, I guess, everybody agrees it's the defendant's burden, and it's different than a hung jury.  The hung jury, the jury hasn't done anything.  When there's a conviction, the jury has done something.  They may have done something under erroneous understanding of the law or they may have done something under the correct understanding of the law.  But either way, I don't know that you can put that much reliance on Yeager.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Prelogar.     Elizabeth B. Prelogar  I'm not sure whether the lower court applied a Chapman standard here, and I think ultimately the potential difference in standards wouldn't have affected the analysis, because the court concluded that there was -- that there was sufficient evidence on the proper quid pro quo theory, also evidence that would have supported a bribery theory. And so the court just couldn't tell either way on what ground the jury would have possibly grounded this verdict. Ultimately, though, I think in light of that error, the appropriate result is the ordinary remedy here, a retrial.  Petitioners are only entitled to avoid that remedy if they can carry their burden, and it's a stringent one, of showing that the jury actually resolved issues in their favor in this litigation. They haven't carried that burden here.  They seek to be excused from it based on the legal error. But they haven't actually carried the error -- carried the burden of showing that that jury that returned those inconsistent verdicts necessarily thought they were not guilty of committing quid pro quo bribery. Unless the court has further questions, we'd respectfully ask that you affirm the judgment of the First Circuit.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

What you know -- it's the same problem I was raising with your friend on the other side.  What you know is they might be.  And so it seems to me that what we're being asked to decide, if the possibility that they might be is enough to allow the government to relitigate the substantive -- the substantive count.  And it does seem to me that's a little bit of a -- an extension of what our precedents have said.   INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You get -- you get mired in some very abstract concepts of property rights. Yes, someone is insured, but here if they keep getting their property stolen, their insurance rates go up. Here, okay, it wasn't that if you -- correct, it wasn't the bank's own property, but it's somebody else's property that they use in making loans.  And, again, they will have less money to make loans if the property is -- is being taken. Now, does your case turn on what the defendant knows even if that's not right? I mean, the argument may as well -- people commonly think you put your money in the bank, it's your money, and they'll give it back, but of course it's loaned out by the bank. But if the defendant really thinks I'm not -- I don't want to take anything from the bank.  I'm taking this from two -- and he's wrong, is -- is he off the hook?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, is that making -- is that ignorance of the law being the defense because the law -- he thinks the bank -- the bank doesn't have any property interest at all, but in fact the bank has the property interest as either a bailee or bailor or -- I forget which one it is -- and the bank has the property interest because it actually uses the money in its own effect, but he's wrong about that legal question of property.  So his ignorance of the law is a defense?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang.     Anthony A. Yang  It shouldn't -- it shouldn't matter at all.  And I think that emphasizes why Congress would not have wanted to add some additional knowledge requirement about the property status of the money.  Why does it matter? All it does is complicate things. Congress would not have wanted to carve out this type of conduct as noncriminal.  And in fact, it's important to recognize, even Petitioner says she's not -- he's not carving out anything that's not noncriminal. In page 25 of the reply brief, Petitioner says it's a -- essentially, a pleading game.  Well, why would Congress have wanted to make the broad language of scheme to defraud, which has a history going back more than a century, to be a narrow appendage on something else in order to force the government into a pleading game, when no -- at the end of the day, if it's pled properly, it's still an offense punished by the same time.  It just doesn't make any sense. This is not what Congress intended.  It has no -- no basis in the text or history of the bank fraud. When you look at what Congress did in the legislative history, it rejected language that would have adopted the same thing.  As far as I can tell, everything points against Petitioner here.

Section 1344(1) requires proof of an intent to deceive a bank, not to cause it monetary loss.  It -- so I didn't understand -- I'm not sure what -- when Justice Kagan proposed, asked, suggested she was going to ask you the question, I guess I a.m., I did not think -- I did not think you agreed with the Petitioner because I think the Petitioner is saying very strongly intent to deceive is not enough.  And I understand you to say that it is.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What's missing?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What does the -- do they have to have the intent to deprive the bank of property?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  I just want to clear up that it is not enough to deceive a bank, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, not of course, since that's what you said.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then if that's the case, then it all comes down to the instruction, deceive, cheat or deprive a financial institution of something of value. Because you -- as I understand your position as clarified, you do have to have the intent to deprive a financial institution of something of value.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Well, then it's all a question of whether ""deceive"" and ""cheat"" stand alone, or if they are also modified by ""of something of value.""   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The enduring consequence to Mr. Shaw is a little bit different, so --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but you've kind of -- instruction, you do read it in context, but if I read instruction 18 in the context of 21, it kind of highlights that you have deceive or cheat separate from the deprivation of something of value. So linguistically, you have to say that what they meant in the instructions was somebody who intends to deceive a financial institution of something of value.  And that's just not grammatical.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And so in 18, sales deceive, cheat or deprive a financial institution of something of value.  ""Something of value"" goes right along with ""deprive,"" but it doesn't go along with ""deceive.""   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not if they -- not if they -- not if they read instruction 21, which talks -- has nothing to do with -- it just says intent to deceive or cheat, nothing of something of value.  And when you quote the instruction on page 46 to make it read, to make it make sense, you have to add in, as you do, after deceive, deceive the bank out of something of value --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- Because it makes no sense to say deceive of something of value.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's just not the instruction.  It's what the court of appeals held.  The court of appeals held, in short -- this is a quote -- ""The defendant was guilty of bank fraud because he intended to deceive the bank."" Full stop.  So it's not just a problem with the instructions.  It's a problem with what the court of appeals held.   INTERRUPTING ",15-5991

Roberts, Jr.  No, I don't think that's fair.  Once we decide race -- this is not an equal protection case; it's a Sixth Amendment case.  So a recent invocation of race is an impermissible -- impermissible enough, I guess, that we will pierce the jury confidentiality.  Well, the next case is going to be religion.  So whatever we say on race is going to have to have either a limiting principle that makes sense, or it's going to open up a broad category of cases.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You think it's odious to have the same sort of discrimination against someone because he's a Muslim or practices Islamic faith? You're saying, he's a Muslim.  Of course, you know, given this, I know how Muslims behave; he committed this crime.  Is that not sufficiently like racial discrimination that it should be carved out?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Somebody gives, you know, a bigoted speech in the jury room about sexual orientation and how particular types of people are more likely to commit crimes like the one before them? Is that sufficiently odious?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  It's not just alleged bias.  It's bias based on innate characteristics of the offensive remarks.  But the question is: What is most likely to -- or a significant risk of depriving the defendant of a fair trial? And it seems to me there are statements that have nothing to do with race or gender or sexual orientation or anything that might have a far greater impact.  And I'm wondering why we -- we don't allow impeachment of the jury verdict in those cases? Someone, I don't know, comes in and says, I know that witness.  That witness lies all the time. Believe me, you can't take anything he says.  I mean that, in a certain -- in a particular case, could have a greater impact. So why don't we allow impeachment of the jury processes in that case?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you think the entire body of law that we have developed in connection with racial discrimination or the Equal Protection Clause is the issue and apply that to your case? For example, here, you have a very obviously offensive and direct appeal to -- to race.  What if it's, oh, you know, he's from that neighborhood; I know people from that -- people from that neighborhood always commit crimes like this. Now, obviously, that could well be challenged as based on race, or -- I mean, is that also, do you impeach the jury's -- the secrecy of the jury proceedings for something like that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is it that the proceeding that you would have, I mean, if we accept your proposal and -- and interview the jurors, subject them to the -- what do you -- what do you ask them?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  But the facts are as alleged here, I guess.  What do you do once you have that in -- in the record? What's next?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if the other jurors come in and they testify, there's testimony and everybody says, yes, that's what he said, and they say, well, what would you -- but of course the guy was guilty, no doubt about it, and the other 11 said, of course he was guilty, it was very offensive what, you know, HC or whatever it was said, but, of course, he was guilty.  Everybody -- we agreed to -- you know, in five minutes.  Does that make a difference?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yarger.     Frederick R. Yarger  Certainly, that might be true at the time the common law rule was announced.  But Rule 606(b) was debated and adopted in the 1970s recently.  And since that time, no rule maker has decided to draw lines within the rule based on the subject matter of the misconduct of the juror. And I think that reflects the tension that we were talking about earlier, which is it doesn't matter what kind of bias arises in the course of proceedings.  All of it has significant Sixth Amendment concerns for individual defendants.  And drawing the right lines only as to racial bias, but to no other type of misconduct, would disserve the rule and wouldn't give an adequate reason not to draw further lines down the road.  And I think that would lead to the constitutionalization of the most permissive form of the rule, the Iowa rule, which this Court and Congress and the vast majority of States have rejected. Your Honors, if there are no further questions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kovner.     Rachel P. Kovner  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Racial bias is a real problem that the United States is committed to eradicating.  But there are ways to address that problem without undermining structural protections of the jury system that have withstood legal challenges for hundreds of years. I take Petitioner's principal submission here to be that a different rule should apply under the Sixth Amendment when a particular form of bias is at issue.  And I just want to take a moment to underscore how that's really without foundation in this Court's cases.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Fisher.

It may be a good time to alert people who have this bias not to talk about it.  It seems to me that's a very hard thing to measure, this sort of bias.  And, I mean, one question, I guess, is whether impeaching the verdict in this way will cause people with biases like that to keep quiet about it and yet still have the same sort of pernicious effect on the verdict.

I mean a -- social acquaintances, you know, that people say we're all going away for the weekend, why don't you join us? I can't, I'm working on this Google thing, or something like that, and it means something to the other people.  You wouldn't call that a gift.  You'd call it a social interchange.  And maybe it's, you know, something he should have been more careful about saying, but it's quite different than a gift.  And it seems to me that, however you read Dirks, it certainly doesn't go beyond gifts.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So then the social -- casual social interchange I -- I hypothesized would not be covered under your interpretation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's hazy -- it's kind of a hazy line to draw, isn't it, between something that you characterize as a gift and something that would be characterized as social interaction, isn't it?

Is there any area that something falls in the middle of that, that it's -- it's not for a corporate purpose, but it also doesn't qualify for a personal benefit. Whenever you're talking about how you define personal gain/personal benefit, you say this was given -- not given to him for a corporate purpose. Is it an exact parallel?   INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben.     Michael R. Dreeben  We are most certainly, Justice Ginsburg, not raising procedural default in this case. I was meaning to refer generically to the category of procedural issues along the lines that Justice Alito mentioned that should remain open for consideration below.  But the United States is -- has waived procedural default in this case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Walker.     Helgi C. Walker  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the 25 years since Teague was decided, this Court has never held that a new rule based on the central procedural guarantees of the due process clause, in either the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment, nonetheless constituted a substantive rule that could apply to overturn final criminal judgments. You should not do so for the first time here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what procedures would allow somebody to be convicted under the residual clause? If it's a procedural protection, there must be some procedures that would allow people to be convicted.  What are they?   Helgi C. Walker  Absolutely.  What Johnson required was the use of a framework that specified the nature of the inquiry to be conducted and the kinds of factors to be considered. And the fact that Congress can go back and fix the problem with residual clause, as members of this Court have pointed out, and as my friends on the other side concede, only shows that Johnson did not, quote, deprive -- that's the language of Montgomery, that's the language of Penry -- did not deprive Congress of any substantive power, if you will, to impose 15-year sentences. The problem in Johnson was not that something was wrong with 15-year mandatory minimums, per se, but just that Congress hadn't articulated its -- its statutory goal in sufficiently precise terms.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the procedural protection is that Congress can change the law?   Helgi C. Walker  The procedural protection is the right to fair notice and an avoidance of the risk of arbitrary enforcement.  Those are the two prongs of the void-for-vagueness doctrine.  And those have always been understood to come under the procedural due process component. Johnson was based on the Fifth Amendment. So there are essentially only two options here, Mr. Chief Justice.  Johnson was either founded on the procedural component of the due process clause, or it was founded on the substantive component.  And I think that if you read fairly, Johnson, from beginning to end, you'll not see any substantive concern.  The concern is the underlying conduct was somehow constitutionally protected, which --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's a --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Please.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How -- my understanding is that it's properly categorized as procedural if there's some people who could be convicted under it legitimately; in other words, Miranda -- you didn't get Miranda warnings, but you know, you were a criminal law professor, you knew what your rights were. But who is it who could be convicted legitimately under the residual clause? We're sure, yes, okay, it's -- it's vague, whatever, but you are definitely covered, so you shouldn't get the protection of what you would regard as a procedural flaw.   Helgi C. Walker  We certainly agree that Johnson invalidated the residual clause, and therefore, to answer your question, Mr. Chief Justice, nobody can be sentenced under the residual clause going forward, and the residual -- anybody that was sentenced under the residual clause would get the benefit of that new rule on direct appeal. But the question that Teague asks is whether that remedy should be available on collateral review. And the answer to that depends upon -- and this was reaffirmed just two months ago in Montgomery -- the existence of a substantive procedural guarantee.  Once we cut the analysis loose, subs procedure under Teague's first exception, cut it loose from the underlying constitutional basis for the rule, we're going to be entirely at sea.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I -- but my understanding is that the characterization of that as procedural, it turns on whether or not there is a significant group of people who could be convicted under that provision where vagueness would be off the table. Now, however, it may appear to other people engaging in this type of conduct.  Maybe it's vague for them, but for this group of people, that's not vague. So we're not worried about not applying it retroactively.   Helgi C. Walker  But we can't know that about everybody that was sentenced under residual clause.  And yet, holding Johnson retroactive would give relief to everybody categorically that was sentenced under residual clause.  Any --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  Including -- including some people you think it shouldn't be applied to.   Helgi C. Walker  Absolutely.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So who shouldn't the residual clause apply to?   Helgi C. Walker  Well, for instance, let's take the Petitioner in this case, Mr. Welch.  His sentence was correct under the residual clause at the time it became final, which is what Justice Harlan said we should be looking at.  But even today, Mr. Chief Justice, his sentence is plainly correct under the elements clause, Florida law has made clear since 1922.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what I'm talking about, the residual clause.   Helgi C. Walker  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess what I'm trying to ask you is who are the people who you can say, without a doubt, their conduct otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury?   Helgi C. Walker  The people who committed the crimes that were at issue in this Court's decisions in James and Sykes, the people who had engaged in vehicular flight, and the second crime is now escaping.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The problem in Johnson, I think we took a look back and said, yeah, well, we did say that, but I have to think Johnson suggests that those decisions were not clear.   Helgi C. Walker  Certainly Johnson overruled those decisions with respect to the vagueness holding, but this Court itself said that people who engaged in those two particular crimes were entirely correctly sentenced under the residual clause.  The Court actually didn't say that that itself was wrong. And what's interesting about void-for-vagueness doctrine, and Johnson in particular, is that it took 30 years for the vagueness of the residual clause, the hopeless indeterminacy of it, to materialize.  That's all the more reason not to pretend as if the residual clause never existed at all, as my friends would have us do under the nineteenth century Blackstonian.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you would go back and say that we think that vehicular homicide is conduct that -- today, with the benefit of the analysis in Johnson -- I mean, assuming we were wrong in those cases, which I think Johnson suggests or said, that nonetheless it's clear that those people, the vehicular homicide people, we shouldn't be concerned about applying this -- not applying this retroactively because they, and other -- and other category clearly are covered by it. In other words, put aside our cases where I think -- I understand your argument, well, we decided that, but I -- I think Johnson suggests we decided it wrongly.   Helgi C. Walker  Right.  There's -- there's other -- other kinds of crimes --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   Helgi C. Walker  I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. There's other --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What's another example?   Helgi C. Walker  Other kinds of crimes that have been found by the lower courts to count are attempted rape, child molestation, assault with intent to kill.  I think all of those crimes would fall within the heartland of the residual clause without a whole lot of debate. But the point, again, is that we need to go back to the existence of a substantive constitutional guarantee.  The reason why we are here in a sentencing case is because Penry extended Teague into the sentencing context by reasoning that Justice Harlan had spoken of, quote, substantive categorical guarantees accorded by the Constitution.  Nobody in this case has even attempted to fit Johnson within that core of Justice Harlan's theory. The cases that Justice Harlan cited in Footnote 7 of Mackey, that famous opinion, those cases, those conducts immunizing decisions of this Court, like Griswold, Stanley, Street, and Loving, the other side does not even mention those cases in their briefs.  I think that shows just how far Johnson retroactivity would be from anything that Justice Harlan ever intended. If the Court has no further questions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel.   Helgi C. Walker  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Ali, you have six minutes remaining.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah.

What -- what is the nature of that legislative history?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, I -- where is that? In -- in the -- in the -- a Senate Report? What?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Harrington.     Sarah E. Harrington  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start, if I could, with Justice Kagan's last question, which is: What would we like the Court to hold in this case? We think the Court should hold that a bankruptcy court can never resolve a bankruptcy by ordering the distribution of estate assets in a manner that violates the Code's detailed priority system without the consent of the impaired priority claimholder.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You don't even have the extraordinary circumstances exception?   Sarah E. Harrington  No, we don't -- I mean, basically, the extraordinary circumstances exception that the Third Circuit wanted to apply would bring in any case that is administratively insolvent, and that's a large proportion of business bankruptcies. That kind of exception also gives parties the -- the wrong incentive to make essentially self-serving assertions about what they would or would not do if the particular disposition that they desire is not approved.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you don't agree completely with Judge Scirica's dissent?   Sarah E. Harrington  We don't.  I mean, I would point out, again, that he is a -- he is a dissenter in this case, and so he -- even he didn't think that this case would -- would qualify, but we -- we don't think there is anything in the -- in the Code that would allow parties to override the priority claimholders' assertion of their rights. Now, it's important to keep in mind that Chapter 11 is very -- is very flexible.  It allows basically any type of plan to be confirmed if all the parties can agree on the terms of a plan.  That was the innovation in Chapter 11 in 1978.  It didn't exist in the Bankruptcy Act, and I think that sort of clearly expresses Congress' intent that parties, if they can come to an agreement that deviates from sort of the usual course, then they should do it and that that -- that agreement should be memorialized in a plan, not in some other disposition.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought they -- I thought they had a priority at the initial stage that required them to be paid the $6 million that you're talking about.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's, I think, where the -- the -- the issue comes down.  I mean, the reasonableness of your position is directly related to how extraordinary the extraordinary circumstances have to be. I mean, you're -- you're -- you're suggesting that the main criteria in approving under 363(b) is pretty much what the priorities are under -- under Chapter 11.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, if there is a very close requirement there, then, you know, what you're asking for is not that extraordinary.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If, however -- well, if, however, that -- it -- it's -- that priority simply informs the exercise of discretion by the judge under 363(b) and is not as tight a requirement, well, then, it's -- you know, then it is pretty extraordinary. And -- and it -- it makes a difference. Under -- under the -- the Chapter 11 regime, people's leverage in negotiating the plan depends to some extent on their priorities.  Under the -- the -- the settlement regime, it's, you know, the -- the leverage is reshuffled, and it's more or less who can gang up on who but who else.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  Could you answer my concerns?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right, but if we are concerned about --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If -- if we are concerned about how extraordinary the extraordinary circumstances are -- in other words, your position looks more reasonable the tighter the extraordinariness requirement is -- what -- what type of language would you require -- I mean, you're saying, oh, well, just say you can do this and then it will work out over time how extraordinary it is.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm -- I'm not quite sure I understand how you assess predominance, which I think is the challenge here. And to take a hypothetical, let's say you're trying to select people for a particular board or something; and you say they have to come from a city with more than 500,000 people, absolutely.  And then you say, and they have to come from such a city in California.  Can't be anywhere else. Now, which is the predominant factor? The 500,000 or California?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't really care -- I'm not talking about this case.  It's a hypothetical.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, how do you know that? I mean, it seems to me that the 500,000 is the criteria which -- to which all others might yield.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, no, I know. That's why I'm looking -- that's why this is called a hypothetical, because it's not about the particular case. But I -- I -- obviously, what I'm trying to highlight is, ""predominant"" means one that dominates over all the others.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And it's easy to imagine situations where you cannot say that one dominates over all the others.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what do you do in a situation like that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if you're still -- you're trying to figure out which -- which predominates.  And I think this is where the inquiry or the test that you challenge comes from. One way to tell which is the predominant is to see if they conflict.  And if they conflict, then how do you resolve it? And whatever trumps the other, that's the predominant one.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Uh-huh.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you're saying -- yeah.  So you're saying you do not need a conflict between traditional criteria and race?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But do you agree with the Solicitor General that say -- who says, nonetheless, that -- that -- quoting on page 8 of their brief -- in the vast majority of cases, a conflict may be necessary evidence to establish racial predominance?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, even if you're saying not in the vast majority, but in the majority, or -- why is that? Based on -- on your answer to Justice Kagan, why is it that you're almost -- almost always or vast majority for the SG, or something less than that in your --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's kind of --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I was going to say: It's kind of hard to do it just with respect to one, isn't it? Because that means, okay, you can't pull these voters in, so you've got to push them back, and now all of a sudden that other district has an issue.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gornstein.     Irving L. Gornstein  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The district court was right to hold that the use of a racial target is not sufficient to trigger strict scrutiny, but it was wrong to hold that a conflict with traditional redistricting principles is an essential element of a racial gerrymandering claim. On the use of a racial target, the Court's cases have drawn a distinction between the use of race as a factor and the predominant use of race in drawing district lines, and the use of a racial target shows that race was used.  But as the Court explained in Alabama, the -- when -- the critical question is whether it was predominantly used.  And as to that, evidence that a racial target is used is evidence, but not conclusive proof. To take one example that I think you asked for, if a district starts out 75 percent black voting age population before it's redistricted, and that's based on general demographic patterns, and then the target is set at ""don't drop below 50 percent,"" then it's just not the case that district lines that are then drawn to bring the district into compliance with one-person, one-vote are necessarily going to be based predominantly on race rather than traditional districting principles. And if a racial target was alone sufficient to trigger strict scrutiny, it would deprive the States of the flexibility that they need to comply with the Voting Rights Act.  So it's --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe I missed your -- you're saying, if it was 75, and it's down to 50, that does not necessarily mean --   Irving L. Gornstein  No, I -- I -- I did not say that.  I -- I said if the target was that it shouldn't go below 50, not that the target was it had to get to 50.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So it's at 75.  And they say, what we're going to do, we draw this as not yet below 50 --   Irving L. Gornstein  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And then they --   Irving L. Gornstein  And so they could end up anywhere between 70 and 50.  So it's just -- they could end up right at 70, or at 65, or at 60, or at wherever there is in between. So it's just not necessarily the case that the use of a target may have had little or nothing to -- a target that that's -- that's so low at 50 percent when you started up here at 75, then this -- the lines that you're drawing are probably likely to be drawn based predominantly on traditional districting factors.  It's just not necessarily the case that you're going to have to predominantly use race, because no matter what you do --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is it still the office's position that it would preferable to have the test that was adopted by the district court here, requiring a conflict before you find that race predominated?   Irving L. Gornstein  So putting aside the question of whether it would -- you would -- overruling the Court's --   Irving L. Gornstein  -- decisions, yes, except that we wouldn't want that to bleed over into racial vote dilution claims.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so your objection to the court below is that it required a conflict?   Irving L. Gornstein  Correct.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And in your brief, you say, in the vast majority, your words, of cases, you will need to show a conflict?   Irving L. Gornstein  Correct.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you think showing a conflict should be the correct legal standard, putting aside the decisions?   Irving L. Gornstein  Well, I wouldn't want to urge the Court to overrule its decisions in --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I know.  Putting those cases --   Irving L. Gornstein  -- those cases -- for that -- but putting aside, that is the position that we advocated in -- in -- or a version of it in Miller.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is it -- what is it -- what is it that you said?   Irving L. Gornstein  I think that what we said -- (Laughter.)   Irving L. Gornstein  I think what we said are two things. One, that there -- that simply because you use a racial target, you're not in strict scrutiny, and that's from Alabama; and, two, a conflict is not essential to prove a claim; but, three, there has to be pretty strong evidence besides just the use of the racial target to put you in strict scrutiny.  And so --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement.     Paul D. Clement  Well, I would put, representing the State Legislature of Virginia, my bona fides in looking out for the State's even ahead of Mr. Gornstein's.  And it's easy in the Solicitor General's Office to throw out a standard that's theoretically pure and that's going to force lots of other people to litigate for years. These districts were good enough for everybody for four years.  They were good enough to be pre-cleared by the Justice Department.  Having this detailed inquiry out there to have them invalidated years later does not seem to me to have a lot to recommend it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

Roberts, Jr.  And you say you can appeal that, even though it's not complete.  And then later on, you can appeal either the part that fills it in, or the whole thing.  It seems to me that usually if things are -- they're either final or not, and if they are not, you can't appeal; and if they are, you can.   John G.

It just seems to me we would be better served by a simple rule.

The restitution may be insignificant enough that you don't feel it's worth adding that to the appeal issues, any number of things. So I don't see how they know should we hold onto this or not hold onto it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  I know they can't.  Here, the question is whether you're going to add anything at all.  I mean, obviously, if the restitution amount hasn't been entered, you can't challenge the amount.  But they don't know in the court of appeals: Well, is he going to file another notice of appeal? I guess we have to hold this in abeyance.  And then you hold it in abeyance, and who knows for how long, because it doesn't actually have to be within the 90 days.  It just seems to me a very confusing system.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you've been talking about how it works, or how you think it should have, but not any statutory reasons.  You rely heavily on 4(b)(2), but it doesn't even seem to apply by its terms. It says, ""Notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision, sentence or order, but before the entry of judgment."" And that would not seem to apply to a situation here.  This wasn't before the entry of judgment, the appeal of the restitution part.  It was -- it was after.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but -- so you're saying the rule doesn't apply, what I understood to be the typical situation when it applies?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The court announces a decision, you file the -- the notice of appeal, and then they get around to entering it in a couple of days?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So he hasn't entered a judgment with respect to the amount of restitution.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But he also hasn't -- he also hasn't announced a decision, and this rule applies to a notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  With respect to the subsequent order, that -- nothing about the amount has been announced yet.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it's addressed specific instances, as you say, in which the issue may come up.  But it hasn't addressed your situation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So I -- and it's one of those arguments.  You're saying whenever they see it, they provide for it, but they haven't seen it yet, at least with respect to the drafting of the rule.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So maybe it doesn't apply in that situation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kedem.     Allon Kedem  I think, Justice Ginsburg, that would be inconsistent with the way the Court has conceived of its mandatory claim processing rules, in which it has said consistently that a party's failure to comply with such a rule, so long as it's invoked by the other side at the appropriate time, means that dismissal of the claim is mandatory.  You don't have a separate inquiry into prejudice. There are a number of Federal rules that include time limits.  And if a party's failure to comply with one of those time limits could be excused absent prejudice to the other side, then I think those time limits would no longer be mandatory in a -- in a meaningful sense. I think it's also inconsistent with another Federal rule that I would point out, which is Rule 3(a)(2), which you can find at page 6A of the appendix to the government's brief, which states, ""An appellant's failure to take any step, other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal, does not affect the validity of the appeal,"" which again suggests if you don't have a proper notice of appeal, you don't have a valid appeal. If the Court has no further questions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rashkind, you have three minutes remaining.     ",15-7250
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  The issue here strikes me as -- as somewhat similar to the issue that arises in the civil context with respect to attorneys' fees. You have a judgment and you're entitled to attorneys' fees because you've won, but of course they don't know what those are yet.  And then they have a hearing down the road. What is the rule there? One notice of appeal, two notices of appeal?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, the Peguero case, I -- do you read that as saying that if there is prejudice to the defendant who wasn't advised of his right to appeal, that defendant is entitled to collateral relief?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And I suppose the collateral relief is what, reopening the -- the case so that he can file a notice of appeal?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You said -- I'm not going to get the phrase right -- jurisdiction over all of the elements of the appeal, or something like that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  But I thought the basic rule was -- and your friend has emphasized this in his briefs -- that you get the case. You don't get different elements that may have been adjudicated or whatever.  If you're filing the appeal, the whole case goes up.   INTERRUPTING ",15-7250
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fletcher.     Brian H. Fletcher  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents two related questions about the scope of the remedy that's available for design-patent infringement under Section 289.  If I understood my friend Ms. Sullivan's presentation correctly, the parties are now in agreement about both of those legal questions. Just to summarize briefly, first, the court of appeals correctly held that Section 289's provision for an award of total profits means that the patent-holder can recover all of the profits from the sale of the infringing articles and manufacture and not just the portion of the profits that the patent-holder can prove was caused by or attributable to the design as opposed to other features of the article. But second, we read the court of appeals' opinion to have held that the relevant article of manufacture for which profits are owed is always the entire product that the infringer sells to customers. And we think that's a mistake, and we understand all parties to agree with that now. Instead, the relevant article of manufacture to which a patented design may be applied will sometimes be a part or a component of a larger product sold in commerce.  And when that is the case, all parties now agree that the patent-holder is entitled only to the profits from that infringing article and not to all --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, one of the things that was mentioned was cost in terms of that.  I don't understand how that helps on this question.  It would seem to me the higher the cost, the less it contributed to profits.   Brian H. Fletcher  So I think, Mr. Chief Justice, it will depend on the case.  Sometimes you -- you might try to build up the share of the profits from the bottom up by saying, what's the cost of each of these components, and then what share of the revenue is attributable to each of these components.  And then you say this component is 10 percent of the cost and 20 percent of the revenue, and we -- we do a bottom-up calculation and try to do it that way. Courts haven't always done that.  Sometimes that won't be feasible.  Sometimes instead they've -- they've done a more impressionistic approximation and said the total profits on this product are $10 million, and we think that the component at issue here, based on expert testimony, is responsible for a quarter or 25 percent.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you said based on expert testimony.  What would -- what would they be talking about?   Brian H. Fletcher  So I think the -- the Sheldon case that's cited on page 27 of our brief from this Court that was a Copyright Act case but discussed these problems sort of generally discussed how you apportion the portion -- the profits from a movie that are attributable to the script as opposed to the actors or the directors or other things.  And they had experts who were familiar with the industry and who said the script is important but, really, a lot of the value and particularly for a movie like this comes from other things. And there were various expert testimonies that gave varying percentages, and the Court ended up saying that the court below had awarded 20 percent of the total profits from the movie, and this Court affirmed that award and said that's a reasonable approximation. We're not -- never going to be able to get to certainty, but on these sorts of profits questions and these sorts of remedies questions, a reasonable approximation is good enough, and it's certainly better than awarding all or nothing.  And courts have been able to come to those reasonable approximations by using expert testimony in some of the ways that we've discussed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How is the Beetle put together? It's put together like every other car. I mean, I don't see how that's going to tell you whether the shape of the body is distinctive or not.   Brian H. Fletcher  Well, I think you'd also want to know, to put it in terms of all four factors, that the scope of the claim design covers the whole article, but not the interior of the car.  There are design features in the interior that the driver sees that aren't the body of the article. As to the second factor, how prominent is the design feature, I think that's one that cuts in favor of finding that the design does cover the whole article. Then the third one is conceptually distinct innovations, and I think that one cuts the other way. There are going to be lots of other features of the car or innovations in the car -- the engine, the steering system, things like that -- that's an area where you might want to hear adverse testimony.

Your question presented, though, focused only on one, which is that it prohibits the use of current medical standards and requires outdated medical standards.  And I think several of the other points you made are not encompassed within that question presented.  And maybe there are questions that should be looked at, but they don't seem to be covered by that. I mean, in what -- you mentioned the correspondence with clinical practices.  Has that changed? Did Texas similarly depart from clinical practices under the old standard as it is under the new?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But you got in the door by a question presented that is a little more eye-catching, which is that they prohibit the current standards and rely on the outdated one.  And that's all it says.  And I'm just wondering if you got yourself in the door with a -- with a dramatic question presented and are now going back to a concern that was just as present, as I understand your argument, under the old standards. .   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, then why didn't you say that? I mean, really, the question presented talks about a comparison between current and outdated, and it seems -- it's pretty dramatic to say you can't use current standards; you're only using outdated.  It's quite a different question, is -- you know, they used the Briseno standards and they shouldn't. You don't think they should have used the Briseno standards under the old medical standards, do you?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Sotomayor?   John G.

Sometimes it's because the dollar amount is small.  Sometimes it's because the -- we think that the relator is capable of handling the case himself, or the relator's counsel.  Sometimes we do decline to intervene, because we're skeptical of the merits of a case.  But even in those situations, it could be that we agree with the relator's theory and simply don't know whether the facts could be proved.  It comes in all variations. I -- our amicus brief is obviously the -- the best evidence of what we believe the correct legal rule to be.  The only other thing I would say is that our decisions about whether to intervene in particular cases would be skewed if we believed that courts would draw from our failure to intervene an adverse inference as to our views on the legal theory.  If we felt that we would be made to seem skeptical of the implied certification by not intervening, we'd feel pressured to do it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So is your -- is your position that every material breach of a contract gives rise to a False Claims Act -- a claim under the False Claims Act as false and fraudulent?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so if -- I know you've got another one, and I want to keep that in mind, but if it's a situation where the alleged material breach is of Massachusetts Regulation 185(Z)(3), (4), (8), (10), or whatever, you -- the claimant would have to show knowledge of that regulation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, I guess, I mean that --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That causes concern, of course, because there are thousands of pages of regulations under Medicaid or Medicare programs.  And I guess your -- your position would precipitate litigation over whether or not the person who said, here's our bill, knew about -- knew under the reckless and whatever standard, about the particular regulation that the government or the relator is claiming made the submission fraudulent?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I thought you said --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but I thought your point was the first thing is that the claimant has to know about it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It has to know about the particular requirement in the regulation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it has to know not only about the particular provision but that it was material and the government wouldn't pay without it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it's got to be -- he has to know about the specific provision in the regulation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So you think it's an easy case to prove, in other words, because they would have necessarily known that.  But what they have to know is of that regulation, whatever one of the 28 it is, and they have to know that the government will regard that as material.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I suspect most cases are a little more complicated than that, and that's where the difficulty comes in when you have hundreds, thousands of pages of regulations.  And typically not -- probably not the government.  They didn't in this case. They didn't pick up the -- the false claim; it was the relator.  And the relator comes in and says, well, you didn't -- you violated the provision, not that the college intern is a doctor, but that -- whatever it is. You know, you have to use this particular syringes or drug company, and, in fact, you didn't.  And, therefore, blah, blah, blah. And I guess that's where the problem comes in, in that it's a little more complicated than that. And I just don't know if I can take your abstract hypothetical and transfer it to the reality of government contract.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it will, because it changes the reality.  They're going to look at that, and they're going to say, wow.  Every single thing we're going to get in trouble in a False Claims Act.  So our bid is going to be a little bit higher to cover that potential risk.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do you tell -- Mr. Stewart, because at least under Mr. Frederick's view you have to have knowledge that the government wouldn't pay.  I assume the government wouldn't pay even for nonmaterial provisions. I mean, if you're supposed to pay -- you know, for $100,000 you're going to provide these services, and you don't provide small service? You still pay, but you wouldn't pay for that.  I mean, I don't understand that, how some things are material -- does it go pay at all, or -- or carve out a particular provision? When -- when is the government -- when is there going to be not performance of a contract and the government's going to pay for that anyway?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So the contract is to provide all these health services, and by the way, you've got to buy, you know, staplers made in the United States, not -- not abroad.  And they do everything, but they don't buy staplers made in the United States. I would say the government, if they're, you know, rigorous contracting officers, would say okay, you get, you know, 99,000 whatever, but we're going to penalize you because you didn't use staplers -- we put that in there for a reason, you didn't do it, so we're going to withhold $100, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not -- if that would be --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- a false claim --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- and then they could bring -- and a relator can sue for that, then I don't understand the difference between material and immaterial.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  Just -- all it means is?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Withhold payment, but not repudiate the contract.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, if they don't -- if they put the wrong billing code down, and, you know, you shouldn't have to pay them.  But I don't know that means you can say, okay, you're fired as our Medicare provider in the State of Massachusetts, which is what I understand materiality in the contract concept to be. But what you're saying is it's a false claim if it's -- and, you know, you said you were providing X-rays and you didn't.  Okay.  But -- and that's material, I would think, in the sense that you have to pay for it.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  There's a tension in your -- your briefing over what you're really arguing for.  In the question presented, you focus on the Fifth Circuit standard for a COA in saying they're imposing an improper and unduly burdensome.  But most of the briefing, and as you sort of begun today, is really focused on the underlying merits of the case.  And you sort of have to make a choice, don't you, because if we didn't focus on the merits and rule in your favor, we don't get to say too much about the threshold for Certificate of Appealability.  Well, if we focus on the Certificate of Appealability, all we're saying on the merits is there's a substantial showing.  So what do you want us to do, on the merits or on the Certificate of Appealability?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  Right.  So is that what you want us to say, that because the merits are debatable, he should have gotten a Certificate of Appealability? Or do you want us to say, well, he should have won, and so he obviously should have gotten a Certificate of Appealability?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So on the merits -- on the merits then, you just want us to say, oh, reasonable jurists could disagree about whether or not he was unconstitutionally sentenced?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the -- the -- the answer to Justice Alito is that in our opinion, we should say our interpretation of Rule 60B, in case it doesn't apply unless it's a capital case? Rule 60B doesn't draw that distinction.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The risk of injustice, if it was a sentence for ten years, that's unjust.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So that doesn't work.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What else?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I guess the same answer there.  Sentenced to 40 years, that impairs the integrity of the system.  I mean, I know that obviously, death is different.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it's hard to factor in why it's different in the context of interpreting particular rules.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  To the -- to the extent it is a unique case, it really doesn't provide a basis for us to say anything at all about how the Fifth Circuit approaches Certificates of Appealability, does it? It's a unique case, so this would be an odd platform to issue general rules. But in the brief you say, well, the Fifth Circuit grants these in a very small percentage of cases.  The other circuits are much higher. But if it is so unique, I don't know how we can use it to articulate general rules.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Was it wrong? Was it wrong for the court of appeals to conduct the merits inquiry in this case? I mean, they went to considerable length in trying to determine whether or not the claims were valid. Was that an error? Should they have just said, well, you know, the -- the test is what, substantial -- showing a substantial -- a substantial showing of denial? They should have just done, you know, kind of a sort of quick-and-dirty peek at the merits and say, yeah, there might be something there.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So did they err in looking at it more closely?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So should our decision be just that, they erred in looking at the merits? They should have just issued a Certificate of Appealability and sent it back? That's not what you want, is it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it seems to me we're well beyond a COA should issue.  You don't want us to say that.  You want us to say that there's been a constitutional violation in this case and the court of appeals was wrong in determining that there wasn't.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So what is the test you -- should we say the Fifth Circuit should apply in considering whether to issue Certificates of Appealability? Do you have anything to add to the statutory language?   ",15-8049
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I assume the facts -- I assume the facts in the other Saldano cases are similarly heinous, the ones where the state determined that nonetheless that there was a risk that they would be sentenced to death because of their race. And I don't understand -- I understand the procedural differences in this case, but I don't understand why that ultimate conclusion doesn't apply here as well.  In other words, regardless of whether the evidence was admitted by the prosecution or by the defense, it would seem to me that the same concern would be present.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not sure how the quickness of the determination helps you at all, when one response would be, well, they had this evidence that he was, by virtue of his race, likely to be dangerous, so they didn't spend that much time on it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand your arguments on the merits, but do they apply equally to the Certificate of Appealability? I mean, you argue that you should prevail on the merits.  But the question on a Certificate of Appealability is whether there's been a substantial showing of denial of a constitutional right. Assuming you haven't already seen the analysis on the merits and you're looking at this question for the first time before going through this analysis, wouldn't it seem pretty straightforward to say, okay, maybe he's right, maybe he's wrong, but at least he's made a substantial showing.  Let's give him a Certificate of Appealability, and then we'll go through the normal procedures on the merits?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that gets tougher and tougher.  I mean, you're talking about reasonable jurists debate.  Okay.  That's -- that's a very low threshold.  But when you say reasonable jurists debate, whether there's been an abuse of discretion, I mean, abuse of discretion gives a broad range to the district court.  And now you're asking, well, is there a reasonable person out there who could debate that you ought to have deferred to that exercise of discretion? It seems to me, yes, it's a different standard, but it's quite a different standard. And the broader question here is whether the Fifth Circuit applies the wrong standard on a Certificate of Appealability, and it seems to me that if you're going to say, particularly when you are reviewing an abuse of discretion standard, that you're going to be able to look at and say, no, no, there's nothing substantial here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You know, I guess my question kind of cuts the other way.  I'm saying they don't -- yes, and you make the point, there was a substantial amount of process.  There was a long consideration.  There was a lot of briefing.  I would have thought the purpose of a Certificate of Appealability would be to make the decision to move forward without all that elaborate process?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So is your suggestion that they deny more because they've taken up more search and look at the merits than the other circuits?   INTERRUPTING ",15-8049
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it also -- it also didn't appear anywhere in the original petition, did it? I'm looking at Footnote 8 in your -- your opening brief where you note that substantial educational benefit was the standard that was discussed in the petition and then a significantly different one in your -- your opening brief.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that raises a concern under the Spending Clause.  I mean, the Spending Clause operations are pretty clear.  The Federal government proposes a deal to the States.  If the States want the money, they have to agree to these provisions. And now you're saying that the content of those provisions, though, is changed by new legislation. And I just wonder whether that puts some strain on the idea that the States have agreed to these provisions when they accepted the offer under the Spending Clause.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How does that work?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  How does that work with students whose disabilities generally wouldn't allow them in -- in their own -- with their own potential to follow the general educational curriculum? I understand how it worked in Rowley --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- where we were dealing with someone with a particular disability, but one that was rather readily and easily addressed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Here you have a very different context.  I mean, you would not say that the goal here, would you, was to progress consistent with the general educational curriculum?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gornstein.     Irving L. Gornstein  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The requirement of a free appropriate public education is not satisfied by the program that aims at barely more than de minimis progress.  What it requires instead is a program that is aimed at significant educational progress in light of the child's circumstances.  What that --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We're talking about somebody for whom I think you'd agree that that standard doesn't apply.   Irving L. Gornstein  Right.  And so that is where we have a slight area of disagreement.  We would say significant progress towards grade-level standards, not as close as possible to grade-level standards.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So how does that actually work in -- in practice? I mean, I understand in the Rowley standard, you're dealing with someone who has a disability that is readily addressed so that they can keep track with grade progress.  But if you're out of that realm where that is not a realistic goal in light of the child's potential, how do you decide what it is? You're sitting -- you're sitting down at the meeting, and how do you decide --   Irving L. Gornstein  All right.  So you -- what the -- the IEP provisions tell you where to start.  You look at the -- where the child currently is in terms of academic performance, what are their present levels of achievement.  Then you examine the disability and you ask to what extent has this impeding progress in the general curriculum.  And then what you do is you basically make an estimate --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is there somebody at that meeting? I mean, you have the parents --   Irving L. Gornstein  You have expert -- you have educational experts who will say, make an estimate of how much progress towards grade level standards that child can make in light of where they are now and the -- the nature of the disability.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe there's still time to grade level standards.  I would think in many situations those would largely be irrelevant.   Irving L. Gornstein  So here's what we mean by that, Mr. Chief Justice.  You start with the grade level standards, but then you see the building blocks that are missing underneath those grade level standards, and you set those out.  So if you can't multiply and you can't add, and multiplication is the standard, maybe you need to learn how to add first.  So you set forth what are the building blocks that the child is missing.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Everybody -- I say everybody.  I assume everybody needs to learn how to add before they learn how to multiply. And -- and the basis of my concern is that it seems to me that even though you have a lot of -- maybe because you have a lot of different adjectives to describe the standard, that there's really nothing concrete there.  And when you're asking the courts to undertake judicial review, it's not clear to me exactly what they're supposed to do.   Irving L. Gornstein  So -- so again, it's appropriate in light of the circumstances.  And we think that this is just what most school boards are already doing.  And I agree that the concern is with court enforcement of the standard, and the risk of court over-involvement in educational decisions.  But the response to is that is not to adopt a barely more than de minimis standard that nobody purports to apply, but it's to say that the court's role is limited to ensuring that the State's program for progress or appropriate progress is based on reasonable educational judgments.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal.     Neal Kumar Katyal  Well, I think that it came directly from the circuits right after Rowley.  But all we are saying is ""some benefit"" means the more than de minimis test.  That's the way court after court has interpreted it.  It's worked well.  This Court shouldn't renege on that.   John G.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  And it makes a difference.  And I -- one reason I think that it -- it's problematic for you is because Rowley just doesn't say ""some benefit."" It tells you what it is.  And it's enough benefit to keep track with grade progress.  And if that's what the standard is, that's certainly more than -- you know, slightly more than de minimis. And, now, obviously, we -- we -- you can't take that actual substantive standard and apply it in a case such as this, but it does seem to indicate that there is a substantive standard and it's not just some benefit.

And that's it.  And that's all they do.  That's some benefit.  Better to have the person there for two weeks than not at all, but you wouldn't say that satisfies the statute.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So -- and just change the hypothetical.  She's there five minutes a day.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I guess it depends on whether somebody can tell us at some point whether it's beneficial.  And yet, I think most people would agree that it -- well, I mean, are you saying that the -- the judicial review is supposed to be whether that's de minimis or more than de minimis, and they're supposed to say, well, a half hour is -- is -- is good, it's not de minimis, but that's all you have to do?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, but you're putting a lot -- you're assuming that the procedural process will yield significant results.  What if they do the whole thing? Yeah, we have a hearing.  Everybody comes in.  We bring the expert in and the expert says, well, you need to have somebody there six hours of the day to help the child learn, and they say, okay, that's -- that's the procedure, we listen to you.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't know why -- I don't know why you run away from the proposition that less is better.  I would have thought that's central to your argument, and it's not.  It sounds bad, but it's not.  I mean, maybe less was going to be more susceptible to another challenge, like it's arbitrary. But you can see that it's not a vagueness problem.  I mean, if you -- you know, the coin toss proposition, if you say the sentence will be decided by a coin toss, it's not vague.  Everybody knows exactly what's going to happen.  But it might be arbitrary. So in that case less would be better.  If you did not have the provision about a coin toss, which narrows the uncertainty, then that would be better.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Jay  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Feigin.     Eric J. Feigin  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about the reproduction of two-dimensional artwork on a useful article.  The question here is fundamentally indistinguishable from the tuxedo shirt that my friend conceded would retain copyright protection, or putting a sports team logo on a T-Shirt that identifies somebody as a team member or a fan.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Or putting camouflage on a military uniform?   Eric J. Feigin  So, Your Honor, camouflage has been protected by copyright for decades.  The Copyright Office's practices on that reflect the view that camouflage is generally eligible, at least for a very thin copyright, in the creative elements of a particular camouflage pattern that aren't dictated by the underlying ideas and scientific principles that make it work.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  As applied to a military uniform.   Eric J. Feigin  So as applied to a military uniform, if someone were asserting a copyright in camouflage in such a manner as to prevent the manufacturer of a uniform from actually manufacturing a uniform that would perform a concealment function, and if concealment were, as Justice Kagan was positing, considered to be separate from the sorts of expressive functions that are traditionally protective by copyright --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  All of which --   Eric J. Feigin  -- then there might infringement --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- suggest the answer was yes; right?   Eric J. Feigin  Then there might be some infringement defenses that would apply in that context. But what I think the dispute in this case is really boiling down to is a question of what the utilitarian aspects of the ""useful article"" are.  And I think there are two the Petitioner's identifying: One is conveying the information that someone is a cheerleader, identifying someone as a cheerleader; and the other is affecting the viewer's perception of the wearer's appearance.  And I'd like to just explain overall --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The whole point of the case is we're not just talking about two-dimensional artwork.  We're talking about two-dimensional artwork applied to a -- the fabric in a way that conveys a utilitarian function.  It's not just -- your friend concedes that if you want to put a picture of this on a lunchbox or whatever that you have a copyright in that. It's only when you apply it to a garment -- because it is what makes that garment a cheerleading outfit as opposed to somebody else; it serves that utilitarian function -- that you don't have a copyright.   Eric J. Feigin  Your Honor, I think our fundamental disagreement is whether this is actually performing utilitarian functions.  If I could just --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure.   Eric J. Feigin  -- finish my response. And I think one -- I think one problem with the approach you've just articulated is it really divorces Section 101 and 113(a) because you could get a copyright in the illustration, and then he would say it's not copyrightable in certain applications, and that doesn't make much sense.

This is a special design that things are curved one way or another that nobody else had thought of.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, can it be -- can it be reproduced on a military uniform?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if you take them off the useful article, you have whatever color the fabric is, a white dress.  If you look at somebody in the white dress, you don't say, oh, that's a cheerleader.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  From the 1950s.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your friend on the other side concedes that those could be copyrighted.  If you take the design of a particular cheerleading uniform and put it on the lunchbox or the computer cover, yes, those can be copyrighted.  But because it is the design that makes the dress a cheerleading uniform, you can't separate -- you can't copyright the design applied to that functional article.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think you're avoiding the question.  Yes, you can have a copyright in the pattern; and, yes, you can attach it to a useful article like a lunchbox that's going to have a design. But the question is when the design is what makes that useful article what it is -- the design on a lunchbox doesn't make the lunchbox a lunchbox.  It's still a lunchbox.  But the design on a cheerleading uniform is what makes it a cheerleading uniform, as opposed to a plain dress.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if you -- I understand you are resisting the premise as applied to your case.  But is that right as a general test, that if it is the design that makes the article what it is in its utilitarian aspect, that that cannot be copyrighted?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the House report is not the law, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you're saying that the cheerleading uniforms do not serve a utilitarian purpose?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Your -- the argument is not that it makes the room or whatever look better. The argument here is the design makes this look like a cheerleader uniform, which is different and distinctive function in -- than a normal dress.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not simply to cover the body.  It's to convey a particular message. It shows that you're a member of the cheerleading squad and --   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  We don't doubt that if the -- the mandatory minimums were out of the picture and all we had was the underlying offense here, that this sentence would be reversed on appeal, do you?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'll pick up Justice Alito's question, then. Is there any indication that Congress was aware of those court of appeals decisions?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How -- how does that normally work, not in a mandatory minimum way, but if you've got three different offenses and -- and you're going to be sentenced on each of them? On appellate review, how is that reviewed? Is it the total sentence or do they go by one -- one, two, and three and say, we think you abused your discretion in only giving, you know, five months for this and then that doesn't affect the three years you gave for that.  How -- how does that actually happen?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Yang.     Anthony A. Yang  And -- and that's why, you know, when you have a predicate offense that Congress said add this additional mandatory on, you don't look to the length of the total, because maybe -- maybe 30 years, in the judge's view, is not reasonable, but Congress required that. That is a separate -- that is for Congress to decide what the minimum is going to be for the 924(c)  What would be reasonable is when you take a look at the predicate offense and you say would this be a reasonable -- one day for four felonies, would that be reasonable? And the answer to that is of course not, as -- as my brother conceded at -- in his argument. So, again, I think the whole -- the idea that a judge would go down to one day because of a disagreement with the length of the mandatory minimum simply circumvents the statute and is inconsistent with 924(c)'s text.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  It -- it would circumvent it.  On the other hand, it seems to me that if you're talking about 30 years for an offense that a judge thinks merits a lot less, if Congress wanted to prevent circumvention, they should have written the law a lot more carefully.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not sure -- I'm not sure ""sufficiently clear"" is enough.  I think maybe ""indisputably clear."" I mean, in your -- in your brief you quote, to be fair, that -- that this is contrary to the thrust of 924(c), and I'm not sure when you're talking about this amount of punishment a -- a thrust is enough.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Congress doesn't pass thrusts, they pass language, and there's nothing in the language that prevents the judge from imposing a sentence recognizing that the defendant faces 30 years already.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know what you're quoting.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm -- I'm going to let you get back to a fuller answer to Justice Breyer. But that certainly cuts against you, the idea that they recognize that, yes, you do have to look to the mandatory minimums.  You should take that into account in imposing the sentence.  And now you say when it gets down to what the actual sentence is, you can't look at the mandatory minimums at all.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you think the case is resolved at a higher level, it seems to me that your -- your friend has a very good technical argument that says these sentences have to run concurrently.  One day, they run concurrently, end of case. And your argument is, you know, you look at the drafting history, the commentary to 2K2.4, all the other arguments you got and you make -- make -- and the basic one is well, that's technically correct, but it's obviously not what Congress had in mind.  Congress obviously had in mind adding the mandatory onto a normal sentence, one way or another, under -- under the guidelines in 30 and all the provisions we've been talking about. So if you view the case that way, technically correct, you know, contrary to the obvious policy, what -- what case can you give me that tells us how to approach a conflict like that?   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  But I'm just suggesting that that's not certainly a total response.  Yes, you have to satisfy it, but as Justice Kennedy just suggested, there's also a cap.  And if the reason you can't satisfy it is because of the cap, well, that's just the way the statute has balanced the two obligations. But the initial obligation is to satisfy the -- the fees.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You say that the -- one way that the discretion of the district court would be guided would be by the seriousness of the offense, and you gave a couple of examples.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Wouldn't it normally in those cases result in a higher award of damages?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, this is -- it's -- it's a little different.  I understood the objective of Congress, in order to weed out non-meritorious suits, to be to replicate, to the extent they could, the -- the situation of private parties outside of prison. There, if you have a serious injury, you quite often can go to a lawyer who will charge you a contingent fee, say 25 percent, and whatever your recovery, you would owe him 25 percent of the -- of the judgment. And you wouldn't owe him only 2 percent just because the -- the judge in the case thought, well, you didn't do enough work or you could have done better.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, but they could --   John G.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's clearly -- it's clearly covered by Colorado's law.  It's not primarily religious.  It's primarily legal.  It's provided to all faiths. And there's nothing in the law that I can see that says it's limited to for-profit organizations.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so Catholic Legal Services would be put to the choice of either not providing any pro bono legal services or providing those services in connection with the same-sex marriage?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Under Colorado law, is that --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- are they or are they not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What facts do you need besides the ones I've given you?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They have all -- they have taken every other customer to date, except this is the first time someone's come in and wants legal services in connection with a same-sex marriage and they say we're not going to do it because, as a religious matter, we're opposed to same-sex marriage.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We've -- we've had this case before --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- in the context -- the context of courts, I think it's not just where you have a three-judge panel and it turns out one judge was -- should have been disqualified, whether -- for whatever reason, they don't say that, well, the vote, there were two still, so it doesn't change the result because it's a deliberative process, and the idea is, well, the one biased judge might have influenced the views of the other.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe you could answer --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- maybe you could Justice Alito's question.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does it make a difference, was -- was same-sex marriage permitted in Colorado at the time of these events?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does that make a difference?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Could he have said I'm not going to make a cake for, you know, celebrating events that aren't permitted in Colorado?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You have five -- five more minutes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If you want. (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cole.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not sure he provides equal services outside the context of wedding to -- weddings, to gay and lesbian individuals.  And the -- the racial analogy obviously is very compelling, but when the Court upheld same-sex marriage in Obergefell, it went out of its way to talk about the decent and honorable people who may have opposing views. And to immediately lump them in the same group as people who are opposed to equality in relations with respect to race, I'm not sure that takes full account of that -- of that concept in the Obergefell decision.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that a modification of --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that -- is that a modification of Smith? It sounds like -- it sounds like an overruling of Smith.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is your -- is your answer to my hypothetical about the religious legal services organization the same as Mr. Yarger's?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I just -- you're -- you're changing the hypothetical just -- just a little --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- I -- the services they offered was pro bono legal services --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- to people, whether it's wills or --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- contracts or landlord/tenant or anything at all.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So they would -- if someone had a problem in connection with their marriage, again, whatever it is, contract dispute, something like that, they would have to provide representative services to someone who had a similar problem in connection with a same-sex marriage?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But this is not only speech; it's providing the legal services.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I would say partly expressive conduct.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Perhaps that's a fairly small number of people compared to the situation where it is not terribly difficult for an assistant U.S. attorney to prove that something was done corruptly as opposed to willfully.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, but, I mean, I -- yes, but I think most people would think that the district court has a greater familiarity with the litigation, particularly since the court of appeals may know nothing about it until you get a notification, and understands how related the two cases are or how not related they are.  And maybe the ability to consolidate ought to continue to -- I mean, to keep the cases together, to the extent appropriate, ought to remain with the district court, rather than suddenly throwing the issue before a court of appeals that is new to the whole litigation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, the court of appeals might well have something to say about that.  The courts of appeals don't like to have matters just resting on their docket, depending upon matters of years before the district court might get to the other matter.   John G.

Our brief goes through all of these cases.  When you deal with all-purpose consolidation -- his split is about partial consolidation in general.  There's only three cases we have been able to find in the Sixth Circuit, two of which are unreported, that disagree with what every other circuit that we have been able to find that's ruled on this has found. So I think all we're saying to you is leave the rules where they are.  To the extent you're concerned about any, you know, problems with the rules, any problems with consolidation, I think the national rules committee is the place to be.

It's a -- it's an argument; it's not a separate claim.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Now you can get back to Justice Sotomayor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if it's just -- if it's -- if they're consolidated for all purposes, why did the district court enter separate judgments? Why didn't he wait and say, well, there's only going to be one judgment because these are all consolidated for all purposes, so I should wait until we're ready to have one judgment?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Katyal, I -- one thing that concerns me.  This is, for all the back and forth, a relatively simple case.  We're talking about two cases, same lawyers, same parties, but consolidation can come up in a situation and often does when there are 100 separate cases, a mass tort situation. And there, one waiting for the final judgment can be a very long wait and it could be very prejudicial.  I mean, let's say it's in some sort of mass tort and some of the people have, you know, emotional distress damages, others physical injury, and early on the judge says, look, I don't think you can recover emotional distress.  So all the cases that just have emotional distress, judgment is entered against them. Now let's go on to the other thing which is going to take five years.  Doesn't your position make that extremely complicated?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You -- you've mentioned that a couple times.  What -- what are we to make of the amicus brief by -- filed by seven retired federal judges? Do we imply that the other 280 don't agree with it or -- or -- (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I -- I don't quite know what to -- what to do with that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's the perspective of seven individuals.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but I -- I think the argument is pretty straightforward which you, in your district, have a right of association and you want to exercise that right of association with other people elsewhere in the state. And if you can't challenge the districting throughout the state, then your claim seems to be -- there's no way for to you to raise your claim.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Wait.  I'm sorry.  Certainly, voters in Milwaukee -- you left out the -- would not have standing?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Murphy.     Erin E. Murphy  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Plaintiffs have not identified a workable standard for determining when the inherently political task of districting becomes too political for the Constitution to tolerate. Indeed, the only thing Plaintiffs have added to the mix since LULAC is a wasted votes test that identifies court-drawn maps as enduring partisan gerrymanders and conveniently favors their own political party.   ",16-1161
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Maybe we can just talk briefly about the standing issue. It is a little arresting to have a rule that we establish that when your claim is racial gerrymandering, it has to be limited to your district, you can't complain about racial gerrymandering elsewhere in the state, but here, if the claim is going to be political gerrymandering, you can raise claims about whole statewide issues even if there is no argument that you're gerrymandered, like the first plaintiff who votes in Madison, his vote isn't diluted in any way, and yet he is able to complain about voting anywhere in the state.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about -- what about the sign hypothetical? You know, you're up in far north of Wisconsin and somebody is -- is taking down the signs for the one candidate in the far south. That affects that individual's -- the strength of his vote for the state-wide purposes.  Is he really have standing to complain about that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but that's equally stereotyping.  Sometimes people vote for a wide variety of reasons.  Maybe the candidate, although he's of a different party, is a -- is a friend, is a neighbor.  Maybe they think it's a good idea to have the representatives from their district to balance out what they view would be necessary -- likely candidates from other districts.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I don't think it's any more -- any less stereotypical to say that people are going to vote for parties because they support everything the party does statewide.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Smith -- do you have standing? Well, Justice Kagan?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Smith, I'm going to follow an example of one of my colleagues and lay out for you as concisely as I can what -- what is the main problem for me and give you an opportunity to address it. I would think if these -- if the claim is allowed to proceed, there will naturally be a lot of these claims raised around the country.  Politics is a very important driving force and those claims will be raised. And every one of them will come here for a decision on the merits.  These cases are not within our discretionary jurisdiction. They're the mandatory jurisdiction.  We will have to decide in every case whether the Democrats win or the Republicans win.  So it's going to be a problem here across the board. And if you're the intelligent man on the street and the Court issues a decision, and let's say, okay, the Democrats win, and that person will say: ""Well, why did the Democrats win?"" And the answer is going to be because EG was greater than 7 percent, where EG is the sigma of party X wasted votes minus the sigma of party Y wasted votes over the sigma of party X votes plus party Y votes. And the intelligent man on the street is going to say that's a bunch of baloney.  It must be because the Supreme Court preferred the Democrats over the Republicans.  And that's going to come out one case after another as these cases are brought in every state. And that is going to cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this Court in the eyes of the country.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It is just not, it seems, a palatable answer to say the ruling was based on the fact that EG was greater than 7 percent.  That doesn't sound like language in the Constitution.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, but you're going to take these -- the whole point is you're taking these issues away from democracy and you're throwing them into the courts pursuant to, and it may be simply my educational background, but I can only describe as sociological gobbledygook.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And if you need a convenient label for that approach, you can call it proportional representation, which has never been accepted as a political principle in the history of this country.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That sounds exactly like proportional representation to me.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  All of those predictions -- I mean, Bandemer predicted the Democrats would never be able to attain a majority.  It was 50/50 the next election, and they got a majority the one after that.  You already mentioned Vieth.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Geyser.     Daniel L. Geyser  He -- I think it just simply did not occur to him at the time.  And so -- and in the same way that he missed the limitations period for the Sarbanes-Oxley claim. What he tried to do was do the right thing, and to honor the corporate Code of Conduct by calling the -- the misconduct to his supervisor's attention, which again is exactly what all the corporate stakeholders, you know, in this proceeding have said is their goal, too. No one thinks it's better to have reports go directly to the SEC, unless the corporation is entirely unwilling to remediate and address the problem.  So, I -- again, it is consistent with the -- the natural, regulatory scheme in Sarbanes-Oxley; and Dodd-Frank is not passed in a vacuum.  Dodd-Frank is part -- and Sarbanes-Oxley work together.  They each amend provisions of the Exchange Act. So I -- I don't think it -- I think it's highly odd to say that in Dodd-Frank, Congress wanted to create a heavy incentive not to report internally, but in Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress was focused intently on internal reporting and especially internal reporting of lawyers and auditors. So, under my friend's reading, Dodd-Frank would leave those critical groups, the groups that this Court in Lawson versus FMR recognized were best equipped to spot and detect and prevent fraud, out of these critical protections after Congress recognized that Sarbanes-Oxley had been ineffective in getting lawyers and auditors and other employees to report internally. This is critical whistleblower protections, and we don't see any basis for carving those groups out of the statute. If the Court has no further questions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Michel. ORAL ARGUMENT of CHRISTOPHER G. MICHEL     Christopher G. Michel  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The statutory definition of whistleblower is tailor-made for the awards program, but it does not fit in the retaliation programs. Giving the term its ordinary meaning in the retaliation context would harmonize the statute and avoid the anomalies that would result from woodenly applying the statutory definition. Some of those anomalies have been discussed already by the Court.  But I do think the most drastic one is that applying the statutory definition, which requires reporting to the Commission, into clause (iii) of the retaliation provisions, which protects internal reporting, would decouple retaliation liability from the Act that causes the retaliation, and moreover, would make employers liable for conduct that they don't know about.  Now, that in our view would be a one of a kind retaliation provision in the U.S. Code.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but, I mean, it's not just that it's not absurd.  It seems to me if you look at Utility Air, it has to be -- not absurd or anomalous, whatever you want to say -- it has to be cut very broadly. I mean, if you get to a tiny little thing and you're saying, well, the definition doesn't work there, it's one thing to say, well, then we're not going to apply it to that provision. The cases where you're allowed to move beyond the defined term are when if you stick to it, it really makes a mess of the whole thing.   Christopher G. Michel  I agree, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think it's a pretty big mess that -- that the Petitioner's reading is -- is making here.  You know, in addition to the -- to the anomalies we've already discussed, I do think a very important one is that Petitioner's reading would eviscerate the incentive for internal reporting. Keep in mind, Petitioner wants to import the entire --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Certainly.   Christopher G.

McGuire  That's the question the Court granted certiorari on, Justice Ginsburg, but we understood the Court's precedent to mean that we can argue -- argue for an alternative basis for affirmance.  And here, from the reasons Justice Alito gave earlier, this case does not present an issue of ultimate fact that even if he could carry his burden and argue issue preclusion under Ashe, that would bar the second trial. Unless there are further questions, we'd ask the Court to affirm.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ross.     Erica L. Ross  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Double Jeopardy Clause provides defendants with a right against multiple trials for the same offense, but it does not protect a defendant from the consequences of his voluntary litigation choices. Whereas here, a defendant agrees to multiple trials on different charges in order to obtain a benefit, he cannot thereafter argue that his charges are, in fact, one offense for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure.   Erica L. Ross  So, if the defendant says I will not waive and I want separate trials, I think then the prosecution and the court would have to decide sort of what -- what happens going forward.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feldman.     James A. Feldman  Well, I mean, I -- I just would say: one is, that does happen sometimes.  Two, is another way to deal with this is to have fewer days worked and you can have longer hours.  There's many occupations that work that way.  You can -- you can share the work around.  You can give people time off in the middle of the day.  Okay? This dealership doesn't do any of those things. They -- it's a -- it's a 55-hour week. And that's exactly the purpose of the F -- these are people that come directly within the purposes of the FLSA.  And it's no coincidence that Congress didn't include them in the statute when it included salesmen, partsmen, and mechanics. Another -- I would say also that Petitioner's argument is primarily -- is that service advisors are salesmen.  And, actually, on page 5 of the reply brief, Petitioner says they're salesmen because they are principally involved in selling.  And that's what you would expect salesmen to do. But that does create a logical problem for Petitioner because, if you're principally involved in -- you can't be principally involved or it's hard to be principally involved in two different things, especially two things as different as selling and servicing. So, if they're principally involved in selling, which is what Petitioner says makes them a salesman, and I think what would make them a salesman if they were, then it's -- it's impossible to say that they're -- then it's hard to turn around and say: No, no, they're principally engaged in servicing. The -- the two categories are distinct in the statute.  And as examples I gave of the house painter or the -- a -- a travel agent who's selling guided tours is -- you know, or a AAA person who's selling you roadside assistance.  All those people are selling you things.  They're not doing them because the idea of selling something is a fundamentally different concept than the idea of actually doing it.  And that's a problem -- a problem that I don't think Petitioner can escape. I mean, that is the reason why what Congress did is they -- they put service advisors with all the other people in the auto dealership who I mentioned who are not exempt and who get overtime. I think even Petitioner doesn't actually believe, at least in one respect, that -- that service advisors are principally engaged in selling -- in servicing automobiles. There are people at the dealership who sell underbody coatings and assorted paint sealants, upholstery treatments, tire treatments.  Those people are definitely salesmen.  That is their job, is to sell. They -- those -- those things are all services that are provided to the car.  And yet Petitioner has conceded from the beginning of this litigation that those people who do that kind of selling, that they are not covered by the statute. And I think that just is a natural conclusion that Petitioner draws because I think that's the natural way to read this statute. Petitioner -- my friend did refer to the -- said that the Department of Labor has taken the position that auto -- that auto body repair people are not covered by the -- the statute.  I think that that is actually mistaken. The only cite -- source for that is in a footnote in the reply brief.  It's a 1968 opinion letter by Department of Labor, and what Department of Labor said there -- first of all, the opinion letter stood for the proposition and addressed the question of whether auto painters are covered by the statute, are exempt, and it concluded that they're not exempt. But, secondly, it did then talk about a category it called body and fender mechanics. And it suggested that they are not -- that they are exempt under this statute. Well, I just think it's worthwhile looking at what happened to that.  In 1970, body and fender mechanics were included in the original version of the -- of the regulation as an example of the kind of people who are considered to be mechanics and could be exempt. In 1973, three years later, I think it was the first revision of it, they kept the list of people who are mechanics the same and removed body and fender mechanics.  So I think the only thing you can conclude is the Department of Labor has not concluded and there isn't a history of saying that even body and fender mechanics are not covered, but whether they're covered or not would be a different question, but at least auto body repairmen are not. Congress picked three distinct professions who were well recognized at the time of the statute and said, you know, we want those occupations, specific occupations to be exempt for the reasons that I said, that service advisors were a well-recognized occupation at that time. They -- they were recognized in the Occupational Outlook Handbook.  They had been recognized in NLRB decisions from the 1940s on, in industry publications.  And there's a reason why they're a distinct occupation, because if you look at the jobs that they do, it's actually a completely different job than the job that's done by -- by auto salesmen, who are the people who Congress undoubtedly wanted to include. The one other thing I'd like to say is about the distributive or reddendo canon.  I mean, we don't -- we -- what that canon stands for is the proposition that when you have two lists like this that you have to make match up, as -- as dates -- as -- as in the Simms case, is actually a great example, where you have three in the first category and two in the second and you have to match them up, it is common, and there are or's -- they're connected by the word ""or,"" it's common in the English language to say, well, we match up the ones that actually fit according to the context, but we don't have to struggle and strain to twist the ordinary meanings of words or something like that to try to barely find a way in which everything in the first list has to match with everything in the second. And that is all that that canon means. It means that it's perfectly acceptable and was what Congress, I think, did, is to say salesmen match up with sells, they are etymologically related, they're semantically related, that's what Congress intended to do, and it matches perfectly. Partsmen and mechanics match up with servicing.  Salesmen don't match up with servicing and, in fact, insofar as someone is a salesman, they're almost certainly not a service person.

You bring the car up, you know, it's making this noise, they go out and at least listen to the noise, and sometimes they can say right away: Oh, that's probably this.  And then they send something down, and whether the customer is still there or comes back later, all that they do in the -- the mechanics or the partsmen, send it up and then plug it in and it's right. So, I mean, in certain situations, the advisor would play the primary role in fixing the problem, not when it's more complex, maybe not typically, but certainly in what I suppose would be many occasions.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's a different -- that's a different example.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sometimes -- I -- I guess what I'm saying, sometimes the primary decision in servicing the car is going to be made by the service advisor, at least the initial thing.  You know, send something down. The -- the mechanic may well look at it himself or herself, but the service advisor says it's a distributor cap or whatever, and it turns out it is, they put it on, and it's done.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but, I mean, just in -- and maybe this isn't the best guide to the interpretation, but it's sort of common understanding if you, over several years, dropped your car off whenever you're supposed to or whenever it's broken and -- and you talk to Fred about getting it fixed, and -- and somebody comes to you later and says something -- I've got a problem with my car, you would say my service guy is Fred, go see him. It's just sort of your general reaction is that is part of the service -- not only that, it's the part, the only part that you have experience with.  But you would think of Fred as the person who services your car --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- no?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's different, go to different shops, I guess?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but diagnosis is part of the servicing as well, and the service advisors at least do that.  I mean, the mechanic isn't going to know what -- he needs to know what the problem is.  And the service advisor will spend a fair amount of time trying to get a description from the customer -- sometimes it's easy, you know, the -- the car won't start.  Other times, it's -- it's -- it's -- it's going to be harder, and they need to get a good description.

What about that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Contract of adhesion?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They don't want to rent the car to somebody who's going to put illegal stuff in the car.  I don't -- or, you know, they want to -- it's their car.  They want to cooperate with the police in terms of what can be used in their car.  I don't -- well, put aside the contract of adhesion, what -- what then?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, he knows that Budget doesn't want him to have an expectation of privacy in the trunk.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, he knows that the owner of the car, Budget, does not want to give him any privacy in the trunk.  The police know that the owner of the car does not want to give him any privacy in the trunk.  And yet, nonetheless, he has an expectation of privacy?   INTERRUPTING John G.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's a pretty big connection that the person who has the right to drive the car told him that he could.  That's a connection to the car.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but this is probably not the only time it's ever happened.  And -- (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- I think what -- I think the understanding is, well, you're probably going to have trouble with insurance and all if so-and-so gets into an accident.  But at least the argument on the other side is that it wasn't unlawful for him to be driving.  It may have been -- or wasn't criminally unlawful.  It may have been a breach of contract by Reed, I guess, but not necessarily anything wrongful on his part.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How important is it -- how important is it that -- that the police have access to the actual agreement? One of the things that I think is very important in these types of cases is the ability to give clear guidance, not only to the courts, but to the police who have pulled a car over in the middle of a situation -- that is the most dangerous situation they confront. And, you know, you're saying, well, are they supposed to conduct an inquisition, you know, who gave you permission to use this car, what did she say, all that. Is there anything wrong, from your perspective, in a rule that is very simple which is if it's a rental agreement -- a rental car, look at the agreement.  If it's not an authorized driver, that's it.  In other words, it doesn't matter what the positions of the person who rented it is and -- but would you be arguing that the search was permissible if you didn't have the rental agreement?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Uh-huh.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, but, I mean, maybe it's paradoxical; you think, well, if there's no rental agreement, they ought to have a greater authority.  But the -- the absence of the authorization on the rental agreement that the police can look at is evidence that, you know, this is not your typical situation. However common it might be in -- in -- in -- in practice, it is -- raises doubts that might otherwise not be there even if they don't have the rental agreement.   INTERRUPTING ",16-1371
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I -- I suppose their answer would be that under Pinkerton, when you're talking about the defendant, you're also talking about co-conspirators.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what's your authority for that proposition?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And under Pinkerton, the -- the need to reach the substitute assets because of dissipation wouldn't be attributed to the co-conspirator.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it's -- it -- in furtherance of the conspiracy, we're looking -- the act at issue here is dissipation of tainted assets and the need for substitution.  I don't know that that's in pursuance of the conspiracy as more as frustrating the identification of the tainted assets.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fletcher.     Brian H. Fletcher  Well, if that's the case, Justice Kagan, you might disagree with me about how to read (p), and if you read (p) that way in the hypothetical you just described, then that defendant would have an argument the government couldn't invoke (p) as to him. But I really think a lot of the discussion that we've had about how (p) works and how money judgments works are really ancillary.  They inform the question presented, to be sure, but they are not the question presented.  The question, as this case has been litigated and as it comes to the Court, there's no question that the government can get a money judgment. There's no question that it can proceed through substitute assets if it can invoke (p). The question is who has liability for the amount, and the rule that was reflected in the decision below and the rule that we think is correct is that when the government is in that decision where the traceable proceeds are gone and it's trying to recover the value of the proceeds, how is that liability allocated amongst the conspirators.  And we think, in accordance with traditional principles of conspiracy liability, the correct measure is the amount that was foreseeable to each conspirator. Because the alternative -- and this gets back to the point I made to Justice Sotomayor, or was starting to about couriers -- is that you're going to be sticking people with liability based on the amount of money that they touched.  It's not just the amount of money they got to enjoy or spend or ultimately keep; it's the amount of money they obtained.  And so when a person sells drugs, he obtains the whole proceeds of the transaction and then passes it along to somebody else, he can be held liable for that entire amount even though he didn't keep all that much of it. That's reflected in the Casey case which we cite in our brief, and also in Judge Boudeen's opinion in Hurley.  And we think a system that instead makes forfeiture liability depend on the amount that was foreseeable to the defendant is a more sensible way to allocate the monetary penalty in Section 853.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Unikowsky, 15 minutes.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it seems to me that just another -- a reiteration of your earlier argument.  I mean, of the defendant in (a) and of the defendant here, but under Pinkerton, the defendant includes the co-conspirators.   INTERRUPTING ",16-142X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that, Pinkerton, it -- it's based on a fiction, right? I mean -- I mean, the defendant may not have been there when the acts committed; somebody else may have done it, but because he's a conspirator, you treat it as if he had done that. I'm not sure that that theory works when you're talking about a more focused statute here, where you tamper only the tainted property.  And I'm not quite sure that that works, because as soon as you engage in a -- that fiction, it takes the focus tainted requirement away.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If -- if they both have -- was carrying it, they both have the duffle bag and all that, and you say, well, they are both liable for what's in the duffel bag.  But then one of them takes the duffel bag and, you know, buys a car with it. And your theory is the other guy is responsible for the value of the car.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And your theory also is if the other guy, you know, just dropped the person off, had nothing to do with getting the duffel bag or whatever, the same thing happens.  He's still responsible to forfeit the value of the car.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  As to one person, though, not to the other.  In other words, if we have -- if the chauffeur who drives the -- the kingpin around and therefore is going to be a co -- a co-conspirator. And the kingpin does, you know gets the drug money, decides to buy a Ferrari with it, then sells it.  And he has the cash. But you can get that cash from the chauffeur.  You don't have to trace it to him somehow. Because he's a co-conspirator in Pinkerton, he is considered to have obtained what anybody else had obtained.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Listen, I wonder why you call them traceable.  I -- oh, I think your theory applies even if there -- you don't have to show that they're traceable.  I mean, if you can show they're traceable, he used the drug money to buy the Ferrari, are you saying that then the co-conspirators, the chauffeur, is not liable for those proceeds?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry, finish your answer.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand the idea you argued this is not in rem, but when you -- as soon as you say, but we're only after the tainted property, it kind of sounds like you're in rem under another label.  In other words, you're sticking with this piece of property, just as if you were proceeding in an action against --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- in rem against the property.  So I -- I don't see how you can say it's not -- not in rem, but we're only going after the tainted property.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So in terms of the -- I don't mean to interrupt, but the substitution principle doesn't apply with respect to assets that you can seize that are needed for counsel fees?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You have --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You have your choice of getting the money either from the guy who is holding it in the basement, or from the other guy.  Right? You can choose.  It's not -- it's not a precondition for you recovering from the, whatever it is, the chauffeur, the bag man, to show that the money is not available from the kingpin.   John G.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  You made the point earlier that -- I understood you to make the point that this would be outside the scope of the Contract Clause because it was an exercise of the state's police power?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah.  But -- but is that true to the full extent of the police power? Anything that we would characterize as a police power authority would be exempt from scrutiny under the Contract Clause?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  When you say it's not a substantial impairment, are you acknowledging that it is an impairment? At least in terms of ranking your -- your arguments?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dvoretzky.     Shay Dvoretzky  So I -- I think, under the original understanding, that would be a Contracts Clause violation.  Under the modern test, there is a -- a court -- there is a case we cited in our brief that has found such a change to be unconstitutional. It would, however -- there would, however, be a stronger case for its constitutionality than there is here if, under the modern approach, the state thought that it had a strong policy interest in ensuring the equal treatment of adopted children. That, however, is fundamentally different from this case, where -- where no one has made any showing of a strong policy interest in effectuating the presumed intent of some policyholders at the expense of the intent of others. Mr. Unikowsky, in his argument, made a few points as to why the Virginia alternative, or a notice alternative, would not be sufficient, that I'd just like to briefly address. One, the notice -- the notice that is provided can exist alongside the revocation-on-divorce statute.  In other words, a state is free to have, under the modern approach, the revocation-on-divorce statute on the books so long as it tells people.  And -- and it's also free to do the same thing -- have the same revocation-on-divorce statute for wills and for life insurance policies, and also to provide the same notice for wills and for life insurance policies. And so, in that respect, that achieves the goal that -- that Mr. Unikowsky posited of achieving equal treatment of wills and life insurance policies so long as that is actually what people want, as long as that is actually what the -- the divorcing parties want. As for disputes about what a decree -- a decree means, the revocation-on-divorce statute can take effect so long as there is notice.  And so there doesn't need to be a dispute about what the decree means if, in fact, the -- the revocation-on-divorce statute has simply taken effect. If the Court has no further questions, again, the Contracts Clause is absolute in its language.  Chief Justice Marshall recognized long ago that this was a clause so clear that it could hardly be misunderstood and recognized that it applied to all manner of contracts. We ask that the Court bear that original understanding of the Contracts Clause in mind in resolving this case.  And even under the more deferential modern approach, that original understanding ought to inform the approach, particularly where, as here, there's a ready alternative to achieve all of the state's objectives without impairing anybody's contractual rights.

Decorum, obviously, reaches further than you can't intimidate someone.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you -- you say that, but I wonder if the state can make an opposite determination and say, you know, for however many months we've had this, you know, maybe bitter, sharp, political campaign going on, and maybe, just before you cast your vote, you should be able to have a time for some quiet reflection or to do that important civic obligation in peace and quiet without being bombarded by another campaign display. And it -- you know, you say these are -- it's passive but not active, but, you know, a picture can be worth a thousand words, and people's apparel can convey very strong and shocking images that maybe the state can decide that, just before you cast your vote, you should have at least a moment free of all the Sturm und Drang of the campaign.

I ask questions. But I just don't understand where the disruption of the decorum comes with respect to anything that qualifies as -- as political.  I -- I mean, people going to vote certainly would expect that they would see people arguing for their candidates or the other candidates, though maybe not within 100 feet or whatever. But the idea that they're going to be protected from recognizing that other people support different candidates than they might, I think, is a bit more of a stretch.   INTERRUPTING John G.

And I think that that would also be a problem with trying to apply this rule to the Gerstein hearing and to other proceedings where there aren't those same adversarial safeguards or adversarial presentations.

Suppose Congress passed a law that said, well, any professional responsibility -- any professional responsibility rule adopted by the ABA will preempt contrary State law. Is that okay under preemption doctrine?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are you just -- are you just saying this is beyond -- regulating the --   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  I guess, is it -- you know, in some of those areas, you're talking about State governments.  Is -- is it permissible for Congress to delegate the authority to decide what laws are preempted to a private entity?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But what about two private parties, whether, you know -- whatever they are, a railroad and a shipper, in other words, and Congress says, whatever you agree to will preempt contrary State laws.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know you're going to suggest --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- it's not this case --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- but assume it is.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, before you get -- get to that, I mean, it would seem to me that you could deal with the concerns you have and still address the problem.  In other words, it's not a blank check. You know, it -- any rate between, you know, $10 per mile and $30 per mile, but you, the parties, you know, we want to give the -- the free enterprise system a little more scope than having the government set it.  So whatever rate you set between $10 and $30 a ton or a mile will preempt contrary State regulation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah.  But the idea -- the concern is -- raised by your friend on the other side is, yes, Congress can do that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But we're talking about the preemption of State law.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What -- what if the government approached GE and said, look, this is a very complicated financial fraud, we're busy with some other stuff, we'd like you to go ahead and investigate it to the extent you can, and they'd used the results of their investigation in their prosecution?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's a pretty open phrase, ""other expenses incurred during participation in the investigation."" I don't know why, if the government's essentially delegating its responsibility, that those expenses wouldn't be covered.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You seem to suggest that there's a very sharp line where you can tell the precise point at which the government is beginning investigation and the prior -- prior times when they hadn't. I mean, it's more of a fluid situation, right? The government gets a report.  They put it in the file.  They'll start investigating as soon as they finish up these three more serious offenses. I mean, isn't it going to be a difficult determination of when precisely the government investigation began?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, does it begin when they get a complaint?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  But I'm talking about your other theory --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- which is it has to be during the government investigation.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The -- one of the items that you're entitled to recover as the victim is lost income.  Here, the victim was a corporate entity.  How -- how do you measure lost income in that context?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Huston.     Michael R. Huston  That's right, Your Honor, but I think that only illustrates Congress's wisdom in allowing these -- these restitution expenses.  If you were to pay back GE Capital the $11 million that Petitioner does not contest, it would not be made whole because, in order to get to this point, GE Capital had to incur substantial investigation expenses, and participating in the bankruptcy proceedings, those are losses that are real to this company, which is a victim of the fraud within the meaning of the MVRA. And they were proximately caused by the defendant's offense, which is the definition of victim that's in Section 3663A(a). So I think for all of these reasons it makes sense that Congress would design a restitution system that would focus on restoring the victim to its position before the offense.  As the Court said in Dolan, the substantive purpose of this statute is to award full restitution. Unless there are further questions, we'd ask that the judgment be affirmed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Geyser.     ",16-1519
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  We have talked --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We have talked about two investigations: GE's investigation and the government's investigation.  The statute talks about participation in the investigation, only one. And it seems to me if you're talking about only one, it obviously has to be the government's.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm not sure that GE took steps to limit its expenses. I mean, it -- it hired very expensive law firms to conduct the investigation.  And -- and you're going to have the district judge in all of these cases being asked to do that, did they really have to, you know, have partners work on this as opposed to associates? Did they have to hire this law firm? Couldn't they have done this? And it's not clear to me that the Congress would want the district courts to spend a lot of time on that sort of restitution litigation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But he --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And it seems pretty clear the government would never have done that on its own, try to figure out whether the restitution ought to be $4 million or $8 million from a guy who's never going to pay any of it.  They would have said, I think, instead we'll spend a little time on the mass murder down the street. And I'm just wondering if you're talking about expenses that the private party incurred for its own purposes to find out how to adjust its books, what it had lost, why should the victim be compelled to pay that or, as Justice Ginsburg suggests, just carry it on -- on his own back, when it's something that the government would never have done on its own?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm not sure if that --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not sure if that helps you.  I mean, then your -- your answer seems to be, well, they can always litigate these things.  So now, not only is the government going to be conducting an investigation over money that nobody's ever going to pay, but they're going to be litigating about it, taking the district court time to figure out whether the attorneys' fees should be $2 million or $1.5 million, again, when no one's going to get the money anyway.

Now, they were there as part of the jury pool, but, of course, they weren't all chosen. I mean, what was the -- did the judge have to set aside how many seats for people who weren't actually being called for jury duty before you would conclude that the courtroom was not closed?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not -- I mean, it's a limited space.  There's only so many --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- spaces and it's -- you know, he's got to get the jury pool in there and, you know, they took up all the space.  So you must -- your position must be on the error itself that the judge should have kept aside certain seats for people who weren't being called for jury duty.  I'm just curious how many that is.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but -- but you -- presumably, I guess the argument is, well, they were turned away because there was no -- no room.  And there was no room because the courtroom was full of members of the public who were called for jury duty.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'll have to go back and look at Presley, but courtroom overcrowding is not a justification for turning away other people, what are they supposed to do?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What did they say in Presley that you were supposed to do? In other words, there's no room in the courtroom, and you say, well, that's not a justification for keeping people out.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The -- the structural errors are not the most grievous errors possible in the criminal process.  They are a particular type of error, which the assumption is there's no way to tell whether they're prejudicial or not.  But, I mean, this -- this may be a good case.  That doesn't mean they're the most shocking miscarriages of justice you can imagine.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah.  You're picking good ones, but, I mean, I -- I can come up with a long list of things that I think are more serious violations than the exclusion of the public from voir dire when you have the other jury members there.  I understand that that is an error, and I -- the argument, of course, that it is a structural error; but I'm just quarreling with the idea that these are the most grievous miscarriages of -- of justice you can imagine. There are particular characteristics of them that put them in a different category.  The -- the --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  A list of errors that could occur in criminal procedure, I think you'd agree, there's some that you would put ahead of excluding members of the public from voir dire when the courtroom is otherwise full.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ravitz.     Randall E. Ravitz  Thank you very much.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Ms. O'Connell.     Ann O'Connell Adams  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin where my co-counsel just left off here with the idea that any time a structural error occurs, it leads to fundamental unfairness and unreliability in the outcome of the trial.  Structural errors implicate fairness in a way that's broader than the interest that's protected by the Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. Under Strickland, we're focused on whether counsel's error undermines confidence in the -- in the verdict.  You're asking whether there was such a breakdown in the adversarial process that we can no longer rely on what the jury did.  And the Court in Gonzalez-Lopez pushed back on the idea that all structural errors are necessarily the type of error that undermine confidence in the reliability of the trial. And I can give three examples of scenarios where structural errors occur, where other courts have concluded that those errors do not undermine the reliability of the trial outcomes: Batson errors, right to counsel of choice, and bias trial judge. In the context of Batson errors, which you were talking a little bit about before, we have cited some cases in page 18 and 19 of our brief where courts of appeals have looked at cases where Batson errors occurred and said, okay.  There was a Batson error.  We consider that a structural error, but it didn't undermine our -- our confidence in the outcome of this trial.  There was overwhelming evidence of guilt. There's no reason to believe that any juror that was actually sitting on the jury had any kind of a bias. And those decisions are consistent with this Court's opinion in Allen v. Hardy, which is the case that holds that Batson is not retroactive.  And that case --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is the difficulty in any particular case something that can be weighed in determining whether the defendant has carried his burden of showing prejudice? I mean, in some of these, you say -- I guess we haven't required in some Batson cases, I think it would be -- that's where I do think it would be almost impossible to put the burden on showing prejudice.  On the other hand, denial of counsel of choice, I would think that would be pretty easy to show whether there's prejudice or -- or not, right? Is that something a judge, reviewing whether there's been an adequate showing of prejudice, can take into account, or is it all or nothing?   Ann O'Connell Adams  I -- no, I think so. In Strickland, I think it's page 459 of Strickland, the Court describes the test for how to do a case-by-case prejudice inquiry under Strickland.  And the Court looks to, was the evidence against this defendant overwhelming.  Was the error that occurred pervasive, in that it affected everything that happened in the trial, or was it just limited to one particular witness or one particular thing. So I think, you know, under Strickland, the test is flexible enough that courts could take into consideration what type of an error it was. I think Justice Gorsuch --   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Goldenberg.     Elaine J. Goldenberg  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Article 10(a) of the Hague Service Convention permits service through postal channels on persons abroad if the law of the forum State -- that's the State where the case is pending -- authorizes such service and if the receiving State where the mail will be delivered hasn't objected to Article 10(a). And I'd like to start with this permit authorize framework, because I think there's been a lot of confusion in the lower courts on this subject.  The question presented here is perhaps phrased a little inartfully in terms of authorization, and it would be really helpful if this Court would clarify this point. Article 10(a) says that provided the State of destination does not object, the present convention shall not interfere with the freedom to send judicial documents by postal channels to persons abroad.  So it is not interfering with freedom.  It is -- it's not the same thing as providing an affirmative authorization for service by mail.  That affirmative authorization has to be found elsewhere.  And the place where you find it is in the law of the forum State. So, for instance, in our Federal system, if you look at Rule 4 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, there is a subsection of Rule 4 that says where an international agreement permits, but does not authorize service on persons abroad, here are a bunch of things you can do.  And some of those options include service by mail, using registered mail by -- sent by the clerk of the court, service by mail if the district court judge in a particular case directs it, and so on. So that's where you get the authorization. You have to -- the forum State has to authorize the service by mail on a person abroad. At the other end of the process, you have to see whether the receiving State has objected to service by mail.  And as my friend indicated, nearly half of the countries that have acceded to or ratified this treaty have indeed objected to service by mail.  Some of them have given a sort of conditional objection that they'll only service by mail if --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hootman.     Timothy A. Hootman  Thank you.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Mr. Wall. Mr. Griffin.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Griffin, if -- if -- I'm not sure I fully understand your position.  Individual -- individuals can agree to arbitrate disputes so long as they allow -- so long as the agreement allows collective arbitration; is that correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So the arbitral --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Right. But if they agree to act -- the agreement requires that they act individually, although, to arbitrate, but there is a collective arbitral forum, that that's all right? In other words, just they have to arbitrate, whether they do it individually or collectively, you cannot restrict that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So the point is they -- they can, in their arbitration agreement, waive the right to proceed collectively in court, so long as they have the right to do it in arbitration?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I don't -- yeah, I don't understand --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right, I don't understand how that's consistent with your position that these rights can't be waived.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Let's say the arbitral forum says -- the rules of the arbitral forum says you can proceed individually, but you can -- and you can proceed collectively, but only if the class represents more than 50 people.  Is that all right under your theory?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you have a right to act collectively, but only if there are 51 or more of you?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, the arbitral forum has rules, just like the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  And what you're saying is, well, once you get into federal court, of course you've got to follow the rules of the forum.  And we have arbitral forums as well, and I'm just saying --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Maybe I'm not understanding.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so all the employer -- well, and why can the arbitral forum enforce the rule that says, basically, you cannot act collectively if it's fewer than 50 people?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So the employer has to say --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but most arbitration agreements tell you what the forum is, whether it's the AAA or something else. So, if the employer/employee agreement says you shall arbitrate this under this particular arbitration forum, and those rules say we're -- we'll do collective arbitration, but only if you have more than 51 people because we think it's more efficient to have a smaller number arbitrate individually, that would be okay under your position?

Ortiz  Your Honor, it's -- it represents an accommodation, if you will, with this Court's jurisprudence where this Court has said in a series of cases that the arbitral forum is equivalent to the judicial forum, so as long as one can proceed in one or the other, there should be no Section 7 violation.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  So this decision in your favor would invalidate the 25 -- agreements covering 25 million employees?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but, of course, there's another statute that has either equally or plainer language which says that arbitration agreements will be enforced according to their terms. Does it complicate the case to add that into it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that kind of begs the question.  We're trying to figure out if this is illegal.  You can't assume that that type of arbitration agreement is illegal, and, therefore, it's covered by a clause that prevents the enforcement of illegal arbitration agreements.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Where -- where are you on my 50-employee hypothetical? Do you agree with the NLRB that it is all right to have a provision which says there is no class arbitration unless there are more than 50 people involved?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But is your answer then that you disagree with the position of the NLRB? Because I understood them to say that, yes, once you're in the forum, you have to abide by the rules of the forum.  And one of the rules of the forum that I hypothesized is one that's saying you've got to have at least 50 people before you can have a collective action.  Now, if it's an arbitration agreement, that means you are already out of the courts. So the question is, is that a valid agreement or not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, my point is it doesn't make collective action impossible.  It requires that there be at least 51 employees before you can have collective action.  In other words, it's a rule like the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure which says you cannot have a class action whenever you want to, but you have to satisfy certain rules like numerosity.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sorry it's so complicated.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, there's no alternative available because you're agreeing to arbitrate.  You're agreeing to go to the arbitral forum, and it has certain rules.   INTERRUPTING John G.

If you take the position that refusing to -- not answering about the speeding ticket or the nickname is enough to subject that person to denaturalization, the government will have the opportunity to denaturalize anyone they want, because everybody is going to have a situation where they didn't put in something like that -- or at least most people. And then the government can decide, we are going to denaturalize you for other reasons than what might appear on your naturalization form, or we're not. And that to me is -- is troublesome to give that extraordinary power, which, essentially, is unlimited power, at least in most cases, to the government.   INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That goes to deficient performance.  I think we're beyond that, and the question is -- is prejudice.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  On that point, you say the facts here support that -- that conclusion and go through them all, but I don't understand how you'll be able to distinguish any case in the future. You say: Well, here, he's been here a long time, hasn't gone back to South Korea, has he started -- but I think someone who's just arrived might say: You know, this has been my passion my whole life to come to the United States; I don't want to go back. You know, it -- it -- I'm not sure how, at the outset, a judge can simply say: Oh, we don't need to have a hearing in a case like this. It seems to me that there would necessarily have to be a hearing in every case.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it sounds like a subjective test.  I mean -- I don't know if it's hypothetically, or we can assume it's actually, the idea is that, even though the result of a trial is going to be exactly the same, there's no reasonable probability that he won't be deported, he nonetheless wants to go through the trial. Now that could be certainly characterized as a subjective wish, not an objective.  An objective person would say: Well, it's going to come out the same anyway.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No -- but I think several times in your brief and here today, you talk about -- you say well, who knows what will happen at trial.  Well, that can't be the right test because otherwise, there'd never be prejudice in a Strickland situation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, who knows what will happen? Maybe the jury won't convict because they get -- get it wrong.  Maybe there'll be a case of jury nullification.  You say in your brief maybe the government witness will die.  I mean, it's all -- yeah, of course you can't be certain about what's going to happen, but if your test is right, then all the Strickland cases come out the other way.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  -- you'll agree that there are many possibilities where it would nonetheless be rational for him to choose -- where -- where it would make sense for him to want a longer prison sentence, right? Let's say that there -- he has a serious medical condition.  The medical care he's going to get at Millington is better than what he's going to get wherever he's going.  He may get no medical care where he's being removed to. Isn't that rational for him to want to go to trial with the expectation that he'll get a longer prison sentence?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Under Strickland, in the typical Strickland case where you're talking about the outcome of a trial, I understand that.  But we're talking about something different here.  We're talking about reasonable probability that he would or would not have accepted the -- the plea agreement.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah.  But I mean, you know, that's funny, but the -- the fact is this is a situation where he might well have elected to have more prison time because it would keep him in -- in Tennessee, close to his family, where he would be able to visit his children, where he could even, as I think the judge suggested, have some role in continuing to -- to run the restaurant. What is -- what is like life at FPC Millington? I take it it's not Alcatraz, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what is -- what is life like at a minimum security federal prison?

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Salyer.     Robert E. Salyer  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  That -- that's correct inasmuch as -- the question here revolves around what the power of attorney means.  If the power of attorney encompassed the authority for the agent to sign this agreement, then, as the Kentucky Supreme Court said, the agreement will be enforced.  If it doesn't, then there's no agreement.  And I'm saying -- saying that the Federal Arbitration Act does not bear upon answering that question; that that is a function of State law and of the State court's interpretation of a power of attorney instrument. So in summation, our -- our general -- our -- our general position is that the Federal Arbitration Act again does not extend this Court's interpretive powers beyond agreements to arbitrate.  It does not extend them to powers of attorney.  However, this Court need not even reach out to that particular principle because we are talking about interpreting a power of attorney, which, in the ordinary course of a State instrument, is up to the State supreme court to -- to -- to make that interpretation.  And this Court will only step in and substitute its interpretation for that of the State supreme court in the exceptional circumstances. And the only exceptional circumstances that this Court has identified in DIRECTV do not apply here. The Kentucky Supreme Court did not single out arbitration for distinctive treatment, and the Kentucky Supreme Court went out of its way to tie the -- its interpretation of the meaning and authority of the power of attorney to the intention of the principal. No further questions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Pincus, you have ten minutes.     INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, the State could also --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The State could also enact a statute that says powers of attorney can't waive -- can't waive fundamental rights.  Would -- would that violate the FAA, in your view?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah.  But I mean, legislators -- legislatures often pass statutes that are underinclusive or overinclusive.  So I don't think that distinguishes the case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It -- it says it embodies the rule that the supreme -- Kentucky Supreme Court adopted, which is that you can't -- you can't waive fundamental rights, and like a lot of statutes, it's going to require some interpretation.  But that's all it says.  It says, you can't -- you know, they're worried about the scope of powers of attorney, and they say powers of attorney in Kentucky cannot waive fundamental rights under the Constitution.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It doesn't single out arbitration.  That happens to be the issue before it.  I mean, basically, it seems to me what it's coming down to is you just don't believe the Kentucky Supreme Court when it says this is the general principle.  And you're saying, well, I really think you're hostile to arbitration because I haven't heard that principle before and this is the first one.  But you know, if -- if the Kentucky legislature passes a law that does the same thing, I mean, are you going to be suspicious of them too just because arbitration might be the first time it comes up?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You have to look at what's going on in the case.  So in my case where you just have a statute, there's nothing else to look at. So how -- how -- I still don't get why that would be invalid.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  There's no talk about arbitration.  The word ""arbitration"" --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- doesn't come up.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  We understand that. But I'm talking about a legislative proposition.  And it doesn't say anything about arbitration.  It just says powers of attorney.  You can't waive fundamental rights unless it's expressly stated.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I know, but the problem is -- is that it is, in terms of the law-making authority, Kentucky would say to the supreme court, you know, we make these rules through the courts as we did in this case.  And I just -- I guess I just don't see -- I -- I don't think you've -- well, you haven't come up with a distinction that persuades me, and that's important because I think, as Justice Kagan said, we have to assume the Kentucky Supreme Court is acting in good faith.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  There's nothing else in there.  The -- the first time --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The first time the statute is applied, it happens to be to an arbitration case.  It happens to be to this case.  But you can't say oh, look in the background of it.  It's all about hostility to arbitration.  You can't --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Pincus, you understand that when your first answer is, let's go to this case, that's not the most compelling response.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  All right.  Well, how would you do that? That's the position that you and maybe Justice Breyer are taking.  How would you -- how would you go about that? How would you say we've got to decide why arbitration is being included in this?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes or no, and your time is expired.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  Thank you.

It wanted to have all of that standardized. Now, that might sometimes result in the word ""resides"" in a venue statute swallowing the rest to some degree.  I think, you know, this Court, next month, is going to consider the Fila venue provision, 45 U.S.C. 46, I believe.  And that venue provision -- it's in the list, in, I think, footnote 8 of the House report -- that footnote incorporates of venue provisions that would be encompassed.

Ms. Harrington?     Sarah E. Harrington  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In our view, no creditor is entitled to file a proof of claim in bankruptcy on a claim that the creditor knows is time barred.  When the bankruptcy system works --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, bankruptcy is very different.  The whole idea is let's get everything here in one place and -- and deal with it, you know, and different priorities and all of that.  I think it's much more significant if you have things spinning out of the bankruptcy estate being adjudicated elsewhere than the fact that you might have it as a general matter in -- in district courts.   Sarah E. Harrington  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it's a bedrock principle of bankruptcy that a creditor's rights with respect to a debt are defined by State law. When a debt is time barred, State law has determined that that debt is not judicially enforceable.  Nothing in the bankruptcy gives a creditor an extra right to judicially enforce the debt.  That's --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What other affirmative defenses does your theory apply to?   Sarah E. Harrington  Well, think about freedom from the defense of res judicata.  If a creditor had sued in state claim on a timely -- a timely debt, and the state court had said: This is not a valid claim. We wouldn't want a system where that creditor could then file a proof of claim in bankruptcy, hoping that the claim would just slip through the cracks and get paid even though the creditor knew for sure --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  A lot of these affirmative defenses though in -- aren't presented as abstractly as that.  They may involve nuances. We have cases about the scope of res judicata and when it applies.  What other -- I assume your argument applies to every affirmative defense.   Sarah E.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are there other defenses to a debt that you would say are covered by your theory other than the statute of limitations? For example, that the -- the debt was incurred to a contract of adhesion or, you know, the -- the normal list of reasons that a debt might be unenforceable.  Does your theory apply to all of those?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well -- well, but how do you know that's the case in the statute of limitations with respect to a statute of limitations defense? There are exceptions to the statutes of limitations that -- that -- totally -- you know, the whole list of -- so it's hard to say.  I mean, but the -- the argument on the other side is look, we've spelled out -- we -- we have to have spelled out the sort of basis.  If you think there's a statute of limitations defense, here are the dates of these things. If it's obvious on the face, which was the standard you've proposed, then it ought to be obvious to the other side as well.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  How do we know? Do we -- is there some way we know that there wasn't a tolling argument that could be raised in this case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  There was a little disputed footnote battle about that --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- in terms of what the record provided or not.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Let's take the case where the dates, since you asked, it's six years that was incurred, however many years beyond that, and you say they -- they should just not raise it, or you say that they should inquire somehow to make sure that there wasn't a basis for tolling the -- the statute? What -- what do they have to do?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, tell me what that is.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So it's -- it's not enough for them to say there might be, it's -- you know, there -- a tolling issue here.  I mean, their argument is that that's exactly how bankruptcy works.  Here we have a claim, and if there is an objection to it, it shifts to the other side.  It seems to me that you're putting a burden on them to research the claim before asserting it in bankruptcy.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And -- and where -- where does the -- where do you litigate the issue of good faith?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But what kind of claims are you talking about? These -- these kinds of claims?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So then it's logistically, it's every claim that they -- they look at?   INTERRUPTING John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky.     Nicole A. Saharsky  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We have two questions in this case.  And I think I'd like to pick up with that -- where my co-counsel left off, which was with Justice Breyer's question, which I think goes to the first question presented.  And I think the question was, why can't we just say that we can consider the facts of causing the situation as part of the reasonableness inquiry? And the answer there is because the question that we're answering under Graham is, was the officer's force -- use of force reasonable in the circumstances that he faced? And those -- those depend really on two sets of facts. One: What was the individual doing? Was the person a threat? Did he have a weapon? A propensity to use it? Was a member of the public at risk? Was he fleeing, committing a crime, et cetera? And two: How did the officer respond to it? What were the officer's options? What did the -- was the officer's use of force proportional, et cetera? It doesn't ask whether the police officer created the situation.  It takes stepping into the shoes, the situation --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, it -- it -- I just want to put the discussion so far this morning in the right framework.  We're talking about the second question presented, right? None of this, it seems to me, to be involved the provocation rule in the Ninth Circuit, at least the question about did they get a warrant, did they knock, announce.  How do you understand the Ninth Circuit's provocation rule in distinction to what we've been talking about in terms of proximate cause and things like that?   Nicole A. Saharsky  Sure.  The provocation rule takes, under the Ninth Circuit's precedence, a reasonable use of force and deems it unreasonable because the police made an earlier constitutional mistake, and we think that that is just flatly wrong. You should --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So as -- as that's describe -- is the label what's wrong? I -- I would think of provocation is something fairly immediate, something that causes the pulling of the gun by the -- the victim or something like that.  I don't think of it as provocation that you should have gotten a search warrant earlier in the day but you didn't, and that led to this.   Nicole A. Saharsky  I mean the thing that's wrong is what the Ninth Circuit is doing, which is saying the police created the situation by doing things that are not constitutional violations, but that the Ninth Circuit later finds, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, to be reasonable -- unreasonable.  And that's actually what we've seen. We've had this doctrine in the Ninth Circuit for 20 years now.  It's incredibly ill-defined, does not put in place clear rules for the police.  And the kinds of things that the Ninth Circuit is second-guessing is, maybe the police should have used a hostage negotiator for longer before going into the house in Alexander. That's the one with the sewage seeping outside of the house.  They tried to spend a month trying to talk to that guy.  They went to his house.  Used a hostage negotiator. Or the situation in Sheehan where there was a very difficult situation with a mentally ill woman who was threatening the police, and the Ninth Circuit said the police should have tried to calm down the situation for longer.  I mean, these are incredibly difficult determinations that are being made.  And under the Ninth Circuit's rule, the Ninth Circuit's just second-guessing doing exactly what this Court has said shouldn't be done.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well -- and also if you could get to Justice Kennedy's hypothetical.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Okay.  Just to finish this, but the Court has recognized that you have a problem in the knock-and-announce context that you don't know that they are the police.  And so in that context there really is a potential risk of violence.  Once you know that they're the police, a citizen is expected to stand down. Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, if I remember it, I think is an arrest without probable cause and the damages that --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feldman.     Leonard Feldman  Thank you. If the Court doesn't have any questions, I will conclude simply by saying that this is a case, quite specifically, about how citizens ought to act when they are dealing with known law enforcement officers. When people know that they are dealing with known law enforcement officers, nobody goes anywhere near a gun for fear of being shot.  But Mr. and Mrs. Mendez never had that opportunity because the Petitioners here decided to enter their home without warning, without a warrant or consent, and in violation of clearly established Fourth Amendment law.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, then it's not -- it's -- it's -- and this, I think, is the argument on the other side.  Then it's irrelevant.  In other words, the search warrant is not going to change the conduct.  But the failure to get the search warrant is the only thing that violated the standards under 1983. So it's not a proximate cause at all of the conduct, because, as you just said, it wouldn't have changed it in any way.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, but I don't see how you can agree -- I don't think it's -- addresses at least my concern, which -- why and in what way did the failure to get a warrant cause everything that followed?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It was the entry. I'm with you there.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand that. But the failure to get a warrant did not cause the entry.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Now, there -- and maybe I'm just asking the same thing over and over again.  And, if so, I apologize.  But how did the conduct, the failure to get the warrant, lead to the entry in this case?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I'm asking the same thing over and over again.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But I guess maybe I just -- you -- you -- as I understand your theory, the failure to get a warrant caused -- that's why we call it a provocation, I guess -- caused the -- the entry which caused the -- the confrontation; is that right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Exactly.  So I don't know why the failure to get a warrant matters.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, if I could interrupt you to ask a question. (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is it that whether it's authorized or not, you don't think it's going to prompt violence? The fact that you have a search warrant, you may have a search warrant, say, I've got to execute a search warrant to pick up this armed and dangerous felon; you may still think that's going to prompt violence.  That doesn't have anything to do with the nature of the entry you're going to have to make later on.  Knock-and-announce does, because if you just burst in, the person may reasonably think this is a burglar.  But if you knock and announce, it doesn't. That does affect the -- the -- the nature of -- of the conduct.  But I think a warrant, whether it's authorized or not, doesn't.   ",16-369X

Roberts, Jr.  Well, I think -- I think you're right that it -- it's a problem.  I just can't figure out who it's a problem for.  The -- the -- I mean, if you're concerned about the consequences of what the MSPB might do, you can skip it altogether and go -- go to district court right away; right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that -- that -- that takes place -- I just want to make sure I've got the flow here right.  That takes place before you get to that fork in the road; right? If this -- this is a mixed case in which you file your complaint with the agency --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- and then you can go either to the district court or to the MSPB.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, before you can do that, you have to exhaust; right?   ",16-399X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Go ahead.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's the way -- that's the way the system works, generally.  I mean, there are all sorts of statutory programs where there are prerequisites to a proceeding.  You know, the Clean Water Act, you know, you can only proceed if they -- the company is discharging water into navigable waters, but the system always works by the fact -- it has to start with an allegation. That's the -- you know, the -- the one provision does say ""alleges"" and the other doesn't, but it's hard to see how -- the -- the system doesn't turn on preexisting facts.  The way it -- you answer facts is you have an allegation, and then you have a response and all that. So I don't think the fact that it -- A did not use the word ""alleges"" can really be that significant.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And -- and that -- and, normally, that you can appeal that, and -- and have a choice to seek a review of it.  And you're talking about matters that are, I think in a majority of the cases, brought pro se.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And we've -- we have had -- I won't say difficulty, but we've had a lot of cases trying to decide whether something is jurisdictional or procedural.  And it's not always an easy question.  And to suggest that people, you know, filing these things pro se will be able to understand, well, that's jurisdictional, but it may actually be jurisdictional in the sense of being a claims processing rule as opposed to substantive jurisdiction.  I -- I think you're putting a huge burden on the -- on the system.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It is odd, though. It is odd that the only category of cases that you say has to go to the Federal Circuit through the MSPB are the cases in which the MSPB thinks they don't have jurisdiction.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You have two cases here, and one was come together, and the one they say, no, no, that's got to go to the MSPB and the -- I mean, that's got to go to the Federal Circuit because we need uniformity are the cases where they don't think there is a claim under the Civil Service Act.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the way -- the way you end up, though, is a situation where, peculiarly, the MSPB has jurisdiction because uniformity is desirable in a particular area.  Even though it doesn't have -- it can't enforce uniformity as a matter of substantive law, and we held in Kloeckner it can't enforce uniformity as a matter of procedural laws. And you made these arguments in Kloeckner and lost on procedure, and now you're saying, well, jurisdiction is different so we can make the same arguments there. In terms of accessibility of the statute, and simplicity, it would seem wiser to prevent that type of, you know, splitting the -- well, whatever.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  Might want to -- ahead.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You said there has to be a detour either way.  I understand there's a detour in the MSPB to the Federal Circuit under your view.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But where is the other detour? I thought the other route was straight to the district court.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   ",16-399X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, now --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I want to understand the -- the basis for the 24-hour, however long you want it to be, exception.  It seems to me if there's going to be protection extended to the information, it has to involve some compromise of the third-party doctrine, and if that is altered, I don't see why it wouldn't also apply to, you know, one day of information.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I don't understand.  What is the line we're drawing? It seems to me the line is between information to which the authorities have access and information to which they don't.  I don't know why we're bothering about a line between six hours, three weeks, whatever.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, another thing the government's never had is the ability to go back even for 24 hours and basically test everybody, everybody in the whole community or anyone who happened to be there. So I don't know why that isn't a consideration that cuts against preserving 24 hours two months ago. The government didn't have the capability of tracking a particular individual, or every individual, and they find out later that's the one they want, so I -- I don't understand the coherence of your argument on that point.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you avoid taking a position on the question in your brief, but I'd like you to do -- take one today.  Is there any reason to treat grand jury subpoenas differently than you would treat subpoenas under other -- under legislation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  One --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  One thing -- I'm sorry.  Please.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  A lot of what you're talking about and a lot of what the questions concern, I think, is addressed under the question whether a warrant should issue as opposed to whether a warrant is required. Under current practice, when you're getting a warrant, it makes a difference if you go in and say I want to search the entire house for anything I can find and if you say I want to search the drawers for business records that we think are related to blah, blah, blah. And so it's the same thing here.  Yes, the technology affects every aspect of -- of life.  That doesn't mean that the warrant has to.  And in terms of reasonableness, if you can focus on, you know, we want to talk about simply whatever it is, purchases, because we have reason to believe he's purchasing the stuff that goes in to make, you know, methamphetamine, but that doesn't mean we're going to go look at location information.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben.     Michael R. Dreeben  The -- the difference here is that the government is operating under court supervision with an order that provides particularity.  It provides the interposition of a neutral magistrate between the government and the acquisition of information.  And it does require a showing that is less than probable cause but is above what a traditional subpoena requires. So even if the Court does think that there is a search here, Congress has properly, in our view, calibrated the balancing of interests, and the Court should affirm it as a constitutionally reasonable order.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Of course, the -- the issue, I guess, was not addressed below and is not before us.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm looking at footnote 1 in the government's brief.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky.     Nicole A. Saharsky  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: So there are two questions before the Court. The Court said in Omni that in order to assert personal jurisdiction, you have to have a statute or a rule making the defendant amenable to service of process. There's a question of, here, is it Section 56 or Montana law.  We've explained why we think it's Montana law. And then the second question is if they're exercising service of process on Montana law, does -- is that general jurisdiction consistent with the standards the Court set out in Daimler and Goodyear, and we don't think it is. So on -- particularly on the Section 56 question, because that's one where there's a strong Federal interest in not having words that don't say anything about service of process being interpreted to in fact say something about service of process, we have a first sentence that refers to venue only in Federal courts, and then a second sentence referring to State courts.  But all it does is to clarify that there's concurrent jurisdiction in the State courts. And we just don't see how you can get to conferral of personal jurisdiction in the State courts, especially when we know, very clearly from the legislative record, that Congress was trying to solve two particular problems, the first in the first sentence with venue in Federal courts, and then the second in the sentence -- second sentence with making sure that State courts understood that they could hear these claims. I think it is also noticeable, as Petitioner's counsel suggested, that we have not -- we are not aware of any example in which Congress has used language of this type to confer personal -- or even more explicit language to confer personal jurisdiction in the State courts, and also, that even at the time, back in 1910, Congress knew how to confer personal jurisdiction if it wanted to. We gave examples in -- of the Clayton Act from 1914 in our brief, the Credit Mobilier Act in Petitioner's brief, and then these were also discussed in the Robertson case from 1925.  In that, Congress knows how to do venue versus service of process.  That has continued up through the Court's decision in Omni. So we just don't think that Section 56 should be interpreted to be the first statute -- statute to do it, especially where the implication with respect to the second question would be to say that a company like BNSF is subject to general personal jurisdiction in 28 or more States. If the Court's decisions in Goodyear and Daimler mean anything, it's that that just can't be correct.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The Respondents note what we said in Daimler that, in addition to the State of incorporation and the principal place of business, there may be particular circumstances where another State could be considered their home as well.  And given the volume of activity in the State in terms of the physical plant, it's a railroad, goes through -- I forget the number of employees -- why doesn't that fit in that additional criteria?   Nicole A. Saharsky  Well, the Court described that category very narrowly as a place where the contacts are not just that they are continuous and systematic business contacts, but where they are so significant that you consider the company at home there, that it's like the company's domicile. And the only court -- example that the Court's given of that to this point is the Perkins case where you have the company that actually relocated during the war from the Philippines to Ohio.  And there they said that --   ",16-405X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why is -- why is that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I -- I haven't looked at a route map, but BNSF, I assume, is doing business in a lot of States.  And this would allow plaintiffs, wherever they reside, wherever they are injured, to sue in any one of those States, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even though the injury -- even though the injury occurred somewhere else.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not the unique nature of particular forums? I mean, the -- the discussion in the briefs is that there is a reason that someone, not a resident of Montana, injured in Washington, would want to sue in Montana.  Is that something we ought to take into consideration?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What's -- what's the good reason they would want to sue in Montana?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  That seems -- that seems a little circular.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The -- the Court in Pope didn't mention personal jurisdiction at all.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that's your strongest authority?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The right that -- the right, I think, they're referring to, is the right to proceed in State court, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- which, of course, you'd expect that to deal with the second sentence, because it talks about the concurrent jurisdiction. There's a difference between, you can proceed in State court and the question of whether there's personal jurisdiction in a particular State court.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry.  We don't -- we don't typically think of concurrent State and Federal jurisdiction to refer to subject-matter jurisdiction?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, Pope didn't mention personal jurisdiction.  Did Boyd?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And there is something --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand the notion that railroads -- for those reasons, they obviously have to have a lot of physical plant, they have to have a lot of workers, they, you know, traverse the State.  I understand how that might look like they're at home.  But there are a lot of other industries that have a significant impact.  I don't know, there are interstate banks, airlines.  I suspect that there are agricultural companies that do a lot of business and cover a lot of land and territory. I mean, is your -- your test just that it's a railroad, or -- or how do you decide what other companies and industries are at home in Montana?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So trucking companies? Trucking companies, they carry a lot of goods, too.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no.  I mean, they're going to take -- what is it? -- 95 across -- not 95.  90?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  There you go.  It's that geographical diversity. (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so I-80 across Montana, that's the route they're going to take. They're going to, just like the railroad, is going to follow the railroad tracks.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The truckers are going to follow I-80.   John G.

The -- in the situation in Blackledge, et al., can the government specify that those claims are waived; in other words, spell it out: You are waiving any double jeopardy claim too.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But what about --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about, where does the sufficiency of an indictment fall under that approach? You have a crime. The elements are 1, 2, 3, and 4, but 4 is left out.  The -- the defendant pleads guilty to the crime and, you know, through the colloquy admits to 1, 2, and 3 but 4 -- doesn't admit to 4 because it was left out. Is that something that can be raised on appeal or is that covered by his guilty plea?   ",16-424X

It suggests to me that there's more covered by that than just Blackledge and Menna --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that's not -- that's not -- that's not accurate.  He may not know.  I mean, he enters this plea agreement and the next day this Court issues a decision saying that statute is unconstitutional. You would still hold him to the plea agreement, but he didn't necessarily know he was giving up that claim.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- I'm sorry. What do you mean an open plea?   ",16-424X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I don't know that that makes much sense.  The purpose of the statutes of limitations are to protect the defendants to a large extent, not just the plaintiffs.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, but you just said that, well, you need 30 days because the claims might be different, all sorts of other things, you've learned new information. I -- I'm just not sure that that makes much sense.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. AliKhan.     Loren L. AliKhan  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but I don't understand why acting diligently on the front end gives the plaintiff the ability to be dilatory by a period of two, three, four, five, six years on the back end, because there, yes, there is notice of the claim at the time of federal filing, but once the federal suit has resolved, a period of time has gone by, we would submit 30 days, then the defendant thinks she's not going to refile her state suit. But then she could surprise a defendant by saying two years, three years, four years, and I think this is especially significant in employment cases where you're looking at back-pay awards that run from the time of the adverse employment action, there is a chance for gamesmanship by the plaintiff, which would not happen if we were looking at this as a 30-day period from while the claim is pending and after its dismissal. But I -- I do want to get back to just the structure of the statute as a whole because I think that the provision of this 30-day period, because it is a rarity within the U.S. Code, suggests Congress was doing something other than stop-clock tolling. And I think combined with this self-conscious legislation that defers to state tolling periods, of which this Court was aware, of which Congress was aware, when they were enacting this statute. And so 1367(d) is a precise fit to the problem created by 1367(c).  And that comes from the fact that a -- a case dismissed without prejudice is treated as if it had never been brought.  That means the statute of limitations has been ticking by the whole time. And to save that litigant from being ousted out of a state forum by virtue of that state statute of limitations, Congress said no, we will toll your claim so it will not expire during the federal litigation, and you will have a 30-day window in which to refile. If there are no further questions, thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Eleven minutes, Mr. Unikowsky.     ",16-460X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What do you do with the argument your friend began with, the period of limitations point? I understand your argument would be a lot stronger if it said the statute of limitations is tolled.  But here it says the period of limitation is tolled.  And, to me, that means you're looking at the period and it's suspended, as opposed to just that the provision specifying a period is tolled.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but it's not -- the period doesn't set the bar.  It's -- it's the provision that provides it that does. And so, as I acknowledged, your argument would be stronger if it referred to what it was that set the bar, the statutory provision.  But here it refers to the period itself.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's not -- it's not a radical proposition to say it's a serious intrusion on the state when the state says this is a state claim, these are our courts, we don't want our claim brought in our court if it's more than three years or whatever. And for the federal government to come in and say: Well, you may not like it, but you've got to do it, I -- I think that raises serious constitutional concerns.   INTERRUPTING ",16-460X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kovner.     Rachel P. Kovner  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court in Goodyear and Daimler rejected approaches to general jurisdiction that would allow plaintiff in one State to sue a national company for product liability in all of the other 49 States, calling those approaches exorbitant and unacceptably grasping. The California Supreme Court misunderstood this Court's decisions when it allowed that same result under the label of specific jurisdiction. As this Court explained in Goodyear, specific jurisdiction lets a State exercise authority over activity within its borders, which it has a strong interest in controlling.  But a State lacks a comparable interest in exercising authority over out-of-State defendants for entirely out-of-State conduct.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Justice Breyer.   John G.

And -- and that -- that's why, I mean, you've cited Keeton twice, it's cited innumerable times in your brief.  It is completely sui generis in that respect. I -- it involved the single publication rule, and what that is, it says, this is a restatement, as to any single publication, only one action for damages can be maintained.  All damages suffered in all jurisdictions can be recovered in that one action and a judgment for or against the plaintiff upon the merits of that bars any other action. It's a very, very unique situation that -- that, you know, maps on a position you want to apply generally.  And -- and it seems to me that that's a real overuse of -- of Keeton.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, we're dealing with the jurisdictional rule, and when we do that, we want the rules to be as simple as possible.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you have -- you started out with the four different factors and all that.  But I'm particularly concerned -- your brief at page 54, you say, well, if there were only a handful of people from California and hundreds from Texas or Tennessee, that would be a different case.  By which, I think, you mean it wouldn't satisfy due process, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Well, you have 86 in California and 575 elsewhere.  And there's a difference, I suppose, between handfuls and hundreds and 86 and 575, but where exactly that difference is, it seems to me is going to be impossible to determine.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's right. You say handful in California, hundreds Tennessee and Texas, no good.  86 in California, 575 somewhere else, okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know, but you're articulating a rule that requires businesses trying to figure out where to do business and plaintiffs where to sue and courts whether it's real.  Your rule depends upon some line between handful and -- and hundreds, and 86 and 575. Where is it, exactly?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If there were 20 in California and 575, would that satisfy due process?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But it's your case. You ought to be able to at least answer --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that's the same thing applies, just completely flipped.  They could be doing the same thing in Ohio, saying, we've got a lot of plaintiffs here from California, but we're going to -- we're going to let them sue in Ohio.  And the same thing's going to happen in every other State.  I don't see that it increases the efficiency at all.   ",16-466X

Baker would not have been different if, in addition to having a prohibition on states and individuals, it had said states are preempted if they try to authorize private conduct that's separately barred by the Act.

Roberts, Jr.  No state shall issue?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it seems to me that there would be something a little more odd about it, which is it goes to the fundamental powers and prerogatives of a state to sort of function their own -- own government, if you say you can go so far as to regulate what level of income tax they can charge.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you could imagine a situation where it's the same kind of commandeering.  The federal government wants to reduce expenditures on public employee pensions, so it tells the states there's a state law, you cannot spend more than 20 percent of your budget on -- on state employee pensions.  They're commandeering the state to achieve that result. Can they do that?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't it enough just to say --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Isn't it enough just to say it's illegal for entities, people or otherwise, to engage in gambling on sports events? That would be the federal government regulating this area.

Roberts, Jr.  But, that's a very odd way -- that's a very -- and this is, of course, subsection (2).  It's a very odd way to phrase something.  It's illegal if it's pursuant to state law.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, if the state law says you can do it, that's the only situation in which it's illegal.  If the state law doesn't say anything about it, well, feel free, you can do it.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you seem -- you said subsection (2) is the other side of the coin of subsection (1).  And it seems to me that if that's the case, that subsection (2) cannot be severable from subsection (1).   John G. Roberts, Jr.  To do the same thing, right? Because it says that it is illegal for individuals to follow state law --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- or to engage in activity protected, authorized under state law; which seems to me to be the same thing as saying states shall not authorize individuals to do that.

You know, during the civil rights era, there were a lot of proposals in Congress that said the federal courts have no jurisdiction over any case in which busing is sought as a remedy.  And those types of proposals are consistently submitted whenever Congress attempts to achieve an unconstitutional result by depriving the federal courts of jurisdiction.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is it? If saying Smith wins, isn't that -- what would an unconstitutional statute under the separation of powers look like from your viewpoint?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And -- and so we should -- so we should look at this and decide whether we think this is in substance different from Smith wins?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So Congress has plenary authority to insulate itself from separation-of-powers arguments.  They -- a statute that says in any case in which a statute is alleged to violate the separation of powers, federal courts have no jurisdiction. You think that's okay?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sovereign immunity is --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, but there wouldn't be any challenge to that.  It does seem -- I mean, you say, well, ""relating to"" could mean different things.  And it could, but that would be for a court to decide. And it's not clear how they get to decide what ""relating"" means in light of 2(b), which says if it does relate, it's dismissed automatically.  And I guess I just don't understand how -- well, you're saying it's an open issue how broad Congress's determination that these cases shouldn't be in federal court is?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  On the sovereign immunity question, you know, that is the federal government sort of going nuclear. You know, they're -- they're -- I'm like the king; you can't sue me because I can do no wrong.  And it seems to me there's a real political accountability problem there because this statute doesn't say anything about sovereign immunity.   INTERRUPTING John G.

You're telling the court you have to -- you take this stamp and you stamp dismissed on it. And it doesn't say dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  I suppose we'd have to figure out what the collateral consequences are, since the statute doesn't say.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You aren't dragooning the court into doing something the court doesn't want to do.  You're making them dismiss a case that's pending before them.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that begs the answer -- that begs the answer to the -- the -- the Hart and Wechsler dialogue that when the court -- when Congress strips jurisdiction to achieve an otherwise unconstitutional result, that that's perfectly fine.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  And I think that's a very difficult question.   John G.

Where else in the world would this type of action be brought against -- against -- against a corporation or almost really against anyone? I'm -- I'm concerned about the foreign entanglement issue.  I mean, we passed this statute to avoid foreign entanglements because we wanted to provide a forum for someone like the French ambassador in the Longchamps Affair, but I'm wondering if extending it to corporate liability is, in fact, going to have the same problematic result of increasing our entanglements, as it obviously has here with respect to the government of Jordan.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm not talking about jurisdictions that allow suit against corporate defendants.  I'm talking about a case like this one, foreign activity, a foreign defendant brought in a jurisdiction against a corporation seeking monetary relief like that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  It's my understanding that the availability of this sort of relief is pretty unique here.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Foreign -- foreign corporate defendants?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fletcher.     Brian H. Fletcher  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the government's view, for some of the reasons that Justice Alito alluded to earlier, there's a serious question whether the claims in this case have a sufficient connection to the United States to proceed in U.S. court under the Alien Tort Statute.  But the court of appeals did not reach that important extraterritoriality question because it -- because it relied on its rule that a corporation can never be a defendant in an Alien Tort Statute case. And in our view, that categorical rule is wrong, and the Second Circuit reached the wrong result because it looked to the wrong source of law.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If it -- I'm sorry.  Please finish.   Brian H. Fletcher  I was just going to say we answer the question here by saying, once you've carefully defined those violations of the law of nations that ought to give rise to a remedy in U.S. courts, what should the scope of that remedy be, and when you view it in that lens, we don't see a sound reason to categorically exclude corporate liability.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think this might be a question along the same lines.  On page 7 of your brief, if I could just read one sentence, you say that ""the function of the ATS is to ensure private damages remedies in circumstances where other nations might hold the United States accountable if it did not provide a remedy."" Who's going to hold us accountable, what other nations, in this case, if we didn't provide a remedy?   Brian H. Fletcher  Well, I think there's -- we don't see a reason, and again --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It seems to me the other nations are holding us accountable for providing a remedy.   Brian H. Fletcher  And that's why we say at the tail end of our brief that we have serious questions about whether or not this case belongs in U.S. court precisely because it is extraterritorial potentially.  Again, we haven't expressed a definitive view on that because parts of the record are sealed.  But we understand the principal connection to the U.S. to be the clearing of dollar-denominated transactions through New York, and we've taken the view that that's not sufficient to displace the presumption against extraterritoriality here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Did he -- did he cite legal authority for that proposition?   Brian H. Fletcher  I think -- I can't remember whether he cited it or not.  I know the Court has also limited the scope of respondeat superior under Section 1983 in the Monell decision.  So there are circumstances where corporate liability has been limited. But, certainly, I think for present purposes, all we're asking the Court to do and all the Court needs to do is say there is no categorical bar on corporate liability. And if I could, just before my time runs, I do want to turn to what the government's other important interest in this case, which is that if the Court agrees with us that the corporate liability bar is incorrect and sends the case back down for further proceedings, we think, we'd urge the Court to indicate in its opinion that the Second Circuit ought to address what we regard as a very serious extraterritoriality issue promptly on remand because this case has been a source of international friction and because if that important issue isn't resolved quickly, there may be more international friction from a trial.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement.     Paul D. Clement  There was, which just shows that there's only a toehold of U.S. concern here, which is the dollar clearing transactions in the United States.  And there is a far, far better way for the law to address that concern than with a 33-word jurisdictional statute passed in 1789. And that's really what this comes down to at the end of the day.  I mean, obviously Sosa left the door ajar for some kinds of ATS cases, but with respect, I do not think Sosa left the door ajar for cases like this.  Thank you.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  So you mean they were paid for work by the State --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- as opposed to being -- working for the prosecution for a particular result in a given case.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you say --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- in your -- in your reply brief in -- on page 1, you've got four examples where you say the language clearly shows that they were meant -- meant to be -- I don't know what the word is, but you hope it's not partisan or nonobjective, but aligned experts, I guess.  And the first one, they are supposed to provide assistance that may well be crucial to the defendant's ability to marshal his defense. Well, you can certainly understand the assistance being here is the diagnosis, this is what these medical terms mean, this is what the, you know, rules are or this is -- you know, it doesn't necessarily mean that they are going to be partisan in helping shape the defense. The other one -- another one of the four you say is that they're needed to translate a medical diagnosis into language that will assist the trier of fact.  Well, that doesn't entail partisanship of any kind.  It -- it's simply sort of a medical instruction. You know, this particular term means this, and then the lawyer can go off and develop her defense.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Bright, before you move on to that, you say it's clear.  The LaFave treatise on criminal law -- which I think is, if not the most cited treatise in this Court, certainly one of them -- this is a quote: ""Ake -- Ake appears to have been written so as to be deliberately ambiguous on this point, thus, leaving the issue open for future consideration."" So your position has to be that the LaFave treatise is -- is wrong, it wasn't ambiguous at all --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- it wasn't deliberately ambiguous.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they do, but your position has to be that LaFave made a mistake, the Fifth Circuit made a mistake, eight State courts -- the final State courts made mistakes, the -- on remand in Ake, it was a mistake.  All of those things -- not saying whether you're right or wrong on the merits, but that body of authority that takes a different position would seem to me to establish that the question was ambiguous, at least coming out of Ake, as opposed to clearly established.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Brasher.     Andrew L. Brasher  I think that's a very reasonable hypothesis.  And I think one way -- one way that that hypothesis has some merit is that, when this precise issue about neutral expert versus partisan experts came back up to this Court in Granville, where it was directly presented, this Court didn't grant certs.  And, instead, Justice Marshall was writing a dissent from the denial of the cert. I see that my -- my light is on. Unless the Court has any further questions, I'll just wrap up and say that this case has been going on for over 30 years.  This Federal habeas case has actually been pending for over about 14 years now, and we would respectfully request that the Court affirm the Court of Appeals. Thank you.   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  I guess your phraseology is technically correct, but the government says there's a multifactor analysis that a court would go through to determine that maybe the government's brought its action too late.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you have any idea what percentage of time -- how often a district court does direct that the disgorgement go to a victim as opposed to the government?   ",16-529X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  One reason we have this problem is that the SEC devised this remedy or relied on this remedy without any support from Congress. If Congress had provided, here's a disgorgement remedy, you would expect them, as they typically do, to say, here's a statute of limitations that goes with it.  And including, as your friend says, usually a statute of limitations and an accompanying statute of repose. Now, it was a concern -- you know, Chief Justice Marshall said it was utterly repugnant to the genius of our laws to have a penalty remedy without limit.  Those were the days when you could write something like that and it's about a statute of limitations.  It's utterly repugnant. And it -- the concern, it sees seems to me, is multiplied when it's not only no limitation, but it's something that the government kind of devised on its own.  I mean, I think -- doesn't that cause concern?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's a little circular, yeah.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they're sort of backing --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  They're -- they're sort of backing and filling.  I mean, this remedy is out there, and yes, they're saying this.  But it does seem to me that we kind of have a special obligation to be concerned about how far back the government can go when it's something that Congress did not address because it did not specify the remedy.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Was there --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  All right.  I'm sorry.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about the many cases your client has filed in the lower courts taking the opposite position?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you've argued that you --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You've argued that disgorgement -- that they're not entitled to equitable -- I don't remember if it's tolling or not because disgorgement is -- is punitive?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not entitled to deductions?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- the briefs that were cited in your friend's reply --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  I know.  That's not a very --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, you haven't taken the same -- different positions under the same statute, but we're talking about disgorgement in each case.  I gather your position would be if disgorgement was required under the securities law, that's remedial -- right? -- and -- and therefore is not subject to the statute of limitations.  But if that same defendant tried to deduct that remedial relief, you would say you can't do that because it's punitive. So the same payment is characterized by your client as remedial in one context and punitive in another.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In the SEC context?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So not only is it one thing in one context, but something else in the other context.  Sometimes it's remedial and sometimes it's punitive in each context.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's only with respect to -- that's only with respect to the amount of the remedy, not with respect to liability.  So 20 years from the time that the fraud or whatever is committed, the government can bring an action for disgorgement against -- against the wrongdoer, and that action would proceed, despite this equitable limitation you're talking about.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if we -- if we think that's inappropriate and bad, we're not going to come out the other way because we trust the government not to bring an action like that.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, this has changed a lot after the Gabelli decision.  That was your answer to Justice Ginsburg, that why did you get this huge amount from disgorgement and only a small amount under the other thing.  And you said, well, that was because Gabelli said we have to be bound by a particular construction of the statute of limitations.  And if that cut us off, now we're going to rely on disgorgement to get all the money we -- that the Court said under Gabelli, that you couldn't get.   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does it --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But does it matter to you what -- at what point the Article III determination you say is required is made? I mean, I would think that -- why would it be necessary to do that at the outset? Why wouldn't it be when you get an intervenor who decides -- certainly if he is going to raise a different claim, but also is the one and the plaintiff is not the one imposing particularly burdensome discovery, can you wait until then, when the other party objects, and say, well, now I've got to look at your Article III standing, because you're doing something that changes the litigation?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Harrington.     Sarah E. Harrington  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The best reading of Rule 24(a)(2) is that it requires an intervenor, as a right, to demonstrate that he has Article III standing by showing that he has a cognizable interest cognizable under Article III, and that it could be impaired by the disposition of the pending lawsuit. I'd like to start where Justice Ginsburg started by focusing on how it works, sort of how you establish standing when you're talking about intervenors, and particularly, defendant intervenors. Like Justice Ginsburg, most of the courts of appeals that have held the other way have held that standing is not required, have focused on whether an intervenor can establish standing to initiate a lawsuit. But in our view, that is not the appropriate focus. What the rule itself focuses on is whether an intervenor could be injured by the disposition of the pending lawsuit. And so the -- it's -- it's much more like asking whether a party has standing to appeal than it is like asking whether a party would have standing to initiate a lawsuit.  What you look at is whether there is a particular outcome of the lawsuit that one of the parties is trying to obtain and you ask if that outcome happened, would it injure the intervenor, the potential intervenor, such that that person, the intervenor, would have standing to appeal. And so it's the same whether you're talking about a plaintiff or a defendant.  Now, they have to have an interest that's related to the underlying dispute, but their injury comes from the disposition of the lawsuit.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  In -- in what sense, if any, is your position different from that of the Petitioner's?   Sarah E. Harrington  I think it's not particularly different.  You know, I think they take sort of, you know, a stronger line than we do on the constitutional question.  Our view is that you could -- I think everyone here agrees that there are some things a party -- a litigant would do that don't require standing, like presenting oral argument, filing briefs. There are some things that do require standing, like seeking damages, filing a new claim. There are -- in our view, there are some other things in the middle that are kind of fuzzy.  In our view, as a theoretical matter, you can imagine a system where a person could easily obtain the label ""intervenor,"" and then a court could later inquire into that intervenor's standing, if and when they did something that would require standing. We think, as a matter of reading the rule, that the rule -- that the drafters of the rule have -- have required that inquiry up front.  We think the requirements of -- of Rule 24(a)(2) are best read to map onto the Article III requirement --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I -- I'm not sure I understood your answer to the question.  You said that this person does not have to show standing, Article III standing, in the first instance, but if she tries to do something different than what the plaintiff is doing, she does?   Sarah E. Harrington  Yes.  I mean, I thought the question was, if there was a -- setting aside Rule 24(a), if there was a statute that authorized intervention --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so you think it is satisfactory to -- it satisfies the constitutional requirement of standing if Congress says you have standing?   Sarah E. Harrington  No.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.   Sarah E. Harrington  No, the question was, if Congress says a party can intervene as of right, and doesn't require a showing of standing.  We don't think that is a violation of the Constitution, as long as you don't let that intervenor later do something that requires standing --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dvoretzky.     Shay Dvoretzky  To an as -- if it were an as-applied challenge, then an additional plaintiff would need to show standing because the question, again, is what is the court ordering the defendant to do.  That's the touchstone for the relief.  And if an additional plaintiff is asking for different relief, then it requires standing.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

It's all right to allow them to intervene as a party? Because there is a case or controversy.  They don't -- you know, they wouldn't satisfy Article III standing, but they don't have to, according to you.  So their views are valuable, their participation in, you know, depositions, discovery, all might help the Court, so why not?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, I know.  But I'm asking a constitutional question, putting aside exactly what the rule is. If you say, all there has to be is an existing case or controversy, and once there is, you don't care whether the person has standing, Congress could pass a statute saying anybody who the Court thinks is appropriate -- you know, an expert in the area, qualified with a record or whatever, they can jump in and participate as a party, and you would say that's okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, I can't tell whether that's a yes or a no.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That type of proceeding is okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- I hope I haven't given Congress an idea, but -- (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, is that consistent with what we've said, that Article III standing plays an essential role in the separation of powers?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what if it's a -- as it goes along, the defendant says, well, I'm going to settle with the original plaintiff.  Okay? You know, he's raised this claim.  I'm going to do this, but I -- I'm still going to litigate against the -- the Sierra Club.  Is that okay?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The Second Circuit has assumed otherwise, right? It decided this case on the assumption that there wasn't Article III standing, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  Well -- so now you're arguing before us that, in fact, you do have Article III standing, so that if we agree with you, the -- the Second Circuit decision that it's not necessary would -- would stand, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The -- the question you want us to decide is a real estate law question under New York law.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I -- I may not.  What -- what is the -- the legal case you have where the Court has granted judgment in favor of a party without standing? Other than treble pitch or putting that aside.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, no.  No.  No. I know that, but that's -- that's -- those cases are distinct, in that the Court is saying they need not inquire further because those are separate parties, but they're all seeking the same relief.  It may be necessary at some point for the Court to inquire further if it determines that the party is seeking to exercise authority beyond Article III. Sure, you don't have to decide cases that might never come up or issues that might never come up, but I don't see how that helps you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, no.  But then the question becomes if you are, then, exercising the authority to issue subpoenas with respect to other parties, you're exercising the authority of the court in a way that expands beyond what the particular plaintiff was seeking.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that just seems to me to be circular.  I guess I was looking for a reason why that is so.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's the argument -- your argument in your brief, you focus on case or controversy.  There has to be a case or controversy.  But we have said, repeatedly, that the Article III standing is an element of the case or controversy requirement.  And so I don't know how you can put Article III standing to one side, while -- while saying it's okay, because we still have a case or controversy.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No.  With respect to a particular party, you don't -- you don't just ask is there an injury.  You say, has the plaintiff been injured? You don't just ask is there redressability? You say is -- is his injury redressed? I don't see how you can just carve off one part of the -- of the test for standing.   INTERRUPTING ",16-605X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  One -- one thing a good appellate lawyer will do is pare down the issues that are presented on appeal, even if they think that some of those issues have merit.  I mean, if you have six issues that you think you can argue credibly before the -- before the appellate court, you may decide it would be much better to focus that court on the two or three strongest issues, that adding the others will, in fact, dilute from the value of that. So when you have these -- I'm not talking about this particular case.  But in general, when you have the claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, it's sometimes easy in retrospect to say, well, here's an issue that, you know, maybe -- the appellate counsel, in the exercise of discretion, thought it was like number 6 in the order of -- of strength.  And you look back and in hindsight you say, well, he should have made more of that, and it's not even mentioned at all in the appellate brief. I mean, I know there's also issues of trial strategy, but it seems it's more typical in an appellate case that you have -- you know, you leave things off the table.  Is -- is that going to present a problem, in your view, in evaluating the effectiveness of appellate counsel?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  One -- one significant distinction, of course, is that these claims of appellate assistance -- ineffective appellate assistance of counsel, under the logic can be raised in every State.  Martinez, Trevino, it's only where the State has funneled the decisions to collateral review. Appellate claims like this, you know, obviously can't be brought on appeal in every State, and so this would arise, in terms of evaluating the statistics, it would be many, many times the numbers of Martinez claims that you see, and we see -- and -- and there are now an awful lot of Martinez claims anyway.

Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry to cut you off, but I -- I understand that, but that's going to be true in every State, right? It's going to be -- you're going to have the same difficulty of raising ineffectiveness of appellate counsel on direct review in every -- every State.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah.  Martinez, one of the important considerations at least for some in Martinez is that it is narrow.

Roberts, Jr.  So -- so the number that are granted really isn't the consideration we're looking to, is it? It's the number that are going to force the courts to review them.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I mean, are you saying it would have been hard to formulate? Are you suggesting that someone facing this sentence that Mr. Davila is facing would say, well, let's not do that, let's not raise an ineffective assistance of appellate counsel or somewhere and said, because it's just too hard to formulate that claim? These are situations where the defendant is facing capital punishment where they are going to raise every possible claim they can, and I don't know why it would be terribly different for defendants facing life in prison or further sentences.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Keller.     Scott A. Keller  But it will be predicated on an underlying trial issue. And that's the difference.  The trial IAC claim in Martinez, that was the trial error.  That was the particular trial error the court was concerned about, and that unique bedrock right. Here, in contrast, when the Court has recognized repeatedly that appeals are quite different from trials, and that an appellate IAC claim is necessarily predicated upon an alleged trial error, the Court has adjudicated that alleged trial error.  And separating it out and just saying that the appellate IAC claim itself has not been raised, that has to be seen, though, in the context that the underlying claim has. If there are no further questions, we ask the Court to affirm the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kretzer, three minutes.     ",16-6219

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  The issues of equitable considerations, special circumstances that you talk about, are there limits to those? I mean, let's say the issue comes up three years later.  Can the district court at that point consider to extend the time to appeal?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The -- the rule by its terms, I suppose, it says you've got to file the motion no later than 30 days after the time proscribed under Rule 4(a), right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But then it's quite clear that that's not jurisdictional, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I'm talking about the time to file the motion for an extension.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The motion for an extension?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they also said these were only technical changes, right?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Stewart.     Damien G. Stewart  So the problem with that reasoning is that the district court providing the additional time gave her some right.  The district court didn't have the authority in the first place to give that time.  And that's because of Rule 4 and Rule 26. Rule 4 says that a party has 30 days to file a notice of appeal.  Rule 4(a)(5)(C) allows the district court to extend that period to an additional 30 days but no more.  And Rule 26 says that courts have the authority to extend the time to comply with the rules, with the exception of Rule 4. So there was no opportunity for the district court to provide any further days, other than what is set forth in Rule 4.  So the Court didn't have the authority to give her the time that it did.  Ms. Hamer didn't have a right to file the notice of appeal when she did.  That's why it's mandatory. If there are no further questions.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Herstoff, 10 minutes.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, that -- that doesn't seem right to me.  I mean, the relief they want is that they can't be sued, right, or they win.

John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if he is ever able to submit under (e)(2), it would be because it's a new rule of constitutional law -- I'm just looking at the statute here -- or a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered.  And if it could not have been previously discovered, it seems to me you won't be able to make a case of ineffective assistance of counsel.  It's not ineffective if he couldn't have discovered it.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Uh-huh.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I would have thought he did fail to develop it.  You just have an excuse, I guess, a reason why he shouldn't be faulted in your view, and that's because of the ineffective assistance of counsel.

0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think that --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand that point, which is -- the end result of which is that it seems to me that you can make all of your arguments under the guise of the test that the Petitioner proposes, which is, the course, the reasonable attorney working with finite resources. I have something of the same problem that Justice Alito has.  I -- I don't see that it would be terribly valuable for us to spend the time trying to figure out is reasonable necessary; is that the same as substantial need or not? And even if we come out and say one or the other, I don't know that it's going to get to the heart of the question, which is what is exact -- exactly is the district court judge supposed to do or -- so why -- what's wrong with asking when a reasonable attorney working with finite resources would devote resources to that service?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, I can see -- I have a question about how the two parts of the statute worked. The first says reasonably necessary. And then there's the ""may"" question. Now, it would seem to me, I mean, it can work one of two ways.  In other words, the discretion that is granted to the district court could go to the question about whether something is reasonably necessary, the sort of things we've been talking about. I mean, maybe it's necessary if you haven't done anything, but maybe if you're saying, well, I think if I ask the parents a third time, maybe they'd give me a different answer. Or is it necessarily a two-step process where the judge has to make a determination: Is this reasonably necessary, and, if it is, then the district court judge can still deny it because it says ""may""? Which of those do you think is how the statute should be read?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I was hoping you were going to say the first.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Because under the first it does seem to me that all the stuff we've been talking about, you know, did they get the school records or not, did they talk to this person or not, how much did -- it strikes me that those are the sorts of things that would be very hard for a court in the normal -- an appellate court in the normal course to get into. On the other hand, it seems to me there are also things that you could say to the district judge.  They do these discretionary rulings all the time.  They're much more familiar than we are with how these sorts of mitigation investigations are conducted.  So that if the ""may"" goes into what's reasonably necessary, it seems to me that makes sense. If, however, you say the statute requires an inquiry, is this reasonably necessary, and then the district court has this unusual power to say, even though it meets the statutory standard, I'm not going to do it.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry, I lost -- what -- what's correct?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but if you have it -- I think in Foster it was pertinent in the analysis of the -- the lower state court determination was certainly evidence of what the issues were and were not decided.  But I've read the footnote carefully, and I don't see anything in there that suggested that that was a -- an absolute rule of law.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I thought the logic -- the logic would be, though, that it is unusual for a court reviewing a procedural determination, if you can't tell, because it's silent, you would normally not assume the court went on to the merits when the lower court said there was a procedural bar. But when it's simply merits decisions in both cases, the -- the argument anyway is that that's a different situation.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Warren.     Sarah Hawkins Warren  Well, I would certainly resist that characterization, but I would say that Ylst's purpose, as it was originally conceived, is consistent with and complementary to the inquiry that this Court later set out in Harrington versus Richter. And so using Ylst for the purpose that Ylst was originally intended, which is to identify the state court bars and to preserve them, which is a probable assumption, where silence may very well equal consent, that -- that respects comity in its own way by ensuring that state court procedural bars are not vitiated by later state court summary opinions. Here, asking this Court to make sure that the Georgia Supreme Court or any higher state court of the land does not have infirm reasoning imputed on it when they are faced with both reasonable and unreasonable bases on which to sustain the denial of relief also serves comity and is the best -- and is in service of federalism and comity in that set of cases where it matters the most, when that lower state court may contain an infirmity. And for that reason, the presumption that is the thread running throughout Petitioner's argument, the presumption that the lower state court's reasons are the same as the last state court's decision cannot stand.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is -- what is the relationship between your position and the takings clause? The government can certainly diminish the value of your property rights quite extensively when it comes up with new -- new regulation. You have a lot that you think you could have built a mansion on, and then the government passes a law and you can only build a shed on it and -- and yet we often say -- or give the government a lot of leeway in saying that -- that they don't have to pay compensation. So, if the government can restrict your property right in real property to that extent, why can't it do so with respect to patent rights?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Kise.     Christopher M. Kise  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Stewart.     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner and some of the questions from this Court have identified two potential challenges to the inter partes review procedure. The first is that this can't be done by executive branch officials because the effect of patent cancellation is to take away a private property interest. The second -- and this is Petitioner's argument -- is that this can't be done in the way that it's being done because the PTAB is using adversarial procedures.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, how can -- how does that work since this patent was issued before there was inter partes review, before the America Invents Act?     There was ex parte reexamination.  There was the possibility of judicial proceedings in which patent validity could be called into question.  Take --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but there was -- I mean, inter partes review changed those things.  It is something different.     It changed --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Including particularly with respect to the procedures.     Well, to go directly to your question about public employees, because I think it is a good analogy, the Court has said that if a public employee has tenure protection, a guarantee that he or she can be fired only for cause, then the employee has a property right in this job --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, sure. That's just defining what the sweet is.  But I -- it sounds to me like your position is if the government says you're hired for this job and if we terminate you, you know, we'll flip a coin and decide whether or not you get to stay or not.     No, first, the procedures still have to be fair.  They have to comport with due process to determine whether you, in fact, committed the acts that would justify a termination for cause. But I want to make two points about that.  The first is, even though the firing would have to comply with the Due Process Clause, there's no rule that it could only be done by an Article III court.  Executive branch officials make decisions all the time that tenured federal employees should be fired because they have done things that justify their termination for cause.  The federal government has to use fair procedures when it makes that decision.  It's subject to judicial review.  But the decision can be made in the first instance by executive branch officials. The second thing --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does it comport to due process to change the composition of the adjudicatory body halfway through the proceeding?     This has been done on three occasions.  It's been done at the institution stage.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So I'll rephrase the question.  Was it illegal under those three occasions?     I don't think it was illegal.  It had functional similarities to a court of appeals granting rehearing en banc because the full court doesn't like the initial panel decision.  I think it was less extreme than that.  My understanding of the cases is that the chief judge was concerned that the initial --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  The chief judge?     The chief judge of the   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You're talking about the executive employee?     An executive branch official.  The chief judge of the PTAB --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  When we say ""judge,"" we usually mean something else.     Okay. (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How did that case come out?     I -- I don't know how the institution decisions came out.  This has not been done at the merits stage, if you will, when patentability was actually being -- being determined.  But our primary point would be that if there's a constitutional flaw in that procedure, then a person who is actually harmed by its use in a particular case --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'd like to just touch on more directly the Schor test for whether something is or is not a public right. And as I understand it, it says five different factors that you consider.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Consent, this, this, this, and other things.  And I'm wondering if that is a sufficiently stable and predictive test when you're talking about something like a property right? In other words, as Justice Breyer mentioned, people invest in their patents to the tunes of billions of dollars in building the plant that's going to make the product that's -- and all that, and yet when you're deciding -- when they're deciding is this a right that I can securely rely on, they've got to go through these five factors, you know, any one of which can be determinative in a particular case.     I guess the -- the first thing I would say about cases like Schor and Stern versus Marshall and Northern Pipeline is that they are really directed at a different sort of problem.  In -- in each of those canonic -- canonical cases, the adjudicator was being asked to determine whether one party was liable to another for a violation of law. And in each case, the -- the adjudicator was being asked to impose a money damages remedy -- was asked to direct one person to pay money to another, and that's kind of a classic judicial function. And the question was can that be performed by non-Article III federal adjudicators as well? And the answer was sometimes yes, sometimes no.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.

If you want the sweet of having a patent, you've got to take the bitter that the government might reevaluate it at some subsequent point.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, haven't our cases rejected that -- that proposition? I'm thinking of the public employment cases, the welfare benefits cases.  We've said you -- you cannot put someone in that position.  You cannot say, if you take public employment, we can terminate you in a way that's inconsistent with due process.   INTERRUPTING John G.

The IRS --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What are the limits of that proposition? I mean, I don't quite understand, you're saying because these three government agencies interpreted the statute one way, we shouldn't be more -- we should be inclined to interpret it that way?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Right.  It's just -- maybe it's that I've never understood Skidmore.  To me, anyway, as it's been articulated, it seems to be the principle as you should defer to agencies when you agree with their interpretation. (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And -- and I don't see --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, the statute means -- the statute means what it means, and it's nice that these agencies have interpreted it your way.  But I think we have to go back and interpret the statute ourselves.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr Stewart.     Malcolm L. Stewart  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to first to pick up on a point that Ms. Blatt alluded to when she was describing the -- the history of the statute and its amendment.  I think the statute in its current form is probably not the type of provision that Congress would draft if it were doing the whole thing in one fell swoop.  But it's important to understand that the text of the -- the current provision is the combination of things that were done in 1974 and things that were done in 1980. Congress enacted the original church plan provision.  Presumably, it had in mind particular plans that were established and maintained by churches and it covered those; and pretty quickly, problems came to light.  Other types of plans were found not to be covered by the administrative agency that Congress evidently believed should be covered.  And so when Congress amended the provision in 1980, it chose to work within the existing framework.  We're not quite sure why, but at least one plausible explanation would be there were some church plans that had been found to be covered under the old ""established and maintained by a church"" language.  Congress may have wanted to avoid any possible inference that those plans were no longer covered, and so it retained the original language, but defined it to include something else. And when Congress passed the -- the provision that Ms. Blatt was discussing earlier, (C)(i), that refers to a plan established and maintained for its employees includes a plan maintained by a principal purpose organization, I -- I think it's -- it's helpful to recognize that there are two different sorts of definitional provisions that Congress sometimes enacts. Sometimes when Congress enacts a definition, it's trying to clarify what the defined term really means.  And when Congress acts in that way, we tend to strain to read the definition in a way that makes it consistent with ordinary understandings of a defined term.  But sometimes Congress will enact a provision that says something like the -- for purposes of this statute, the term ""State"" includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  When Congress does that, it's not trying to explain what State really means; it's simply using a shorthand formulation to say, for purposes of this statute, we want D.C. and Puerto Rico to be treated the same way that the 50 States would be treated.  And that's really what Congress was doing in the 1980 amendment. When it defined the term ""plan established and maintained by a church"" to include plans that satisfied the prerequisites in the amendments, it -- it was not saying this is what a plan established and maintained by a church really is.  It was saying, for purposes of the exempt -- of the church plan exemption, we want these to be treated the same.   ",16-74XX
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, isn't there -- didn't Congress provide for church involvement by making the employees covered by the principal-purpose entity church employees?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, the -- the church agency employees.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If that -- if that were so evident, why do the three government agencies responsible in this area -- the IRS, the Department of Labor, the PBGC -- why for 30 years did they take the opposite view?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That -- that's standard language in a private letter ruling, isn't it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  No.  But --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- well, but you -- I guess you began with that, and the church is involved to the extent the law says that the principal purpose is -- agency is maintaining that fund for people who are defined to be church employees.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you can't say the church is not involved in that -- in the situation before us.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the church -- the church --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But they have involvement with the church agency, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So I thought the whole concern with the original IRS problem was that the IRS was treating church agencies as if they were not engaged in a church function.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They were saying -- they were saying, okay, the -- the church has an agency whose mission is to, you know, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, all of that, and the IRS was saying, well, that's not a church; it's got nothing to do with it. And now it's changed and those -- those individuals that are engaged in that social mission are treated as members of the church agency.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  The church agency.

Roberts, Jr.  I thought the whole purpose was to avoid that inquiry.  I mean, that was the mistake that the IRS made, is that it was saying these church agencies were actually not part of the church --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- because they weren't engaged in sacerdotal or whatever activities that the IRS thought characterized what a church should be.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What the -- what was the tenor --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What was the tenor of the hundreds and hundreds of letters that -- that Congress received about what the IRS was doing?

I mean, look, normally, I don't think you really draw any inference through -- from the amici that aren't here, but, you know, if you told me that, wow, there's this provision that's in the code that's specifically designed to protect your interests, and the Seventh Circuit adopted a narrow construction of it, and it's going up to the Supreme Court of the United States, and they will decide the scope of this exemption that protects your industry, I mean, if -- if you had any thought that you were not fully protected by the Respondent's view as much as the Petitioner's view, I would think it would be worth your while to file an amicus brief. And the fact that they're not here, I think, underscores that the entities that Congress was trying to protect are fully protected by our view, and they're fully protected by the Petitioner's view.  It's just so is the rest of the world.

Roberts, Jr.  That's an element of the offense.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, if a lawyer says it's obvious that you did cross state lines, you've got 48 witnesses, I'm not going to argue that you didn't cross state lines; and the person says that's an element of the offense, you have to say I didn't or withdraw.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  So the lawyer gets up, look, they've got to prove these things.  Crossing state lines, that's clearly proved, but we want to talk about these other things.  So that violates this fundamental right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, I know. You -- you know how hypotheticals work.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  This is a different case.  And I just want to make sure that I understand that your position is that the lawyer cannot vouch for any element of the defense, not just that, you know, it was self-defense, not that you didn't shoot him, all that, but any element of an offense, if the lawyer tells the jury that that's satisfied contrary to the client's wishes, that violates the --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So I did not -- I did not cross the Pennsylvania state line in the course of committing this crime.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's okay if --   John G.

Your -- the lawyer does not go in and say the client did it, but the client says I want you to say I didn't do it -- that's a very clever defense you have on mens rea, but I want you to say I didn't do it.

He said I've got this -- and so, if that's not the case, I don't want to make it an easier case on second degree.  Our only chance is to defeat first-degree murder and here's how I'm going to do it; so you cannot stand up and say that he's -- he's guilty because that's just getting me life in prison and that's worse.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, and these are all reasons that you would consider when the question is -- when there's an objection and the question is raised.  Here, we're dealing with a situation when there was no objection, so we're in the context of plain error.  So it seems to me that you have to argue more than just this was wrong and it ought to be fixed.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I -- I think the basis for your -- or perhaps a basis for your exception is that the error is so precise, you know, a typographical error has caused the person to stay in jail for -- to have to stay in jail for another six months.  A typographical error and exactly six months. So I think one of the considerations we take into account is the reputation for the judicial system, justice system.  And if you tell somebody, well, because of a typo, the guy is going to stay in jail for six more months, people will say, well, that's not -- that's not fair. On the other hand, I don't think that takes into account there is cost associated with that, which is the -- the remedy is you send it back for another sentencing hearing, who knows how long, how much time has passed. The judge has to reconstruct the whole operation.  And that's caused by your client's failure to object when he should have objected. So why doesn't it make sense to say that it kind of makes a difference, if you're talking about a relatively insignificant amount of time -- any day in jail is not insignificant -- but there's a difference between an error that results in an additional six months and an error that results in an additional five years. Is that something that the court can consider, or is it -- I guess it's the first question I asked.  Is your position one day and it's plain error?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ellis.     Jonathan Y. Ellis  Yes.  So the Court identified that in Molina-Martinez as a way to mitigate the costs.  It's really about the third prong because the third prong is, is there a reasonable probability of a different sentence? And so you can answer that.  Ask the judge.  But if the judge says yes, there's still the fourth prong and there's still the full resentencing that follows. Post-Molina-Martinez, we haven't found any examples of courts utilizing that for a guidelines range error.  In fact, the Seventh Circuit has said that's not about guideline range errors.  That's about the Booker errors and whether they treated the guidelines as advisory or mandatory. If there are no further questions, we'd ask the Court to affirm the judgment below.   John G.

Aditya Bamzai  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: This Court lacks Article III jurisdiction to issue the writs in these cases. The CAAF is an executive branch entity, something that I believe the government does not dispute.  This Court's direct review of executive branch officials is necessarily original, not appellate, as established by Marbury itself. These two propositions decide this case.  Now, my friends on the other side have made the argument by analogy to the territorial and D.C. courts, and that's the principal and, in fact, it's the only argument on which they rely, but it's very important for this Court to understand that that is a slippery slope to go down because territorial and D.C. government is very different in a number of respects. And so, for example, I understood the Court to be asking, well, if -- if the Court were to apply the territorial cases, such as United States versus Coe, permitting review from the highest court in the territory to military courts, then wouldn't that open up the possibility that review would be permissible from other adjudicatory bodies in the federal agencies, many of which can be characterized as courts under the definition offered by my friend, such as the tax court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I -- I understand your argument that they're different because of -- but I don't understand what possible pertinence the fact that they cover a territory as opposed to a subject matter has to do with your Article III objection.   Aditya Bamzai  Your Honor, it's both. It's the -- the -- the reason why territorial courts were created, and this is Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in American Insurance versus Canter points this out, that -- that Article III courts, under the understanding of Article III at the time, may not have been able to resolve certain disputes that were necessary, just in order to govern a group of people, such as divorce disputes, things of that nature.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So your doctrine wouldn't apply if, you know, the Article III Court couldn't do it, then you'd have to say it's all right for them to do it in a way that seems inconsistent with your theory?   Aditya Bamzai  Not at all, Your Honor. What I'm -- what I'm pointing out is that the territorial courts were created for a certain reason, and that is that they stepped into the shoes of state courts where state courts were not available. And that explains why certain principles of the structural separation of powers don't apply within the territories and D.C.  It also --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why don't you take another couple minutes.   Aditya Bamzai  Thank you, Your Honor.

Roberts, Jr.  You'll have a couple minutes for rebuttal. General Francisco.     Noel J. Francisco  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I could begin with Justice Kennedy's question.  Justice Kennedy, we think that Ohio's process was permissible before Congress enacted the clarification amendment in 2002, but the clarification amendment made it even clearer for two basic reasons. First, sections 8(c) and 8(d), that's the Postal Service process and the notice process, require that non-voting be the immediate cause for removal.  The only way you can -- you can construe 8(b)(2) as not prohibiting that is if 8(b)(2) is limited to removing people only solely by reason of their failure to vote. And, second, this reflected a significant shift in the federal/state balance at the time.  Prior to the NVRA, many states removed people solely for failure to vote. Others had notice processes that were far less protective than Ohio's notice process.  None of them had a four-year waiting period. What the NVRA did was it required everybody to improve their processes well beyond what they were before the NVRA was passed, but beyond that, left the states with flexibility.  And there's nothing in the statute that says that, within that range of flexibility, states are barred from using a non-voting trigger in conjunction with 8(d)'s protective notice process.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, General.   Noel J. Francisco  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Mr. Smith.     Paul M. Smith  And so, you know, the process is vastly overbroad in its design to try to find this relatively small group of people, starting with 50 or 60 percent in an -- in an -- in an off-year election don't vote; 70 percent don't return the notice.  You're just going to end up with a lot of false positives in the end, and that is, in fact, how the system is -- is operating. It -- it finds a lot of people that supposedly have moved who simply haven't moved. I think I'll leave it at that, Your Honor.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Murphy.     INTERRUPTING ",16-980X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what about people -- Justice Breyer's question also included people who moved.  What about them?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about Justice --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so the triggering event can be the failure to vote? I would have thought that's inconsistent with the rest of your argument, which says what's wrong with this case is that they used failure to vote to trigger the sending of the notice.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But -- but, I mean, then I would -- the response is really the -- the substance of your argument, which is it's still triggered by the failure to vote, and the law says you cannot use failure to vote in -- in one of these processes.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that -- is that true? I mean, you think there is a constitutional right not to vote?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I understand it's a statutory.  But there are many democracies that require you to vote, right? Australia, it's -- you get a fine if you don't vote.  And other places.  And I have certainly seen it proposed that it would be a good idea, given the low voter turnouts in our country, that we adopt something like that as well. Now, you think that would be unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it doesn't --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- it doesn't tell them nothing.  It tells them that they did not respond to a notice that says you're going to lose the registration if you don't vote through the two years, two elections.  So it tells them something.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  They have more evidence than just that they haven't voted. And you've indicated that under some circumstances, the method of the notification as we have in the states that you reference in pages 14 to 15, that that is okay, even though it's triggered solely by the failure to vote. So I -- I don't think you can maintain in a principled way the acceptance of the validity of those states' positions and -- and your argument against the position here.  Now, you may say: Well, it makes a difference because of the -- the -- the -- the quality of the information you get from one notice or another, but you can't just attack this on the basis that it's triggered by the failure to vote. You have to say failure to vote, plus a method of notification that you think is not sufficient, because you do think in other cases failure to vote plus a different method of notification would be okay.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Now, maybe your position still is the same, but it can't just base on the fact of failure to vote being the trigger.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but they say they get more information.  It's not just that it's not -- you know, that it's not returned, but that they've gotten the notice and they haven't voted in the subsequent elections.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, maybe I'm just repeating myself, but --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- you don't just have the failure -- maybe we're both just repeating. (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  We -- we don't -- you don't just have the failure to vote. You have the failure to vote, plus the notification that you need to do something because you haven't voted. Now, in some situations, you think the notification is sufficient, so you would say in those, it's not just the failure to vote.  But in this case, you say the notification is not sufficient, so it is just the failure to vote.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, I understand that, but the point is that your argument then really turns on the adequacy of the notice and not simply the fact that the notice is triggered by a failure to vote.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, of course, the decisions of the ALJs in every case aren't operative until the Commission issues an order of finality, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. General Wall.     Jeffrey B. Wall  Petitioners think it repeats the problem.  We disagree.  I think the problem that Petitioners have, they don't engage with any of the authorities.  The circuit court cases we cited in our reply, like Gordon and Legi-tech, both of the restatements on agency, the Mechem treatise, all of them say, and the courts have uniformly held, if the agent does a thing that is not authorized at the time, but the principal is capable of doing it, though here the Commission didn't, and it's capable at the time it ratifies, it can ratify. And we do think that solves the problem, which is one of the reasons -- to get back to a couple of the questions earlier -- I don't think that the kind of sky is falling arguments here are very persuasive.  Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Metlitsky.     Anton Metlitsky  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Other than a narrow historically-grounded exception concerning diplomatic offices, an officer of the United States is someone with power to bind the government or private parties in the name of his own office. In contrast, someone whose acts have no binding effect without the sanction of an officer is not himself an officer of the United States.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If I were trying to figure out who an officer is, I think I might have started with Freytag.  And your test that you just proposed doesn't seem similar to what Freytag talked about, which was a laundry list -- not that long perhaps -- of particular -- particular authorities.  And I don't see, other than the contempt power, I suppose, what's different here than in Freytag.   Anton Metlitsky  Well, the contempt power, I think, is crucial.  So in -- in Freytag -- there are two alternative holdings in Freytag.  The second one is clearly consistent with our rule that's about the fact that special trial judges can enter final decisions. The first alternative holding is that special trial judges are officers of the United States because they can preside over trials, rule on the admissibility of evidence, take testimony, and enforce their own discovery orders through contempt. Now contempt clearly is a power that can only be exercised by an officer of the United States.  It's a coercive power that binds the parties. This Court never considered a position that only included one or all or some of the first three authorities.  But the Office of Legal Counsel, the Attorney General, and Congress have, for more than a century, all concluded that, for example, commissions that are set up to investigate but that don't have any binding authority at the end of the investigation do not set up offices of the United States --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does that make --   Anton Metlitsky  And the --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does that make Chief Justice Warren an executive officer in that situation?   Anton Metlitsky  No.  No.  The Warren Commission did not create an office, and it couldn't have created an office because the Commission included four congressmen, which would have been barred by the incompatibility clause, if it did create an office. The reason it didn't is because all of those powers are understood to be non-binding powers but powers internal to a hearing that allow the person that's presiding over the hearing to figure out what happened --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you said on -- your -- your friend, Mr. Perry, said in his reply brief, ""This Court has never held that an adjudicatory official is not an officer."" Do you agree with that?   Anton Metlitsky  Yes, but an adjudicatory official is somebody that gets to decide a case, to -- to bind the parties at the end of the day.  That's why, for example, in Stern against Marshall, what this Court was concerned about, about non-Article III judges adjudicating private rights, was that they could issue final judgments of the United States.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so --   Anton Metlitsky  That's what Justice Alito's --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry, go ahead.   Anton Metlitsky  Justice Alito's concurrence -- your concurrence in the -- in the Amtrak case identified a -- an Appointments Clause problem with binding arbitration, binding.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if -- if the statute said the ALJ decision -- there you can seek review within 90 days; if after 90 days review hasn't been granted, that decision is final.  Would that be a different case for you, or would the mere possibility of discretionary review mean that the adjudicatory official did not have binding authority?   Anton Metlitsky  So I think that's a harder case than this case.  So, in this case, the -- the finality order grants affirmative sanction to the decision.  And the rule since at least 1822 --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But your friend says that's really just a notice, that we're not going to review it.   Anton Metlitsky  Well, it's -- they say that, but what -- what the finality orders all actually say is that the orders contained in the initial decision are hereby declared effective. It's -- it's affirmative sanction granted to the decision.  And since at least the main Supreme Court's or Supreme Judicial Court's opinion in 1822, somebody who doesn't act, that can't take effect without the sanction of an officer is not an officer of the United States, which is precisely what's going on here. Now, in your hypo, there's -- there's a distinction between a decision that becomes effective by itself but that then can be reviewed.  That's like what happens in the courts of appeals and, you know, petitions for cert in this Court.  And I don't think anybody is reasonably going to say that this Court is fully responsible for every court of appeals decision. There's a different kind of order that cannot take effect at all without the act of a superior.  The act might be plenary review or it might just be denying review.  Like I said, I think that's a harder case, and I think the question would turn on whether you could reasonably hold the superior accountable for the decision by virtue of the fact that he decided not to engage in plenary review and instead denied review.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  One of the principles that caused the drafters to give the authority to appoint officers to the president was the important one of accountability.   Anton Metlitsky  Exactly.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And in this case, if -- if the individual were an officer, he would have to be appointed by the Commission, and people would know who was responsible for whatever conduct or misconduct or decisions he would -- he would take. But in this case, you don't have that accountability.  The Commission can say: Don't blame us.  We didn't do it.  The President can say: Don't blame me.  I didn't appoint them. And, instead, it's something in the administrative bureaucracy which operates as insulation from the political accountability that the drafters of the Constitution intended.   Anton Metlitsky  Right.  So -- so I think that is the fundamental question in the case.  And I -- I respectfully disagree, Mr. Chief Justice, for two reasons. I think the Commission is going to be held 100 percent accountable for every single decision, whether it's initially made by an ALJ or not, for two reasons: First, they affirmatively sanction it.  That's why the long-standing rule that if an act requires affirmative section -- sanction, that the person that did that act is not an officer. That's why that rule exists. Second, even if you disagree that the ALJ's decisions -- if you think they're binding, the way that Congress set up the structure here makes clear that the decision is always the decision of the Commission. The Commission is allowed to delegate authority to an ALJ or to other delegees under 78d-1(a).  Congress gives the Commission authority under subsection (b) to engage in plenary review.  But Congress does not allow the Commission to escape responsibility if it doesn't engage in plenary review, because subsection (c) says that every decision is going to be deemed the decision of the Commission. So, if somebody comes to the Commission and says that decision was -- you know, was bad, was wrong, the Commission cannot say, oh, I don't know, that was my ALJ.  That would be like me saying I don't know, that was my associate, like a judge saying I don't know, that was my law clerk.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So are you saying that anybody whose decisions are subject to review can never be an officer?   Anton Metlitsky  No, no, not at all. But --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I thought you were suggesting that the reason that the ALJs are not officers is that the Commission has the discretionary power to review their decisions?   Anton Metlitsky  No.  So --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And you -- and you seem to be putting a lot of -- I'm sorry, go ahead.   Anton Metlitsky  No.  So -- so they are not officers for -- for two reasons: One is that they don't have, in our view, decisions to make binding -- the authority to make binding decisions in the first place. And, second, because all the authority -- if they had authority to make binding decisions, that authority would be to make binding decisions that are actually decisions of the Commission --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And it seems to me, I mean, we've heard about the independence of the adjudicator.  You seem to be suggesting that he is not an officer because he doesn't have the kind of independence that it's been suggested the APA and other things were designed to promote.   Anton Metlitsky  Well, no.  So the APA was -- was a compromise.  It granted ALJs structural independence: Tenure, salary, various ex parte rules and the like, but the one thing they explicitly did not grant ALJs was decision-making authority, policy-making authority; in other words, the authority to make binding decisions. That power always rests with the agency, which is the crucial question for whether somebody is an officer of the United States.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You said --   John G.

And what you're suggesting is that to make things clearer for the courts of appeals down the road, those justices should talk about these hypothetical cases, about how they would apply the rule in the event, you know, that this or that happens.

Roberts, Jr.  Do you really think that Twombly and Iqbal require the degree of specificity that you postulated, that the only cases that are going to be successfully brought are when the person has a hat on that says that he's a member of a particular group, and the officer says: I don't normally arrest people, but because of your hat with a political message, I'm going to arrest you? Do you really think -- is it a bit of an exaggeration when you say Twombly and Iqbal are going to keep everything but that case out of court?   INTERRUPTING John G.

They're going to Redmond, Washington, and saying you have to turn this over to us. It's not the government's fault that it's located overseas.  I suspect the government doesn't care.  Just like any other subpoena where you go, and Mr. Dreeben used the example of funds, but it could be any other evidence. And if there is a particular objection by the government where the information is located, they're free to raise that and the government will have to deal with that.  But I gather that's not the situation here.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- there -- there is nothing under your position that prevents Microsoft from storing United States communications, every one of them, either in Canada or Mexico or anywhere else, and then telling their customers: Don't worry if the government wants to get access to your communications; they won't be able to, unless they go through this MLAT procedure, which -- which is costly and time-consuming.  Could you provide that service to your customers?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well -- I'm sorry.  In -- in what way is their service seriously compromised if the server is overseas?

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I know, but my basic point, and I'm not sure that you've answered it, is that there is nothing that prevents Microsoft -- in other words, an e-mail from me to somebody on the other side of the building that is going to be stored somewhere else would be protected from disclosure, if people, the government, wanted access in the normal course of a criminal investigation where they have a warrant establishing probable cause.

INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I mean, I know that doesn't mean it's -- it's done, but it certainly makes it a lot easier for you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, there is the countervailing interest, which, of course, is the safety of those in the courtroom and the safety of the judges.  And your scenario of the person coming in from Newgate, I -- I understand, that's one individual. Here, according to the -- the -- the record from the marshals, you have many situations where there are a lot of people, and the idea that they're going to undertake an individualized determination in every case is just something that they don't have the resources or time for.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, but there are situations where in term -- for pretrial decisions, you do have more than one person.  I mean, there -- there are -- according to what the marshals say, there are many people in the courtroom, or waiting to get in the courtroom, and presumably, in many cases, the lawyer is going to say: I don't want the client to be shackled. And then you have to have an individual determination, right, where the -- the -- the -- the assistant U.S. attorney, whoever it is, comes in and says: Well, here's why we think you should.  And the lawyer says no.  And then the judge has to make a decision on that --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- for every one of however many people are there.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I suppose -- I suppose there are many situations where people don't know much about the individual, right? The situation we have here where, for example, there are many people -- like the recidivist clients, obviously, you know something, but they arrest somebody and bring them in and the question is should they be detained, and they don't know anything about them.

The elections in 2012, 2014, and 2016, suggest that maybe 2018, you're not going to be irreparably harmed in a broader sense.  Obviously, you argue you would be in this particular election, but if you've been willing to accept that harm in three different cycles, I don't know if we should get concerned about irreparable harm for one more.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, if you look at 20 -- you -- you did not file the suit presenting this particular theory of the case until 2016.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What would that -- what would that --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, it's not simply a question of -- we have held that, in a preliminary injunction context, you do not have to consider the merits if you think the equities and the irreparable harm questions cut against the grant of a preliminary injunction.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  No, no, you're asking us to --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- decide the merits and determine from that whether there's been an abuse of discretion.  I understand that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And what I'm suggesting, most -- I guess the strongest case is the Winter case from a few years ago, where we said if the equities and the harm question cuts strongly in one direction, we don't have to consider the merits at all without determining that there has or hasn't been an abuse of discretion.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, I think that's exactly -- I think that's exactly right, that the Court can pick out of the different criteria which one it wants to base its decision on.  And I think it's part of your challenge today to explain to us why we should pick out the hardest one.   John G.

In other words, it would seem to me that there are so many alternative approaches that the idea of saying this one way of achieving a particular result was the only possible way.

Is it appropriate in a case like this to look at what the district looks like in terms of the boundaries and the extent to which it complies with traditional redistricting criteria? I mean, part of the issue here is you have people from, you know, Potomac joined with people from the far west panhandle.   INTERRUPTING John G.

Roberts, Jr.  -- people, and -- and part of the objection here to the way it was redrawn is that it's -- it doesn't seem to have any internal logic.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you've made -- just to clear up, I meant to ask it before, a factual question.  You said the state was 60/40 Democrat/Republican?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's just the identified party.  How -- what's the percentage of independents in Maryland?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that a pertinent consideration in deciding whether something's been a partisan gerrymander?   John G.

Roberts, Jr.  What did the referendum question ask?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Is that what it said, the plan that had been drawn up? I thought it -- well, I can look at it.   INTERRUPTING John G.

And, certainly, I think your -- your friends on the other side suggest that the question -- the -- the phrasing of the question on the referendum was opaque.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, one difference between -- one difference between the race and partisanship is that we've always recognized that a certain degree of partisanship is acceptable.  We've never recognized that a certain degree of racial discrimination is acceptable.   ",17-333X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  But what about -- what about honoring Rule 23? It seems to me that you're creating an exception to the rule. If you just read it on its face, the statute of limitations hasn't run because of American Pipe and Crown, Cork, so why shouldn't that rule be available to you?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So -- so what they all have to do is they all have to file individual claims, every -- every member of the class?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick.     David C. Frederick  So leaving that aside, I think that if you were to do that, you would affirm on a separate basis, but the judgment of the Ninth Circuit would be upheld and the case would be timely and allowed to go forward. I think that the -- the principal difficulty from it as a doctrinal matter is that the Court has not tended to use these types of equitable arguments as a way of having Rule 23 operate as a toggle on and off switch. And that, I think, is where you have a certain amount of analytical difficulty. The way we have proposed the solution to this case is if the claim is timely and it's timely as an individual matter, the individual can bring in, under Rule 23, that is a very straightforward, clean, simple rule. So, if you were to then look at, say, we don't accept the simple rule, we want to have something a little bit more complex, I think at the very least you would say: Was the plaintiff who brought that adequate to represent the class and was there a deficiency in the adequacy of that representation? And I think to that extent, you would then have to look hard at what were the various factors that went into that adequacy.  It becomes a much more complicated question when I think, as the Court has told us, we want these timing rules generally to be simple and straightforward so that litigants know how to follow them. But certainly, as a matter of equity, it does not seem fair where you're talking about a rule that is allowing potentially meritorious claims to go forward to be snuffed out simply because the person who got to the courthouse first happened not to be competent in bringing about the kind of case that would be representative of all of the various plaintiffs.

I mean, if you have a requirement, you know, you must have these four things in your -- in your order, and you have -- and you fill them out and you've got all four, and then you've got another one that's not required, it seems to me that that might be invalid, but -- but you can't say it's insufficient.  You've got everything you have to -- have to have. And yet, you're saying if you add something else, it's insufficient.  It seems to me it might be invalid under the statute as you say, you can't do what the fifth thing says, but I don't see why -- why it would be insufficient.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, but you need them to define ""insufficient"" to mean ""invalid.""   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, what about invalidity? Forget I said inadequacy. You have to say that ""insufficient"" -- you have to say that ""invalid"" is the same as ""insufficient.""   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You didn't -- the -- the order didn't need any statement with regard to the territorial limitation, did it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  If that were not in this order, the order would still be sufficient, correct?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you -- do you have any authority for that?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Do you have any judicial authority interpreting the statute?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You keep --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  You keep mixing, as you just did, ""insufficient"" and ""invalid."" And I want to make sure I understand your view on it. If somebody told you to bring to a party apples, bananas, and pears, and you brought apples, bananas, pears, and cherries, the person would not say that's insufficient. Right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Who would do that? I'm sorry. (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Tripp.     Zachary D. Tripp  Yeah, this is something I wanted to clarify.  So -- so we did not use any evidence that was the fruit of the poisonous tree.  We did not use any evidence obtained any -- under any order where we did any interception outside Kansas. There were 10 orders entered in this case.  For nine of them, including all the orders covering Petitioner's phones and all the orders we relied on at trial, interception was all in Kansas. For the one remaining order, we did the interception at the DEA headquarters in St. Louis, where there was better Spanish language capability.  But we didn't use any evidence under that order at this trial here. I think also one -- one point I really do want to emphasize here is that I think our -- our primary interest in this case is in being sure that the Court not adopt Petitioner's very extreme rule where as -- as long as there is any statutory violation of any kind apparent on the face of an order, then you automatically and mechanically need to suppress all of the evidence obtained under that order no matter what, even when there's no causal link between the error and the interception of the evidence. That would be very damaging.  I think this case is a -- a good example of -- of -- of why that frankly doesn't make all that much sense. I have a lot of trouble imagining -- excuse me -- that any Congress would knowingly enact that rule.  I admit that this statute is ambiguous.  You could potentially read it Petitioner's way. But I think, with all due respect to Petitioners, it is also ambiguous and you could read it our way: That insufficiency only means some errors, not all of them. Only some things make an order insufficient.  Some -- this error just made it overbroad, not insufficient.  And -- and, regardless, even if you disagree with that, that -- that you can sever the mistake, the orders here were not insufficient to authorize the interception of these communications inside Kansas, and that's the only evidence we relied on in this trial. So, if there's no further questions, I'm asking the Court to affirm.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Shanmugam.     INTERRUPTING ",17-43XX

I mean, what if it just says, okay, our normal process, we try to get you in, you know, the third day of the second month or something, we always try, and then it turns out they're not going to be able to, so they say, okay, we'll try again. I mean, it's like when you get a traffic ticket and want to challenge it.

We don't quite know when we're going to have the, you know, available hearing officers and all that, and we'll let you know.

Frederick Liu  Right.  Well, I think the Court applies the same functional approach that it's applied in Becker, in Scarborough with respect to fee applications, in Gonzalez v. Thaler with -- with respect to certificates of appealability, in Edelman with respect to charges filed with the EEOC.  And I think the -- the Court does have to have some understanding of what the function of that document is. The statute here makes plain what the function of this document is.  It is to initiate removal proceedings. I think it's also fair to look at the function of the stop-time rule, and the function of the stop-time rule is to basically say to the alien: Look, while it's true that being physically present in the United States builds some sort of reasonable reliance interests up to a point, it's no longer reasonable to rely on being in the United States once the government has given you a -- a notice to appear that tells you that the government intends to remove you. It was the point of the stop-time rule to make the stop-time determination turn on the beginning of the proceedings, not at things that would happen later. And if you're looking at legislative history, Justice Sotomayor, this is 143 Congressional Record S12266, where Congress, again, amending the statute to make clear that the old orders to show cause that lacked a date would qualify, said the reason we're doing this isn't because of some housekeeping measure but for the substantive reason, the affirmative reason, that we think the stop-time calculation should be made at the very beginning of the proceedings and shouldn't be affected by things like how crowded the immigration courts are, which could affect the timing of the hearing and, in turn, the -- the timing of the hearing notice. I -- I think my -- my friend in the reply brief puts a lot of weight on the word ""under"" and -- and says that the word ""under"" should be read to mean in accordance with. You know, this Court has said ""under"" is a chameleon and it must be understood in its context.  And if there's one meaning of ""under"" that the context here rules out, it is the ""in accordance"" definition because, as I have said, (b)(5), Congress used those exact words.  So we know that, when it wanted to express something different, it used a different word, as it did here. If there are no further questions, we ask that the judgment be affirmed.   John G.

So they're already covered. And the work-arounds that some of the states have employed are also bringing more in.

I don't have that -- that figure. If there are no further questions, I thank the Court.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. General Jackley, five minutes remaining.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry. Maybe they already -- maybe they already have and they've made a decision or at least majorities have made a decision that this is something they're going to leave the way it has been for, whatever it is, 25 years.  I think it would be very strange for us to tell Congress it ought to do something in any particular area.  Just a thought.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is the reliance --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What is the reliance you're talking about, other than the retroactivity question?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the -- the assumption, when you're talking about stare decisis, is that the decision was wrong.  So you're saying they've made business decisions on the basis of an erroneous decision, when the decision is based on the fact that -- well, that use taxes are not being paid.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  In other words, the benefit comes from them, not just from the fact that they don't have to collect, but from the fact that most people aren't paying use taxes.   ",17-494X
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kovner.     Rachel P. Kovner  That's right.  These -- these are going to be valued for purposes of the income tax.  Nobody disputes that.  And we think that once they're valued for purposes of the income tax, they're -- they're also -- that value should be ascribed to them for purposes of the RRTA tax. If there are no further questions, I would ask that the Court affirm.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Dupree.     INTERRUPTING ",17-530X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  You -- you would agree, wouldn't you, that not every form of stock qualifies under your definition? Justice Kennedy mentioned non-publicly traded stock.  I suppose there are some entities in which their stock is particularly volatile, I mean, you can expect it to change between the time you get the options or the actual stock and -- and when you liquidate it. How are we supposed to tell which stock counts and which doesn't?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  When you say covered too, you mean that counts as money remuneration?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about bushels -- bushels of wheat? It's readily convertible into cash on the Chicago Commodities Exchange.  So, if somebody gave you 20 bushels of wheat, you would count that as money remuneration?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, okay, they give you a little -- they say, okay, here, you're entitled to buy 20 bushels of wheat on the commodity exchange.  Does that count as money remuneration?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Sure.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If we were --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If we were to agree with you, we would have to assume that whoever wrote this statute was told we want you to include money remuneration and stock remuneration; and he said, well, a good way to do that would be to say ""money remuneration."" Right? You're -- you're asking us to accept that, aren't you?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- I'm not -- I'm not saying there isn't a broader use and someone might understand it, but I think if you wanted to be even close to being clear, or reasonably clear, and you want to include both money and stock, you wouldn't pick the phrase ""money.""   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You would either say ""money and stock,"" or you might say, as you suggested, is something readily reducible -- ascertainable value readily reducible to cash.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You -- you think that's the only reasonable -- I -- I didn't think your argument went that far.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  I thought in some places where you're talking about the regulations, your idea was it was ""a"" reasonable one.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Saying it's the only reasonable one is a bit of a stretch.   ",17-530X
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  I -- I suppose you're not arguing that that's true in every case.  For example, if the record or the proceedings indicated exactly what the people were talking about, they were debating a particular point and that would explain it, that would be enough, right?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Go ahead, please.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  So if --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if he just says same -- same reasons as before?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Before he's done a fairly, you know, the usual, what's required under 3553, and those are the same -- what he's saying, those are the same things that is -- that are motivating him in this new context, same reasons as before?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So you'd be fine? I mean, that gives you -- you say that would give you the grounds you want to present on appeal, just as you've articulated here.  So that ought to be fine as far as you're concerned?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I think you'd be -- I think you'd be better off with the other rule.  I mean, if you have something that looks out of the ordinary in the -- in the resentencing and the judge hasn't said anything, I think that gives you a stronger basis for appeal than -- you say, well, all he's got to do is have a couple of words. Well, a couple of words and then you're out of -- out of the appellate court.  But if he doesn't say anything, you've got a stronger argument. He hasn't justified it.  It's not that there's no basis for appellate review.  It's that you have a strong case because nothing's on the record to support what has been done.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yeah, but it depends on the -- the range of the departure. In other words, if whatever you think is what it should look like or the norm, you mention in your brief an argument about where you thought it should be proportionately, and if it's out of whack, and nothing is said, it seems to me you have a stronger case than what you've suggested is what -- you -- you lose if he puts in just a few words that shows that he considered the pertinent factors.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if it was the -- I think a lot of your objection, right, and a lot of the appeal of your objection is the boilerplate language.  What if the judge had actually, you know, written it out? I mean, it seems the way you're saying it, the -- the actual language, he says I've taken into account the policy statement, I've taken into account those factors, to the extent they're applicable, this is what I think. I think if you had seen that in an order written out, you know, that based on what you've said, that would seem to be sufficient. I -- it -- it seems to me your objection is -- in other words, you don't -- you don't really believe it when it's just a check in a box. You think, well, he really hasn't done that; he's just checking the box. But what would be wrong with the language that he's checked in the absence of the -- the boilerplate aspect?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  General Rosenstein.     Rod J. Rosenstein  Thank you, Your Honor.   John G.

1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if they --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- a judge is -- has had, you know, 600 of these resentencings, every time just checks the box, 600, he's done nothing but check the box, and the results are a little off; sometimes it's high, sometimes it's low; you can't really tell why? Do you have the same position?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Even if it's -- even if he's done it 600 times, never done anything but check the box, you still presume that he's giving the careful consideration in each of those cases?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If there were -- if your --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If your position prevails, why would any district judge ever say anything about why he -- his position on resentencing?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, a judge who -- under what circumstances was a judge -- would a judge who did just that be subject to reversal?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, like -- like what? I'm -- I'm saying the judge doesn't say anything, and you say the presumption is that he adequately considered all of the factors and all that.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  What type of evidence in the record would suggest that that wasn't the case?   ",17-5639
0,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin.     Eric J. Feigin  So Dillon addresses the fact that this isn't a full resentencing proceeding.  And I was responding to Justice Kagan's suggestion that the government had effectively acquiesced to Section 3582(c)(2) relief when it, in a case, again, not this case, where substantial assistance sentencing was done improperly and the government hadn't appealed. I -- I'd also like to quickly address opposing counsel's suggestion that we're creating sentencing disparities.  I think they're creating sentencing disparities in three different ways. The first is a timing disparity. Again, under our view of how substantial assistance works, which is the law of all the circuits that have addressed it, and I think the only fair reading of the statutes, they would have a very strange timing disparity where they're entitled to Section 3582(c)(2) relief simply because they were sentenced before Amendment 782, whereas identically situated defendants sentenced today wouldn't get relief.  I think Justice Ginsburg pointed this out earlier. The second disparity that I think exists here is the one I was pointing out to Justice Breyer, which is that you have Amendment 782, which has nothing to do with cooperators and only has to do with the appropriate sentences for defendants convicted of drug crimes, and yet the -- as to two different defendants, both of whom Congress believed committed the same crime and deserved the same statutory minimum, only the cooperator gets the benefit of the Commission's judgment on a matter that the Commission's judgment isn't controlling because we know what Congress specifically thought because there's a statutory minimum. And the third disparity is one I've mentioned a few times here today, which is that, again, I think there would be an anomaly in their view of how substantial assistance sentencing works. Even if we get rid of that very odd situation that I think would come up quite a bit when the guidelines were mandatory and shows Congress couldn't have intended it to work the way they're suggesting, I still think it is very odd for Congress to have enacted a statute that would allow a defendant who is sentenced to a statutory minimum and then cooperates to presumptively receive a sentence -- the same sentence if he had -- that he would have gotten if he hadn't cooperated and if he committed a different crime. Section 3553(f) illustrates that Congress knew exactly how to write language of the sort the Petitioners want to read into 3553(e). Although 3553(f) was enacted later, they're not unrelated provisions.  They're the only two provisions of Section 3553(e) that allow sentencing below a minimum -- that allow sentencing below a minimum under any circumstances.  And Congress naturally would have viewed them as related. Thank you.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Thirteen minutes, Mr. Fisher.     INTERRUPTING ",17-5716

And if you do look at it, in -- in other places immediately surrounding this, it does say 994 and then the subsections, and here it just says 994.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Which suggests that all of the guidelines should be taken into account.   INTERRUPTING ",17-5716
1,"John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  I have a question on the merits. You put a lot of weight on the adoption in 2013 of the court-drawn 20 -- what, 2012, 2011?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  2012 plan. And I -- I think a concern, though, is that the district court plan was not comprehensive.  It -- it was put in quickly based -- it was preliminary, as opposed to permanent. And I wonder if that undermines the weight you can place on it?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler.     Allison J.

Roberts, Jr.  Well, but the judge -- the court gave the -- the governor three days --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- to call an election.  And, I mean, if you were the governor, would you think, well, maybe we're not going to be able to use the 2018 plans?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Counsel, you were the one who said you wanted to have one more word on the jurisdictional issue.  But on the -- (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  On the -- on the merits, it seems a strong argument, which you dismiss as just sort of wanting to end the litigation, which is usually a good thing, for the legislature to say: Okay, this is the plan, I understand it's preliminary and all that, but to move things along, this is the plan the district court drew.  That's what we're going to go with. It does seem to me that at the very least, and I understand this to be the point on the other side, that ought to give them some presumption of good faith moving forward, which is significant on the determination of their intent to discriminate.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, they were not changed, but that -- surely, the district court could draw a map; you don't have to change every single district when you're -- you're looking at what you think is an appropriate map for two -- two elections to go forward under.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Does -- is your answer different if they did alter every single district in Texas?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  How -- how -- how many of the Texas districts were redrawn or altered?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  You've got a couple more minutes too.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Riggs.     John G. Roberts, Jr.  I'm sorry, I've lost track of the -- which districting are you talking about with respect to 105? Was it 20 -- the 2011 or 20 --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.  Sorry.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Are these --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Go ahead. Are -- are these districts that the district court in entering its preliminary map looked at? Is that your -- is that where I am on this, is that these are things that the district court changed but didn't have this additional information before it?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  It did it -- it did it when? In the 2012 order?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But if you're the Attorney General or -- or the -- the legislature in Texas and you want to take your best shot at a plan that will be accepted by the district court, wouldn't you take the plan that the district court drafted?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, who was doing the masking? The district court when it drew up the preliminary plan?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That's --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Go ahead.  No, I'm done.  Okay.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And that -- and that -- don't you have to suggest that that was the intent that the district court had when it imposed the interim plan? Because keep in mind, this -- this evil intent that you're attributing comes from adopting the plan that the district court adopted and let the elections go forward under for two cycles.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But the intent doesn't have to encompass any racial animus?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Not a deep, hateful place.

Let's suppose that the intelligence agencies go to the President and say, we have 100 percent solid information that, on a particular day, 20 nationals from Syria are going to enter the United States with chemical and biological weapons.  They could kill tens of thousands of Americans. In that situation, could the President ban the entry of Syrian nationals on that one day?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, just to stop, interrupt you there.  I mean, what if it's a week? What if it's a week a month from now? That's what the intelligence information is. In other words, I'm trying to --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- respond to your point that it has to be an immediate decision.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, imagine -- imagine, if you can, that Congress is unable to act when the President asked for legislation. (Laughter.)   John G. Roberts, Jr.  And someone introduces a bill saying let's authorize -- first of all, the President may have qualms about sharing that absolute intelligence broadly, but let's say there's a bill introduced to say let's authorize the President and there's a bill introduced to say let's block the President, and neither bill moves.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What if the military advisors tell the President that, in their judgment, the President ought to order a strike, an air strike against Syria, and the President says, well -- does that mean he can't because you would regard that as discrimination against a majority Muslim country?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  So, under 1182(f), you would say that there's no problem under that provision?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Well, any type of targeted action that would have a impact on the Muslim population.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  Why under your theory wouldn't that constitute or the argument would be that that's discrimination under your Establishment Clause argument --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- that that's discrimination on the basis of faith because he has said in the past, if you accept the --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- accept the arguments, that he -- he is anti-Muslim?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  He can never --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  But that's in the abstract.  I mean, they may have more -- the President may have more particular problems in light of particular situations developing on the ground, and, yes, Congress addressed the question of the adequacy of vetting, but those questions arise in particular contexts. And it seems to me a difficult argument to say that Congress was prescient enough to address any particular factual situation that might arise.   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  What about -- what about a change of administration in a particular country --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- in which perhaps the vetting procedures are not going to be taken seriously?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  That Congress could not have anticipated?   John G. Roberts, Jr.  If your -- your argument based on discrimination based on the campaign statements, is there a statute of -- no the one that you do make based on the campaign statements, is there a statute of limitations on that, or is that a ban from presidential findings for the rest of the administration?   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  My question was on the --   John G. Roberts, Jr.  Yes.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  My question, of course --   INTERRUPTING John G. Roberts, Jr.  -- was not on 1152.   John G. Roberts, Jr.  My question was whether or not the inhibition on the ability to -- to enter one of the proclamations applies forever?   INTERRUPTING John G.
