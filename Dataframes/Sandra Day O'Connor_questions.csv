The second point is that what the... the absence of private actions for retaliation shows is that title IX's remedial apparatus is kicking along just fine without the implied right of action.

Why do they want to pay the cost of having a mechanic disassemble an engine unless they have a good reason for doing it?

0,"Sandra Day O'Connor  Well, is it the case, though, that other courts of appeal at the Federal level have concluded that the Tax Injunction Act does not bar suits that would increase State revenues rather than reduce them, that the purpose of the Tax Injunction Act was to prevent reduction of State tax revenues, specifically by corporations coming in and getting injunctions and preventing the State from receiving revenues, but that it doesn't apply where the effect of the... the suit would be to increase the State's coffers?   INTERRUPTING Sandra Day O'Connor  First of all, with the courts of appeal, the majority have so held, I guess, who have addressed it.

Now, can EPA, under the statute, say, Alaska, you just didn't follow the required procedures?   Sandra Day O'Connor  Well, isn't that an element here in fact?  Wasn't that part of EPA's concern?  Is it true that the owner of the mine wouldn't even furnish certain financial information to enable the State to make that analysis?   INTERRUPTING Sandra Day O'Connor  Well, I don't...

It can also bring a civil suit for injunctive or monetary relief.

1,"Sandra Day O'Connor  Mr. Phillips, it... the Ninth Circuit in its opinion on about page 8a in the appendix said, Hernandez raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was denied reemployment because of his past record of drug addiction.  And I'm concerned that the court may have said there is a genuine issue of fact here, that it wasn't clear whether there was a no-hire policy that was either adopted or if it was used in this case, that there's something else at stake due to the different responses of the man who wrote the letter versus the woman who actually made the decision, and that there's some issue of fact here.  Now, if that's the case, maybe the rest of the opinion is just dicta.  I don't know.   Sandra Day O'Connor  I might agree with you that a no-hire policy, if that's what was used, is certainly not unlawful.  But if there is a genuine issue of fact here, what... what do we do?

0,"Sandra Day O'Connor  Well, don't you think that the Federal Circuit may have focused too much on generic drug applications?  Do you think it was right about that?   Sandra Day O'Connor  Well, it seemed to be driven by its very narrow focus on generic drug development.  Do you... do you think that the efficacy of the drug being suggested plays a role in the IND application?   Sandra Day O'Connor  See, I think there may be a difference there, because I think the other side thinks that how the drug is expected to work, in practice, and whether it, in fact, will attack a certain disease, is part of what the FDA looks at.  Apparently, the Government takes that position, as narrowly as I could determine.  But you reject that, as well.   INTERRUPTING Sandra Day O'Connor  Can you repeat that 355 what?   INTERRUPTING Sandra Day O'Connor  --(i)--   INTERRUPTING Sandra Day O'Connor  --Uh-huh.   INTERRUPTING Sandra Day O'Connor  But does the... does the statute... is that the only place we would look to decide whether safety is the only consideration for the FDA?   INTERRUPTING Sandra Day O'Connor  But you do--   Sandra Day O'Connor  --you do agree, do you not, that the Government does not agree with you on this point?   Sandra Day O'Connor  Right.   Sandra Day O'Connor  Yeah, but it's absolutely clear, I thought, that the FDA, at the end of the day in some of these drug applications, ends up looking at not only safety, but how effective it is.  And sometimes if the safety risk is minimal but the effectiveness is great, I understood at least, that could affect the decisions.  So, I would think that you would want to encourage the exemption to cover those matters.   INTERRUPTING Sandra Day O'Connor  Well, I'm not sure.  If there's data earlier, at IND stage, as a result of the lab tests and the animal tests, I would think that would be part of the exemption.   INTERRUPTING Sandra Day O'Connor  Well, we don't... I hope we don't have to, at this Court, look at all the evidence and try to sort it out that way.  What we have to focus on is whether the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was in error in articulating the scope of the exemption.   INTERRUPTING Sandra Day O'Connor  No.   INTERRUPTING Sandra Day O'Connor  Well, I thought the issue was whether the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit correctly determined the scope of the exemption.  If they were wrong about it, then it is open to us to correct that and send it back.   INTERRUPTING Sandra Day O'Connor  Exemption.  The statutory exemption.  I thought that was what we were looking at.   INTERRUPTING Sandra Day O'Connor  Well, but it's certainly... that the FDA considers only safety, and nothing else, that it was directed at generic drugs, not others, and that there was a cutoff point earlier than that argued by the Government and the Petitioner for what is exempt preclinical trial information.

0,"Sandra Day O'Connor  Well, but typically these plans like 401(k) plans permit hardship withdrawals, and other plans that are mentioned in the act allow withdrawals for medical reasons or to buy housing or something like that.

I think it is reasonably clear that Congress spoke very broadly in the Act, and the question, for me, turns on whether Lopez and Morrison dictate some concerns with its application in this context.   Sandra Day O'Connor  Well, but in Wickard, of course, you had a wheat grower, a small farmer, and his wheat did, in part, go in the national market.  You don't have that here.  As I understand it, if California's law applies, then none of this home-grown or medical-use marijuana will be on any interstate market.  And it is in the area of something traditionally regulated by states.  So how do you distinguish Morrison?  And how do you distinguish Lopez?   Sandra Day O'Connor  Well, in looking at this broad challenge, do we have to assume that the State of California will enforce its law?  I mean, if it turns out that it isn't and that marijuana is getting in the interstate market, that might be a different thing.   Sandra Day O'Connor  Well, I do take issue with that.  As I read the record in Wickard, it involved a small farmer.  A portion of his wheat went on the interstate market.  It also was fed to cattle, which, in turn, went on the interstate market.  He used some of it himself, but part of it was commercial.  I think Wickard can be distinguished on the facts.

Sandra Day O'Connor  Well, what if we think that's not correct, that it is not the equivalent of a guilty plea?  There was some cross examination.  There was some participation.  So if we don't accept your statement that it is the functional equivalent, then what standard do we employ for the tacit consent or the failure to affirmatively respond?
