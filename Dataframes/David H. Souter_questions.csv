0,"David H. Souter  Mr. Feinerman, may I go back to your own hypothetical of a moment ago in which this crime has been committed, people don't want to be seen talking to the police, so the police might set up a roadblock under those circumstances.  What about the same situation in which the police say...  and I suppose it would be reasonable in your hypo that they need to talk to a lot more people than simply the ones who were driving in cars...  on your reasoning, could the police, in effect, cordon off sidewalks so that any pedestrian coming down the sidewalk would have to pass through sort of a chute at the end and could not get through with stopping to talk to the police officer and answer questions in order to get through?   David H. Souter  Well, they...  they...  they do in the sense that we...  we recognize certain rights to stop the motorist because of the regulated nature and the highly dangerous nature of the...  of the driving enterprise.  But here we're talking about stops which bear absolutely no relation to the regulation of motor vehicles.  The only reason for the stop in the case that you're defending, and the only reason for the stop in my hypo is that there may be an opportunity to gather evidence from a citizen who won't come forward but would answer a question.  So it seems to me that the difference between cars and pedestrians has nothing to do with the...  the...  the answer to my question.  Am I wrong there?   David H. Souter  No, but the...  no, but the justification for interfering with their freedom of movement is not the justification that's involved in this stop.  You're not looking for impaired motorists.  You're not checking licenses and registration.  You're simply stopping motorists because they might have seen a crime, and in the extension of your hypo I'm talking the pedestrian who might have seen a crime or have some evidence of it.  They're in exactly the same situation.  If you can stop the cars, why can't you stop the pedestrians?   David H. Souter  You...  you mentioned that this is a good way to get at the people you want to get to.  Is there any indication that there...  anything of value was obtained in the investigation of this crime in this particular roadblock, or do you have any information across the...  from...  from broader statistics across the nation about the effectiveness of doing this?   David H. Souter  If...  if the police had...  if the police had asked the local news to...  to broadcast a 2-minute clip of a police officer saying, we're having trouble finding the perpetrator of this crime, please come forward, wouldn't that have gotten the same result?   David H. Souter  Why...  why does the distinction...  you've mentioned it and...  and Mr. Feinerman mentioned it...  why does the distinction between cars and pedestrians apply in a case in which the...  the justification for making that distinction, regulation, a risk of impaired driving, does not apply?   David H. Souter  No, but my expectation of freedom of movement in the car is that, yeah, the police can stop to...  for a sobriety checkpoint and I'll assume they can...  they can stop to...  to check my...  my license and the registration of the car, but I also assume that they can't, you know, barring today, the result of today's case, I...  I'm assuming that they...  they can't stop me for...  for other reasons, barring some really exigent circumstance.  And if that expectation is reasonable, and I think it has been at least up until today, then I think my expectation is...  is the same as the pedestrian's expectation, barring the...  the regulatory authority of...  of exercising the regulatory authority, which is not in...  in issue here.   David H. Souter  You're...  you're saying that because they might have observed or...  or observed evidence in the exercise of their privilege that that would be a regulatory basis for stopping them in the cars, whereas there wouldn't be any such basis for the pedestrian?   David H. Souter  And...  and we understand that when...  when there's something pretty contemporaneous between the stopping and the...  and the accident.  That's what I had in mind with exigency.  But do we...  is...  is it such a common practice that a week later or two weeks later...   David H. Souter  I got mixed up...   ",02-1060
1,"David H. Souter  But if...  if they hired someone like Justice Scalia to go on the screen and describe it...     [Laughter]   David H. Souter  big audience.   David H. Souter  Oh, okay.  Mr. Ramsell, there's something I'd like you to comment on.  The...  the Illinois Supreme Court was...  was concerned about the...  the effect of...  of this practice, in effect, in opening the door to stops all the time.  They said, you know, there are loads of crimes and if it's justified here it will be justified in other cases and so on, and there have been some questions from the bench to that effect.  One answer to that might be that under the law as it stands now the police can conduct sobriety checkpoints and we will assume that they can make license and registration checks and things like that.  So the...  the police already have an opportunity, to put it bluntly, to abuse their right to stop if they want to do it.  Is there any indication that there is this kind of abuse going on, and hence, is there any reason to believe that the abuse would be greater if this practice passed muster than it is under the existing law?   David H. Souter  But what...  what do we know?  Empirically, what we do know?  What is...  has there...  has there been an indication of abuse?  Is there a reason to believe that this invitation, this tool, would be abused more than the tools that they now have?   David H. Souter  But why...  why?   David H. Souter  Well, it makes for great publicity to...  to have sobriety checkpoints.  That's one reason why they have them.   ",02-1060
1,"David H. Souter  One of your... I think it was yours, rather an amicus argument for... for reading 113 is you say it would have a bearing on reading 107, and that was that Congress didn't want to permit suits prior to some definitive resolution of a claim, whether it be by settlement or whatnot.  And the reason was that if... if the one joint tortfeasor could sue prior to that time, there would be liability against another who would still be open to action by EPA--   David H. Souter  --or even yet a third joint tortfeasor.  Their response to that was EPA resolves lots of actions without complete cleanup, so that the possibility, even in contribution cases that you would allow, would be later EPA action against another polluter.  What... what is your response to that, if I've got it right?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So you're really disputing the... the fact of... of their response?  In other words, they say, look, EPA resolve... settles these things without complete cleanup, and you're saying that really isn't the way it works?   David H. Souter  So that if... so that if it is done, there won't be further EPA action against yet another polluter for that site.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, if that's the... if that's the case then, whether... whether... even... even in a... in a case of contribution brought under 113, the person against whom contribution is obtained might still be liable to EPA if EPA later proceeds against that person.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I see, yes.   ",02-1192
0,"David H. Souter  Well, there's... there's one argument, isn't there?  And that is, in the first sentence, it speaks of... of a civil action under 107.  Then in the savings clause, it says, nothing, et cetera, shall diminish the right to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action.  It seems to be talking, you know, under... of 107... it seems to be talking about something other than 107.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That may be what it means, and... and maybe that's the way it ought to be construed.  But it's not clear, is it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What... what is your answer to their response to the loophole argument that, in point of fact, you can... if you want to undertake this cleanup, all you've got to do basically is go to EPA and say, look, we want to get into circumstances in which we can have a settlement with you so that during or after it, we can... we can go for contribution?  What's your answer to that, that you have an avenue to get where you want to go?   David H. Souter  Well, that may... how about the answer to the practical question that Justice Ginsburg raised with your friend on the other side?

0,"David H. Souter  Mr. Strauss, may I go back and ask a variant on Justice Breyer's question, assuming that there is some implicit limitation on...  on the scope of any entity?  And it relates to what, if I have my facts straight, is the...  is the drafting history in this case, and I'd like you to tell me whether I have got the facts straight because I didn't look them up myself.  I just got this out of the briefs.  And if so, what you think the significance is.  As I understand it, at least the Senate version of the original bill had a provision in it that affirmative...  expressly provided that any existing utility, whatever its object of service, could go into the telecommunications business.  And this, as...  as you point at one point in your brief, this would be...  this would be good for your argument because a lot of those utilities are municipal utilities.  As I understand it, in the...  in the conference committee, that language was, in fact, removed entirely, and subsequent to its removal in the conference committee report, there were references to any private entity being able to go into the telecommunications business but not the old, pre-conference committee references to...  to any...  any public as well as private entity.  That suggests to me, the...  the combination of the drafting change and the conference committee report, that the implicit scope they were getting at was an implicit scope that says any entity is a reference to private, not public.  What...  are my facts straight, and if so, what...  what's your response to that argument?   David H. Souter  So you say the...  the excision was a redundancy excision.   David H. Souter  Okay.  The answer to that I think is in...  in part a response to something in your brief.  You mentioned that the original House and the original Senate reports were speaking, among others, expressly of...  of public entities.  As I understand it...  and again, I didn't look myself.  I just got this from...  from one of the briefs.  As I understand it, the conference committee report...  after this excision, which is arguably just a redundancy excision, the conference committee report started using the adjective private entities rather than public entities as being subject to this kind of universal preemption.  Doesn't that nix the theory that it was merely a redundancy excision?   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  What we're left with, it seems to me, is...  is at least...  maybe let's call it tension between the conference committee report and the preamble language which was then inserted.  And isn't that a perfect situation to provide...  to...  to apply a Gregory kind of rule, saying when we're not sure what they meant, we want them to spell it out more clearly before we conclude that they, in effect, are...  are limiting the...  the power of a...  of a State to determine what its municipalities can do?  Isn't this a good situation for a Gregory rule?   David H. Souter  I...  I think so too.   David H. Souter  And...  and maybe what I'm saying is we...  we ought to...  those of us who would look into the...  the legislative history, as I would, maybe ought to take advantage of a slightly broader Gregory rule.   David H. Souter  Isn't the difference, though...  and I...  I see your argument.  But isn't the difference that in that case we didn't have anything in the history either of the drafting or of the legislative consideration of the statute that suggested that there really was an...  an argument each way as...  as to whether they...  they were...  they were intending to...  to cover the...  the prisoners.  They simply didn't deal with...  with that situation at all, and they used absolute kind of...  of language.  Here, there is an argument to be made because the drafting changed.  The drafting certainly could have significance for...  for public utilities.  There is a tension between the...  the conference committee report and the preamble.  In other words, we've...  we've got a...  a question sort of affirmatively raised by the history of the drafting and enactment of the statute, whereas there was simply silence in the Yeskey situation.   David H. Souter  Well, I...  I grant you that, but when...  when the...  when the issue relates to the kind of State sovereignty issue that...  that Gregory addresses, that's a good reason for having a Gregory rule.   ",02-1238

0,"David H.

David H. Souter  So, I mean, that's...  that's a long way from General Motors.   David H. Souter  Well, it is to make money, but it is to make money in order to subsidize a particular activity, and I don't think...  maybe I'm missing something...  but I don't think there's an indication that there's a mandate there to maximize profits to in...  in effect subsidize the rest of the Government.

Souter  I take it you don't take the position that...  that, let's say, any death resulting in part as a result of one, but not the only, cause of the preexisting conditions is thereby excluded from the...  the class of liability.   David H. Souter  Every...  in other words, having a heart condition does not immunize Olympic Airlines against liability if somebody dies of a heart attack per se.  You're not taking that position.   David H. Souter  Sure, if...  if they're simply sitting in the seat and nothing unusual happens and they have a heart attack and die, sure, there's no liability.  But if there are other conditions...  and the argument here is that there are other conditions...  and the heart attack was merely a contributing cause...  it was a condition upon which those other conditions acted...  that does not...  the existence of a heart condition does not immunize Olympic Airlines against liability.  That's...  I don't think that's your argument, is it?   David H. Souter  And...  and they say the injury-producing event is...  or one of the...  the analyses is the unexpected refusal of the airline personnel to allow this individual to get moved into a smoke-free zone.  And that unusual and unexpected event, combined with the smoke and the heart condition, caused the death.  But it was the unexpected refusal to remove from a smoke zone that is the unexpected event or occurrence that is the accident.  What is your answer to that?   David H. Souter  He was assigned a non-smoking seat which happened to be in a zone with smoke.   David H. Souter  Well, you say direct, are...  are you trying to make the...  the act omission distinction?   David H. Souter  No...  no one is...  no one is making the common...  I don't think is making the common law argument here.  They're saying it was unexpected as a matter of fact that somebody who wanted a...  a smokeless seat, who found there was smoke in the area of the seat and who was asked to be moved, would be refused by the airline.  That is the unexpected event.   David H. Souter  The...  the point is the allegations are not of negligence, which is a legal and normative conclusion.   David H. Souter  The allegation is simply, as a matter of fact, it is not to be expected that a stewardess would stand there and say, no, you can't move him.  Whether it was negligent or not negligent, it simply was unexpected as a matter of fact, and they're saying that satisfies the unexpected event.   David H.

Here, we have a different problem.  What is the force or power that a member of a given political party ought to have?  It's not as simple as the race case.   ",02-1580

If it wasn't valuable at the time of patenting, what do you do with it?  It seems to me that if... if your argument is going to be consistent, you're going to say the... the Government hasn't reserved the right to uranium.   David H. Souter  No, but you're changing the hypothesis.  Justice Scalia's question was, if it wasn't valuable at the time of the patent, but we have now discovered uses for it so that it is valuable, what do you do with uranium?  And I would have thought that your position would be the Government loses on uranium too.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  May I ask you a question about an... an argument that hasn't specifically come up this morning?  And, first, I just want to tell you what my... my understanding of the argument is and... and you tell me if I've got it wrong.  I thought one of your arguments was that it was important to know whether the mineral was valuable or not at the time of the patent or the deed because the... the grantee, the patentee, ought to know, in effect, the extent to which his... his land grant is... is jeopardized by the Government's right to come in.  He ought to be able make a rough judgment as to whether at some point they're going to come in and start extracting things.  Is... is that a fair statement?   David H. Souter  My... my question is this.  If... if that is the reason for saying we should look to value at the time of the patent, isn't that an argument that is at odds with your position that if the mineral is valuable at the time, it is reserved?  Because... the reason I say that is this.  There may be gold under the land, but the patentee doesn't know it and the Government doesn't know it.  So that there is no way, at the time the deed passes, that the person taking that deed is going to be able to know whether, at some point in the future, the Government is going to come in and... and start drilling a mining shaft in the land.  So my question is, regardless of what the date at... at which value is established, isn't it the case that these patentees never really know whether at some future time the Government is going to come in and start drilling?  And if that is so, why should the patent date be important?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So are you saying basically, look, that's the way we've done it and you ought to defer to the practice?  Is that... I mean--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --is that the foundation for your argument?   David H. Souter  You're saying it makes up the bulk of the land?  I mean, I can understand that you would have an argument maybe for... for limiting what the government can take if out of your, whatever it is, 600 acres, you know, 590 are gravel and the Government says, too bad, we're taking it all.  But as I understand it, we... we have not gotten any issue in this case or in other cases about an inequitable enforcement of the... of the extraction condition.  Am I wrong about that?   David H. Souter  Well, you'd have an argument on the first prong of Western Nuclear if they took that position in fact, wouldn't you?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I mean, that... that would be inconsistent with the... with the purpose of the grant in the first place I suppose.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, no, but I'm talking about the extent of it.

Eddings and Lockett said you cannot preclude the jury, all 12 people, categorically from giving a certain kind of mitigating evidence any consideration.  The question in Mills was can you preclude one juror from giving dispositive effect to an item of evidence in such a way as to determine the verdict.  Those are two very different questions.  They can be placed under the umbrella of what effect must jurors be allowed to give to mitigating evidence, but they are very different questions within that umbrella.  And it seems to me that because the questions are different, there is not something irrational or capricious in someone having a question... in someone being uncertain of the answer to the second question even though the first question has been answered in favor of admissibility.  What do you say to that?   ",02-1603
1,"David H. Souter  Well, if we don't accept... let's assume, just for the sake of argument, that... that we're having trouble accepting the... the analysis that it is a violation of the statute in the statute's own terms.  You then made the argument that, in fact, you should recognize retaliation as a claim because in the context of... of school students and so on, if you don't allow retaliation, the teachers are not going to blow the whistle, and if the teachers blow the whistle, the statute is going to be a dead letter.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So... so the... the argument is you... you should recognize this as a necessity.  That, it seems to me, still goes back to Justice O'Connor's question.  Why do we have to recognize a private cause of action as opposed to the government allowing an administrative remedy?  And I thought you were leading up to saying the administrative remedy simply isn't effective because it's so draconian that, in fact, they don't impose it, or for some other reason.  So my question is, is there an argument to say that the administrative remedy simply is not good enough to preclude... to... to deter retaliation and that's why you've got to have a private cause of action?   David H. Souter  What's... what are the facts?  What's the empirical evidence for that?   INTERRUPTING David H.

Newsom  --Well... well, I will, I assume, perhaps foolishly, defer to the Solicitor General's office to tell you what... what the DOJ has and hasn't done.  What I can tell you is that... that the DOJ manual that the other side cites throughout its briefs expressly encourages agencies, when enforcing these... these things, to leverage even damage awards on behalf of individual claimants.  So I can tell you that, as a matter of policy, this is far from a dead letter.   ",02-1672

Souter  Yes, but the... the argument that's being raised is whether we're talking about the person who is listed in the statute as the primary beneficiary of the anti-discrimination statute or whether we're talking about the teacher who blows the whistle and so on... the... the argument is unless you allow this teacher or this whistle blower to... to bring the private action, your statute is a dead letter, that the... that if... if... once you recognize a private action, you've either got to recognize this kind of private action or you can forget the whole thing.

1,"David H. Souter  Ms.... Ms. Blatt, may I just go back before you go on with your argument to follow up on Justice Stevens' question?  You spoke of the $50,000 limit as being for damage or, I guess, destruction of non-commercial property.  Does... does the non-commercial mean, as I would assume it would mean, that a truck or lorry that is driven as a... as a carrier would not be covered, damage to that would not be covered by the $50,000 coverage?

Which is it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  All right, you know, what is the issue on value?  They'll put it back together again, there's apparently no record that... that these blow up all the time.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So... so what is the... the property concern?

If... if I bring in... if I buy a valuable statue in Europe and I have it elaborately crated so it won't be hurt in transport, when it gets to New York, can they open the crate to see what's inside?   David H. Souter  All right.  So the difference between the crate and the gas tank is, I take it, your concern that after they've put the gas tank back together, there may be some risk that it won't function or that the emissions system will be affected?  I mean, is that where you draw the line between the crate and the tank?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but, I mean, we... we didn't have this problem in 1790 or 1799, and the question is, what is the difference in principle for constitutional purposes between opening up, disassembling my crate, and disassembling the gas tank?  And the only thing that I can think of is, based on what you've said so far, is the concern that maybe the gas tank won't work or I'll have to disclose it to a subsequent purchaser, or the emissions system will be hurt.  Do you have anything else to distinguish in principle between the... the uncrating and the opening of the tank?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, the security is... is the... is the concern that maybe the tank won't work or... or are you saying maybe... maybe the... it'll blow up?  Is that what you mean by the security?   David H. Souter  Okay.  Well, the individual, I assume, is not in the car when they take the tank out, so we're talking simply about property damage.  When they uncrate the statue, they might knock the hand off, but they can still uncrate the statue.  What... anything else in principle between the two situations?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So it depends on my intention?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I intend the crate to be opened, but when I buy a gas tank I don't intend it to be opened?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But that's not the expectation of privacy test.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So this is a new test, I take it?   David H. Souter  No, but the distinction between the two cases, I take it, now is the intent of the owner of the property that is disassembled.  In the one case, the owner ultimately intends the crate to be opened up.  In the other case, he does not intend the gas tank to be opened up.  Is, is that it?   INTERRUPTING ",02-1794

Does... does that word occur as a statement for some technical function that you go through with respect to every taxpayer within the meaning of Arizona law?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, then... then isn't your problem this, that... that there... that that specific word is used in the Federal statutes, quite apart from the Tax Injunction Act?

Your argument is that in effect by defining the... the benefit... by Texas' act of trying to define the benefit denial as equivalent to the practice of medicine, it therefore gets us back into the insurance savings clause.  It seems to me an irrational logical leap.  502 says we get out of the insurance savings clause because of complete preemption, Texas says by saying what you're really doing in denialing... denying a benefit, is practicing medicine.  We get back into the business of insurance, and the insurance savings clause applies.  I just can't follow that.   David H. Souter  Well they're the ones that--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --is there any insurer that does not at some point incorporate some issue of medical judgement in it's coverage?   David H. Souter  If it does not, then in effect it is giving carte blanche to any medical decision by a doctor without right of review.   David H. Souter  In Pegram you were dealing with the doctor who was the treating physician, that is precisely what Justice Breyer has just defined as not being the case here.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  When we were dealing with a treating physician, we're not dealing with a treating physician here.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well except that you say when it's made here it is the choice of the doctor, the pharmacy or the hospital to seek that judgment early, isn't it.  In other words in the... the doctor could have gone ahead and prescribed Vioxx, and sent the bill in.  The doctor could have kept the patient in the hospital another day, and sent the bill in.

Souter  If you don't get it then, they automatically deny it later?   David H. Souter  So, they do force it.  My premise was wrong.   David H.

1,"David H. Souter  Doesn't... excuse me.   David H. Souter  No, please.   David H. Souter  Mr. Salmons, may I ask you one question on... on your timing point?  Your claim is that the... that the issue of property damage is irrelevant to the question of reasonable timing as distinct from reasonable execution.  I understand your argument when we are dealing with a situation in which there is an... an exigency, a set of circumstances that said you've got to act fast.  My question, though, goes to the situation in which there is no exigency.  You're... you're executing a warrant for... to seize a stolen grand piano or something.  No property is going to be destroyed if you wait a little bit longer.  In that case, where there is no exigency, not at the beginning, none develops while you're waiting, doesn't the issue of property damage have some relevance to the question of timing?  In other words, if there's no risk that anything is going away, isn't it reasonable for the police to say, okay, give them another minute or something like that?   David H. Souter  But when... when you're dealing... let's... let's take the case in which the exigency develops while you're waiting.  One reason why it is reasonable to... to suspect that you are being denied admittance, let's say, in a case where drugs are easily disposable is that there is good reason to believe that somebody would... another 10 or 20 or whatever seconds will use the 20 seconds to get rid of the drugs, if possible.  You don't have any basis for drawing that kind of a conclusion in the grand piano case, and there... there is less reason to believe, less reason to suspect that you are actually being denied admittance as opposed to simply being the victim of somebody who's slow at getting the... to the door.  Isn't that a fair line of reasoning?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, Mr. Salmons, as I--   David H. Souter  Should we consider these two possibilities in Justice Scalia's case?  Possibility one, no exigency again, just take his premises as... as he gave it.  Possibility one, the police knock on the door; they say, police, search warrant.  A guy on the inside says, I don't want to see you.  The police say at that point, come on, we're serious.  We've got a warrant out here.  Open up.  Possibility two, same thing.  The guy says, I don't want to see you.  The police bash the door down.  Isn't the fact that the police could say, come on open up, we're serious a factor to take into consideration in deciding whether, at the point the fellow says I don't want to see you, it's right for them to bash the door down?

I mean, we're just not experts in that, and it's hard to find out.  We are, however, at least closer to being experts on what American law would provide.

So that's what I want you to help me on.  I thought their argument was that when you say your present position is just like the... or is the position of a litigant, the difference between you as a litigant over there and you as a litigant here is... is a difference in... in effect, in responsibility.  You at least at not supposed to bring an irresponsible complaint in the United States.  You can be sanctioned if you do.  They, I think, are implying that you don't have that obligation of responsibility over there and therefore simply by filing a complaint, without anything more, you get a free ticket to discovery, whereas your ticket to discovery if you were suing in the United States, is not free because you would have to meet a certain threshold of responsibility before you bring it, and therefore your positions aren't the same.  What is the answer to that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but the contemplation of proceeding has got to be present.  Proceeding can be in the future.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And that's different from United States law.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  In that respect, you are not a litigant in... in the same sense that you would be required to be a litigant for discovery here.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Unless... unless you get your discovery and say, well, we've learned a lot of interesting things about the other company.  We don't care about an antitrust suit now.  We've got what's valuable to us.  We're not going to initiate a proceeding.  That's what they're worried about.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You've got rule 11.  You don't have rule 11 when you're merely in... in the EC and when you're merely in contemplation of litigation.   David H. Souter  Okay.  But is that a responsibility that they can enforce against you in any practical sense before you have initiated a proceeding with them?  In other words, in the case that they're worried about, you... you get American discovery to learn interesting things that as a competitor you want to learn and you drop it there.  Does the EC have a... have a means of, in effect, calling you to book for that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So they can go against them as regulated industries quite apart from their litigant status.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Is... is that--   David H.

1,"David H. Souter  Can you tell us how it worked?  The representative of the Attorney General was in court and he stands up and he says, we insist on sovereign immunity, and the judge say, all right, that's act one.  It's closed.

Souter  Okay.  Now maybe we can go back and you can tell me who the... was there an act one and an act two, act one being the State asserts immunity, act two being the Eleventh Amendment, or... or were the same parties before the court at all times?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Wearing different... wearing different hats or proceeding under some different theory.   David H. Souter  Right.  That's the puzzle in this case.  The State as State was dismissed at the threshold, and then we have an Ex Parte Young case.  And now we're talking about Eleventh Amendment immunity again.  So the State is out of the case.  It's proceeding as an Ex Parte Young case.  How did it then become converted back into a case against the State so that we're talking about whether the State waived its immunity?   David H. Souter  No, but Justice Scalia's question didn't go to waiver.  It went to representation.  And Lapides says, if you can represent, you can waive.

Easy.  I mean, I'm... I'm not saying that this would be a difficult case, but you would have to, I suppose, make that inquiry.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Let's put... put it this way.  Are you saying that if the State officials negotiate a consent decree that goes beyond the Eleventh Amendment... or that goes beyond... pardon me... that goes beyond Ex Parte Young's--   David H.

Souter  Especially if they've asserted their immunity at the beginning.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So you want us to write an opinion that says after the State has specifically asserted its Eleventh Amendment immunity, its officials may negotiate a consent decree which goes beyond the boundaries of jurisdiction set forth in... in Ex Parte Young without waiver.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well... well, you introduced the point of remedy.  That wasn't part of my question.  My... my question was whether or not, having asserted the immunity in a... in... under the assumption that the immunity has not been waived, the State officials can negotiate a consent decree that goes beyond the usual rules of Ex Parte Young, it goes beyond the authority granted to the courts under Ex Parte Young, without relying on the theory of waiver.   David H. Souter  So you're really saying that it doesn't go beyond Ex Parte Young.  I mean, the... the premises of some of the arguments here that it does go beyond it, in your judgment, is... is in fact a false premise.   David H. Souter  When you had--  --Would you help... excuse me.  May I ask one more question?  Would you help me on one thing?  My understanding was... and I... I may simply be wrong on this.  My understanding was that the claim that this went beyond Young was not a claim that it... it mandated State law... or mandated the performance of State law obligations, but that it went further than it had to to enjoin the Federal violation by getting into details about what the State officers had to do or had to refrain from do... from doing.  Am I correct that it's... it's not... the claim is not that it got into State law but that it simply went beyond the scope of a proper remedial order under the Federal law?  Is that correct?   David H. Souter  Mr. Gornstein, I want to clarify what you mean in your argument when you say go beyond.  There are... and here are two possibilities.  One, you throw in an entirely new obligation, and you say, you know, by the way, we'll... we'll also agree to a program of pediatric podiatry, which isn't covered by the statute.  We'll do that too just to show you how good our faith is.  A second possibility is we'll show you how we will implement our agreement to abide by what we understand to be Federal Court law.  We will throw in a how-to-do-it or a how-we-are-going-to-do-it clause.  I understand your argument, when you refer to going beyond the letter of Federal law and agreeing to that in a settlement, to refer to a how-to-do-it kind of agreement as opposed to a new substantive obligation agreement.  I assume.  Is that correct?   Irving L. Gornstein  Yes, but let... let me explain further.   David H. Souter  I guess my question is--   Irving L. Gornstein  Yes.   David H. Souter  --why do you acquiesce in this phrase, going beyond Ex Parte Young?  Have you ever--   Irving L. Gornstein  No, I--   David H. Souter  --Has anybody seen a consent decree that simply said, we'll obey the law?   Irving L. Gornstein  --No.  I didn't say it went beyond Ex Parte Young.  I said it went beyond what was strictly required by Federal law.  And as this Court said in the Rufo case, every Federal court remedial order that's entered by a Federal court goes beyond what's strictly required by Federal law.   David H. Souter  That's all--   Irving L. Gornstein  And Milliken permits that as long as it's aimed at remedying a violation.  But there's one step beyond Milliken here, and that Rufo says that you can even agree to relief that goes beyond what a court would order after a trial as long as the relief furthers the objectives of the underlying law because there you are operating with the consent of the State officials in... in selecting that relief.

0,"David H. Souter  Why?  Why would it be more difficult?  It seems to me this is more difficult.  You agreed to it.   David H. Souter  No.  But your argument, as I understood it a moment ago, is that you can't go beyond Federal law because there's no violation of Federal law now.  And that would be exactly the same whether the predicate was a... a litigated judgment or a consent decree.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So we're in... it seems to me you're in the same boat under Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So in other... I take that to mean, yes, we would be making exactly the same argument--   David H. Souter  --if this had been a litigated decree.  We would... we would say that--   David H. Souter  --that the order saying, A, you did something wrong, you violated Federal law, and B, in the future to avoid that, you've got to do the following things, A, B, C... you would say so long as at the moment of enforcement we are not then violating Federal law in the sense found in the judgment, they cannot order A, B, C, and D.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  I want to know under you.  [Laughter]  On your theory, isn't that going to be your answer?   David H. Souter  No, but you're... you're getting into... into a general answer, and I want a specific answer.  As I understand it, you would say that in... that following the litigated case with an A, B, C, D order, you would say that if... if the State... if the... if the other side tried to enforce A, B, C, and D, you could come into court and say, we are not now violating Federal law in the sense originally alleged.  Therefore, A, B, C, D, and E cannot be enforced.  Isn't that correct, that that would be your position?   David H. Souter  Well, all right.  Let's... let's compromise on an answer to the question.  Your answer would be we can always object to A, B, C, and D. We may or may not succeed, but we can always object to it, even though we haven't appealed it.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  We didn't... we didn't appeal saying, look, Supreme Court, they... you know, they... they nailed us to the wall on liability, but they do not have jurisdiction to order A, B, C, and D and E because they don't have jurisdiction to enforce it.  You didn't take that appeal and yet you feel you can raise that later.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You mean you can never move for modification prior to an enforcement action?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  But you're saying then that the consent decree is basically a continuance.   David H. Souter  Right.  We'll see... a consent decree means we'll see you later.

Souter  Mr. Franklin--  --So under 17... or what is it... 7413(a)(5)(C), which is 14a of your brief toward the bottom, you say that in this case the agency cannot invoke that section to issue an order or to go to court.   David H. Souter  All right.  You have to say that to be consistent.   David H. Souter  Now, if you want us to write the opinion your way, you would say under 17... 7413(a)(5), the State... the EPA cannot issue an order barring construction unless.  Now you fill in the blank.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --Unless there's a violation of an express statutory requirement, but the Government is going to come up and say, there was a... there was a violation of the statute defining BACT.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What your formulation is, is that they did not follow a requirement of the statute.  And I just don't see how that gets you there.  You're making a distinction between the express requirements of the statute and the obviously implicit requirements of the statute?  Certainly it... it is implicit in the statute that the State's decision must be made rationally and not arbitrarily.  Don't you think that that's a requirement of law?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Where is--  --But the language of 113(a)(5) doesn't really seem to be limiting... I'm over here.  [Laughter]   David H. Souter  Mr.... Mr. Franklin, the... the difficulty that I'm having with... with your argument about the meaning of the statute goes back to your answer I think to Justice Kennedy's question awhile ago.  He asked you, in effect, what's the role of the statute on your theory, and... and you said, well, if they... if they simply ignore one of the stated statutory factors, they say we're not going to consider this, or if there's a technical defect in the order, if the order is incomplete, that would be a... a circumstance in which EPA could exercise this authority.  But you also said... and I... I assume you said correctly... that later on that these kinds of obvious violations are going to be rare.   David H. Souter  And that leads me back to... as I said, I guess, to Justice Kennedy's question, and that is this.  It seems to me that on your view of the... the two statutory sections, there really isn't very much role for them to play, and I can't imagine why Congress would have enacted separate order sections if all they were meant to do is what you say.  So my question is, why... why doesn't your explanation trivialize these two statutes to a point that is implausible?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And... and EPA could do the same thing by following the State review process, couldn't it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It could go in and say, look, they forgot X. They refused to apply Y.   David H. Souter  Well, but I mean, that's... that's the question.  I mean, the... the difficulty I'm having is that if... if it is unlikely that Congress would have provided this entire separate track simply to deal with the problems that you say the track is meant to deal with, then it is not so implausible at all that Congress would have intended the statute to be applied as it has been applied here.

0,"David H. Souter  But isn't there... isn't there something more than presence here?  Isn't the significance... isn't the significant evidence of this case something that appears when you contrast it with Houghton from a couple of years ago?  Houghton, you had evidence that the driver of the car was a recreational, a personal drug user.  We don't, I think, in this society, at least certainly today, assume that everyone who is in the company of a recreational drug user is also a drug user or an accessory to the first person's drug use.  Here, however, what the police officer had was evidence, not merely of the time, but of... of three people in a relatively small car with commercial quantities of drugs, an amount of money that was enough to suggest that drug dealing was going on, and I think a... an inference was possible that someone in that car was dealing in the drugs.  And it seems to me that the different inference that can be drawn about the others here as distinct from the inference in the Houghton case is, most drug dealers do not go around in their place of business, the car, with people who are totally innocent of drug activity--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --and isn't that the basic difference between this and Houghton and doesn't that inference support... amount to probably cause?   David H. Souter  Five... five crack cocaine hits?   David H. Souter  But is--  --How about a big roll of money?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, you pointed it out, but I think it... I thought, and tell me if I'm wrong here, I thought that it was... it was... the evidence was, regardless of how he first described the quantity that he saw, I thought the evidence came out that there was 700 and some odd dollars in it, so I think the judge could infer that it was fairly... a fairly sizable roll of bills.   David H. Souter  And what is in... and it was in the glove compartment?   David H. Souter  And it was open, it wasn't in a wallet or something like that?  A roll of bills.   David H. Souter  So it's reasonable--  --But he... he must have seen it in the form of a... a roll of bills or something, rather than, as Justice Souter said, just not in a wallet.   David H.

Souter  Well, except if... if you accept the proposition that the... that there probably was a roll of bills visible in the glove compartment, Mr. Pringle was within easy reach, not even arm's reach of the rolled bills.   David H. Souter  Well, we... we don't know that and we don't know whether the armrest had come down during the time the backseat passenger was there.  There are lots of things at a probable cause stage that one does not know, but the very fact... if... if we're going to talk... if we're going to find it significant that something is within reach of one of the passengers or not, I would have supposed that for probable cause purposes, the fact that the money was in reach was a relevant fact.

0,"David H. Souter  But doesn't it make sense to assume that the cross-reference has to be capable of informing of what is left out?  And in this case, number one, there is nothing attached to the warrant.  No one reading the warrant could possibly figure out what within this house was... was being searched for.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And once again I guess I go back to Justice O'Connor's question.  Why don't we apply the... the Fourth Amendment the way it's written, and it says that the warrant shall particularly describe, not some other document under seal.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  The Fourth Amendment says it's the warrant that is supposed to particularly describe, not documents given to a magistrate.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Whether... whether the homeowner has the right or whether the point is to make sure that the officers executing the warrant can check what's in front of them and find out how far to go, the fact remains that the Fourth Amendment says the warrant is supposed to particularly describe.  This didn't, it had no document appended to it that did.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It may refer to it, but if it's not there, nobody can figure out what it says.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Not when the police are at the scene they can't.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It doesn't have to make that assumption in... in order to apply the Fourth Amendment as written.  It could perfectly well make the assumption that the point of the Fourth Amendment description was to make sure that the officers at the scene knew how far they could go.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Doesn't it talk... or correct me if I'm wrong... about serving the warrant?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So two people--  --How do we know that the magistrate did look at the piece of paper?   David H. Souter  Any magistrate who looked at that piece of paper would say your warrant... your warrant application or the form you've given me does not indicate what you're searching for, unless you really are going to put the house up on a flatbed truck and take it away, which we know you're not.  It's... it's... the obvious, I think the obvious probability is that the... the agent did not read what his secretary had typed in and the magistrate did not read what the agent presented to him, and this sometimes happens.  I've had it happen to me.  You hand the magistrate the application and he says, where do you want me to sign?  Isn't that probably what happened?   David H. Souter  But you... but you are saying that in... in circumstances, you gave an example, the reasonableness requirement would result in an obligation to show the warrant.   David H. Souter  Well, let's... let's take... let's... let's go one step further than the... than the hypothetical you... you were dealing with a moment ago.  Let's assume the homeowner comes to the door and says, I'd like to see the warrant.  And they say, well, here it is, and the homeowner says, I... I'd like to read it, and the police say, no, you can't read it.  And the homeowner says, look, I'll give you whatever you've got a right to seize under this warrant.  You don't have to tear the house apart, just let me see what it is you want.  The police answer, no, we're not going to tell you, we're going to go through the house ourselves.  Do you think that would be reasonable execution of the warrant?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  They would have a right to... to... to tear the house apart when the homeowner stands at the threshold and says, tell me what you've got a right to seize and I'll get it for you.

So it seems to me that in... in the bankruptcy case, the court would have every reason, if it was brought to its attention, e.g., in the form of a stipulation, to say, no, I'm going to keep the ball rolling fast.

If... if you are correct in your analysis, why isn't the answer to the problem that you raise here is simply that they are not entitled to charge you any fee at all, no matter what you call it?  Because if I understand your... and I may not, but if I understand your argument, your argument is they agreed to my charging beyond the limit in the agreement as we originally negotiated it.  They said it's okay.  And if that is the case, why isn't your argument and your remedy simply they can't charge me any penalty at all for that?  They agreed to it.

The only thing they can make you do is pay what you have charged.  And if that's the case, we don't need to get into this... this complicated question about Regulation Z. All you have to say is, I don't owe you a cent for exceeding the credit limit.  Why isn't that the answer to your question or to your problem?   INTERRUPTING David H.

Souter  Okay.   David H.

They said, in... if I understand it, if you go over the limit, we charge you X dollars, and... and that was the extent of it.  You're fighting about whether the X dollars should be classified as a finance charge or something else, but your argument now is a different kind of argument.  Your argument now is they, in some sense, approved my going over the limit.  If that does not change the original agreement, then what difference does it make?  If it does change the original agreement, then why isn't your remedy simply to say you can't charge me a fee at all for going over the limit?   INTERRUPTING David H.

And it seems to me that on a premise like hers, of course the state can fairly say the law is the same, doesn't matter at this point whether... whether I call it state or whether I call it Federal, so it's fair to assume it's both.  If the state court, let's say the state supreme court, later on says, we think we'll change our rule, then all the state court has to do is to say, the claim is either good or bad under Federal law and this... the result is now going to be different under state law.  But the state courts at each stage on a premise like Justice Ginsburg is fairly on notice of what it has to decide.  There's no unfairness to it.  That's the point that we're getting at, and I... and I don't understand your answer when you say it's important for them to know the source if there's no unfairness.   David H. Souter  You mean because it's just nice to know?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It doesn't make any difference in the law.

And that's not what they're claiming here.  They're claiming here that there was something much more than (k) standing alone.  As I understand it, they're claiming that the difference between this and Boyde and why this is not a standalone kind of case is that the prosecutor deliberately argued or argued law that was in fact wrong and... and continued to do so even after the court interrupted the argument and that the court never gave an instruction that corrected the erroneous statements of law that the prosecutor had made.  So that's... that's why they're... they're saying this is not a Boyde situation.   David H. Souter  Well, no, no.  The... the mitigating evidence that Boyde held could be considered without a... (k) being a bar, was mitigating evidence about the... the character of the individual prior to or at least up to the moment of the crime.  So this is... this is different kind of evidence, and I... I mean, this is post-crime evidence.  And... and I don't see that... that Boyde's holding is so broad as obviously to cover this at all.  It might be a... it would be a... a closer question if it hadn't been for the prosecutor's argument and the judge's failure to correct it.

Souter  Yes, but let's get specific.  You... you said there isn't a reasonable possibility.  Why?  Get... get down to facts.  Why isn't there a reasonable possibility?   David H. Souter  Yes.  The prosecutor stands there and twice says, before the judge interrupts him and after the judge interrupts him... says, you cannot legally consider this evidence.

Souter  No.  Precisely, if I recall... and you correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought what the judge said was that the prosecutor's statements were... were not evidence.  Of course, they're not evidence.  The issue isn't whether they were evidence.  They were statements of the law.  The judge didn't say anything about whether they were correct or incorrect statements of the law.  It seems to me that the judge's response to the objection was totally beside the point.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And the court didn't give them an instruction on this contested point.   David H. Souter  He didn't come out and say, yes, you can consider this under (k).  He never said that.   David H. Souter  (k) says you can consider evidence that... that goes to the gravity of the crime.  I will be candid to say I think you're stretching things about as far as you can stretch, as Boyde held, that... that character evidence pre and up to the time of crime can be considered reasonably under that factor.  But certainly evidence of what an individual did after the crime is committed does not naturally fall within (k) at all, and I don't know why any juror would consider it unless a judge came out and said flatly you can.

Would there... would there be any economic difference to the... to the public or... or indeed even to the carriers if they simply jacked up the... the registration fee by $100?

So is there any economic difference?   David H. Souter  No, but that... that... maybe I don't understand.  That... that tells us what happens to the money after it's paid, but it doesn't make any difference to the person who is paying the money, does it?   David H.

I can understand that argument more easily under the statute, under the text of the statute as it is written, than I can understand it under the instruction that you agreed to, because the instruction that you agreed to had a limitation, a textual limitation which is not in the statute itself, that refers to ""relatively directly"" as describing the relationship between this information and its object.

It simply picked one model, and the... the clearest way to have a coherent system of conspiracy law is to apply the model.  If it didn't talk about overt act, there's no overt act requirement.

You told us a few moments ago... and I'm sure you... you were right... that the kind of the paradigm example plans vary enormously depending on the terms in which employers set them up.  So if... if we say that the... the dividing line is going to be between plans under which withdrawal can be for any purpose versus plans in which withdrawal is going to be somehow limited, then we're going to have to litigate an awful lot of plans.

1,"David H. Souter  But you're... no, I was going to... your whole point, I take it, is that the two particular patients in this case are simply... simply cannot be taken, for our purposes, as representative in the fact that they are getting the marijuana by, I think, growing it themselves or being given it.  You're saying, you cannot take that fact as a fact from which to generalize in deciding this case.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  May I go back to your point a few minutes ago about... it was, sort of, a categoric point... you, in effect, said,  ""If this argument succeeds with respect to medical use of marijuana, the next argument is going to be recreational use, and there's no real way to distinguish between them. ""  Wouldn't this be a way to distinguish between them?  That in deciding what class you are going to... or what subclass you're going to consider from which to generalize, you simply ask the question,  ""What good reasons are there to define a subclass this way? ""  In this particular case, the good reasons to define a subclass of medical usage are the benefits... whether you accept the evidence is another thing... but the benefits which the doctors say that, under present circumstances, you can get from smoking it, as opposed to taking the synthesized drug.  There's no such argument, I would guess, in favor of recreational marijuana usage as a separate category.  And, for that reason, isn't there a... isn't there a good reason to categorize this as narrowly as the Respondents are doing here, just medical usage, without any risk of generalizing the recreational usage?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That may... oh, that may be, but it seems to me that that's a separate argument, because you're... you were arguing before that if you recognize medical usage, you don't have any way of drawing the line against private recreational usage.  And I'm suggesting that you do have a reason for drawing that line, and it's the benefit for medical usage, if you accept the evidence; whereas, there is no reason to categorize recreational usage separately, and that seems to me a category argument, rather than a respect-for-Congress argument.   ",03-1454
0,"David H. Souter  No, but even--   David H. Souter  --But even if we accept your definition of economic, I don't see that it is a basis upon which we ought to make a category decision.  You say it's non-economic because one of these people is a... is a self-grower, another one is getting it from a friend for nothing.  But I don't see what reason that you have given, or any reason that you haven't given, for us to believe that, out of... now I'm going to assume, for the sake of argument, a hundred-thousand potential users... everybody is going to get it from a friend or from plants in the backyard.  Seems to me the sensible assumption is, they're going to get it on the street.  And once they get it, under California law, it's not a crime for them to have it and use it.  But they're going to get it in the street.  Why isn't that the sensible assumption?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yeah, but the... it's also the case that approximately 10 percent of the American population is doing that every day, if I accept the figures in the government's brief, and they're not getting prosecuted.   David H. Souter  And if I am a sick person, I'm going to say,  ""Look, if they're not prosecuting every kid who buys, what, a nickel bag or whatever you call a small quantity today, they're not going to prosecute me, either. ""  I mean, there's not going to be any incentive, it seems to me, to avoid the street market.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Your whole argument for triviality, though, goes... your whole argument for triviality, though, goes back to your disagreement with the government about how many people are involved, because I take it you accept the assumption that the more people who are involved... if there are millions and millions, it is unlikely that this licensed activity is going to be without an effect on the market.  So the whole argument boils down to how many people are going to be involved.  You don't accept the government's 100,000-dollar figure.  Let me ask you a question that would... that would get to, maybe, a different number, and that is, Do you know how many people there are in California who are undergoing chemotherapy at any given time?   David H. Souter  Isn't that number going to be indicative of the demand for marijuana?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But if you... if you accept that, then there's nothing implausible about the government's hundred-thousand number, is there?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  How many people are there in California?  What's the population?   David H. Souter  Lots... lots--  [Laughter]  --lots and lots.  They... a hundred-thousand cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy does not seem like an implausible number.  And, in fact, if that number is a plausible one today, its plausibility reflects, among other things, the fact that there is a controversy as to whether California's law, in fact, is enforceable, or not.  And the reason... there is reason to assume that... if we ruled your way, that that number would go up.  So, if you accept that line of argument, then your argument, that the effect, whatever it may be, is going to be trivial, seems to me unsupportable.  Am I missing something?   David H. Souter  Well... but that is circular reasoning, because the whole... your whole argument that it's non-economic is based on the claim that there are... the numbers are so few... the number of people involved, from what you could generalize, are so few that it would not be reasonable to infer an effect on the market.  If there would be a large market effect, it makes no more sense to call this non-economic than Filburn's use, non-economic.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It was inference upon inference upon inference.  That's not what we're talking about here.   David H. Souter  Your whole jurisprudence in this case is premised on the assumption that we have got to identify the entire range of potential effect based on the particular character of two individuals in their... in their supply of marijuana.  And the whole point of this argument is that that does not seem to be a realistic premise on which to base constitutional law.   INTERRUPTING ",03-1454
1,"David H. Souter  How about you?  You're in trouble too, aren't you?  [Laughter]   David H. Souter  No, but it seems to me... and I think what bothers me is... is what bothers Justice Kennedy.  It seems to me that the argument you just made is an argument that given the pleadings in this case, the findings that Justice Ginsburg just quoted really were irrelevant findings, that they should not have gotten... that the court should not have gotten into extortion and so on and should not have provided a remedy for extortion, quite apart from the fact of whether it's an appropriate remedy, constitutional or otherwise.  And that, it seems to me, is... is something that we... we are not here to touch.  That's a question of California law.  What we are here to touch is, number one, whether the injunction is overbroad with respect to pure speech, and maybe we are here... that we have a question about the... the breadth of the case we took.  But maybe we are here to determine whether there can be an injunction against blackmail or harassing activities.  But I... I think we're not here to decide whether California could have gotten to the question of blackmail, harassment, and injunction for that.  Do you agree with that?   David H. Souter  Well, it can certainly... the... the issue is certainly before us as to whether such an injunction can be issued with respect to defamation pure and simple.  But the findings that Justice Ginsburg has... has read and part of the order in question here seems to go beyond pure defamation.  It goes to the kind of demonstrative activity which plausibly is found to have been in aid of extortion.  And that, it seems to me, is an entirely different question.  We may... I'm not saying we will, but we may agree with you that it's overbroad.  We may agree with you that as to pure speech, you can't enjoin it.  But that doesn't necessarily mean that every part of this injunction is wrong, and it seems to me it is irrelevant as to whether the... the State of... the courts of California should have reached extortion.   David H. Souter  With respect to the defamation, pure and simple.  I agree with you.  We... there is a heightened standard of review, but I don't think that addresses one way or the other what the standard should be when an action in the State courts has been treated as an action both for defamation and for extortion or harassment.

Mr. Chemerinsky didn't have too much chance to... to get very far into it, but one of his points was that there was... quite apart from any injunction against picketing, harassment, et cetera, there was an injunction simply against speech on a given subject directed to a lot of people with no limit of time.  With respect to that last aspect, do you defend the injunction?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, it was directed, number one, to a named person who was not a party to the case, and it was directed to agents and employees of... of the named party.  So, I... I assume that Mr. Cochran probably has a fair number of agents and employees, so it does seem like a large number of people.   INTERRUPTING David H.

I said forget the injunction for a moment with respect to picketing, with respect to harassment, and we'll say with respect to blackmail, since that has come up.  Forget that.

I'm just talking about a piece of stone or a poster that says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not covet, thou shalt not bear false witness, et cetera.

0,"David H. Souter  Isn't it all the case, as has been pointed out, that no monument is going to be on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol without the approval of the legislature?  You don't dispute that, do you?   David H. Souter  And you don't dispute that anyone going on those grounds would assume that the State government approved it or it wouldn't be there?   David H. Souter  But you have to contend with the fact that the district court found that this sort of commemoration of the commandments involved was not the objective in placing the monument there, so you're left basically with a religious text.  And if anybody has any doubt about that, the religious text is surrounded by some religious symbols, the Chi Rho, the Star of David.  So it seems to me that it's hard to find, if we accept the district court findings, that there's anything here but an expression of approval by the State of Texas for a religious expression, and only for the religious expression.   David H. Souter  But you're not trying to withdraw the... I took it to be the concession that of course anyone would reasonably assume that the State of Texas approved this message, and thought it was appropriate to devote state property to its promulgation.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But then the fact that the Eagles also approve it doesn't really get us very far, does it?   David H. Souter  Let me ask you this.  If the Eagles' presentation statement weren't on there, would that make a difference to Establishment Clause analysis?   David H. Souter  What is the... that's one of the problems with the argument, it seems to me, that by putting the Ten Commandments monument on grounds that have lots of other monuments, that the religious message is somehow either diluted or changed.  Contrast the situation in Texas with what we've got here.  You've got Moses up there with at least the last five commandments showing.  But Moses is in the company of a group of individuals who are nothing but law givers.  You've got Menes and Hammurabi and John Marshall and the rest of them.  There is an obvious theme.  Anybody who looks at the identity... or knows the identity of these figures is saying they're getting at law givers.  But if you look at the grounds of the Texas State Capitol, you see wars, pioneer women, children and so on.  There is no one common theme.  The only theme seems to be these are objects or symbols that are worthy of some kind of respect.  And one of them is religious.  Being mixed into a group that has no common theme does not eliminate the religious... the obvious religious message from this monument.  Isn't that correct?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Maybe it doesn't, but I'm trying to find a rationale for the argument that's being made, and that I thought you were alluding to.  The argument is that by mixing this in with a grab bag of other symbols, you have somehow diluted or changed the focus from a religious message to something else.  And I can understand that in the Moses case in the frieze because there is a clear common theme.  On the Texas grounds, at least insofar as I can tell, there is no common theme.  There are a series of objects that say, these are worthy of veneration.  One of them is religious.  There is nothing that removes the religious message from its prominence in the display the way the religious message is removed from prominence in the Moses display, isn't that correct?   David H.

0,"David H. Souter  May I ask you there basically to comment on the point that Justice Scalia made in the course of the last argument?  The context, as we know, has changed pretty radically in the course of litigation over this and it started out with just the Ten Commandments alone and then version 2, the Ten Commandments had certain... were surrounded by certain quotations of religious content from other texts.  And finally, as I guess literally is true with a new lawyer and more litigation, we've gotten to the present context.  Isn't the problem that you have to face, as I've said before, what Justice Scalia raised before, everybody knows what's going on.  Everybody knows that the present context is simply litigation dressing and that the object for what is going on is the object that was revealed in the first place.  What is your response to that?   David H. Souter  Well, they created the land mine basically.  I mean--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --Okay, but if we still have a purpose inquiry, what you say of course is true.  The current display includes the display of a lot of legal documents.  But is there any reason for anyone to believe that that display of legal documents or anything else would be there for any other purpose than the display of the Ten Commandments, including the religious, the overtly theistic part of the text of the Ten Commandments?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You're not abandoning the position that you have a right to make this kind of religious display, are you?   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  But is there... I guess... I don't want to tie you up too long but I mean given the history, isn't it still the case that there is no serious reason to believe that there is any object here other than the display of the Ten Commandments including the overtly theistic text and the rest of this is basically enabling context which does not affect the objective, the objective being the Ten Commandments and the religious text?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, not forever but for now.  This isn't a case in which they came up with the Ten Commandments display, it got enjoined and 10 years later somebody comes along and says, let's have a display of important documents in the history of law.  This in fact is a continuous process and it is a continuous process within the context of litigation about the constitutionality of the display.  It's not a... the implication is not that you can never have a different display but that there is no reason to believe that the intent of this display has changed as the context has changed.  What is your response to that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But I assume if you were running a course in a school about the biblical text, you would explain the differences.  You would indicate the difference between the Jewish, the Roman, the Protestant, the Lutheran and so on and you're not doing that here.  I would have thought your answer might be, well, if that really made a difference, we could have separate versions.  But it's not comparable to school teaching.   David H. Souter  Would you think it was appropriate in a public school course that was otherwise a bona fide course to teach the day on exodus, to teach about simply the Protestant version of the Ten Commandments?   David H. Souter  In a public school, wouldn't it be required, at least for intellectual reasons if not the reasons of the establishment clause to say, well, graven images are dealt with differently in the standard Roman translation and the preamble sections of what may and may not be regarded as commandment number 1 are different in the Christian versus Jewish and so on.  Wouldn't that be an intellectually responsible requirement?   David H. Souter  Exactly.  I thought you were equating the two together.   David H. Souter  Okay, but at the end of the day in Marsh, there wasn't any question that what they were doing was praying.  And here it seems to me that the change that you're arguing for as significant is only significant unless it is a change in the essential activity because there is no law and it would be crazy law from this Court that said you can engage in religious endorsement, promotions, et cetera, so long as you hide the ball well enough.  What this Court basically has said is you can engage in secular objectives that incidentally involve religious figures or references, e.g., Moses up there.  What you started with in this case or what the county started with was a pretty religious-looking exercise and the question is, did they go from a totally religious exercise to a secular exercise or did they go from an obviously religious exercise to an obscured religious exercise?  And therefore, you can't make context a mere change in physical context dispositive because it ignores that distinction.  And that distinction I think is what is driving or what is going to drive possibly in my mind the resolution of this case.  What do you say to that?   ",03-1693
1,"David H. Souter  May I ask you a question on that point?  And I should know the answer.  It must be in the briefs but I don't remember.  I assume that they rescinded the resolution before version 3 of the display was put up, is that correct?   David H. Souter  It is still on the books?   ",03-1693
1,"David H. Souter  But what for?   David H. Souter  Well, if you win on the preclusion--   David H. Souter  --what do you get then in substance?   David H. Souter  Then what do you intend to do?  If you win on preclusion, what do you do then?   David H. Souter  No, but the argument... it seems to me the argument is that in a de facto sense, when you try to litigate the Federal case, after losing the State case, you in effect are asking the Federal court in some sense to review what happened in the State court.  Justice Ginsburg's answer to that is preclusion is the answer.  Is that your answer?   David H. Souter  Because if that... if that is... if we accept that as the answer, then there's no argument for saying you should expand Rooker-Feldman to include the de facto review as opposed to the... the very strict sense of review that you're talking about.   David H. Souter  And I take it that's because you don't have the cert period expired yet in the first action and you don't have the check.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  It's... if the 3 months is expired and the check is in your hand and it's certified, what's left?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I'm not asking about your intention.  Let's assume you do intend to litigate further.  What for?   David H. Souter  I want... I want an answer to my question.  What are you going to litigate for?  What's left?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I'm talking about your case.  What's left?   David H. Souter  Nothing is left.   ",03-1696
0,"David H. Souter  And the... and the concern is I think... at least as I understand the... the concern with it, it... it boils down to something like this.  Somebody comes along and says, don't apply claim preclusion.  Don't apply it because, for whatever reason, there's this... there's something wrong here, and... and Federal court should determine the... in fact, the... the claim preclusion of the State judgment should not apply.  The answer to that is, look, that's an issue to be raised by way of appeal of your State judgment.  You don't appeal State judgments in Federal court.  Out.  There's no such claim being made here.  The only claim that's being made here or the only conceivable claim, I guess, that can be made here is that we might want to do some litigating in the Federal case after the State case is over.  There's no claim here that claim preclusion should not apply in that instance, and because there's no such argument that claim preclusion does not apply, the answer to the problem that you're worried about is simply claim preclusion doctrine.  There's no reason to add a perihelion or something onto Rooker-Feldman to deal with what is really a very simple problem and that is, if they try to relitigate anew in Federal court, as Justice Ginsburg says, you... you plead claim preclusion.  Simple.  Why do we need to complicate it beyond that simplicity?   David H. Souter  Well, no, because the... it... it would not rule out the need to have some answer when someone in a Federal court comes along and says, don't apply claim preclusion, whatever the reason may be.  Don't apply the claim preclusion rules.  There's something unfair about doing it here.  The answer to that is, look, what you're really asking us to do, when you say don't apply claim preclusion, is to review what happened in the State court, and we don't sit as an appellate court on State courts.  So there's still something for Rooker-Feldman to do on, as it were, Justice... Justice Ginsburg's claim preclusion argument.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It'll get the... it'll get the job done that you say will need to be done if you get to that point.   David H. Souter  Why won't it?   David H. Souter  Then... then you--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --Then... then you appeal.  Don't ask for a new body of law.  Just say, look, you got the application of claim preclusion wrong in this case.  We're going to appeal.   ",03-1696
1,"David H. Souter  And... and if in fact--   David H. Souter  --you rely on the rule, do we even have to resolve the issue of meaning of report in the statute?  Can't we simply, from your position, rely on the rule and say you've got to follow your own rules?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So you've really got three arguments.  You've got the rule.  You've got the statute, and you have due process.   ",03-184X
0,"David H. Souter  But that's not the way the rule reads.  The rule reads, as I understand it, under (c) that the court itself may accept, reject, or modify.  It doesn't say anything about the special trial judge reconsidering and rewriting his report.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No. But I don't see what is consistent with your notion of a deliberative process as producing the report and the presumption of correctness in the rule.  The rule presumes that some original document, which you are treating as provisional, enjoys a presumption of correctness, and I don't see the consistency between provisionality and deliberate character on the one hand and presumption on the other.   David H. Souter  And aren't those findings of fact the findings of fact that are delivered to the chief judge in the report that is made to the chief judge before it is even assigned to a Tax Court judge?   David H. Souter  But he hasn't abandoned them at the point that he delivers them to the chief judge, and if that's what this is referring to, then the presumption of the... of... of correctness necessarily has to apply to whatever the document is that's delivered to the chief judge.   David H. Souter  The presumption.   David H. Souter  So you're saying the rule itself in that respect is invalid?   David H. Souter  Well, how else could you possibly construe it?  There's no presumption operating at all on your reading.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but you're saying there is... there is no presumption of correctness that can operate with respect to the report that goes first to the chief judge because, I understood you to say, to do that would violate the Internal Revenue Code provision that the fact-finder and the only fact-finder is the Tax Court judge.  And therefore, I think the implication of what you're saying is that the rule on its face is invalid.   David H. Souter  I'm... I'm not even getting to whatever the standard of review may be.  I presume the word presumption means something other than it's there unless you want to change it later after the person who employs you objects to it.  It's got to mean something more than that.   David H. Souter  But there's no party who is seeking to change at this point because the parties don't know what's in it.  They're not going forward.  This is, as you point out, an internal process that is going on here.  So that definition can't apply.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Any weight?   David H. Souter  So I... I think your... I think your answer then is not that this is invalid.  It is simply unenforceable.  It is precatory language, looks okay, but there's no way to police it.   David H. Souter  Judicially it cannot be enforced.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Except that the... the relationship between the... the one judge and the full Tax Court is a relationship basically of people who are in the same boat with respect to what they know about or can know about law and what they can know about the evidence and the facts of the case; whereas the relationship between the special trial judge and the judge to whom it is assigned is... is quite different because only one of them has heard evidence and only one of them is the source of conclusion about fact.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It certainly is not identical in... in the sense that the... the Tax Court judge then goes and listens to evidence.  He doesn't.  That's the whole point.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Neither does the full Tax Court, but if the full Tax Court is disagreeing with one judge, the one judge and the full Tax Court are in the same boat.  They have access to the same material.  Their limits are exactly the same in each case.  That is not true in the relationship between the single Tax Court judge and the special Tax Court judge.  The special Tax Court judge is the only one who has heard evidence and can find facts based upon the evidence that he heard.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I... I am quite aware of that.  That's not... that's not the point.  I'm... I'm saying that you cannot draw an analogy between one judge and full Tax Court and use that as an analogy to legitimize the relationship between one judge and a trial master.  They are in different positions.  They are not in parallel positions.   David H. Souter  It's the knowledge issue.  The special Tax Court judge heard somebody.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Nobody on the Tax Court did.   David H. Souter  In other words, they're... they're sitting hearing witnesses?  They are... they are redoing the trial?  Surely not.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But we are talking about situations in which the trial judge is the special judge.   ",03-184X
0,"David H. Souter  Well, it isn't just duration of... of confinement.  I mean, in... in Balisok, what you had was a determination that the confinement would be definitely less as a result of the... the good time scheme.  The... the gut notion behind Balisok was that what you were attacking would imply that the sentence itself was invalid because the conviction was and so on.  We don't have that here.  What we have here is a scheme that makes a... a sentence that is imposed a more definite sentence.  We know where in the range it's going to be reconsidered.  And however that may be classified, it's not simply a Balisok situation.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Right, but that had--   David H. Souter  --that had nothing to do with the rationale in Balisok, as I recall it.  Isn't that correct?   David H. Souter  No... no question.  But the durational consequence in those cases was a definite consequence of longer duration, i.e., a sentence in the first place, a sentence not reduced by good time in... in the second example.  Here, there... there is no such clear consequence.  Here, the consequence is that there will simply be a period of time before a sentence already imposed will be reviewed to determine whether, in fact, it will be shortened or allowed to run.  And that's different.   David H. Souter  No... no question about that.  At... at the level of whether there is a durational consequence, they... they both have it.  I... I grant you that.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It... it doesn't advance the date of eligibility.  It advances the date at which the parole board will take another look.  The only eligibility is an eligibility to take... to have another look-take and not an eligibility for release.   David H. Souter  But if they are subject to another look, they are not necessarily then eligible for release.  And I think that's the point that we're getting... let me... let me ask a... a sort of complementary question.  Is there any reason that these--   David H. Souter  --With an E. With an E. But if... if you take my questioning as a compliment with an I, that's perfectly okay too.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Let's see what it is.  The... the question is, could these claims not have been brought in advance of any application to these particular prisoners of the revised... whatever they were... the 1998 guidelines?  And if the answer is yes, then they could be brought at a time when, I suppose, habeas would... would not have been a possible remedy.  Is... is... am I correct on those two points?   David H. Souter  Is... may... may I just follow up on that question?  At the administrative level, cannot these State law policies perfectly well be taken into consideration?  In other words, your argument was these things are bound up with State law issues and the best place to have them resolved is... is in a State forum.  They can be resolved in a State administrative forum, can't they?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But... but the... the generality at which you keep referring to it, with respect to conditions of confinement, is a... is a higher level of generality than anything that Balisok decided.  In Balisok, the particular decision was a decision to revoke an entitlement to be released at whatever the date the good time would give, and... and that is a much more specific... I mean, that literally affects an entitlement to be released.  It is not merely a decision with respect to length of confinement.   David H. Souter  We... we don't know what consequence it will have for the duration of his confinement.  All we know is that it will have a consequence in determining the date at which the next look will be taken by the parole board to see whether he then is in a condition to be released.  That's all we can tell.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  But you're... you're assuming... your argument now is assuming that they are going to be successful on this element, that you say they've got to satisfy later.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And... and whether they are or not has nothing to do with... with Balisok and Heck.   David H. Souter  Sure.  It also... it also means that if... if... assuming your argument is sound, if you lose this case, you win the war.  [Laughter]   ",03-287X
1,"David H. Souter  And why--   David H. Souter  --You said... you said a moment ago that it would be expanding habeas, and I'd like you to expand on that.  It would be expanding habeas, I am assuming, because in every successful habeas case, the ultimate remedy that the court can order, if the State does not snap to it, is the immediate release of the prisoner.  And I take it when you said it would expand habeas, it would expand it because this would not be an immediate release case no matter what.  Is that correct?   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  And that's why they could not bring habeas in this case because if they won, they still would not have shown anything that entitled to them to get out now or get out now unless the State within 30 days does something.  Is... is that the nub of it?   David H. Souter  Regardless of what he's asking for, if he got what he wanted, he still would not be entitled to any immediate release.   David H. Souter  He would still have a sentence of X years, and the question is, how often are we going to look at him to decide when, within X years, we may let him out.  Is that--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --That's the nub of it I guess.  The fact that he may be granted parole has no implication for the validity of the sentence.   David H. Souter  In fact, it assumes the sentence is valid, but that he will probably stay clean if he gets out.  That's all it means, isn't it?   ",03-287X

Souter  Well--  --But I take it you are--   David H. Souter  No, but I thought your... may I, may I ask you this, because I'm having the trouble Justice Scalia is having.  I thought your principal argument on the basis of Eisentrager was that it cannot stand for the proposition that there is no jurisdiction because in fact, in Eisentrager, there was enough mention of matters on the merits so that it was clear that's what was driving the ultimate resolution in Eisentrager.  And it cannot stand for the proposition that a court cannot even inquire, and the only issue we have got is whether under the Habeas Statute the court can even inquire.  Do I misunderstand your position?   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  But isn't that the merits case that you are talking about?  I mean, your jurisdictional argument doesn't depend, as I understand it, on military regulations or the Geneva Convention.  It depends on this statute.   David H. Souter  If you get into court, your clients may raise Geneva Convention and all sorts of things, but that's not what your case here depends on.   ",03-334X
0,"David H. Souter  Why?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, it's clear that there was no relief.  What do you say to Mr. Gibbons' position that because in fact they did discuss the merits, that case cannot really be taken as authority for the... leaving Ahrens and Braden aside, that the case cannot be taken as authority for the proposition that there is no jurisdiction in the sense of allowing the person through the door to make whatever claim the person wants to make.  What is your response to that?   David H. Souter  Oh, it did.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I'm really not asking a question about, frankly, about the Court's terminology.  I'm asking about the holding in the case.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  The mere argument is you can't say it held anything more than that there was no relief at the end of the road.   David H. Souter  Well, the briefs may have mentioned it, but wasn't the problem that Eisentrager had to confront, the problem created by Ahrens, construing respective jurisdiction, and therefore, the only way there could be habeas jurisdiction in Eisentrager was if due process demanded it.  And the Court went on to say, well, there are various reasons why there is no ultimate due process entitlement, and therefore, due process does not demand entertainment of jurisdiction.  After Braden, that argument is gone.  Why, therefore, is Eisentrager not undercut to the point where it's no further authority on the jurisdictional point?   David H. Souter  Yeah.   David H. Souter  No, but there are no rights that can be recognized unless there is jurisdiction in the first place.  And if the Court is going to make good on what you have just said it said, it has got to do so presupposing jurisdiction.  So if you are going to rely upon those statements, don't you necessarily have to concede jurisdiction?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  With respect to the citizen?  Doesn't make any difference if they have got lots of rights if there is no jurisdiction to get into a court to enforce them.   David H. Souter  Is that your answer to Justice Kennedy, that there would be jurisdiction because due process would require it for citizens, but there would not be statutory jurisdiction in the case of the citizen at Guantanamo?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, but what is the position... I mean, I want to know what the position of the United States is for the same reason Justice Kennedy does.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why is that, why is that crucial?  I mean, it's not crucial, I take it, under the respective jurisdiction clause of 2241.  Is it crucial under the Due Process Clause?   INTERRUPTING David H.

1,"David H. Souter  But isn't... isn't it possible to read... and I'm not sure it should be read this way, but isn't it possible to read the Mansfield Amendment as simply saying DEA agents should not go out in foreign police raids when the police of the foreign countries make the raids.  Stay out of it.  That's one way to read the... the foreign police action qualification.   David H. Souter  It doesn't... but it doesn't imply anything one way or the other.   David H. Souter  Of course, you get there by assuming that anything that the DEA does is law enforcement.   David H. Souter  Okay.  Mr. Phillips, let's... let's assume I accept your argument that there are good reasons not to invite the... the... today's brooding omnipresence into court without something more from Congress, that there are good reasons to be concerned about separation of powers problems.  Assume also that I am convinced or the Court is convinced that at the time the statute was passed, there was an understanding that there were certain offenses to which the jurisdictional provision would... would provide access for litigation, piracy offenses and things like that.  How do I distinguish today's situation from yesterday's situation and hold your way without being inconsistent with what I take it the understanding was at the time in incorporating some offenses in a common law kind of way?

I am assuming that the cause of action was assumed to be out there and that the jurisdictional provision opened the door to the courthouse to get the cause of action in.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, yes.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Is it clear that there was nothing in the absence of... of action by the States?

",03-377X
0,"David H. Souter  Well, isn't the difficulty with that... that the point that I raised with Mr. Ayer?  To take that position before the most recent amendment and now, you've got to say that the word subparagraph refers to the section of one sentence which, regardless of legislative drafting manuals, I... I think anybody would say, well, it's a clause, and to call a clause a subparagraph is a stretch, at least in the absence of a very clear provision somewhere in the statute that says when we use the word subparagraph, we include clause.  That... there's a basic implausibility, I guess I find, in using subparagraph at any point in the statute to refer to a mere clause.   David H. Souter  Well, no.  It... it... that... that completely leaves... even in your view, that leaves open the question whether this refers to a clause or a set of three clauses.  It... it doesn't answer the question before us whether subparagraph means clause.   David H. Souter  Well, the... you can look at that either way, it seems to me.  One way is to see it as a conflict.  There's no question about that.  Another way is to see it... I think the term that has been used is carve-out.  In other words, the... the cap on damages will be such and such provided that.  If you got a mortgage, the cap is going to be higher.  You can read it either way.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That's... that's the argument for your reading.  There's no question about it.  But it... I don't see it as an argument that excludes the proviso kind of reading.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  All right.  But let's... I mean, start--   David H. Souter  --Start from your own analysis.  There's something very odd about saying that when there has been a violation involving a mortgage transaction, you can only get $2,000, but a violation in a conventional bank financing or a finance company financing or a dealer financing of a chattel transaction, the sky is... is the limit.  There's just something very strange about that.  Most houses cost more than most cars.  It is odd that you would have the limitation on the potentially larger damages and no limitation... or, let's say, recovery just as a... a generic term... but no limitation on the damages in what normally is... is a smaller transaction.  How do you explain that oddity?   David H. Souter  Well, they do... they happen to be right at this moment in the business climate, but that is not the characteristic climate in which this act has operated over the years and presumably will operate again as interest rates start their way back up.   David H. Souter  Well, but there's a cap, but he's still going to get more money than he would be if exactly this same kind of behavior had taken place with respect to the financing of a mortgage on a half a million dollar house.   David H. Souter  That's strange.   David H. Souter  Well, but getting all of your money back is... is presumably going to make you whole so far as the transaction is concerned, and we have to assume that allowing the transaction under (i) is going to keep you whole so far as the transaction is concerned.  The... the issue is what do you get in addition to remaining whole or steady with respect to the value of the transaction.  And when we ask that question, the potential for recovery under (i) is significantly greater than the potential for recovery under (iii), even though (i) tends to be a smaller transaction, (iii) a bigger one.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  Your... your... there's no question that... that in... in this... in the case of your client, he's got problems that this act really does not address.  But the question what we've got is what does the statute normally address, and I still find something anomalous in the normal operation as you describe it.  What am I missing?   David H. Souter  But if that is the answer, you're still left with the situation, as I understand it, in which the recovery under the small loan is going to be potentially in, I suppose, many cases practically bigger than the recovery under the large loan.  And that still seems cuckoo to me.   David H. Souter  Let me... let me ask you a question which you are free to decline to answer because it... it rests upon an assumption that you don't make but the Fourth Circuit did make, and if you say, look, I don't want to defend the Fourth Circuit on this, okay with me.   David H. Souter  The--   David H. Souter  --the Fourth--   David H. Souter  --The... not refuse to answer.  Exercise an option not to answer.  [Laughter]  The Fourth Circuit made the assumption that prior to the addition of (iii), the... the $100,000 minimum and... and cap applied to... to both little (i) or little (i) and little (ii).  And you... you have argued that that really isn't a sound assumption.  But if you... if you start where the Fourth Circuit did in making that assumption, then there being no reenactment of (i) and (ii) when (iii) was added, the Fourth Circuit position has got to, I think, encounter the... the general presumption against repeals by implication.  And on the Fourth Circuit's theory, the... the threshold cap applied to... to Roman little (i), and without any reenactment or anything, suddenly it no longer did.  There was no express provision to that effect.  There was nothing in the legislative history to indicate that that was intended, and it seems to me that there is a... a difficult repeal by implication problem here.  Is... is there an answer to that problem?   David H. Souter  If this is an express repeal, you win.  [Laughter]   ",03-377X

Souter  Every time they sue on the... on the ground that... let's say, that... that the... the actual use was inconsistent with what the label described, you could say, gee, if their theory is correct, we'd have to change our label to say that what's on the label now is in fact not properly descriptive of the product.  So it's not a... a question of needing more fact.  On your theory, whenever they, in effect, sue on the basis of what you say, your response is going to be, as a matter of law, well, if they're correct, we'd have to say something else.  That impeaches the label.  Therefore, preemption.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay, but why--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --No, but neither--   David H. Souter  --The problem that I think some of... several of us are having is that both the... as I understand it, the Fifth Circuit test in your argument draws no distinction between the two following kinds of situations.  Situation A: there's something that the manufacturer should have told you, should have put on the label, but the manufacturer didn't.  Situation B: the manufacturer puts something on the label which in fact is wrong and in Justice Stevens' example is in fact false and it causes harm.  It makes sense, it seems to me, for preemption purposes to say if the person who sues sues simply on the ground that I bought it in reliance on the label, the label was false, I should get damages for... for whatever harm was caused, that situation should be dealt with for preemption purposes differently from the situation in which the... the manufacturer made no false statement.  He simply should have said more.  And if... if you don't distinguish between those two situations, then the... the prohibition against mislabeling means absolutely nothing because... because it can never be enforced, in effect, except with respect to some prospective user.  It can never be enforced with respect to the actual user.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, and the argument that's being made is that we ought to... we ought to read... we ought to read the limitation, which Justice Scalia has just described, with respect to labeling and packaging, in a relatively narrow way to allow the suit to go forward and, therefore, we ought to make a distinction between the two kinds of situations.   David H. Souter  Yes, but why isn't there a big difference, for purposes of your argument, between the Medtronic situation and this one for the simple reason in this case you've got a statute that authorizes EPA to do absolutely nothing on the subject of efficacy?  And EPA does nothing on the subject of efficacy.   INTERRUPTING ",03-388X

I guess I probably would accept your position if I did not think there... there was another equally workable alternative here.  And I didn't understand your answer to my earlier question in which you said, if I recall correctly, that it would be unethical for these lawyers to represent a... a future client, subject to a claim to be paid and on behalf both of the client and, I suppose, of themselves, but essentially on behalf of a client, say, there is a right to State money to pay the lawyer who is representing them.  It would be, as I understood you to say, unethical for the lawyer to proceed on that basis.  And I don't understand the reason for your answer.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Oh, no.  I'm assuming they... they represent the client for all purposes and one of the client's claims is, pay my lawyer.  I don't have any money.  Your statute is unconstitutional.  Why cannot the lawyer pursue that claim on behalf of the client and... and raise exactly the issue that is being raised in substance here?   David H. Souter  Well, except that that's a very formalistic answer.  The... the claim, in effect, would be I have a right to be appointed whatever your statute says because... or my... the... the client would say my lawyer... I have a right to appointed counsel, whatever your statute says, with the consequence of payment.  So to say, well, they're not appointed, that's the question.  Should they be appointed?  I don't see why they cannot raise that issue.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay, but these... these lawyers are in the rotation.  Are you suggesting that the rotation is so enormous that it will be 20 years before they get another client?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I mean, your... your claim is that they are going to get clients in the future and they... they ought to have a right to be paid when the time comes.  So why doesn't, number one, a lawyer representing the next client, whoever he may be, have a right to raise this, and why doesn't each one of these lawyers have a right to raise it presumably within a reasonable time when they next come up in the rotation?   David H. Souter  Sure they would, and that's what will get brought to this Court.  That's what we're here for.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, because the claim is that they have a right under Federal law to an effective procedure whereby paid counsel can be supplied to them.  That's a Federal issue, not a State issue.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That's all you've got to get up here.   David H. Souter  It's an argument.   David H. Souter  Right.  Exactly the same situation.  They can... they can bring the case directly for the client they're representing just as readily as they can bring this one.

I think you're saying the reason we can't have discovery is because the whole statute is unconstitutional as applied to the President.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes.  If we go... I mean, if we do what Justice Ginsburg is trying to do, and that is get to the jurisdictional issue without passing, in the first instance, as accord in the first instance on the merits, then it seems to me that the jurisdictional question, to me at least, boils down to this.  Why should we accept your position on jurisdiction when jurisdiction goes to the propriety with constitutional overtones, of course, of discovery, and we don't have the discovery order refined yet.  If this case goes back or if it had indeed not been appealed in the first place, you would have been fighting with your colleagues on the other side about what specific discovery to allow.  Once we knew what the District Court specifically was going to allow, we would have a fairly sharply focused question, and that arguably would be subject to an appeal regardless of the final judgment rule.  But we don't have that focus yet.   David H. Souter  But you never came down... I realize that, I have read the orders.  But you never came back, or the Government never came back and said, well, that order is too broad because, and we think it could be allowed to this extent, and there was... there was no, as I understand it, there was no process of trying to refine the discovery order down to anything beyond the generalities that we have on the record.

0,"David H. Souter  Mr. Stewart, may I interrupt you?  Oh, I'm... may I interrupt you and ask... ask this question?  You're right.  Textually there's... there's nothing in (iv) that... that has the condition of... of prior approval.  The argument... one argument is made is that because of the substantial overlap of... of the subsections in (E) with the country of... of nationality or citizenship in (D), that if you do not recognize a... a requirement of acceptance for the (E) categories, basically you're going to do an end run around (D).  The Government's answer to that argument, as I understand it, as... as I tried to... to put it in a question to your... your friend, is that there is no absolute requirement of acceptance in (D).  There is simply a... a... the Attorney General's mandate to send the person to a... a country of citizenship is... is subject to that.  But if the country will not accept, the Attorney General still has discretion to send him to that country.  There is one answer to that that your brother did not get into, and I... I want to raise it.  As I understand it, the House report for the... what was it... the '96 act, the current statute anyway.  The House report indicated that there was no intent to change the substance of the provisions dealt with from what they had been under the prior statute.  And under the prior statute, which is set out on... on page 1a of the petitioner's brief, it seems to me that it is very clear that there was an absolute requirement of acceptance for the Attorney General to act under the predecessor language to what is now subsection (D).  If you look down to within the... the three lines from the... from the bottom of... of page 1a, which refers to that, there... there seems to be a clear condition: if such country is willing to accept him into its territory.  Now, if I'm reading the old law right and the House report does reflect or should be taken by us in interpretation to reflect the intent of Congress, then don't we have to say that the Attorney General's authority, not merely mandate, but authority, under (D) requires acceptance?  And therefore, if we take your view, we would, in effect, allow an end run around a condition indeed because the Attorney General could simply say, okay, I'm going to go to little (iv) under (E).  I'm going to find the country of the birth.  I don't have to get acceptance.  It happens to be the same country as citizenship.  But... but in he goes, or at least up to the border he goes.  What's your answer to that argument?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So if... if there is acceptance, he does have to remove.  If there is no acceptance, he has discretion.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I guess you could say that he shall do everything he possibly can, but his mandate to do that evaporates if there's no acceptance.   David H. Souter  It... it was the House report.   David H.

Souter  --May... may I go back to, let's say, the... the nub, the narrow nub of... of my earlier question, and that is this.  The predecessor language to what is now subsection (D), as I read it, clearly required the approval of the country if there was to be a removal to the country, a repatriation to the country.  The House report says we don't intend to make any change in the substantive law.  If we accept the House report, then we've... we're going to say that the proper reading of (D) is not your reading, but the reading that says the Attorney General cannot act under (D) unless there is, in fact, an... an acceptance by the country.  And if that is true, then your reading of Roman (iv) in (E) allows you to make an end run around that condition, and that would be a good reason for interpreting all of (E) to require agreement and acceptance by the country.

Am... am I missing something?   David H. Souter  Well, based on an objective test, we'll get absolutely nowhere.  The person who is arrested is not in a position to be making objective or subjective assessments, by and large.  He probably knows what he's being arrested for because it's obvious, but then we have cases like this, which are the only ones that are going to be litigated, and he may not know.

Souter  But... but don't you reconcile the... the problem of the straddle by saying that unless the probable cause, which we will assume existed, is for a closely related offense, the whole arrest was invalid?  Isn't that your position?   David H. Souter  Okay.  Now, let me ask you... you one other question.  You... you started out in getting down to first principles with disfavor of warrantless arrests.  Would your position be different if the officer had somehow gotten an arrest warrant on the spot for illegal taping?  Wouldn't you be making the same argument?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So it has nothing to do, essentially, with warrantless or nonwarrantless arrests.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, in this... yes, but on your theory, that is... that is incidental.  That is not essential.  If he had had an arrest warrant for illegal taping, you'd be making the same argument.   David H. Souter  That's... that's right.   David H. Souter  Yes.

Souter  Well, if we... if we accept that and textually the statute is a draw, we... we wouldn't have to get to this interpretative principle.  I mean, one reason for getting to the interpretative principle that you now suggest is... is simply the submissions of... of foreign countries as well as the United States in this particular case.

Souter  Yeah, but why is it ethical, to the extent that there seems to be a mandatory obligation to order restitution?  And it seems to me that the restitution that would be ordered would be just as much in derogation of the common law principle as the out-and-out collection in Justice Breyer's example.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, but I... a moment ago, you said,  ""Okay, we'll assume that there would be some derogation. ""  in Justice Breyer's example.  I don't see why you don't come to the same conclusion with respect to the restitution aspect here.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yeah, but the revenue... the revenue rule does not rest simply on the rationale of non-extraterritorial enforcement.  It has... it has other rationales: difficulty of understanding what the revenue rule is; the... you know, the problems of policy; there are lots of revenue rules in foreign countries that we certainly wouldn't want to enforce, and so on.

0,"David H. Souter  Well, Ms.... Ms. Millett, my... my problem with that argument and I guess my basic problem with... with the case is Congress did not just sort of stop when it got to the point that would support your Lewis argument.  It went a step... it went several steps further.  But one of the steps further that it went to was... was in... in a certain fussiness about the definition of crime, and it said, well, we want to make sure that... that no State or... or Federal business criminals are... are put at a disadvantage by this.  It then accepted anything that a State might call a misdemeanor if it carried no more than 2 years.  And it just seems very odd to me that Congress would have been that careful in putting these limitations on State and Federal crimes and would totally have ignored any category of crime under foreign law, any conviction under foreign law in... in light of some of the hypotheses that have been thrown out this morning.  It just seems strange that it would have ignored foreign law and foreign courts if it thought they were included.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, it called it that, but it didn't... it didn't have this issue in front of it.   David H. Souter  I... I realize you've got the language, but it... it wasn't addressing this issue.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, I was talking about our language.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But... and I think that ought to count for a lot too.  [Laughter]   David H. Souter  No, but how... how familiar an example is it that price-fixers would... would be placed in... in a terrible position if they couldn't carry guns?  I mean, that was not a pressing problem, so far as I know.  And yet, Congress dealt with it.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And if it can deal with a problem that is as little pressing as that, it seems odd that it would not have averted in any way to equally non-pressing problems under... under foreign convictions if that's what they had in mind.

1,"David H. Souter  No, but doesn't... doesn't that put you right back in the problem, the original problem, with... with the riverboat?  If all it is is tied up, it isn't permanently taken out of navigation.  It isn't precluded.  All they've got to do is cast the lines off and it's out in the water so that the riverboat is the vessel and presumably we've got seamen working on it.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So you're saying... and I... I don't mean to disagree with you.  You're saying, yes, there are going to be a few tough results under this definition.   David H. Souter  When you say the function of the vessel, do you mean the function of the vessel in its transportation function?   David H. Souter  So that would be the answer to the riverboat problem.  You'd say sure, if the... if the riverboat is capable simply of being let go in the water by casting off lines, the riverboat is a vessel.  But you don't have to worry about turning all the... the croupiers and the waiters into seamen because they're not contributing to the transportation function of the vessel.   David H.

0,"David H. Souter  But may I--   David H. Souter  --May I interrupt you there, Mr. Kneedler?  Because I mean, the question is whether constitutionally we should respect that presumption.  And... and my... my question basically is this.  I can perfectly well understand and I can understand the... the argument for respecting that presumption.  When you're dealing with excluded aliens who are in a literal territorial sense within the border but are never allowed, in effect, beyond a point of initial custody, the ones who are kept at Ellis Island or wherever one may... may keep them.  It is difficult, however, I... I think to accept what has been called the... the fiction of custody.  When we are dealing with individuals who, although absolutely excludable, were nonetheless welcomed into the United States by a public announcement of the President of the United States, have been allowed into the American population, just as clearly and as readily as they would have been under any other protocol of admission... and I guess in this case for something like 20 years... isn't there a point at which the... the fiction of exclusion simply cannot be accepted for constitutional purposes?   David H. Souter  Well, factually.  They're allowed into the country.  You know, they can get jobs, own property, et cetera.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  I realize but they are admitted in the sense that they say, okay, you can come in and you can do these things, but you get no... in effect, you get no vested right.  We can take it away like that.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  All right.  But otherwise... otherwise they are treated like any other class of aliens who are admitted into the United States.  They are subject to this condition.  The United States makes that clear, but they nonetheless can be in the country and do in the country what other aliens can do.   David H. Souter  I... I know.  Subject to that condition.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  I... I realize that, but the problem is you've got a Due Process Clause that talks about persons not citizens.  Maybe I can understand the... the fiction that says it doesn't apply to these persons if, for practical purposes, we stop them at the border and we don't let them into society.  Once we do let them into society, whether we say it's subject to this condition it can be revoked or not, I find it difficult to see a constitutional warrant for drawing the line that you want us to draw.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You're giving me prior examples, but the issue here is should we continue to respect that... what has been called that fiction as to people who are allowed into the country and are allowed to move around like other aliens and, indeed, and by and large like citizens.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  All right. I can... I can agree with you that the different classes are going to implicate different considerations on what is reasonable.  But you, as I understand it, go the further step and say there is a presumption, and perhaps an irrebuttable presumption, that in the case of the... the legally excluded, even though they are, in fact, in the country, the... the presumptive reasonable period is forever.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And that's where... it's that stretch that's giving us the trouble.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That's true, but we've got to say something.   David H. Souter  Well, you... you skipped a... a phrase.  It says when the Attorney General is of the opinion that the purposes of the parole justify nothing more, the individual shall return or be returned to the custody from which he began.  And their argument is that custody is different in these cases.   John S. Mills  That custody is the custody under 1225(b)(2)(A).  That is the statute that authorizes the custody.  That's what they're being returned to.  1225(b)(2)(A) is detention until the removal proceedings.  And in the Demore v. Kim case, this case... this Court said that even if it's a long time and there aren't other procedures in place, you can be detained until your removal order is entered because... and... and the emphasis was there's an end date to that.  So there's an end date to detention under (b)(2)(A), 1225(b)(2)(A), and it's the removal proceedings.  Section 1231 is the statute that governs removal and says, okay, now what happens?  It says you have to remove within 90 days, but for certain aliens who've committed crimes or are inadmissible or are otherwise determined to be dangerous, we can detain them beyond.  It says may be detained beyond the period.  That is the only statute that authorizes any detention of an alien after a removal order other than the specific terrorist statute, 1226(a), which was enacted, which does not authorize indefinite detention.  It says... it has a paragraph labeled indefinite detention, and it says the Government shall not indefinitely detain a terrorist alien that it cannot remove except that if the Government determines... and... and it appears to put the burden on the Government... that the person is a danger to national security or the community, it can detain them for another 6 months.  And then you... you could have indefinite detention, but each time, each 6 months, the statute provides for review.  So not only do the sneakers, the aliens who cross across the border in the... in the dark of night from Mexico or wherever... not only do they under the Government's own admission have the Zadvydas rights, so too do terrorist aliens by statute.  And to suggest that by some implication Congress has intended to authorize the indefinite detention of people that we thought we should welcome into our country, even though we didn't have the ability under our quota system and under our current regulations in 1980 to let them in, somehow they have no rights against indefinite detention.  For the Government to--   David H. Souter  What you... what you mean when you say we can forcibly return them is literally we can take them to Guantanamo, take them to the gate, and push them out?   John S. Mills  --That's one option.  If there... if the Cuban army is there to prevent us, you know, maybe it would require some military action that the administration might decide is not advisable.  But those are the options depending on the size of the threat.  So a judicial interpretation that the statute means the same thing in all contexts does not deprive the Government of anything.  And I'd like to go back to that if I could.   David H. Souter  Well, what about the argument that the statute, in effect, limits the... our... our interpretation limits the... the detention to a period reasonably related to the Government's interest in accomplishing that interest?  That interest is different in... in the case of... of aliens who are excluded, if we accept that class as distinct from all excludables.  And... and that may allow a much longer period of detention, among other things, to deter dictators from... from dumping.  You've given us an answer to what to do if they dump, but we don't want them to dump in the first place.  That argument stops short of saying we can detain them for life, but it would support the... the position that on a consistent interpretation of the statute, the Government could detain them longer in the excluded cases than in others.  What's your answer to that?   John S. Mills  My answer to that is that that might be a... a legislative policy decision to make that distinction.  But in 1996, IIRIRA abolished the distinction between inadmissible and deportable aliens after they've been ordered removed.  Up until that time, it makes a difference.  It makes a difference under the Constitution.  But once they've been ordered removed... and this was the Government's argument in Zadvydas.  Once they've been ordered removed, regardless of how they got here in the first place, they no longer have any right to be here at all and--   David H. Souter  There is only one class of excludables by the Government's own choice.  That's... that's basically your answer.   John S. Mills  --After a removal proceeding, there is only one class.  That is correct.   David H. Souter  Yes.   John S. Mills  If there are no more questions, I would just ask that the Court reverse in this case.  If there are any mootness concerns about Mr. Benitez, I would refer the Court to Friends of the Environment which said that when a challenged practice has stopped voluntarily, that does not moot a case out in the Supreme Court unless there's some reason to believe they won't go at it again.  And the Government has asserted that it can revoke his release at any time for any reason and detain him indefinitely.  And the suggestion that the fact that he's been released under the Cuban Review Panel shows that his... he's been protected is... is not well taken.  He was determined, when he first was detained in... in 2001, that he was eligible under the Cuban Review Panel to be released.  It took 3 years and the week before this case was argued in the highest court of the land before the Immigration Service did what its own regulations told it it had to do.  Thank you very much.

1,"David H. Souter  What's... what's your best answer to the Government's argument that unless you treat this case differently from Zadvydas, at least for purposes of reasonable time or reasonable interest, which affects time, the United States is basically defenseless against countries that... that want to dump undesirable aliens and force them into the United States?   David H. Souter  Because.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But it's defenseless under the present law?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then what is the defense?   INTERRUPTING David H.

What's the difference in... in terms of control?  So that if you win this case, why doesn't it apply to class action?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, and I... I want to know why the result would be different.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why... why would... why would that analysis appear?

I don't understand, based on what you've said, why the class action result would be different from the result that you're arguing for here if you win this case.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Mr. Salmons, doesn't the plausibility of your argument here rest on the assumption that what the... that the cause of action at the time the... that the plaintiff made the agreement with the lawyer is a cause of action which has the same value as the ultimate recovery that the lawyer gets?  Whereas, in fact, the cause of action at the time of the agreement with the lawyer has an inchoate value.  The... the value that is actually realized is going to depend in part on the... on the skill and... and the... the gumption of the lawyer.  So that the... what I'm getting at... and... and going to Justice Kennedy's question, it seems to me that the value realized as opposed to the right to sue are two different figures.  And I don't see realistically how the client has complete control over the value realized, which we don't even know until the lawyer has done his work and gotten the check.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but the bond coupon has a certain value at the time the father assigns it.   David H. Souter  The only thing that has to be realized after the assignment of the coupon is the passage of time at which it will be payable.  Here we do not have a definite value.  We don't know... there's no way to know for sure what the value will be until the lawsuit is over with.  The... the two are not comparable.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What... what do you we make of the fact that two Senators apparently don't agree with that position?  I mean, I... I'm referring to the colloquy that was quoted in... in one of the... the briefs about the recent legislation, and the... the substance of the colloquy was we're not making any change in the law, we're just clarifying it.  Well, in fact, if there is no textual difference for tax purposes between the law, so far as it concerns these... these so-called discrimination recoveries and non-discrimination recoveries that have the same problem that Justice O'Connor is talking about, shouldn't we infer that at least the Senate of the United States assumes that this does not get into gross?

We... we have said that that is a kind of seizure.  Why do... I think your... your argument assumes that this for... for purposes of search analogies that something is either a... a full-dress search or it's not a search at all.  Why isn't there a... a possibility of... of a kind of middle ground searches just as there is on seizures?   David H. Souter  Oh, I... I can... I can just imagine the problems, but I mean, what... I think what's... what the... what's bothering me about the case is that if we persist in... in saying that... that it's... that it's an either and or question with no question with no possible gradation, then I assume nothing prevents the police from taking the dogs through every municipal garage in the United States and I suppose there's nothing that prevents the police from taking the dogs up to any homeowner's door, ringing the bell, and seeing if the dog gets a sniff of something when the door is opened.  We're... we're opening rather a... a large vista for... for dog intrusions, and... and that's what's... that's what's bothering me.  Why... why should we... why should we open that vista if there is a possibility of a... of a middle ground that would prevent it?   David H. Souter  In... in discussing the... the answer to the... the Kyllo issue, you... you place an emphasis on the protection given to a house.  Would you go back to Justice O'Connor's question and my earlier example?  Is it still your answer that the police can walk dogs around the foundation of the house or take a dog to the front door and ring the bell and see what it... what it sniffs when the door is opened--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --without there being a search and hence no Fourth Amendment concern?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  But then... then the... then there is no significance in the house.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, when does... when does it occur?  I mean, if... if... first you say the... the house is... is a matter of significance for Kyllo analysis.  We're trying to draw a distinction, if there is one, between Kyllo and this, and you say they can go to the house.  They can sniff the foundations.  They can go to the front door, et cetera.  I don't see that the house, in fact, is functioning as a distinction at all.   David H. Souter  Oh, I realize that, but it seems to me your basic argument, if I understand it, is there is simply no search here, and because there is no search here, it doesn't matter whether you're dealing with a house or a parking lot or a car on the road.  No search is no search.  So for purposes of... if I... I want to understand your case, and as I understand it, for purposes of your case, there is no significance in the house because there doesn't have to be.  The question doesn't arise because there's no search.  Is that--   David H. Souter  Why do you rely on the... in... in distinguishing Kyllo, why do you rely on the house if there's no search?  Why do you have to rely on the fact that there was a house involved there?  You... you listed that as one of your three distinctions.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But... but your... is... is it... I understand it to be your position that there simply is no search here.  Period.   David H. Souter  Because it's a dog sniff.   David H. Souter  All right.  Do you... do you think it's... it's reasonable to say that if the police take dogs simply onto private property to sniff the foundations of houses, if they take dogs to the front door and ring the bell so that they hope the door will open, that there is... there is no compromise of a privacy interest?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, I mean, the Fourth Amendment analysis after Katz doesn't... doesn't depend on trespass, and... and you have said up to this point that there is no search.  And then you have quite rightly said that we have had as a consideration in our minds analytically whether it's fair to say that what the police were doing involved any compromise of a privacy interest.  So I'm assuming... I'm assuming that the police can at least get to the foundation with a dog and they can certainly walk up to the front door and ring the bell.  And if they do that with a dog, for the purpose of letting the dog sniff and alert, if there's anything to alert to, is it fair to say that there is no compromise of the privacy interests of the people who own the house?   ",03-923X
1,"David H. Souter  No, but the... the difficulty that I have with that argument is take the... take the case of... of the arrestable offense in which it is undoubtedly the case that although the police don't normally arrest, they... they can.  Your... if I understand your argument, you're saying if they, in fact, do arrest, they may then take the dog around the car, and indeed, I presume you would agree, they could make an inventory search because they've got to protect themselves against claims that they lost property and so on.  So there's no question that in that case, as... as you have argued it, they could make a full-blown search and... and certainly can use the dog.  But if they choose not to arrest on the highway, they can't.  My problem is how can you say that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in case number two if you admit that the police can search in case number one.  How does that affect the reasonable expectation of privacy?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But... but is... why... why don't you simply say, look... have a very simple line.  If they can arrest, they can sniff.  If they can't arrest, they can't sniff without individualized suspicion going to drugs or whatever.   David H. Souter  But what... what is the answer to the reasonable expectation to privacy question in that case?  Isn't your expectation of privacy identical, whatever it may be, or isn't the reasonable expectation of privacy identical, whatever that may be, without regard to the discretionary decision of the officer to arrest or not?

Does the lawyer at that point at least have a... an option to proceed on the concession theory, leaving it to judge his performance under Strickland afterwards?   INTERRUPTING David H.

And I'm taking the... the facts one step further and saying let's assume the... the client goes whole-hog in his objection.  And he stands up or... or says in front of the judge and the jury, I... I'm not conceding any of this.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I... I would certainly agree if we get to that point.  But let's the lawyer does, as you at least left the door open for him to do, and... and he does proceed to represent the guy.  The judge doesn't remove him and the lawyer continues to concede.  Do you... do you think that there is any possibility on a Strickland analysis of finding adequacy of counsel?   David H. Souter  I... I--   David H. Souter  What... what did the judge... what did judge say?  Your brother said the judge said, no, I won't hear this.   ",03-931X
0,"David H. Souter  Let me ask you a question just about what you... what you're assuming when you make the... the statement... prefaced the argument to the effect that there was a complete breakdown of... of the adversary process.  You're assuming, I take it, when you say that, that the guilt phase and the penalty phase have got to be regarded as distinct and separate phases.   David H. Souter  You're dividing it in half.   David H. Souter  Why is that... why is that legitimate?  Why should a lawyer... I mean, I presume no defense lawyer tailors his... his guilt phase representation without a thought to what is going to happen at the penalty phase if they get to the penalty phase.  And so I... I have difficulty in saying that there should be some kind of a firewall for analytical purposes between guilt and penalty when... when we're in a... a question of Cronic or Strickland.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, they wouldn't end up having lower standards.  They... they would end up having a... a standard at the guilt phase which takes into consideration what the lawyer is or is not going to be able to do plausibly at... at the sentencing phase.  And you know, those... those may be very, very difficult questions, but it's hard for me to say that either the standard is different or that a lawyer should... or that we, in setting down standards, should pretend that a lawyer somehow has to go into a state of oblivion about... about what's going to happen at sentencing if he gets there.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  No, but I don't think you're getting to... at... at what bothers us.  Nobody is saying that the client should not make a decision.  The problem is that the client won't make a decision, and the client acts as if he had made the decision to allow the lawyer to do what the lawyer proposes.  This isn't a question of whether he should be heard or not, but what... what to make of the behavior.  And you're saying when... when the behavior appears to be acquiescence from silence, you nonetheless... the lawyer is, nonetheless, obligated to take the course which is coming closest to guaranteeing that he will receive the death penalty.  And that's what's bothering us.   David H. Souter  Why... why do we need a hearing rather than an examination of the record?  Tell me why.   David H. Souter  No.  We're talking about the trial court.   ",03-931X
1,"David H. Souter  Well--   David H. Souter  --Is... is the--   David H. Souter  --Is the reason... is there a further reason that they've got to... to plead loss causation?  And that is, by reading (e)(2), in effect, as... as making... as... as saying that if you were going to recover on a fraud-on-the-market theory, you in effect have... have got to prove your loss in a certain way.  And you're saying if you're going to... if you're going to sue on a fraud-on-the-market theory, you've got to allege all the elements of fraud on the market.  And if you allege all the elements of fraud on the market, you're going to allege exactly what you've just been saying is required.  So it's not so the... I... I guess what I'm... I'm getting at is maybe what... maybe the nub of the answer is not necessarily that there's... that there's fraud involved, but there is a fraud-on-the-market theory as the basis for the cause of action, and if that is the basis, it's got to be disclosed in the pleadings as an element.   David H. Souter  Do you... do you take the position that the phrase in (e)(2), if the plaintiff... I'm sorry.  Let me find it.   David H. Souter  No.  I'm trying to find a phrase in (e)(2).  If the plaintiff seeks to establish damages by reference to the market price of a security, do you take that phrase as... as referring to a fraud-on-the-market theory or as being broader than a fraud-on-the... on-the-market theory.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It certainly includes it.  There's no question about that.  Does--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --If... if it's not confined to fraud-on-the-market, then there's the argument on the other side that all... all (2) is really doing is saying that if you are going to establish your damages by reference to market price, this is the way you've got to do it.  You've got to go through this mean price analysis and so on.  But they are saying we are not simply trying to establish our damages by reference to the market, and therefore we're not bound by... and therefore, (e)(2), in effect, is... is irrelevant.  What... what is your answer--   David H. Souter  --To the... to the purchase price.   ",03-932X
0,"David H. Souter  Yes, but if you've got to show the inflation, then you don't have a complete cause of action the day after you buy the stock if there's no loss.  I mean, if you've got to show the... the drop following the inflation, you don't have the complete cause of action if there's no drop the day after you buy the stock.   David H. Souter  No, but I... I thought you were conceding that you... you, in fact, do not have a... a loss... forget what you can recover... that you don't have a loss until the inflation is followed by a drop.  And if there's no drop at the... at time of purchase plus 1 minute, then I don't see how there is even the element of a cause of action.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then you're talking about a cause of action without damages.   David H. Souter  If you have no damages, you have no cause... I mean, on normal tort theory, you have no cause of action.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.   David H. Souter  No, but what... it seems to me that what Judge Sneed's theory boils down to is this.  You cannot recover any loss except the loss that was caused by the fraud in question.  In theory, that limit is established by the inflation at the time you purchase.  So that is the limit of your recovery, but it does not follow from that that you have anything to recover for until you have your actual loss if you're pleading a... a fraud-on-the-market theory.  Isn't that fair to say?   David H. Souter  Okay.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But the... let's approach it a different way.  On a fraud-on-the-market theory, there are two facts I think that can be assumed.  Number one, there was no misrepresentation that was made peculiarly to you.  The misrepresentation was to the broad market and was reflected in the broad market price.   David H. Souter  Number two, you as a purchaser do not know about the fraud until the market finds out about the fraud.   David H. Souter  If that is the case, then I don't see that it makes any sense at all to talk about your having a cause of action the day after you purchase before the market has found out and before the fraud is known.  I mean, this... this strikes me as an exercise in... in an inconsistent theory.   David H. Souter  But aren't... aren't you... aren't you, in... in effect, equating two different things: one, a loss that you suffer which you say occurs immediately upon purchase of the inflated stock; and on the other hand, a limit on the loss that is attributable to the fraud?  Those are two different things.  I understand the limit on the loss.  I don't understand the... the suffering of the loss in fact.   INTERRUPTING ",03-932X
0,"David H. Souter  Yes, but they're doing it for a functional reason.  The functional reason is that if you put the poison in the adjacent wetland, it's going to get into the navigable water.  Exactly the same argument can be made as you go further and further up the tributaries, and it seems to me that once you concede, as I think you have to, that there can be a regulation that goes beyond literally navigable water at the point at which the... the pollutant is added, then you have to follow the same logic right up through the watershed to... to any point at which a pollutant, once added, will eventually get into the navigable water.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then... then you have to accept the fact that... that Congress cannot effectively regulate the navigable... the... the condition of the navigable water itself because if all the... the... let's... let's assume there's a class of... of evil polluters out there who just want to wreck the... the navigable waters of the United States.  All they have to do is get far enough upstream and they can dump anything they want to.  It will eventually get into the navigable water, and Congress can't do anything about it on your theory.   David H. Souter  So you're... you're going to... you... you then want to draw a distinction between the dredge and fill addition and, let's say, a... a conventional synthetic poison.   David H. Souter  You mean on... on... in every... in every case then, I mean, Congress would have to... I'm sorry... a scientist would have to analyze the molecules and... and trace them up, and so long as they could... could trace it to a specific discharge, they could get at it, but otherwise they couldn't?  I mean, that... you know, you know what I'm getting at.  That obviously would... would totally thwart the regulation.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but doesn't the reference to tributary make it relatively plain that what the Court was getting at was the impossibility of drawing a functional distinction between wetlands and tributaries on the one hand, navigable waters on the other, when the purpose of the regulation is to protect the purity of the ultimate navigable water?  And isn't the inclusion of the reference to tributaries an indication that it said if we want to attain the objective, which is clearly constitutional, then we have got to recognize these means, i.e., regulation of... of pollution in wetlands and tributaries, in order to reach that objective?  Isn't that the reasoning that is apparent from what Justice Ginsburg just... just read to you?   David H. Souter  Well, it's... except for the... it seems to me except for... for your... your argument is... is fine except for one problem.  And that is, if we... if we assume that Congress was being as... as cautious as you suggest, then Congress' caution, in effect, was... was allowing an end run around the regulation for the reasons we went into a moment ago.  All you've got to do is... is dump the pollutant further... far enough upstream in the watershed and you get away scot-free.  And it's very difficult to believe that Congress could have intended that.   David H. Souter  Well, do they have to make this on a plot-by-plot basis, or can they make a categorical judgment that even in cases in which, you know, there's a berm, as there is here, when the water is high, it spills over?  And if the categorical judgment is sound, do you have an exception because they haven't proven it with respect to your particular lot?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Where do you get that exception?   David H. Souter  And the... and the... but I mean, what I'm getting at is the traditional test is the basis for a categorical judgment.  Your land falls within the general category.  Your argument is I should not be subject to it, to the statute, because of the general category.  I should be subject to it only if they prove specifically that the water spills over in rainy periods in my particular lot.  In other words, you're saying there's got to be a specific connection as opposed to a categorical judgment.  And my question is what under the act supports that view.   David H. Souter  So... so your... maybe what you're saying is we have shown or the record shows that this doesn't fit within the category because it never spills over or whatever.  Is that your argument?   David H. Souter  Where are you reading from?   David H. Souter  Right.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Is the report in the... is the subsequent report in the record somewhere?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And again, where--   David H. Souter  --Where are you?   David H. Souter  And Justice Stevens' question I think in... in that framework is... is this.  If it will result in discharge after the project, is it a water of the United States now?   David H. Souter  Then... then Congress has passed a statute that says we'll lock the barn after the horse is stolen.  I mean, that... maybe that's what it did, but that's... that would be a very odd thing for it to do, wouldn't it?   David H. Souter  Well, it... it would do so in... in cases of... I guess, of the... the sorts of... of new proposed actions that require the... the Corps to get into it in the first place.  But I also assume that it would leave lots of... of water pollution regulation to the States.  I don't see that it would displace the States.   INTERRUPTING ",04-1034

Souter  Well, the practical effect is the same but in the moment before either in theory they commit the crime or in the moment before the trial is over or in the moment before the sentence comes down, there is one big difference in the two classes of cases.

In a case of discretionary sentencing range, within that range, he can not make that claim, he can not make that assumption, and the... that, it seems to me, is the point at which the jury trial right has got to focus.

INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay, and let me--   INTERRUPTING David H.

""   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It is, there's no question.  But we're still at the preliminary injunction stage.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why does the respondent bear the burden?  You have the burden--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --under the statute.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --no, but I realize that... could we pause on that for a second?  Because you apparently take the position... the Government takes the position that when... under the governing law, the Government would have an affirmative burden, ultimately, to defend... in this case, on compelling interest, least restrictive, et cetera... that, at the preliminary injunction stage, the applicant for the injunction has the burden to negate the probability that the Government will carry its burden on the ultimate issue.

Does the applicant for the injunction have the burden to negate the probability that the Government will prevail in its affirmative defense, ultimately?   INTERRUPTING David H.

0,"David H. Souter  Well, let's assume that the city instead of taking the property by eminent domain simply used its, its own... some of its own regular tax income to buy up the property, and assembled parcels of land with the purpose of selling them to an industrial developer to raise the tax base and hence ultimately to raise taxes.  Would you say just within the meaning of general understanding of proper governmental purposes that the city was acting in a way that had no legitimate public purpose?   David H. Souter  Well, I'm not interested in the label.  I'm just saying if the government says we need to increase the tax base because we have a depressed city, so we are going to take some of our tax money now, and we are just going to buy up property that people are willing to sell to us, and we are going to assemble parcels.  And when we get a big enough one, we are going to sell them to a developer for industrial purposes.  And that will, that will raise the tax base.  Is there anything illegitimate as a purpose for governmental spending in doing that?   David H. Souter  Why isn't there a public purpose here?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but we are talking about... I mean, I realize that, but I mean, I thought your point was that it was use of eminent domain power for an improper purpose.  And you characterize that purpose as conveying property to private owners.  Well, in my example, the same thing is going on except that it's not using the eminent domain power.  If the purpose in my example is a proper public purpose, why isn't it a proper public purpose when the government does it by eminent domain?  What changes about the purpose?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But if that is your answer then the slum clearance cases have got to go the other way.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  If that is your answer, then I suppose the slum clearance cases were wrongly decided.   David H. Souter  But you are saying we don't have to reexamine it, but I think your adoption of Justice Scalia's approach puts you in a difficult... I think you're moving in the direction of saying we really have got to overrule the prior cases.   David H. Souter  Just for the moment, what about my question?  And you can get into history, if you want to, and I tend to be interested in that, but my immediate concern is, if you give the answer that you have just given, doesn't it jeopardize the precedent of the slum clearance cases?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And this seems to be really essential for the purpose of developing industrial property to increase the tax base.  The argument is, and I don't know of any reason to doubt it, that doing it seriatim by voluntary acquisition and sale doesn't work.  So the rationale for this is essentially the rationale for the railroads, for the public utility line condemnations and so on.  There isn't another practical way to do it.  And there is a public benefit at the end, and that ought to qualify it as a public use.   David H. Souter  I take it there isn't, but maybe there is, there isn't any question in this case that the city was acting in good faith and did... and I presume still does... intend to convey it to developers who will, will actually proceed to develop a project.  Is there a question about that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yeah, in other words, I can understand perfectly well, why we would want to draw a distinction between the use of the eminent domain power that takes a parcel of property from private person A and simply then reconveys it to private person B without any particular object in mind except that the city likes B, you know, the mayor is a Democrat and B is a Democrat.  That kind of thing.  So I can understand the need for some distinction between that case and what we've got here.  The question is when you say there have to be minimum standards, I guess, is do we have a problem historically or in this case about the good faith of the taking so that we need the minimum standards to make sure that we are not getting into the first example?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Is there a reason in this case?  Is there some doubt here?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Let me ask you, I'm sorry, I'll make this a quick question.  Why do you think it is necessary, given your position, why do you think it's necessary to adopt the test you've just articulated as distinct simply from a good faith requirement.

And I understood your argument to be that given the safeguards such as judicial override, there simply was no... there was no need to read the health exception in, that in fact it was taken care of... any of the issues that might be raised in arguing for the need for health exception in fact were addressed by the statute.

Souter  --Okay, but even if you do that, you're still left, it seems to me, with the problem... whether you characterize the problem as discriminatory and antidiscriminatory university policy or not, you're still left with a speech problem that they raise, that, in effect, you are forcing them, in effect, to underwrite your speech, up to a point, and you are forcing them to change their own message.  You're forcing them into hypocrisy, in one alternative.  And those arguments don't depend upon the... sort of, the discriminatory character of what may be at stake.   INTERRUPTING David H.

Souter  No, but you're making a... if I understand what you're saying, you are making a kind of O'Brien argument that the... that the burden on speech, whatever it may be, is an incidental burden to something else.  Well, that... I think we have to draw this line between recruiting, on the one hand, which is what the military wants to do, and the Solomon Amendment, on the other hand.  As I understand it, the Solomon Amendment is directed, or is responsive, entirely to positions taken by law schools on, among other things, first amendment expressive grounds, so that if we are going to address the Solomon Amendment, I think we are addressing an exclusively first amendment speech expression issue.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I don't--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --know of any other reason for the Solomon Amendment.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But--   David H. Souter  --But they're... but the Solomon Amendment, in order to accomplish that, is addressed to a particular expressive problem which occurs for the military... and for the law schools, for that matter... in law school recruiting.  So, it seems to me that... for... I mean, my only point is that the Solomon Amendment seems to have one objective.  Whereas, the ""don't burn your draft card rule"", in O'Brien, had two... or had a... let's say, had a primarily nonspeech objective with an incidental speech burden.

I thought the distinction was that in determining the forum for recruiting, the university is speaking.  The university isn't creating a forum from a lot... for a lot of third parties; it's speaking, itself.

0,"David H. Souter  General, may... may I... I'd like to pose a question which at least gets to the nub of the issue, as I see it, and... and get your response to it.  The premise of my question is this.  We... we generally regard mitigation evidence as favoring life, aggravation evidence as favoring death.  We've got a case in which the... the assumption is that they are evenly balanced.  The... the pans of the scale are exactly even on that.  Kansas says in that case the jury shall return the verdict of death.  If we are going to demand, as we have said that we're going to demand, that the determination... that the death penalty determination would be one of what we have called reasoned moral judgment, then what has to be supplied in order to make the Kansas provision consistent with reasoned moral justice, it seems to me, is a presumption in favor of death.  Other things being equal, there is a presumption in favor of death.  And my question is, am I correct in saying that in order to hold your way, we have to hold that the Eighth Amendment... it is consistent with the Eighth Amendment to presume the appropriateness of death, other things being equal?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You... you agree that's... that's a proper way to look at the issue then.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then how do you get off the dime?   David H. Souter  Yes, but the... the direction, as I understand it, is that if mitigation and aggravation are even, then the only way to come to a conclusion is to say, as the statute does, because the mitigation does not outweigh the aggravation, you should return a verdict of death.  And that seems to me another way of saying there is a presumption that if aggravation and mitigation are equal, that the penalty should be death.   David H. Souter  The difficulty I have is in the phrase that you have mentioned in the course of your argument a couple of times referring to the ""reasoned moral response"".  And the difficulty I have in squaring ""reasoned moral response"" with the construction that the Kansas Court and we all agree is the proper construction of the... of the... of the equipoise kind of provision, is this.  Kansas has a right, as I understand it, to define what it regards as the aggravating circumstances, those that support a death verdict.  And Kansas has done so.  Kansas is also saying that if a jury cannot find that the aggravators, as we've defined them, outweigh the mitigators... i.e., if the jury is in equipoise... the result must be death, anyway.  And that does not seem to be a reasoned moral response.  I'm assuming that a reasoned moral response would be, the death penalty should be imposed because the aggravators do outweigh... i.e., it's not equipoise... the aggravators are heavier.  And because Kansas is saying,  ""Even though they're not, death is the result, anyway. ""  it doesn't seem like a reasoned moral response.  What is your answer to that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, that's the issue.   David H. Souter  But here we have, it seems to me, to be a stark finding that it has not been proven.  That is what ""equipoise"" means.  If aggravators are the basis for a death sentence, the equipoise finding is,  ""Aggravators don't predominate. ""  ""We cannot make that conclusion. ""  ""We're right on the fence. ""  And it seems to me that to call that a reasoned moral response...  ""We're on the fence, but execute anyway. ""  --seems a total inconsistency.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But it's a decision that says,  ""We don't know what should be done. ""  If aggravators define the basis for execution, and mitigators define the basis for life, the equipoise verdict says, in so many words,  ""We don't know which is more important. ""  And Kansas says, when the jury comes back and says, ""We don't know"", that the result should be death.  And that is what seems to me inconsistent with the notion of a reasoned moral response.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But that is not our case, is it?  Because our case is not,  ""We don't find that the mitigators outweigh. ""  Our case is,  ""We find the mitigators are of equal weight. ""  That's why you get to equipoise.  It's not a question of the failure of mitigators to predominate.   David H. Souter  It is the sufficiency of mitigators to equal in weight.  And that's what poses the problem, it seems to me.   David H. Souter  Of course it is not to predominate, but it is something more precise than merely not predominating.  It is a fact, in effect, that you don't know, if all you know is that they don't predominate.  The fact that you know, here, is that they equal, and--   David H. Souter  --That's right.  We don't... we don't know whether that was the case here or not.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  As I understand it, our question is, If a jury could return the death verdict in the equipoise situation, as the Kansas Supreme Court has defined it, is that... is that statute allowing for that possibility constitutional?  Isn't that--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --Yes.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Is that the law in Kansas?  I mean, I thought... correct me if I'm wrong, because I may have made a wrong assumption here... I thought the finding of guilt to an aggravated murder is the preface to a determination as to whether aggravators or mitigators predominate.  And, based upon that determination, there will be a decision as to whether the sentence should be death or life.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Right.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And, at that point, we don't have any way of knowing, I take it, whether the penalty should be life or death.   David H. Souter  Okay.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  But--   David H. Souter  --But--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --what I'm... what I'm... what I'm getting at is, I don't... I... as I understand the Kansas scheme, the determination of guilt, to aggravated murder, does not create a presumption in favor of the death penalty.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Right.  But the fact of... let me... I think we've got a terminological problem... the fact that there has been a finding of guilt of aggravated murder is not tantamount, as I understand it, to a finding that aggravating factors to be considered at the penalty phase have also been found.

1,"David H. Souter  No, but the... the Attorney General said that the... the fact that in this particular case the issue was focused on, in effect, sort of remedy, severance, and so on, was dependent upon the assumption about what Federal law required.

I don't see how we can divorce the judgment here with the earlier judgment, which Kansas... which the Kansas Supreme Court relied upon here, which was a Federal ground.   David H. Souter  It wouldn't have even raised the issue had it not been for the earlier Federal holding.  Isn't that correct?   David H. Souter  Well, do you... do you... I... I take it this is the implication of your position.  Do you take this position that in any instance in which a State supreme court decides a case on a Federal... decides an issue on a Federal ground in case A, and for whatever reason, case A is not brought to this Court for review, that in every subsequent case in the State system, which depends upon State A, the State is totally without the... or this Court is... is totally without jurisdiction to review it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  If you're... if you're right, I take it, we would not have jurisdiction to review a Federal ground that was raised by a State court, even though it had not been raised by the parties.  If they get... you know, they get the opinion from the court and there's a big surprise... the... the State court decided to go off on... on a Federal ground, which had not been pressed... I take it on your view we would not have jurisdiction to review that.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But regardless of the likelihood of that situation in any given case... and I happen to agree with Justice Scalia; I mean, I don't think the likelihood of that in a given case is great... we're, nonetheless, I think, faced with the fact that the Supreme Court of Kansas says, ""That can happen"".   David H. Souter  ""And if it does happen, the result is death. ""  And I think we've--   David H. Souter  --we've got to take that as a given.  I mean--   David H.

Does Congress have to make it, on a State-by-State basis, or may that record be made in the course of a trial in a particular State as a predicate for subjecting that State to liability in this instance?

1,"David H. Souter  No.  But with respect, I... isn't the... the term that they use... and I was going to ask essentially the same question.  The term that the court uses is raise a reasonable inference of his innocence.  And I will... I will grant you this.  When I read that, it said... I thought to myself it sounds as though they are saying he must present evidence or make a showing, a preliminary showing, that it is more probable than not that he is innocent despite the State's evidence.  But they never spell that out, and is it spelled out anywhere?   David H. Souter  What if the... what if the court says, we will weigh it to the extent of determining whether, in light of the State's case, the proffered evidence, if accepted, would pass the laugh test?  That's weighing.  Is... is that... is that legitimate?   David H. Souter  But that does go... somehow that goes beyond mere relevance.  You can't say that the... I don't think you can say that the existence of the million dollars in life insurance is irrelevant.  It's just that it doesn't prove much unless it can be combined with certain other kinds of evidence.  And when you say you've got a standard that looks into that, then you have crossed the line from mere relevance to probative force, haven't you?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  I... I grant you that.  But to say that the only test is relevance seems to be too strong.   David H. Souter  Mr. Zelenka, do you... do you agree with the characterization that your brother has given, largely by way of quotation from the opinion in this case, that the rule of admissibility that... that the... that the court followed in... or that the supreme court approved in this case would have required the defendant to show to a degree of probability, in light of all the evidence, including the forensic evidence, that he was innocent as a condition of... of admitting the evidence?     No, I do not.  I think it was merely an application of the original opinion that relied upon the straight... State v. Gregory, that in fact it must raise a reasonable inference as to the defendant's innocence.   David H. Souter  But, well, what do you... I mean, your... your brother's strongest point is this statement, and I'm quoting from page 365 of the joint appendix where the... where the opinion is set out, at... at the top of the page, the second sentence.  He simply cannot overcome the forensic evidence against him to raise a reasonable inference of his own innocence.  What could that mean other than a probability that he is innocent in light of all the evidence, including the forensic evidence?     I think that... that language was basically a review determination as to what exactly happened.  I don't think that the court--   David H. Souter  Yes, but what does it mean?  I mean, I've given you a suggestion as to what it seems to mean on a straightforward reading, and... and I take it you disagree with that.  But can you explain how it could mean something else?     --No, I don't disagree with the fact that, in fact, that is what the supreme court said in its analysis, looking at the particular evidence in this case, that he was unable to overcome that.  But I think State v. Gregory didn't require that to be the ultimate threshold that it had to meet, rather that it raise a reasonable inference as to his innocence.   David H. Souter  Well, it's... it's true.  When they... on the... on the previous page, the bottom of 364, they... they cite... they first quote Gregory and then they cite Gay and they characterize, I guess, the two together as... well, they say, in Gay, we held that where there is strong evidence of an appellant's guilt, especially where there is strong forensic evidence, the proffered evidence about a third party's guilt does not raise a reasonable inference as to the appellant's own innocence.  It doesn't use the word overcome which it uses on the other page.     No, it doesn't.   David H. Souter  But even without the word overcome, what... what can reasonable inference of innocence mean, considered in light of the other evidence in the case, if it doesn't mean something like a probability of... of innocence?     It's raising a possibility.  I don't know what level of possibility it is other than a reasonable inference level, which is a level which... which means that it's subject to some belief.   David H. Souter  Well, the trial judge also kept it out, didn't he, because he believed there was... there was no penal interest exception to the hearsay rule?     He was... he... he did that also, but ultimately he blended both concepts together and said both as a matter of substantive law and as a matter of evidentiary law in the... the final conclusion at the end of the State's case, when he made the ultimate determination--   David H. Souter  But... but then you get to the--     --that it would be inadmissible.   David H. Souter  --I'm sorry.  Then you get to the... the South Carolina Supreme Court, and they don't keep it out on... on grounds of... of threshold reliability.     They didn't specifically address that.  They went to their ultimate determination viewing the evidence.   ",04-1327
0,"David H. Souter  Okay.  And I... I take it what you will do, in the course of your second point, is tell us the answer to this question, that if we do not accept the overcome by reasonable inference formulation that is here, what would be an acceptable formulation because I think that's what you... you say you're getting to.  But that would be very helpful to us.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, one of the problems is I don't know what it requires.  On... on the... on the second page of the opinion that I quoted, it is used with the word overcome, which certainly suggests that it is supposed to raise a probability of innocence in light of all the evidence.  Sometimes it is used without overcome, as it was earlier in the opinion.  I don't know what they mean by inference.  Do they mean evidence from which one might reasonably conclude, from which one... there is a reasonable possibility of concluding?  I just don't know what the terms mean.  So I hope you'll give us a suggested formulation with... with terms that... that are defined that... that you and the States that you represent would... would think was an acceptable and constitutional standard.

What is... is your kind of short answer to the... to the argument, which I think Justice Ginsburg was getting to, that if it is, in fact, worth litigating in an antitrust case, that is a pretty good... darned good reason to assume that there is market power and that it is, of course, having a discriminatory price effect?  What's the short answer to that?   David H. Souter  I was going to say I--   INTERRUPTING David H.

I guess one argument is if... if we reaffirm the rule that you're challenging, it will invite more lawsuits.  They'll say, boy, the Supreme Court really means it with this presumption now.  Has that, in fact, been the case that the presumption, at least as it has been understood up to this point, has driven lawsuits and, in fact, has driven lawsuits that ultimately were unsuccessful even though the market power point was, of course, satisfied?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but this is... this is basically a practical question, and I... I'm trying to get a...

0,"David H. Souter  And you... you concede that there was error in execution here?  You concede that there was a violation because... technically because there was no knock?   David H. Souter  Why do you concede that?  You've got a case in which, as I understand it, not only was the evidence but the warrant itself an indication not only that drugs were present, but that guns were present.  It's perfectly true we don't have a general rule that anytime you do a drug search, you can do a no knock, but in this case you had specific evidence that there were firearms there.  And based on what I've seen in the case, I don't know why Michigan did not argue that, in fact, it was justified to go in without knocking.  And I'll be candid to say you... to tell you that the fact that Michigan does not make that argument suggests to me that Michigan is trying to structure a case in which it's going to have the best shot to... to get the exclusionary rule out of the way here.  Why don't you claim that the search was lawful?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, Richards precluded a general rule, but it didn't preclude you from arguing in a specific case, and it's the fact that the prosecutor and, hence, all the way up the line to you do not argue that is... is what I don't understand.   David H. Souter  I don't think we have to revisit Richards.  I... I think what... what I'm... what I'm concerned is that you don't make an argument based on the evidence in this case that you had probable cause to believe that there were going to be guns facing you when... when you went in the door and therefore the knock was not required.   David H. Souter  Well, are you suggesting... did... did the warrant... I don't know this.  I should but I don't.  Did the warrant authorize seizure of guns as well as--   David H. Souter  --drugs?  Well, are you suggesting that the... the gun portion of the authorization was, in fact, invalid?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  If... so... in any case, at... at the moment that you got the warrant, you... you had, in fact, a... a finding by a trial court, or a... whoever the issuing magistrate was, that there was probable cause to believe that you were going to confront guns as well as drugs inside.  And... and Richards does not seem to me to be a good reason, under those circumstances, to concede that you didn't have a basis for... for dispensing with the knock.   David H. Souter  There was specific knowledge here.   David H. Souter  Well, you got a... you got a warrant--   David H. Souter  --that said look for them.  That's about as specific as you can get.   David H. Souter  Well, you can't have it both ways.   David H. Souter  Do you... do you dispute... your... your brother on the other side said in his argument that he had not heard a dispute about this.  But do you dispute his claim that there has never been any... at least in recent history, any... any civil judgment actually rendered against anyone in the officer's position?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But we don't... we don't have any indication that there's an effective deterrence then in civil suits.  Maybe there will be some day, but we haven't seen it yet in Michigan, I take it.   David H. Souter  And it may mean that... that potential plaintiffs say if the courts are winking at this in the criminal case, we don't have much chance of getting a... a verdict in a civil case.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  We don't know, but that might be the case too, mightn't it?   David H. Souter  Isn't... isn't the problem that in... in fact, it's the product of both?  The warrant alone does not get the police officer into... into the building.  It... it is in fact the entry that gets the police officer into the building, the execution of the warrant.  The judge has to do something.  The police officer has to do something.  And the question that I think we face when we say is the later search the product of the entry, is... is what your... what... I think a point that... that counsel on the other side was making.  It's a pragmatic point.  Where do we draw the line of causation?  And his answer is... and I think the... the answer of the cases that Justice Breyer was... was referring to... is this.  We draw it in a way that will allow us to deter illegal police conduct, and if we engage in this slicing process of causation that you talk about, there will be no deterrent for the violation of the no knock rule.  If instead we say, yes, this is enough the product that we ought to deter... that we ought to... to respond to it in a way that will deter the no knock and therefore we find causation and we get deterrence.  What is fallacious about that argument?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  We do that every single time we exclude a piece of evidence in every suppression case, don't we?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Don't... don't we?   David H. Souter  Well, what... what do you say to Justice Breyer's argument that we haven't previously analyzed suppression by tracing or trying to trace the causal connection between a particular piece of evidence and a particular reason for the rule that was broken?  What we have said in the past is if the rule or the standard is violated and the search is therefore unreasonable, the evidence doesn't come in.  You're proposing a... a different causal analysis.  You're proposing a causal analysis that requires the connection between a piece of evidence and the particular reason for one of these standards in every case in which suppression is... is requested.  Number one, do you agree that that... that would be a departure, as Justice Breyer suggested?  And number two, what would be the justification for that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, it does relate to the privacy interests, and we've seen the explanation.  One of the reasons for requiring the knock is that there is enough respect for a person's home, a person's privacy to say the police should not barge in like an invading army.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That is a respect for privacy.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And that is involved... and that is... that is the whole point of... of knock and announce, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  We're talking about the privacy of individual in his home, and the reasonableness of the search depends upon the reasonableness of invading the individual's privacy in his home.  Is that not the general rule?   David H. Souter  Then there will never be a suppression of... of evidence specified in a warrant when the warrant's no knock component is violated--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --because we... we will say... in every single time, following your argument, you will... we will say the... the violation had nothing to do with the authorization to seize the evidence.  The violation simply had to do with the... with the... the niceties and the risks involved in entering.  So if we accept your argument, no knock is... is a dead duck, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but apparently you're saying we would not suppress because as long as the warrant specified the items to be seized and they didn't go beyond that, there was no causal connection between the fact that they broke in and disturbed people in the night, when they were not authorized to, and their ultimate obtaining of... of the evidence.  Once again, it seems to me if we follow your... your reasoning, then the distinction between the nighttime and the daytime warrant is a dead letter.   David H. Souter  The Constitution requires--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --The Constitution requires a reasonable search.  It is hornbook law that violating no knock, violating nighttime searches when only a daytime search is authorized amounts to an unreasonable search.  You're saying that's utterly irrelevant because there's no causal connection between that violation and the seizure of the particular items that the warrant... the warrant specified.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, isn't it--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --the product, here?  I mean, if they had not... if they had not entered, they would not have gotten their evidence.  Their entry, because it violated knock and announce, was unlawful.  So, it is a product, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, an entry that conformed with knock and announce would have been lawful.  This entry didn't.  This entry was unreasonable.  So, I don't see how your argument fits the facts.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, but--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --I mean, how do you make that distinction?  I mean, it's like the... you know, the Cheshire cat and a... and the smile; you can't distinguish the two.  There was one entry, and that entry violated the knock and announce rule.   David H. Souter  So, basically, your argument rests on the fact that we can draw a distinction between entry and manner of entry.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What do you say the purpose of knock and announce is?   David H. Souter  So, I take it your argument is that, except in cases in which the people inside the house are not dressed, or cases in which there is, in fact, a gun battle of some sort, that a knock and announce violation will, in fact, never be the cause of any damage at all.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, no, it... no, but it'll never be the cause of any compensable damage at all.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Because I take it your argument is what you can recover from requires causation.  And what I mean by ""causation"" is the causation of the harms which the rule is intended to avoid.   David H. Souter  And if the only harms that the rule is intended to avoid is the exposure of nakedness and violence, once inside, and there are cases without nakedness or without violence, then, in those cases, there will never be a recovery.   David H. Souter  But, basically, your rule is, the police are entitled to take the chance.  If they... if they get inside, and people have got their clothes on and there's no gun battle, no problem; nothing that the police are exposed to, either by an exclusionary rule or by a civil recovery.  And if they want to take that chance, if they want to take the chance that somebody will not be dressed or a gun will be pulled, basically that's their option.   David H. Souter  What was the--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.   David H. Souter  I was going to say, What was... what were the grounds upon which the warrant, in Segura, was obtained?   David H. Souter  So, it didn't... it didn't depend on the entry or anything gained as a result of the entry, right?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Right, but the--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --but the--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --Right, but the warrant--   David H. Souter  --the warrant... the warrant itself didn't depend on anything they had gained as a result of the entry.  There was no--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --kind of causal--   David H. Souter  --continuum there.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Isn't--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --Isn't that the difference, though, with this case?  Because, here, there is a causal continuum, at least, as Justice Breyer said, a but for causal continuum.  They wouldn't have been in the apartment but for the entry.  And so, the authority of the warrant and the manner of executing the warrant are not divisible the way they were in Segura.   David H. Souter  But, in Segura, the court issuing the subsequent warrant says,  ""You can... you can go in there and do this. ""  The court... by the way, I... maybe this makes it even easier... did the court, in Secuga, know that they were in the apartment?   David H. Souter  Okay.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But what--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --Wait a minute.  What is this incentive inherent in the circumstances?   David H. Souter  Well, it doesn't seem to work.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I mean, you've got... this is a case in which the officer testifies,  ""It never works, I always go in. ""   David H. Souter  When is it going--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --I mean, what reason do we have to believe that this incentive inherent in circumstances is ever going to work in the absence of an exclusionary rule?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why don't they--   David H. Souter  --Why don't they have something to gain?  If they're right that there is evidence inside, they gain.  They're... I mean, they're perfectly rational--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --in this.  They gain a greater chance of getting that evidence than if they let a few seconds elapse and the evidence can be flushed away.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  For--   INTERRUPTING David H.

Everybody knows that if you own real estate, you've got to pay real estate taxes on it.  You're going to have a hard time doing that if they don't know where to send the bill, and so on.

Then... then it has no significance ever because the... the State has an obligation to use the best address it has, whether he's got an obligation to... to keep the address updated or not.  And... and this is the... the tough point for me with your case.  It seems to me that your case depends on our saying the obligation to keep the... the address current has absolutely no significance.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But I take it in... in this case... I mean, I... you're probably right that it would have... it would have worked here, but I... I take it that in the absence of that... that hindsight, you would say that in... in the regular case that simply posting notice on the house, after the letter is returned, would not be enough, that the... that the posting on the house would be sufficient only if they had exhausted other efforts to get a better address so that in this case, going back to Justice Breyer's example, they... they'd have to follow up whatever it is, the 18 G.

David H. Souter  So in practice the answer is no?   David H.

David H. Souter  And our questions are what is the standard for determining the constitutional violation.  Once we get that squared away, then we'll get to Harlow.   David H. Souter  Well, they did, but wouldn't you have to prove under your standard not that they would have procured or tried to procure it anyway, but that in fact the prosecutor would have prosecuted anyway?  In other words, that's the distinction between the... the normal case and... and the case that we're dealing with here--   INTERRUPTING David H.

Wouldn't... wouldn't the... the... when the burden shifts, wouldn't the obligation be on... on the point of substance, as opposed to the point of... of screening, not to show that the... that the prosecutor would have brought the prosecution anyway, but to show that the investigator would have acted to procure that prosecution anyway?

Souter  But it's not going back on the expenditure limit.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I mean, the problem, I mean, I was getting at and Justice Ginsburg is getting at, Judge Winter got at it.  The... the problem is... is the... the total limitation on an election cycle, including the primary, when the primary involves a challenge so that the challenger has an uphill fight presumably to start with in the primary.  And if he's going to maintain an effective uphill fight in the primary and he's lucky enough to win, he's going to get to the general election and he's going to be broke.  That's...

And the only thing that was attributed to the sponsor was that the presumption should be regarded as rebuttable.  The... the footnote in the statement did not indicate that the presumption was a disappearing presumption, once the other side went forward with any evidence.

David H. Souter  Well, let me... let me stop you there because this is something I didn't understand in the brief.  You speak of the Texas probate court determining the validity of an estate plan.   David H. Souter  I take it the Texas probate court determined the validity of a will here.   David H. Souter  It determined the validity of... of a pourover trust.  Is that correct?   David H. Souter  All right.   David H. Souter  All right.

Is that what the Texas court does, or does the Texas court say, the will is good, the trust is good?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  In other words, is it preclusive of everything else?

Of course, it protects the succession process, but it does not follow that everything that implicates a succession process falls within the probate exception.   INTERRUPTING David H.

1,"David H. Souter  Mr. Bopp, right... right there I guess I... I have a problem with... with your argument, and I just want to get it out.  I went back and looked at some of the examples that were given at... in... in the McConnell case for parallels between what we... what we thought was covered in those cases and... and yours... your case.  And the... the one which I... I guess was probably the closest was the... was the advertisements there in... in the McConnell case on the... the lobbying on the Chinese trade relations.  The basic message in... in that case was China uses forced labor.  The Congress of the United States is about to make it easier for... for Chinese goods to get in here and for China to have a respectable trade status.  And... and it said, call Congressman Myrick, I think it was, in any case, a Member of Congress, and... and say what you think.  In this case, you're... you're talking about a... a filibuster, and you say, you know, they're filibustering nominees and they're not coming up to... to a vote.  Tell the two Senators in this State, Kohl and Feingold, that... that you don't like this.  The only difference that I could see basically between the two kinds of ads was that in the first one... in... in the Myrick ad, they actually gave the number of the... of the congressional office to call and say, hey, don't do this.  In this case, your clients did not give a... a number.  They gave a Web site to an organization.  Insofar as I know, it doesn't have a number.  Which gets me to the question.  If the... the Chinese trade relations ad was presumably validly subject to the act, I don't see why your client's ad is not, for the same reason, subject to the act and for the further reason that it doesn't even give a phone number to call... to... to lobby people.  So it seems to me that on stare decisis grounds, unless we're going to go back and simply reexamine McConnell to... to... from... from scratch, that your clients fall within the general rule as... as we held it in McConnell.  So why doesn't precedent foreclose this?   David H. Souter  Yes, but you didn't even give their phone numbers.   David H. Souter  Okay.  So if we accept that extra step, that's... that gets you... if... if we accept the extra step that gets you parallel to the... to the ad that we considered in McConnell.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But if you are right--   David H. Souter  --Then why didn't we have to go the other way in the Chinese trade relation example?  I mean, everything--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --unless I'm missing something in your argument, everything you are saying in this argument could have been said with respect to that ad and, as Justice Breyer said, to a couple of others.   David H. Souter  Yes.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And... and we... we cited some other examples as... as examples that, on the face of it and on the face of the record, would... would lawfully fall within the... the general rule that we said Congress could prescribe.   David H. Souter  No, but the point--   David H. Souter  --But I... I don't want to cut you off from your Yellowtail argument, if... if you want to make it, but it seems to me that the problem in this case is that your ad is very much like a nonYellowtail ad.  And the problem that we would have in accepting your argument is, number one, a problem of precedent and, number two, the problem that Justice Breyer raised that, again, we had dealt with in the prior case.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, no.  Let me just finish my question.   David H. Souter  Once you get out of the sphere of... of kind of sham ads that just hit you in your face, there isn't a practical way to tell the difference.  There isn't a kind of magic formula.  We rejected the magic word, or Congress rejected the magic word's approach.  And therefore, Congress came up with a rule that it did within certain time limits, identified candidates, identified audiences.  You can't do it within this period of time unless you do it through a PAC.  What is different in your case from those paradigm examples in... in McConnell?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But Yellowtail--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --is... is an ad of... an obviously sham ad.  The problem that we're dealing with--   David H. Souter  --May... may I finish?   David H. Souter  Excuse me.  May I... may I finish my question?   David H. Souter  May I finish my question?  The... the... no one is saying that your ad in this case is an obviously sham ad like Yellowtail.  Your ad in this case is one of those ads that it's difficult to deal with fairly.  You can say, well, you know, it's an electioneering ad and you can say it's... it's a lobbying ad.  And... and Congress decided how to deal with them.  We said that's okay.  Why doesn't--   David H. Souter  --Yes, but why doesn't your ad fall within the reasoning that we used in approving... on the facial challenge, in approving the statute?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No... no question about it.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But your... your as applied--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --challenge has got to have something different about it, something unusual that says this is why my ad does not fall within the general rule.  And that's what I'm trying to get at.

INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But... but isn't... I thought your premise was that because the statute doesn't authorize any payment, that is a way of stopping it.   David H.

Because in the more difficult case where it's not $5 an apartment, but a case like this in which the justification is ultimately a justification in gasoline prices and so on, the... the inquiry is going to be much more complex.  Penn Central is a way of approaching that complexity.  Why do we bother with this threshold test which produces a bizarre result in one case and is going to be very difficult to apply in another case, in which event I don't see the reason for having it as distinct from the Penn Central difficulty test.

I'm not saying that should be the test for whether the government should do it at all.  But isn't that kind of the sensible tendency of the test, to suggest that the government shouldn't even be doing it?   David H. Souter  No.  The... I mean, it seems to me that the... the whole point of the argument you're making is it won't hurt me, the landowner, quite so much, but if it doesn't make sense at all, why should we even have to get to that question?

Do we... do we have any... do you have any experience that you can rely on either to show that in fact these subsection (h) claims are brought customarily with the main qui tam action or, conversely, that they are brought separately?  Do we know what's going on?   David H. Souter  Well, he's already alerted to the extent that he's taking retaliatory action as true.  He may not whole... know the... the whole extent of... of what the employee knows, but he's already been tipped off.     Well, as a practical matter, oftentimes the employer fires the employee as soon as the employer has a sense that the employee is on to something.  He doesn't have a full knowledge of what the employee knows and certainly doesn't know that the employee might have told the Government and that the Government is investigating.  And that's the purpose of the under seal requirement of the False Claims Act, to allow the Government to conduct a full investigation of the claim, talk to other employees about what was going on.  Sometimes the employee really has identified fraud, but may only have identified a portion of the larger scheme of fraud that's going on.  And the Government gets to investigate that while the claim is under seal.  But in the course of discovery in any wrongful termination suit or retaliation suit, all of that information would become available to the employer.

They don't have time to be thinking about novel legal theories, which we would dream up perhaps if we could get to Legal Times and these periodicals?  So it's... it's not an alternative.   David H. Souter  So you're... you're saying there... there's a separate value here, and that is the value of access to courts.  And... and that limits what can be done for purposes of behavior modification.   David H. Souter  All right.  What about the marriage example?  The... the Court has said, yes, you couldn't... the... the State can't prevent the inmate from... from getting married.  I don't see where the separate source of... of value is that would... that... that would affect that analysis.  No right of access to court.  The associational rights can be abridged and so on.  Why, on your analysis, wouldn't... wouldn't the proper disposition of the earlier case have been to say, yes, the State can preclude marriage too because that's something they very much want and... and the State can preclude that unless they shape up and... and get down to a... a lesser level of security?   David H. Souter  So you're saying there just is not a logical connection there within--   David H. Souter  --the meaning of the... of the case?   David H. Souter  But there would be a logical connection for those who want to get married.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You're... you're saying it might not makes sense as a systemic policy--   David H. Souter  --because it isn't a big enough problem.  But for... we're not talking about a whole system here.  We're talking about 40 people or less, and if some of those 40 people want to get married, why doesn't it make perfect sense to say no marriage?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You can, and on... on your analysis, why isn't that sufficient?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay, but how do we get around the marriage case then?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So as to these, the... the marriage could be banned, in effect, you're saying.   David H. Souter  But don't we... don't we have the same problem if we're... if we're dealing with First Amendment interests that we do when we're dealing with Eighth Amendment interests?  In other words, if... if we don't say, well, they get outside of Turner analysis because they require... by virtue of being enumerated rights, they require an analysis specific to them, is the abridgement of the right carried so far that it is unreasonable?  If we don't say that, then I don't see, as your friends on the other side have argued, I don't see where the logical stopping point is if we accept the... the behavior modification theory.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Oh, oh, I... I realize that.  I mean, they're... they're making an in extremis kind of argument.  I understand that.  But if... if we accept an in extremis kind of argument on the theory of behavior modification, then I don't see why that argument does not, for example, cover the marriage case, and maybe... maybe it should.  I don't know why that argument would not allow for a total deprivation of all communication outside of, let's say, access to counsel.  And... and so it seems to me that whether we admit it or not, what's going on here, whether we call it Turner analysis or not, is we're making some kind of a judgment as to whether they're carrying the deprivation for behavior modification purposes in these extreme cases too far.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And if that's what... I'll... I'll be quiet in a second.  [Laughter]  If that's... if that's what we're doing, aren't we just as much outside the Turner analysis when we're talking about the First Amendment or associational rights under the First Amendment as we are when we're talking about the Eighth Amendment?  And shouldn't we say so?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So... so but at some point, there's sort of a reasonableness limit then you're saying.   INTERRUPTING ",04-1739

It seems to me that your point to the Chief Justice was the courts have to review the efficacy of these moves.   David H. Souter  And if... if there is no efficacy and there is an infringement of what, at least for people on the outside, would be a protected right, then they have no justification for taking those rights away.  And if that's going to be the analysis, then on... on the argument you just gave, they've got to give the TV rights back, they've got to give the magazine rights back, and so on.  Isn't that correct?   David H. Souter  I sure would like that, but--  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But then why?  Why?   David H. Souter  Right.  And in... in your argument, in your answer to the Chief Justice, you were pointing out a situation in which taking away the TV didn't work, taking away the magazines didn't work.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why then do they not, on your theory, have to give TV and magazines back?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  All right.  Then where does your efficacy criterion go?  You're saying they may make judgments, and apparently they may... may make judgments and maintain them even if those judgments do not, in fact, advance their interests.  Here, you're saying they... it's not going to advance their interests, so they can't do it.  In these cases, you're saying they don't advance their interests, but they can as a matter of judgment.  And I don't know how to draw that line.   David H. Souter  I... may I interrupt you--   David H. Souter  --with this question?  Aren't you really saying that when the deprivations get beyond some point, some serious point, the issue is not properly analyzed under Turner and Safley, can they do one thing more?  The issue really becomes one of cruel and unusual punishment.  Is the totality that they have taken away so great that it is cruel to maintain these people under these circumstances?  Is that the argument you're really making?   David H. Souter  Oh, I know that wasn't... that wasn't the claim that you made, but isn't that the argument that you're making?   INTERRUPTING ",04-1739

Souter  And the reason for a distinction, at least at the present time... the reason for the reasonableness of the distinction at the present time, as a source of applying this definition, is history, basically.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But the...

I will grant you that there are moments in the... in the Ninth Circuit opinion in which there seems to be a shift back and forth in the rhetoric between claim preclusion and issue preclusion.

It held that your claim failed because of the effect of issue preclusion on elements that were common, factual elements common to both the claim in the State court and the claim that you sought to bring in the Federal court.  Am... am I correct about that, about what the Ninth Circuit held?   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  So, in effect, then maybe... are you saying this, that there is no issue preclusion here because the... the ruling that there was no statement of a cause of action was, in fact, a disposition of the claim without there being any resolution of any fact issue upon which the claim might depend.

I just want to know how... how the... the systems work together.  Let's assume that, in fact, a... a Lucas kind of claim had been involved, and the... the State courts said we understand Lucas.  We're applying Lucas.  And in point of fact, following the Lucas standard, there are plenty of uses that are still left on this land, so that there's no taking under... under Lucas.  And let's assume that they... they go through the State system.  They lose.  They don't petition here for cert. Instead, they go into the... the district court with a Fifth Amendment claim.  Is it open to them in the district court to make this argument?  Don't apply issue preclusion to our Lucas claim.  The Lucas... to... to the... to the determinations, the reasonable use determination in... in Lucas.  Don't do it because although the State court purported to be applying Lucas, it really was not.  It was not following the Lucas standard.  It was applying something much more favorable to the State.  And therefore, any determination on that issue should not get preclusion here.  We ought to be able to litigate de novo even though, on the face of it, we seemed to have litigated the Lucas issue and the State court decided it.  Could they make that argument?  And... and if it were sound, would... would preclusion principles give way?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I guess in the--   David H. Souter  --Decided but not litigated.

I mean, if you had an instruction that depended upon the word ""subvert"", I could... I could understand your argument.  But it seems to me that the difficulty with your argument, and the difficulty with your answer to Justice Breyer, is that it went beyond ""subvert"" to merely ""impede"", and it included an instruction that good faith was no defense.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I don't see why it doesn't.  I mean, there's no grammatical break.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, it's certainly--   David H. Souter  --I mean, I will...

Your answer consistently is, Did he know that questioning would stop?  And those are two different issues.  One is understanding Miranda warnings.  One is voluntarily initiating a further conversation with the police.  So, I don't see it... let's assume he perfectly understood the Miranda warnings.  But if the initiation was not a voluntary initiation, or an initiation at all, it seems to me you lose.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Do you take--   David H.

INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Let me just ask you to look at the other side of the equation.  However we assess the burden, we're assessing it in relation to the State's interest.  What is your best statement of the State's interest here that you think is defensible?   Gene C. Schaerr  Well, I think... I think the State's interest is what the district court found it to be, and I think the... the district court actually found two interests, not just one.  It found an interest in avoiding poaching and an interest in promoting party loyalty along the lines that Justice Scalia mentioned earlier.   David H. Souter  Do... do you think the... the poaching argument stands up on any... any empirical basis?   Gene C. Schaerr  I do.  And in fact, the... the district court at... at page 49--   David H. Souter  May... let me just add quickly.  I... I realize, of course, there's going to be some movement of voters, but do we have any idea whether the voters who are moving are the ones who would otherwise have stayed at home anyway and done nothing, merely nominal Republicans as opposed to active Republicans?   Gene C. Schaerr  --Yes.  We... we do have an answer to that.  That is implicit, first of all, in the district court's finding that poaching would, in fact, made... make a difference in the... in the outcomes of the elections.  He... he made that finding very clearly on... on page 49--   David H. Souter  Well, he found that the numbers are such that they could, but did he find... and I'm not sure of this.  Did he find that the actual people who migrated would otherwise have voted differently so that in fact it made a difference?   Gene C. Schaerr  --That is implicit in his finding.  He said the institution... this is again on page 49.  The institution of a party-option open primary format in Oklahoma, as sought by the plaintiffs, would likely affect the outcome of some primary elections.

1,"David H. Souter  Well, isn't there something different here?  Because in... in Holmes, the... the party that was claiming the... sort of the ultimate damage was damaged because other people up the line were damaged, the... the shareholders and then the broker dealers and so on.  There was a kind of a direct line of... of causation.  But the people who were claiming were at the tail end of it.  Here, the causation between the... or the... or the cause of the harm to... to the clients on... on the other side was... was direct.  It was direct competition harm.  So we are in a different situation from Holmes.  In other words, they... they weren't... the... the plaintiffs in this case were not injured simply because New York lost some money.  They were injured in... in their own right by... by the competition between them and your client.   David H. Souter  Sure, but they suffered the harm because the firm suffered the harm.

Let's assume that the... that the defendant engages in extortion against A and makes a lot of money doing it.  As a result of that, in... in dealing with B, the defendant, in fact, can... can offer... offer goods for sale to B's customers at a lower price simply because he's getting all this income from the extortion.

We're talking here about two different lines of causation?  And each of them, to some degree, contributes to the ultimate result which you claim, which is a loss of business and... and business harm.  One line of causation is... is competitive.  It's price competition.  They charge less.  They lure the customers away.  The other line of competition is fraud on the State of New York which makes it easier for them to engage in price competition.  So far as the fraud on the State of New York is concerned, its effect on your client's business is indirect.  In other words, they can defraud New York without hurting your client.  They might simply have pocketed all they money they saved, but the... the only way that the fraud on New York hurts your client is that it puts them in a better position to engage in the second line of causation that hurts your client and that is direct price competition.  If you accept the fact that there are two different lines of causation here, don't we have to say, under the Holmes direct analysis, that so far as the fraud on New York, which is the RICO violation, the consequence is an indirect one, the consequence to your client, but so far as the price competition is concerned, the consequence is a direct one, but price competition isn't a RICO violation, which leaves us saying, so far as the RICO violation is concerned, it's indirect?

I guess the point that I'm trying to get at... and it goes back to your original public interest issue... is, let's assume... as Justice Scalia's hypo had it, let's assume that the statement made by the employee on the subject within job duties... case like this one... is, in fact, a ""stupid statement"".  Let's assume it's wrong, it's inaccurate, whatnot.  The issue is not whether an employer, it seems to me, should, if that turns out to be the case, be able to fire.  The issue, it seems to me, is whether, if it is not stupid, it should be totally unprotected, so that the employer could do anything, even if it's an accurate statement.  And my understanding is that your argument on public interest was an argument that says, even if it's accurate and they were lying and so on, that there should be no protection.

If, in this case, he gets past step one because of the Mexican Bar Association speech, and if, as you suggested in answer to a question a little while ago, that anybody could go public and get at least past step one of Pickering, what is to be gained by the extremely... well, strike the ""extremely""... what is to be gained by the restrictive view that you take that if he doesn't go to the Bar Association, or doesn't go public, there's no protection at all?  In other words, it seems to me that the public is being protected in a way subject to an immediate end run.   David H. Souter  But what if he simply goes to the public and says,  ""Look, there's Brady material here, and it should be turned over, and, instead, my boss is telling me to suppress it. ""  That wouldn't be turning over his work product.  And I took it, from what you said earlier, that, in that case, you would say at least he gets pasts step one of Pickering for the--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --newspapers--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --Oh, he might... he might ultimately lose, just the way, on all issues but one, the employee in Connick lost.  That's quite true.  But at least--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --there would be a claim to go through the balancing--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --exercise.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Oh, I understand your point.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You're not saying he would win on Pickering balancing, but he would at least get to the point of going through the balancing exercise.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Maybe.   David H. Souter  Yes.   David H. Souter  No, you take the position, then, that... going to the earlier hypothetical that somebody brought up, that, say, in a Brady case, if the... if the Federal prosecutor believes there was Brady material that... and let's assume he's correct, just to make it a simple case... that there's Brady material to be turned over, and the U.S. attorney says,  ""Do not turn the Brady material over. ""  that if the... if the U.S.... if the... if the prosecutor tells this to a court, that he can be disciplined?   Edwin S. Kneedler  --Well, there would, no doubt, be other restrictions.  Justice Kennedy mentioned ethical rules.  Under the Federal whistle blower statute--   David H. Souter  Oh, I'm sure--   Edwin S. Kneedler  --there would--   David H. Souter  --that's so--   Edwin S. Kneedler  --be a restriction.   David H. Souter  --but what about, you know, the basic first amendment--   Edwin S. Kneedler  The first amendment would not be the... would not be the source of protection.  Whether there would be some argument that, if the employee could not be fired, it would be an unconstitutional condition to require him to put his job at peril for committing a due process violation or something like that, whether there would be a claim like that, that would be a different matter.  But the first amendment--   David H. Souter  --But why would you recognize a due process violation if you wouldn't recognize a first amendment violation?   Edwin S. Kneedler  --Because the first amendment does not address speech that an employee undertakes in the performance of his duties.   David H. Souter  Well, neither does due process.   Edwin S. Kneedler  No.  No, I was just suggesting there would have to be some unconstitutional condition.  Well, the due process--   David H. Souter  Yes, but to get to the unconstitutional condition, wouldn't you normally look to the first amendment?   Edwin S. Kneedler  --My point is that the due process... due process clause does address the conduct at question, which is the requirement that exculpatory material be turned over to the defendant.  And so, the question is that the employee would be put in a position where he would... where he would be instructed not to perform what he understood to be a constitutional violation.  I think most civil service laws, most ethical rules, would take care of it.  And, as I mentioned, the Federal whistle blower statute, in 2302(b)(9), I think it is, has a provision that protects employees who refuse--   David H. Souter  Well, that's... I mean, I can see--   David H. Souter  --Counsel, you made the point that if we go the ninth circuit way, every time an employee gets Dutch there's a potential first amendment issue.  Why hasn't that been a problem since 1988 in the ninth circuit?  I think 1988 was the year of the circuit's Roth decision.  So, we haven't seen a deluge, and doesn't that rather discount your argument?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I realize that, but that... as I understand it, that has been true since the ninth circuit's Roth decision in 1988.  And apparently we have not seen a deluge of these claims, or we would have had citations to the cases.  So, doesn't that rather discount the concern that you express?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But didn't... maybe I'm wrong on my assumption, but didn't the ninth circuit take that position, back in 1988?   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  Well, but how do we know that?  We're at summary judgment.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, I realize that, but where do you... how do you infer, from that, that the individual, the employee, was not telling the truth?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  If--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --if I--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --if my ethical record amounted to a lie every time I made a... an inaccurate prediction about what a court was going to do when I was a young lawyer, I would have had a very short career.  [Laughter]  And that seems to me as much as you can infer from what this individual did.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Oh.  Okay.   David H. Souter  So, we don't--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --we don't know why it didn't pan out the way he said it was going to, and we don't know that he was... that he was lying.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  Is that--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --is that true in this case?  I realize they didn't get to it on summary judgment, but is that true in this case with respect to a Brady disclosure?   David H. Souter  What if... what if the lawyer simply believes that he has an ethical obligation to make the disclosure, and he makes it, and he is then subject to retaliation?  No first amendment claim on his part?   David H. Souter  Well, does that mean... what's your answer to my question?  If he makes the Brady disclosure because he believes that is an ethical obligation, and he is then subject to retaliation, does he have a first amendment claim, or not?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Do you... let me ask you this... do you propose drawing the line... or at least drawing a line in some circumstances this way: That, at step one, if it can be concluded that a private communication between the employer and the employee would have constituted the discharge of the employee's assigned work... so that it would have been within the scope of his employment, and, therefore, not subject to Pickering balancing, if he had made the statement to the employer... that, therefore, the statement cannot be regarded as a statement of public interest, even if he had disclosed it publicly, or if he took a further step and went to the bar association and whatnot?   David H. Souter  But if it is within... I'm sorry, but if it... if it is within the speaker's assigned duties as an employee, does that preclude a conclusion, later on, that he was speaking as a citizen, even if he goes public with it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So, we do have, then, the problem that Justice Stevens has raised.   ",04-473X

I thought you said that, in this case, as distinct from Givhan, there would be cognizable employer interests in incompetence, the truth of what was said, the capacity to do the job without roiling the waters unduly, and so on.  And that, I take it, is not necessarily so in a Givhan situation.  Or is it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Maybe the employer has the same interest in each.  I--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --I have--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --No, but in--   David H. Souter  --in Givhan, if the employee's assigned duties were all done competently, but she had just gone off the deep end on racial balance or something, the employer would not have had... if... so long as it was the... a private communication like that, I don't know that the employer would have had an interest in saying,  ""Well, you're incompetent on the subject of racial balance, and therefore I... you know, I'm going to demote you or fire you. ""  But in the case in which the employee is talking on the subject within the job description, then the employer has got... I thought you were saying he's got a direct interest in competence, truth, and so on.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  What if he does let the employer try first, and the employer does nothing, then he goes public?  Where does the Pickering balance come out then?   INTERRUPTING David H.

Is that correct?   David H. Souter  That's right.   David H. Souter  Well, let's go--   David H. Souter  --let's go from Xerox back to your iPod.  How is that clear in the iPod case?  I may not understand what people are doing out there, but it's certainly not clear to me.  I know perfectly well I could go out and buy a CD and put it on my iPod, but I also know perfectly well that if I can get the music on the iPod without buying the CD, that's what I'm going to do.  And I think it's reasonable to suppose that everybody else would guess that.  So why, in the iPod, do you not have this Damoclean sword?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, there's never evidence at the time the guy is sitting in the garage figuring out whether to invent the iPod or not.  I mean, that's--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --the concern.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay, but you're--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --No, but you're--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --you're not answering... you're not answering the question.  The question is, How do we know in advance, on your test, anything that would give the inventor, or, more exactly, the developer, the confidence to go ahead?  As was said a minute ago, he knows he's going to be sued immediately.  There isn't a product performance out there, as there is in this case.  So, on your substantiality theory, why isn't it a foregone conclusion in the iPod that the iPod loser... or developer is going to lose his shirt?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yeah, that's inducement.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Mr. Clement, in one way this presents an easy case for answering Justice Scalia's question, but what about a case in which there isn't the Napster example to start with?  Should there be some kind of flexible rightness doctrine in response to suits, as Justice Scalia put it, against the inventor or developer right out of the box?   INTERRUPTING David H.

""  The sales of the product on Friday are still going to be sales which are the result of the inducing remarks Monday through Wednesday.  And you're asking, in effect... you're asking us... to ignore Monday through Thursday.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then why was current... why was inducement, as a current theory of recovery, even the subject of summary judgement?  It seems to me that to make it a summary judgement is implausible to a non worldly degree.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I mean, I thought you were saying that, so far as the inducement theory of recovery is concerned--   David H. Souter  --the only summary judgement that was granted was with respect to current acts of inducement, the way the company is acting now, not the way the company was acting last year.  And my question is... if that is correct, then I don't see how summary judgement could even intelligibly have been considered.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why isn't this a classic willful-ignorance case?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Sure, but I thought willful ignorance was basically a certainty of what was going on without empirically verifying it, so as to, sort of, maintain the guise of one's hands over one's eyes.  And it seems to me, if that's what it is, that's what we've got.   David H. Souter  Then what is the point of the current summary judgement?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So you're saying the summary judgement simply, in effect, says,  ""They're not doing anything wrong now, but we have left open the question, not merely of what they have done wrong in the past, but whether what they did wrong in the past can carry forward into the future? ""   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That's bizarre.   INTERRUPTING David H.

Souter  Well, but the... the point of the case is that the inmate does not expect to be put in solitary confinement for 23 or 23 and a half hours a day for a period of 1, 2, or more years without some process to do it because that is so extraordinarily onerous and so different from the general run of incarceration practice.

I realize that there is a predictive element.  I don't think anyone disputes that.

Going back to your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, when he is given what you described as the bare bones report at the beginning of the proceedings, when he gets the 48-hour notice, will in her example the bare bones report say you are being reconsidered for reclassification because you are believed to be a gang leader?  Does he get the gang leader information?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  I'm not--   David H. Souter  --I'm not worried about evidence.   David H. Souter  Just I want to know the charge.

It may be a very good reason to prefer a different analysis.   David H. Souter  We... we don't have to conclude why it was not presented.

It may not go to eligibility, but it's very significant.  Number two, if we accept your Calderon analysis, this evidence will be kept out forever.

And you shouldn't then have to be given an entirely new case to meet after you've been put on notice and taken whatever preliminary steps you've taken.  But in the scenario that you're talking about, you have not been put on notice, because you don't even know there is a petition there yet.  You have not been led to prepare a case which has now changed.  So it seems to me that your rationale does not apply in the case in which you do not yet have notice, and, hence, have not filed a response, for that reason.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but that... the problem with that is that a... the whole point of a relation-back rule is to get around the time bar.  That's why you have them.  And I thought your argument was,  ""Well, you shouldn't allow them to get around this time bar, because we have been put on notice, we have begun to prepare our case, and we should not then be presented with an entirely new case. ""  And so, that's why, it seems to me, your preparation point, in effect, is trying to limit a rule, the whole purpose of which is to get around the time bar.  If you don't have the preparation point, you don't have an argument.   David H. Souter  Oh, it would be.  But, again, in the case that you're talking about, the very value that you're arguing for... i.e.,  ""We ought to be able to rely on the notice that we have given. ""  --is an argument which hasn't arisen yet, because there's no factual basis to make it.   David H. Souter  But in the capital case, you've got a specific provision in there.  I mean, for the capital case, which is the one, I agree, you worry about most, because there's reason to delay there, Congress provided specifically for states to opt in; and when they opt in, they get the benefit of pretty rigorous time bars.   David H. Souter  And so, why... I mean, isn't the answer to the capital-case problem exactly the answer that Congress gave, and, if a state does not want to opt in, then the normal amendment rules apply?   David H. Souter  How about--   David H. Souter  --Well, let me... let me ask you how that would work in this case.  The original claim is that there was a Fourth Amendment violation in admitting, you know, unlawfully seized evidence.  Later, the Petitioner wants to amend to claim ineffective assistance of counsel, because counsel totally overlooked the leading case, directly on point, on this particular evidence.

0,"David H. Souter  Haven't we... haven't we got something equally different here?  The... the issue here, as I understand it, is... is not litigation of the State law claim, but a claim under Federal law with respect to the passage of title when property is taken for taxes.  As I understand the... the original plaintiff's claim, it simply is that if he's right, under Federal law he is entitled to a declaration that the property is still his.  If he's wrong, the other side is entitled to property.  But the issue is a Federal issue, and the only way the State has a role in it is that the State provides a mechanism, the quiet title action, analogous maybe to 1983, for getting it into a State court.  So it seems to me that the issue is a Federal issue, not as in Merrell Dow, a... a State cause of action that incorporates by reference a Federal standard.   David H. Souter  Yes, but I don't... I guess that's where we're parting company.  I don't see that there is a State law claim as distinct from a State law procedure for trying that claim in a State court.  As I... as I said a second ago, it's sort of like 1983.  It doesn't create causes of action, but it provides a... a jurisdictional basis for getting into court if you've got a cause of action.  And in this case, it's a Federal cause.   David H. Souter  Which was a Federal issue.   David H. Souter  I take it you would agree that we could leave the... the Kansas City formulation, the oral laws, intact and say that the distinguish... that the distinction between Merrell Dow and this case, which leaves it intact is the distinction between in Merrell Dow's case, the adoption by the State of a Federal standard, though the State did not have to adopt it in its tort law, purely optional, and in this case, the application of Federal law which, under the Supremacy Clause, the State had absolutely no choice but to apply.  If we recognize that distinction, we could leave the language in Kansas City exactly where it is, couldn't we?   David H. Souter  What... what are the... sort of the... the horribles that you have in mind?   David H. Souter  Yes, but in... in that case, the action is not enforcing the Federal tax law, whereas in this case, the action is, indeed, enforcing the passage of title statute under the... under the tax code.

Or does it simply say that convicts may be executed by lethal injection?   David H. Souter  No, but the method may simply be lethal injection.  And, going back to Justice O'Connor's question, it might still be the case that, on the theory the Government is advancing this morning, it would be unlawful for a doctor to engage in that, because that was, in fact, not within the limits of the practice of medicine, the doctor was using a controlled substance for something outside the practice of medicine, and hence, it would be illegal.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But I take it Congress did not refer specifically to... or did not include a specific authorization of doctors, so that we'd have to do a little construction to get to your point.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, they say--   INTERRUPTING David H.

Souter  --that was a clear act of Congress.  I mean, Congress had made that decision, and it was unmistakable.  It seems to me that the problem that you have, with your reference back to the Harrison Act and the 90 years of regulation, is that the 90 years of regulation was regulation for the purpose of stopping drug pushing and drug abuse, in the conventional sense.  And to say that a statute... or a statutory history taken into consideration in determining the scope of this statute, with that kind of a history, can support a view that suddenly the Attorney General of the United States is given, in effect, the sole authority to determine whether any State may or may not authorize assisted suicide, and may do so in a way that any other Attorney General can flip back and forth... as has happened in this case, if Attorney General Reno was wrong... seems to me a kind of argument from history that simply cuts against you, because it leads to a sort of a bizarre result.  I mean, what is your response to that?   David H. Souter  Well, and I... as I said, it seems to me that your 91 years of history say that the end that Congress had in mind was to stop drug pushing and stop conventional drug abuse.

1,"David H. Souter  Mr. Olson, may I ask you to go one step beyond that on an issue of fact that I just don't understand from reading the briefs?  Let me give you three quick quotations.  First, the court of appeals opinion contains this statement,  ""An expert on behalf of the tribe reported that basic economic theory teaches that the nation's station cannot charge prices high enough to allow collection of both the Kansas and the nation's fuel taxes. ""  The red brief says, on page 8,  ""It is undisputed that enforcing the State tax on fuel sold and delivered to the station would effectively nullify the tribal fuel tax. ""  Finally, the yellow brief, on page 13, says,  ""By selling its fuel at market prices, respondent. ""  --the tribe...  ""is making both a profit and collecting a tax. ""  My question is, Do we know, from the record, whether the tax that is assessed on the distributor is, in fact, passed through to the tribe so that, in economic effect, the tribe is collecting, via pass through, the State tax and imposing its own tax and still selling at market prices?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But if... if I may interrupt you... if it's getting passed through, and they're still selling their gas, then there's no... then the tribe cannot make an argument here that their sovereign taxing authority is being compromised or threatened.  And the argument, basically, would boil down to the argument that they want to make a bigger profit.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yeah.   David H. Souter  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  May I go back to one factual nuance on that?  Apart from legal incidence, somebody mentioned earlier that the tax would not necessarily be payable until, in fact, the gasoline was distributed to the retailer.  Is that correct?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But isn't that a surrogate for sale to the... well, I guess what I'm getting at, the tax apparently is not payable when the distributor receives the fuel, but only when the distributor transfers the fuel to a retailer.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, why would he be drawing it down, except to sell--   David H. Souter  --Yeah.   David H. Souter  Is it collecting that tax?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  It is, Your Honor.  The--   David H. Souter  Then what's its gripe?  It wants a bigger profit?  It wants to increase--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Your Honor--   David H. Souter  --the taxation?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --the record is clear that the two taxes cannot coexist in the long run, because it would price the--   David H. Souter  No, but if--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --price the--   David H. Souter  --if the tribe is collecting... it's assuming that... if the tribe is collecting its tax, and it does not have a claim to greater taxation or greater profit, then how is its sovereign right as a taxing authority being interfered with?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Your Honor, the tribe is being forced right now to subsidize the sales at the station at a loss, which it's doing for the balance of this litigation.   David H. Souter  Loss of profit--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  But the--   David H. Souter  --as an entrepreneur.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Your Honor, the tribe... the tribe is--   David H. Souter  Well, isn't... I mean, isn't that necessarily the case?  If it's collecting all of its tax, then what it's complaining about is that it's getting less profit as the... as the retailer.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Your Honor, that's correct, at the moment--   David H. Souter  All right.  Then is that an issue that we should consider on a question of preemption which arises from the tribe's assertion of sovereignty?   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --I think it is, Your Honor, because the tribe should not be put to the choice, as a sovereign, where it's running a tribal business, of choosing between... of generating revenues by the tax versus generating revenues by the profit.  There is no--   David H. Souter  Well, in other words--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --suggestion, Your Honor--   David H. Souter  --should we, in effect, say there is no distinction between the tribe's position as sovereign and the tribe's position as retail gasoline seller.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Your Honor, I think, in that situation, that the two are very similar, in the same way when a State sells at a State liquor store--   David H. Souter  Well, they're similar, because it... ultimately, it's all going into the same pocket.  We realize that. But, unless there is a claim that its taxing authority, as such, is being threatened or interfered with, I don't quite see why a preemption theory that rests upon tribal sovereignty has any place in the analysis.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Because, Your Honor, the... it is exactly the tribal taxing authority that interfered.  It's a... it's quite a strange form of taxing authority that says you can tax the... you can tax the station, but then... but then essentially have to operate the station at a loss.  That's not--   David H. Souter  But it's not operating at a loss.   David H. Souter  And your view generally was that it was... that it was indicative of discrimination.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  I think it--   David H. Souter  And I thought that was the stronger argument, because the... you're saying,  ""Look, the State has only the most trivial interest in the amount of taxation it would get here. ""  That would be equally true whether it forgives taxes that... on fuel that goes to the United States or not.  But the discrimination point, if it's a fair one, would be the same.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Your Honor, I think... that's correct, and we've made both arguments, that it's a--   David H. Souter  I take it Kansas has not indicted the distributor for failing to register under the Indian Trading Statute.   ",04-631X
0,"David H. Souter  Is it being interfered with?   David H. Souter  Well, that expert opinion is that, as an economic matter, you can't collect both.   INTERRUPTING David H.

What difference does that make to an analysis based on a preemption theory which is supposed to take account of tribal sovereignty?  The sovereign act is not selling gas, it's taxing.  They are taxing.  They're getting everything they want under their tax statute. Where, then, is there a basis for a preemption--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --No, I mean, it was--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --an entirely separate... an entirely separate rationale.

But so far as the fourth circuit... tell me if I'm wrong here... it sounds to me that the fourth circuit took the following position, that for purposes of determining diversity, it is not enough to name a principal who may be liable for the acts of subsidiaries, without naming the subsidiary, or, if you name a... I'm mixing up principal and corporation--   David H. Souter  --principal and... corporate parent and subsidiary, or principal and business agent.  And I don't know of any rule to the effect that, for diversity purposes, a plaintiff simply cannot choose to sue the parent, or to sue the principal.   David H. Souter  Okay.  Where would I be wrong?   David H. Souter  But the failure of the burden of proof is apparently a function of the fourth circuit's assumption that if you sue the parent, you have a duty to negate the possibility of suing any subsidiary; or if you sue the principal, you have an obligation to negate the possibility of suing any agent.

1,"David H. Souter  Mr. Nager, on... on that point, I have a factual question and I figured I'd get it... excuse me... get it out on the table at the beginning so you'd know what at least is bothering me.  The nub... the nub of your factual argument is, as you just... just stated it, there's a joint venture here and joint ventures price their products.  The factual question that I have is this.  This is... or the preface for it is this.  This is a joint venture that has continued to market, in effect, the same product that the... that the two companies marketed beforehand, and it has done so, ostensibly, under the old brand names.  Therefore, the fact that there is a joint venture doesn't necessarily disclose that there is a new product as... as might be the case normally which you would expect the joint venture to set its own price for.  Therefore, it seems to me that if the joint venture is clearly going to cover pricing, the joint venture agreements, the documents that indicated the joint venture at the beginning, should have mentioned pricing.  And yet, my understanding is that they did not do so, and in fact, the claim on the other side, as I recall the briefs, is that when the Government looked at the joint venture, prior to its going into effect, nothing was said about fixing prices... setting prices.  So my question is, did the joint venture, as indicated by documentation, say in any... so many words that the joint venture is going to set prices for these two... or for the... the... whatever it... whatever it sells?  And... and number two, if... if the answer to that is no, should we regard the joint venture as covering pricing?   David H. Souter  There were two questions.  Which?  [Laughter]   David H.

Souter  Mr. Nager, what if you had a... a crazy kind of joint venture... or maybe it wouldn't be so crazy... in which it was just like this one?  The two companies said we're going to form a joint venture to market these products.  You know, we'll use one fleet of trucks and... and we'll have one computer to determine who needs gas and so on.  But each company... each of the... the principals forming the venture retained the... the power to determine the price of the gasoline that is sold under their brand.  And then 6 months later, the two companies get together and they decide to fix the price.  That decision would be subject either to quick look or per se analysis, wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, I'm assuming there... there are, indeed, efficiencies to be attained by it so that it's not a sham.  They just retained... they said, look, we're... we're still using our old brands, ostensibly, in the market and we're retaining the power to set the price individually with respect to the gas that is sold under those brands.  So no sham.   David H. Souter  Well, are you... are you saying in practical terms that my hypothesis is... is just a practical impossibility?   David H. Souter  No, no, but... no.

INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  Assuming it can happen, in... in that case, would the subsequent agreement as to price be subject to per se or a quick look analysis?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but there's... there's one part of the lot that you haven't thrown in together, and that's the pricing lot.

Because... correct me if I'm wrong on the facts.  I thought for a few months the... the price differential was maintained.  I think there was a 2 cent price differential or something like that.  And so long as that was maintained, weren't they competing?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Wasn't there competition in... in the... in the retail market?  I mean, if I had two stations in front of me and one was selling gas 2 cents cheaper, I'd... I'd go to the one that was 2 cents lower.  Isn't that competition?   David H.

And the one thing, if I understood him correctly, that is clear is that under the undisputed portions of the joint venture agreement, the price at which the products were sold, high, low, differential, no differential, did not affect the distribution of profits as between the two joint venturers.  Therefore, they were not competing with respect to the pricing, and therefore, the... your... in effect, your whole argument collapses because you don't have, on any analysis, an agreement between two competitors.   David H. Souter  I can understand your argument if we were doing a rule of reason analysis.  Is that something that can properly be analyzed on quick look or per se?   David H. Souter  But, Mr. Alioto, your argument, I think, is assuming that the facts in this case are like the facts in what I think I called my... my crazy joint venture hypothetical in which the two principals agreed to a joint venture, but they accept in a clear and unequivocal way the pricing decisions.  And... and it seems to me that the... two things have come out of this argument.  Number one, you don't make that assumption, and that assumption is... is not supported by the facts of this case.  And number two, Mr. Minear comes back and says as long as the division of profits under the joint venture agreement does not depend on these pricing decisions, they are not competitors, and therefore it's irrelevant anyway.

I think the suggestion was over a reasonable period of time, by two and a half percent of the 6, there is, I suppose, reason to expect that there will be, maybe not two and a half percent less coastline lost, but some degree of less coastline lost because there is a correlation between the gas and the loss of the coastline.  Why is that an unreasonable assumption to make in order to show causation and redressibility, bearing in mind that redressibility is a question of more or less, not a question of either/or.

But isn't it intuitively reasonable to suppose that with some reduction of the greenhouse gases, there will be some reduction of the ensuing damage or the ensuing climate change which causes the damage?  Isn't that fair?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But do you have any--   ",05-1120
1,"David H. Souter  Well, I thought you were also making a different argument.  I thought you were making the argument that they have, by their pleadings, in effect, affirmatively indicated that they don't have enough facts to support a general allegation.  I thought you were saying that because of the preface that you began reading, that in view simply of the fact that they are not competing, and in view of parallel conduct, they have violated the Act.  So I guess my question is, would your position be different if there were no allegation simply of an absence of competition and parallel action if... would your position be different if they had simply alleged, as Justice Stevens emphasized, that here were these parties and they had... they had taken some action, not specified, which resulted in violation of the Act?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So that would not be good enough, but are you saying that this is worse because, in effect, they have gone some steps towards specification.  And the specifications that they have made affirmatively show that they don't have enough for the agreement.   David H. Souter  And you're saying that inference cannot be drawn from the particular facts that they have alleged.   David H. Souter  Well, is that really what they... I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that the, that the Court spoke of no set of facts, only on the assumption that there had been a pleading which did raise a plausible, possible inference of forbidden conduct, and I thought the Court was saying if the, if the plausibility criterion has been satisfied, then the only way that the defendant can get a dismissal is by showing that there is no set of facts which would actually support the action.  And I'm not sure that that can be done at the, at the, at the stage of simply pleading a dismissal as opposed to summary judgment or something like that.  But I thought the Court did not get to its no set of facts point until it had first assumed that there had been a, a pleading on the basis of which a plausible inference of forbidden conduct could be drawn.  Am I about that?   David H. Souter  So, so that if plausibility is the standard this does not meet the standard of plausibility, that's your argument?   ",05-1126
0,"David H. Souter  But that does not help you with respect to the other claim, the claim that there was a conspiracy to prevent upstart competitors from coming in.  There's no plus factor as I understand it alleged there, and I also understand that it would have been entirely in the interest of each of your defendants to keep the upstarts out and that there is no need for them to agree to do that.  It would be the most natural thing in the world to do it.  What do you say about that part of your case?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but a common, isn't the common motive consistent, just as consistent with no agreement as with agreement?  In other words, they didn't have to agree; their common motive was operative agreement or not?   David H. Souter  No, what the other side is saying is that simply by alleging parallelism when it would be in the interest of each of the alleged conspirators to do just as you claim they are doing in the absence of an agreement, you have not alleged something that gets to the threshold of plausibility.  That's their argument and I, I--   David H. Souter  --You may reply to us jointly or severally, however you may want.  [Laughter]   David H. Souter  But the difference between that case and this is that the allegation with respect to the agreement to procure the getaway cars gets to a kind of specificity that is not present here.  Here the allegation simply is parallel conduct to make it hard for the upstarts to get in.  And at that general level the answer is, of course anyone in his right mind would want to make it difficult to let the upstarts in.  There's no need to assume that they might have agreed on some matter of detail which is not essential to the scheme.  This is a general characteristic of competition and resistance of competition.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What's the answer to Justice Alito's question in this case?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But if they don't do that, is it your argument that simply by behaving differently from the way Congress assumed when it passed the statute, that raises the plausible inference of violation?   David H. Souter  Okay.  But is part of the plausibility of that inference the fact, in your argument, the fact that Congress assumed that would happen?   INTERRUPTING David H.

1,"David H. Souter  Isn't that the problem?  If the instruction had said that, you would have a very different instruction, and I'm bothered by the instruction too for just that reason.  It says you may consider, and if I were a juror parsing the instruction, I would say,  ""why? ""  ""You've just told me I'm not supposed to punish them. ""   David H. Souter  Okay.  This is an argument you're making to us, but I don't know how a juror is supposed to figure this out.   David H. Souter  Let me... let me... let me focus the problem that I have right now this way.  If I look at the Oregon Supreme Court opinion, and particularly at the point that you mention in 20 and 21, I have to say I, I read the opinion the way you read the opinion.  I read them the same, just what you claimed they were saying.  The difficulty that I have is because I think the instruction that was proposed on behalf of your client was not a clear instruction, I have great difficulty in seeing how I could find that it was error to refuse to give the instruction.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So my problem is, if I think they really did have the wrong view of the law but the issue was focused at the trial court by a request for an instruction which I think was properly denied, what do I do?  Do I concentrate on what they said in the opinion or do I concentrate on what I think was the deficiency of the instruction?   David H. Souter  But then they would respond, when they made that, when they gave that explanation in the Oregon Supreme Court, they were responding to a claim of error which was focused and raised at the trial level by the request for an instruction, which strikes me as probably an unsound instruction, an unsound request.   David H. Souter  In effect, it would give you another chance in Oregon.   David H. Souter  It was a good thing we weren't instructing a jury.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Oh, I do too.  I don't have any trouble with the distinction.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But it doesn't answer the question, if the juror were to speak up.  It doesn't answer the question.  Consider for what?

And I, in all candor I think you told us more about the, your case than about the footnote, but let me ask you basically the same question about what the Oregon Supreme Court meant in the passage that runs from the bottom of 20(a) up to 21.  It says  ""Philip Morris's proposed jury instructions would have prohibited the jury from punishing the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons even if those other persons were Oregonians who were harmed by the same conduct that had harmed Williams, and in the same way. ""  ""As we noted that is not correct as an independent matter of Oregon law. ""  and so on.  That is not a totally unambiguous statement.

In other words, is it because there was such a tremendous variation in the liquid in the sludge or simply because there was a standard formula having no particular relationship to the liquid in the sludge, and they simply didn't follow the standard formula?

Michigan does not dispute that national banks can go into business of real estate loans?  And Michigan does not dispute that Congress has authorized national banks to operate through subsidiaries for specific purposes like this.  My question is can you give me any plausible reason to think that Congress would have contemplated this system of potentially more restrictive State legislation when its national bank in a given instance decides to do... to exercise its Federal banking power through a subsidiary rather than directly?  Can you think of any reason that Congress would have contemplated the scheme that you're, that you're defending?   David H.

I mean, I didn't agree with this at the time, but I mean there, it... you have to admit that there was protectionism of the one licensee, the person who constructed the plant and was going to sell it to the town for a dollar.  That, so far as we know, that person or that company was in it for the money.  And so for the period of the five years prior to the transfer to the town for the dollar, that particular entity was being protected so it could make money, and therefore, make it worthwhile for that company to sell its, its real estate to the town for a dollar.  Surely that entity was being protected handsomely.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, that's... that's a third case but that's not the question we have here, is it?   David H. Souter  It sounds to me as though, if we accept your argument that, going back to Justice Breyer's first question, every municipal utility in the United States is going to fall.   David H. Souter  No, but you know, you know that there are plenty of, of communities that don't have municipal utilities and seem to get natural gas.  They seem to get electricity.  The lights go on.  And therefore by parity of reasoning to what we have just heard, there just wouldn't be the justification for, let's say, embargoing the importation of electricity and gas by private entities from outside.

Why isn't the better answer that in fact that would be subject to Commerce Clause analysis and that would fall, that if the government wants to do this the government's going to do it the way the government's doing it in your case, it's going to be a 100 percent government.  If it doesn't, it's protectionism.   David H. Souter  Well, that's just a question of New York law, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING David H.

Souter  If the government tries to pursue these policies solely by private inducement, trash haulers may say, we don't want to deal on those terms, we can haul somewhere else, in another county, another State, what-not.  By taking on the job itself, the government in effect is guaranteeing that to the extent it can protect its citizens, induce respect for environmental policy, and so on, it will do so without any cessation of service?

1,"David H. Souter  Okay, but you're one step ahead of that here, because here there hasn't been any, in effect, any exposure.  Here there isn't any certain default on the note.  So far as we know, here, there may never be any default on the workers comp obligation.  So that your contingency is a much more remote contingency.  Why should that, why should this case fall into the same category as the promissory note?   David H. Souter  And so far as we know, it won't.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, it has, but that depends on a totally circular argument.  The minute it filed for bankruptcy, although there had been no default on the comp obligation, your client started incurring attorneys' fees, and it was not incurring attorneys' fees based on any default by the, by the debtor.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You can call bankruptcy a default, but that's not what I mean, and you know that's not what I mean.  I'm talking about a default on the workers comp obligation.   David H. Souter  There has been no default on the workers comp obligation, and because they intend to keep on running this business, there is reason to suppose that there will not be.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, and maybe you don't have a claim at the beginning of the case.  I mean, that's what we're getting at.  We can understand the claim when the note... when you've got a promissory note and you're out of money.  The claim is inevitable.  In this case, there is no inevitable claim.   David H. Souter  But if it is defined as broadly as this, we're in a situation exactly like this.  There has been no default on the obligation, and prior to getting to this Court, $167,000 has been racked up in legal fees that accomplishes absolutely nothing.   David H. Souter  All right, in this case, $167,000 has been spent to come to the conclusion, as I understand it.  That if the time comes to assert a right of indemnification, you can assert a right of indemnification and we can oppose it.  If we are going to construe the bankruptcy law to provide a law like this, then maybe there is something wrong in the, in the construction of the bankruptcy law.   David H. Souter  Let's assume, let's assume that one of the recipients of comp payments had come forward and said: I object to the plan, I have a claim for comp payments and I object to the plan because it doesn't provide for them.

1,"David H. Souter  No, but that's I think our sticking point.  If the, if the plan sponsor decides to purchase an annuity, it's accepted I think by you and by everybody that there are two decisions being made.  Decision one is terminate the plan.  Decision two, distribute the assets by purchasing an annuity that gives the beneficiaries what they should get.  And so on.  But when we come to the question of merger, you're saying there's only one decision, and I think that's where I'm having trouble with your argument.  When we come to the question of merger, it seems to me there are two decisions again.  The first decision is we're going to terminate the plan that we've got.  What do we do with our assets.  We have decided to merge... one possible decision as an alternative to annuities is to merge the plan with, with another one.  Why aren't there two decisions in the merger case just as there are two decisions in the annuity case?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why do you say that's the threshold question?  I thought the threshold question is whether to terminate what we've got now.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  If they say, look, we're not ending our plan.  Let's assume you have an ongoing business and they say, we're just sick of the form that it's in now and we can get a good deal by letting somebody else administer this, so we're going to merge.  I can see that as a single decision.  But that's not what you've got here.  As I understand it, the decision to terminate was made, it was over and done with.  The question was what are they going to do with these assets?  It's at that point that PACE arrived and said: Give them to us through a merger.  I don't see how you eliminate the, the termination decision before the merger decision.   David H. Souter  The form of the plan is going to be zero.  Our plan is over.  We are terminating our plan.  What do we do now?  We have two choices roughly, maybe three.  We can either buy annuities, we can give the assets to the beneficiaries or we can give the assets to PACE in the form of a merger.   David H. Souter  Are you saying you can't have a merger of a plan that has already been terminated, so that the merger decision is necessarily a decision that has to be made before the termination... before a termination decision.   David H. Souter  That's what I keep suggesting.   David H. Souter  Why isn't exactly the same point true with respect to purchasing annuities?   David H. Souter  What if the plan document doesn't say anything about what will follow termination.  There is nothing in there about annuities.  Is the annuity... the decision to purchase annuities a decision subject to fiduciary obligation.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  The decision to... to take the option of purchasing annuities or offering annuities to the beneficiaries, that is a fiduciary decision.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  If the plan is silent.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What if they say, we will distribute by going to the top of the building and throwing the money out on the street.  Fiduciary problem?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  Reserve your time.   David H. Souter  Then why are we having this argument?  Why isn't it simply a question of construing the provision for options in the original plan.   David H. Souter  Then why isn't--   David H. Souter  --Then why isn't the simple argument, you can't merge because the plan didn't provide that as an option.   David H. Souter  Was that position presented, I should have asked you--   David H. Souter  --So we've got to assume that the plan is silent in the sense that, insofar as the plan documents are concerned, merger is at least a possibility.   David H. Souter  Then why doesn't the administrator here take the position that it's going to reserve the five million for itself and merge what's left?  If PACE wants a merger with what's left, fine; if PACE doesn't, end of problem?   David H. Souter  My question is why... why isn't it an option here to say all right, number one, we got a $5 million surplus.  We are going to terminate this plan and we are going to take the five million.  Question number two, should we, should we use what's left to merge into the PACE plan?  Is that an option?   David H. Souter  By doing it in that sequence could it reserve the five million for itself?   David H. Souter  If we assume that, can they keep the five million?   David H. Souter  I don't care how they make it; I just want to know under the terms of the plan and consistently with ERISA, could they keep the five million and in some sequence provide for a merger with PACE?

It's not merely in association.  It is a definition, isn't that so?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then, then what does the phrase with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above 95 or below 5 mean?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, why doesn't it?  It seems to me that the only identification of an entity or person, if you want, to be disregarded is the identification of an LEA, and the LEA is described in terms exclusively of its expenditures or revenues.  So why doesn't that foreclose your position?   David H. Souter  Right.  Obviously--   David H. Souter  --After identifying them in terms of the expenditures or revenues.  That's what you're supposed to do.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  There are lots of things that Congress could have done differently from what it did do, but it, that doesn't seem to me to inject an ambiguity in the identification in, in this subsection of the LEA that we are talking about.  And it doesn't create an ambiguity in, in the clear provision that what is to be disregarded is an LEA as so defined.   David H. Souter  Sure, that's another way to--   David H. Souter  --do it, but tell me why that is consistent with the text.   David H. Souter  It says disregard LEAs; it then identifies certain LEAs which are to be disregarded.  Nowhere does it say disregard pupils.   INTERRUPTING ",05-1508
0,"David H. Souter  No, but isn't that the problem in your argument?  Because your argument assumes, and I think you said this quite candidly a moment ago, that once there has been a finding that he informed the court that he did not want mitigation evidence presented, that in effect is a matter of... binds him as a matter of law for all time.  And what he is saying here is look, if I had known that there was this kind of mitigating evidence, as opposed to what was proffered to the court at the end of the trial in fact, I would not have made that waiver, if you want to call it that.  I would not have made that representation to the court.  And what I want is an evidentiary hearing to show that, to show that in fact, when I said to the court no mitigating evidence, I didn't mean this.  And he wants a hearing for that.  The only way it seems to me that you can properly win on the issue that he thus raises is exactly the way that I think you said a moment ago.  That once there is a finding that he made a statement, whatever its predicate, a statement that I don't want any mitigating evidence presented, that is the end of the issue as a matter of law.  My question is, do you have any authority for that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Doesn't it have to go to both?  Because I mean, he's saying look, first I want to show that there's a certain kind of mitigation evidence that was not proffered, that I didn't have in mind, that I wouldn't have objected to.  And he then wants to proceed with respect to his inadequacy of counsel claim based also on the existence of this kind of evidence that counsel didn't look to.  There's a dual purpose, I thought.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So it's clear that they disagreed that the finding was necessarily dispositive.  Is anything clear beyond that?  I mean, I guess I'm hesitant to say I'm raising the same question that the Chief Justice did, about the ambiguity of what the court did.  I mean, there's no question that they found that the... the State trial court's finding with respect to waiver or whatever we want to call it was not necessarily dispositive.  I don't think it's clear that they found anything beyond that, but correct me if I'm wrong.   David H. Souter  Right.  But that could have, as we said a moment ago, that could have a dual purpose.  One to show the, in effect, the inadequacy or the nondispositive character of the State court's finding; and two, to show relief for inadequate assistance of counsel.  And the question here is that, the immediate question is what exactly did the State court find with respect to... oh, sorry... what exactly did the Ninth Circuit find with respect to the State court finding?  And there's no question that the Ninth Circuit assumed that the State court finding was not necessarily dispositive, but I don't know that it's clear it went beyond that, and that's where perhaps you could help me if I'm wrong.   David H. Souter  Isn't there something that, isn't he saying implicitly Justice Souter implicitly  ""I didn't have this kind of evidence in mind; if I had been aware of this kind of evidence, I wouldn't have given that instruction? ""  So he is, it seems to me, implicitly saying well, my waiver was not knowing, in the sense that I understood there was this kind of evidence and intended to preclude its introduction?  Isn't that clear?   David H. Souter  But that's the same thing, isn't that the same, a way of saying that to that extent my waiver was not knowing?   David H. Souter  And he's saying if you will give me a hearing, district court, I will try to demonstrate to you why, why the State court's finding on that point was unreasonable.  The State court made that finding based on its observation of me at trial and, and at the sentencing phase; but it didn't give me a, a further chance to develop my evidence on, on post-conviction.  And I want a hearing to develop that evidence in front of you, Federal district court, in order to prove that the State court's finding in light of that evidence was unreasonable.  Isn't, isn't it correct that that's what he's asking for now?   David H. Souter  How would... how do we know that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But you, I don't think you mean this, but you're not arguing that he just omitted the magic words not knowing and voluntary?   David H. Souter  No, but, I thought a second ago you... you admitted that to a degree he was, because he is saying implicitly if I had known about this kind of mitigating evidence, I wouldn't have waived.  Therefore, my waiver was, as to this, not a knowing waiver.   David H. Souter  Look, it would have been a better affidavit, it would have been better pleading.  We can stipulate to that.  But is there, I don't see there is any serious question that he is arguing right now that as to this kind of evidence, had I known about it I wouldn't have waived and therefore, I shouldn't be precluded from, from getting it in now.  And, and if there's no question about that, then... then I think we're just fighting about words.   David H. Souter  And he says in the district, he says in the district court: I want a hearing to show that I was credible.  So credible that the State court finding should be seen as an unreasonable resolution of a factual issue.  I want a hearing.  That's all he's asking for, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, that's pretty good evidence, isn't it?  I mean, he may be a believable witness on this point.  I don't know.   David H. Souter  Well, the district court had a proffer, but the district court but had not heard witnesses, it had not heard evidence.   David H. Souter  Sure, but the reasonableness of factual findings depends on what the evidence is that can go in on the issue of reasonableness.  And there's a universe of difference between a proffer of evidence which the district court says ""well, I'll assume that"", on the one hand, and on the other hand, the actual presentation of witnesses perhaps including Landrigan himself, which the court actually hears.  You know, you, sometimes you get a lot more impressed by real evidence than by assumptions you make for the sake of argument.  And that seems to me a world of difference.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  The only thing, but the... the... I guess on that point, my only, my only reason for raising this with you is on that point, it's not enough to say well, the district court assumed this.  Or for that matter, the State trial court assumed this.  That is not the same thing as putting in the evidence.   David H. Souter  And so are you, are you in effect then saying that the waiver does not need to be a knowing waiver in the sense that it needs to be based upon an appreciation of all the possible mitigation evidence that in this case might come in?  Are you saying it need not be knowing in that sense?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, you're not answering my question.  I... we all agree that he needs to understand the basic concept of mitigation.  Does his waiver have to be a knowing one in the sense that I just described?  Or doesn't it?  What's your position?   David H. Souter  And it will nonetheless kind him if he comes in later and says look, I accept the fact that it's my burden to show at this point that my waiver was not a knowing one, and that there us mitigating evidence that I would have let in?  Are you saying that he simply as a matter of law cannot say that?  Or cannot be heard to say that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So... so the answer to my question is yes?   David H. Souter  As a matter of law, he cannot do what he is trying to do here?   David H. Souter  Okay.   ",05-1575

Souter  And your claim as I take it, that there is an infringement with the union's right of political advocacy, is that if in effect the scheme restricts the union's use of its own funds?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  All right.  You agree that the union could segregate these funds as opposed to commingling them, and that would cure, that would in effect answer your, your constitutional objection?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, it's clear from the statute that, that what you would do would be leave them subject to the opt-in determination, but all other funds, i.e., the funds that you are constitutionally entitled to protect, would be unencumbered.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Do you think that would create an independent constitutional problem assuming that you did segregate the funds?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That would, that would create an issue?  You know, what if they say: Nothing?  Maybe, maybe the statute does not deal adequately with that.  But does that raise a constitutional problem that in effect would be, would be of equal parity with the one that is, that is raised on behalf of the, the, the dissenting workers?

And I thought the reason it didn't answer the problem was that the, that it was, that the purposes of the, of the act were underinclusive.  And now you're responding to Justice Ginsburg by going back to making the assumption that the segregated funds would be the union's funds.   ",05-1589
1,"David H. Souter  Will you help me out on one mechanical point?  As you probably know from your brief, I don't come from a jurisdiction that uses this rule and I'm just not used to it.  I had thought... and I guess I'm wrong... that if the natural and probable consequences theory were used to prove, let's say, ultimately the offense of assault, in what started out as a theft case, that there would have to be a separate charge of assault but that the theory of proof would be the natural and consequences extension of aiding and abetting so that there would at least be on the record a charge of assault.  And I take it that's not the case.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Otherwise, you wouldn't have this problem.   David H. Souter  But in any case in my example of... of theft, and the further offense under natural and probable consequences being assault, the only charge against the defendant who aided and abetted would be a charge of theft; is that correct?   David H. Souter  Me too.   David H. Souter  But to accept your answer, we've got to look into a question of California pleading law which hasn't been passed on below.   David H. Souter  I think that, the problem I guess that I have with your argument, is that the theory of Taylor and as carried forward in Shepard was that there was a concept of a generic offense.  And when aiding and abetting liability is extended in the natural and probable consequences theory, we face the fact that regardless of what the actual count is, even on your count, there isn't even a majority of states that do it.  And I have difficulty seeing how that can, therefore, form an element of a generic offense when it is... or a generic concept of the offense... when it is a minority view.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why didn't we simply take the closest Federal definition as being the touchstone?   David H. Souter  Yes.   David H. Souter  Was Taylor an immigration case?   David H. Souter  So you are in effect, you would say that the rule should be, or the modified Taylor rule for application here should be that it's either got to fall within the concept of the Federal offense, or in default of there being a comparable Federal offense, a generic offense defined by reference to state practice?

INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I don't understand that.  How could such a belief be reasonable?  What am I missing here?   David H. Souter  That doesn't answer my question.   David H. Souter  Why, why would it be reasonable to believe that a car could be bumped at 90 miles an hour plus without raising a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm?  How could such a belief be reasonable?   David H. Souter  Some people are lucky.  We're talking about creating a substantial risk.  How would it be reasonable to assume that one would not create a substantial risk?   David H. Souter  Well, the phrase used was ""take him out"", wasn't it?   ",05-1631
0,"David H. Souter  The question was whether he was creating a substantial risk doing that.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And my, my question is how could a jury find otherwise?

But the question is whether he was creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm to others.  And my question is leaving... assuming that his reflexes were good and he knew how to use the signal lights, how could the jury fail to find that he was creating such a risk?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Garner was not talking about someone who at the time the deadly force was used was himself creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm to others.  That's what we are dealing with here.  And the reasonableness of the officer's action depends on whether, at the summary judgment stage, a jury can reasonably find that, in fact, he was not creating at that moment, a substantial risk of serious bodily harm or death to others.  And my question is, how could a jury find anything else?   David H. Souter  But at the moment Scott came into this case, what difference does that make?  Why is that even relevant?  Let's assume Scott knew that this entire situation had eventuated out of an 18 mile in excess of speed act by the individual.  Assume that.  What Scott also knew at the point at which he joined the chase was that this individual was driving a car at 90 miles an hour.  He was crossing yellow lines, going through red lights, et cetera.

But doesn't the United States approve the latter contract?  In other words, doesn't it... well, I forget the initials... OPM or whatever it is.  Doesn't it have a... a requirement of approval going to the terms of the contract between Empire and... and the employee before that contract goes into effect?   David H. Souter  But isn't that... isn't that crucial, though, in your answer to Justice Breyer?  Because if the United States... if OPM approves the Empire employee contract, maybe you can say, well, gee, there's something strange going on at OPM if they don't require exactly the same terms in the contract with the employee that they... that they require in their master contract with... with Empire.  But it doesn't say anything one way or the other about the interest of the United States in having uniformity in which the... in the... in the interpretation and application of contracts, which they do approve, between Empire, other Blue Cross Blue Shield entities, and their employees.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And the United States is treated the same in relation to all Federal employees.  I mean, there's... there's an interest in uniformity for fairness among employees, and there's an interest in the United States in having the same expectation, in this case a reimbursement expectation, no matter where the employee is.

Souter  Now, with respect to section 2, what is... what is your position on the relationship between the predominant political motivation and the existence and nonexistence of a section 2 violation?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Let me put it another way.  If... if you otherwise demonstrate a section 2 violation, is the political motivation a defense?   David H. Souter  No.   David H. Souter  But... but are you saying--   David H. Souter  --Mr. Smith, may... may I ask you to comment on... on one problem that I have with your position that has nothing whatever to do with the... with the fact that there was a... a judicial redrawing in the first place here?  If I understand your argument, you're saying that a... a districting that takes place prior to the report of a new decennial census, which is done for purely political reasons, maximizing political advantage, is invalid for that reason, I guess under the Equal Protection Clause.   David H. Souter  And yet, I take it it's also your position that if the districting is done in response to the new decennial figures so that there's a need to do something to conform to one person/one vote, that there is nothing illegitimate about political motivation, at least up to some point--   David H. Souter  --in... in drawing the lines at that time.  How can we in principle say that the motivation which is legitimate in 1991 is somehow constitutionally illegitimate and dispositive in 1995?   David H. Souter  But your answer, both to the Justice Kennedy and... and to me, ultimately comes down, I guess, to saying that political partisanship alone, undiluted, unadulterated by any other motivations, is per se wrong.   David H. Souter  All right.  Let's... let's assume that the... that the partisans who do the mid term redistricting candidly say, we are doing this for partisan reasons, but we recognize limits on what we can do.  And the limits are the traditional ones, compactness, et cetera.  Let us assume that there is, in fact, evidence of a good faith effort at least to conform to those districting principles.  Under those circumstances, is the midterm redistricting equally illegitimate?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, that may be, but how about the question that I posed?  [Laughter]   David H. Souter  Okay.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  I'm... in a way, I'm making it easy for you.  I'm saying, look, they're... they're saying we think we can get a better deal for our party, but we are respecting these districting principles.  Equally illegitimate?   David H. Souter  The difficulty I have with that is that it is... it is impossible... I think you would agree.  It is impossible... and may, indeed... let's assume undesirable... to take partisanship out of a political process.  And... and if partisanship pure and simple, even though subject to the discipline of districting principles, is... is illegitimate, then I don't see why that does not imply the illegitimacy of any districting at any time.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  This would be at... least your criterion, whether we accept it or not, would... would be more administrable if we're dealing with the elimination of a district than if we were dealing with the question of creating one.  Do you take the position that the NAAC brief does that there really should be distinct criteria, depending on whether you're asking to create something new or preserve something which has been in place?   David H. Souter  But is it... is it wrong under the Equal Protection Clause or is it wrong under section 2?   David H. Souter  No.  But on Justice... Justice Scalia's hypothesis, there is no intention to remove Latinos as Latinos.  And maybe the answer to that is if you're removing Latinos, it does not matter whether your motivation is invidious or not.  I don't know whether that's your position.  But it... if that's not your position, then I think there's got to be a difference between the... the Equal Protection Clause analysis and the section 2 analysis.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, is that because there were no other Democrats who could have been identified and taken out?   David H. Souter  Well, isn't... isn't one answer that we were doing it, number one, because we wanted to protect the incumbent and we also had to use race to avoid a section 5 problem and a section 2 claim?  You've got to use race for those purposes.   David H. Souter  So you could have used that reasoning to create a district in the first place, but you cannot use that reasoning to create an offset district in the second place at the same time that you're trying to protect an incumbent.  I think that's what you're saying.   David H. Souter  In other words, you're saying that would be implausible as a section 2/section 5 justification, regardless of when you're doing it.

INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But I think that's implicit in your argument.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay, but why... why isn't the answer to your argument the... the historical answer that courts of equity frequently provided remedies and supplementary remedies when remedies at law were not fully adequate?

Souter  The only issue in that case is competent performance, and it seems to me that the... the difficulty behind a number of our questions this morning is that you are trying to draw an analogy from... from counsel issues that don't involve an autonomy interest to a counsel issue that does involve an autonomy interest, maybe in theory not as greatly as self representation, but as... as everybody agrees, as you've said, it involves some autonomy interest.  And if we're going to import the rule of prejudice from non autonomy cases as the... as the necessary condition in autonomy cases, then it seems to me the autonomy interest is devalued to the point of almost of disappearance.  It becomes not much more than... a little bit, but not much more than an ineffective assistance case.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but you say he's... he's not denied all choice.  He is denied the choice that he wants to make.   David H. Souter  That's not the state's problem.  We're talking about the state standing in the way of it.  In this case the state through the court system stood in the way of it because it made an error that denied him his right.  But the... the... it seems to me the autonomy interest is not merely an interest in choosing second best.  It's an interest in choosing the one you want.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It's second best to the guy who wants somebody else.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But what good is that as... as an answer to our question?  Sure, no harm, no foul.

Souter  It's... it's basically... in... in Justice Scalia's question, it is connected with what the... the client believes will be a favorable outcome by using the lawyer he wants.  It's his judgment about what will probably be a favorable outcome, and his judgment about the lawyer who is most likely to bring that about.   INTERRUPTING David H.

The anatomical approach may be well be an answer at the facial challenge stage, to problems of vagueness, for example.  But the health exception problem is not affected by that.  And the difficulty that I have with your argument that somehow the health exception issue should be left to an as applied challenge is the statement in Stenberg, and it's on 938.  I'm quoting  ""But where substantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular abortion procedure could endanger women's health, Casey requires the statute to include a health exception where the procedure is necessary in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation.... ""  --excuse me...  ""of the life or health of the mother. ""  Now, your position, it seems to me, requires us to do one of three things.  Either we, we overrule Stenberg in that respect, or we, we find... I don't know how but we might find, well, in this case, there is no substantial medical authority, and therefore on the face of the statute there seems to be no impediment in the Stenberg statement.  Or three, we say well, there seems to be a tension between the showing of substantial medical authority which occurred in the litigation in these cases and the findings made by Congress, and under those circumstances in effect we are required to ignore the record in the cases and go with Congress's apparently contrary judgment.  Which of the three do we take?   David H. Souter  Take all three.  [Laughter]  No, but seriously--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --Okay, but the problem, I guess... focus the problem this way.  The, the Stenberg opinion talks about substantial medical authority as triggering this requirement for a statutory element.  That problem is not focused simply by saying Congress made some findings and the district court made other findings and Congress should prevail.  The fact is the substantial medical judgment finding I would suppose is satisfied by the, by the record in the district courts in these cases.  This is not one doctor's idiosyncratic judgment and a court could reasonably find, it seems to me, that there is substantial medical judgment.

1,"David H. Souter  May I ask you to focus on one particular problem that I think is implicated by Justice Ginsburg's question.  If I understood you correctly a moment ago, and I think this is in your briefs too, you said that the definitional problem is that doctors always set out to do an intact procedure if they can, because it involves less risk to the mother from, from acts performed inside.  And if that's the case, then it would be, I guess in the real world, very difficult for Congress to define a difference between D&E and D&X, because the intention is always, as you understand it, to have an intact result.  Your brother on the other side, the Solicitor General says there certainly is testimony to the effect that that is not so.  That doctors who intend to perform a D&E simply intend at the beginning to have a lesser degree of dilation which will force them to do the D&E and not have a totally intact procedure.  Would you comment on what I think is the factual difference between you and the Solicitor General there?   David H. Souter  I understand that.   David H. Souter  But could you start simply with the factual predicate for your argument and his argument.  You seem to be starting from, if I understand the two of you correctly, you seem to be starting from basically different factual assumptions.  Could you, could you start by commenting on that?   David H. Souter  Well, they may not be able to control it in an absolute sense, but can't they go about it in a way that would tend to produce less rather than more dilation?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It can't guarantee results, but couldn't they at least start with a, I don't know how you put it, a procedure that would be likely to produce less rather than more, and hence come within the safe harbor, if you will, of the statute?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, you say they don't, but my question is, can they?  And the record may not show this.  I'm not asking you to answer the impossible, but do we have evidence that would indicate that they can or that they can't?   David H.

On the motion for remand, all a Federal court decides is whether, in fact, there is a colorable basis for the removal.  When it goes back, if it does go back, to the State court, there will be an opportunity not to go merely to the stage of colorable basis, but to litigate it ultimately on the merits.  So... so that what we have is a... in effect, a kind of quick look finding at the Federal level, and that does not preclude a... a complete development of the issue on the merits in the State court, if that's where it goes.

There is... there is regular preemption, on the basis of which there may or may not be a removal, and there is a preclusion of any litigation whatsoever.

But, if we're asking,  ""What is important in the mind of Congress, for purposes of the immigration law? ""  one would suppose that the most obvious touchstone of importance is the way Federal law deals with it... i.e., in the case of a crime, whether Federal law calls it a felony or Federal law calls it a misdemeanor.  You know, in your reading, when Federal law calls it a misdemeanor, if State law calls it a felony, it becomes a Federal felony for the immigration law.  And that's what seems to me odd.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but--   David H. Souter  --May I just ask one--   David H. Souter  --It's one thing to turn to State law to get an answer where there is no other answer.  The problem here is that State law and Federal law are at odds in determining the gravity of the offense.  The Federal law, on my hypothesis, would say,  ""It is minor; it's just a misdemeanor. ""  The State says,  ""No, it is a felony.

I thought, at the time they entered into the license agreement, they had some disagreements about the scope of the then-patent, the scope of the anticipated patent, and so on, and they couldn't very well be resolved.  But they were... they were not settling, in the... in the classic sense of the word, a... let us say, a focus claim, one against the other.   INTERRUPTING David H.

Conversely, as Justice Scalia said, if timing does have something to do with it, timing presumably derives from this provision; this provision, therefore, must have been assumed to apply to administrative proceedings.

But let's assume for the sake of argument that it is a practice within the meaning of the text.  If the... if the agency had explicitly said, what we are doing here in defining this practice as unlawful or unjust, is to define it as such within the meaning of, what is it, 201(b), so they make explicit reference to the statute and they say, we are fleshing out the statute, would your position be the same?   David H. Souter  But it wasn't textually as nice as that?   David H. Souter  Let's assume in the reg itself, they were that precise.  Would your position be exactly the same?   David H. Souter  Sure.   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  You invite me to change the hypothetical, then, by jacking it up in this respect.  The FCC gives the reason.  And it says, the reason it's unjust and unreasonable is that the carriers are getting a free ride on the pay phones, et cetera.  So they fill in the gap that you claim.  They have a reason.  Would your answer or your position still be the same?   David H. Souter  Are there any times under any circumstances that you can think of in which the FCC can adequately and validly define a practice as unjust and unreasonable within the meaning of the statute so that, in fact, in applying the statute, we would follow... be bound to follow the regs?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  But why can't they pass a regulation that says don't gouge pay phone operators?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, do they?  I mean, the statute of the United States says that... I think I'm correct... the statute of the United States says they can't be required, the caller cannot be required to put in the quarter in order to get the 800 number and so on.  So as a matter of law, don't we have to say that the, in practical terms, the caller doesn't owe?  Somebody owes.  Somebody ought to pay for the use of this facility.  But Congress has said it is not the end user.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, the customer is going to pay if, in fact, the long distance carrier is the one who has to make the immediate payment, because that payment is going to be figured in the long distance rate.  So that ultimately, the end user is going to pay for the service he gets, and Congress is simply saying, the way to make this thing work in a sensible and simple way is to require the long distance carrier to make the reimbursement.  The economic end result is exactly the same as it would have been if they had said, well, you can send a bill for 25 cents to the end user.   David H. Souter  It hasn't decreed otherwise.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Isn't that the classic situation in which agencies are supposed to figure out what to do?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, as I understand it, it came to the conclusion not that they were not acting under 276, but that, in fact, the cause of action has to refer back to 201.   David H. Souter  May I focus your return to me?  Because I want to take up with where your answer to Justice Scalia left off.  As I understand it, you were saying that the rate in this case is unreasonable because the party or the person who is responsible for the use of the pay phone facilities is the person who's making the call, not the long distance carrier.  My question to you is, isn't that simply a choice of characterization?  Because another way of looking at it would be that the person who makes the call wants to use long distance facilities to get to the person he wants to talk to.  And, therefore, the long distance facility in every pay phone case is using the pay phone in order to get the customer to what the long distance facility provides.  Why then isn't it just as fair to characterize the use of the pay phone here as for the benefit of the carrier as for the benefit of the customer?  And if that is just as fair, doesn't that end the distinction that you drew with Justice Scalia saying that it is not fair in this case.   David H. Souter  My question is simply, you can say... one way of looking at this transaction is, it is the guy making the call who's using it.  Another way is to say the long distance facilities carrier is using it to get the call to the long distance facility.  If you look at it in way B, doesn't your argument for unreasonableness disappear?   David H. Souter  What difference does that make?  The use of the phone is of a value of 24 cents.  But the value of using the phone is a value not only to the caller, but to the long distance provider who couldn't provide anything to the caller without the pay phone?  Why isn't the alternative characterization just as easy, regardless of how they get to 24 cents?   David H. Souter  Excuse me, but aren't you arguing with the 24 cents, as opposed to creating an argument about what is the proper characterization of the transaction?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  The reason is that the store that rents the cell phone is getting rental income from the cell phone.  And in the case of the pay phone, the pay phone operator is going to get zero, unless there is some such scheme as this.   ",05-705X

It's not... the firearm issue is not going to the jury.  The firearm determination will be made by the judge.  If the State of Washington decides not to amend its law, we would have a situation in which, in effect, Apprendi is read out of the... the constitutional law simply by State procedure.  And in every case, the... the response would have to be harmless error analysis on your theory.  That is a pretty neat way to undercut Apprendi.  Is that not a good reason to say we shouldn't have harmless error analysis?   Patricia A. Millett  No, it's not, Justice Souter.  First of all, the Hughes opinion on which they rely is crystal clear that the only thing the court found was that there was no procedure to re empanel a jury on remand.  And I point the Court to page 208... that's a P. 3d citation and 149 in the Washington Reporter citation... where the court specifically said, we are only talking about remand and not deciding whether these things could ever be submitted to a jury in the first instance.

Millett  I think that's right, but even if it weren't, if... if you had some State that decided not to fix its law, in light of Apprendi and Blakely, I expect that what would happen is defendants would bring sort of... there would be a facial constitutionality problem with any attempt to prosecute under that.  And that may be the way to deal with it.  There's no question of willfulness here.  This is decided at a time when, in good faith, pre Apprendi even... this isn't even the Apprendi/Blakely window... that it was acceptable to have this sort of two tier proceedings much like we are used to in sort of a death penalty context.

It's not... they didn't have to put in further technical evidence.  An issue might have been raised.  I mean, your... the... the defendant might have come up and... and presented evidence to the effect that it was only a starter pistol, in which case, okay, there would be a real issue.  But in the absence of any reason to doubt that the handgun was what it purported to be, there would be no reason to... there would be no requirement of further evidence about functionality, would there be?

Is... is there a Washington case that requires that?   David H. Souter  And what exactly in the language is it that you hang your hat on?   David H. Souter  No... no question.  But if there... but if there is no reason to question its apparent functionality, I mean, you know, it's a handgun.  It looks like a handgun.

Souter  No.  But it's also the case, as I understand it, and as counsel on the other side confirmed a few moments ago, that the charge specifically specified that a handgun had been used.  So this is not a case, as I think you were suggesting, in which there has never been a charge of the offense plus the enhancement they now claim.  The... the problem was in the jury verdict, not in the charge, not in notice to the defendant.  And if that's the case, why isn't it just like Neder?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, a... a firearm, as I understand it, is defined to include a pistol or a revolver.  Is that correct?   David H. Souter  All right.  Isn't the natural reading of... or understanding of the word handgun that it's a pistol or a revolver?  I mean, isn't that what people would normally take it to mean?   David H. Souter  Yes, but you're asking for a... you're asking for a Federal constitutional ruling, and right now, if I understand you correctly, you're arguing that you ought to win because if you don't win, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, we would be condoning a verdict for an offense that was never charged.  But if, in fact, handgun is properly read, properly understood to mean a pistol or a revolver, and that's what a firearm... that's... that's what a firearm is... is defined to include under Washington law, then in fact the offense has been charged.  The enhancement has been charged.  And as a matter of Federal constitutional law, it seems to me that ought to be enough to bring it within Neder regardless of what the quirks of Washington law may be.   David H. Souter  And that's because it... it didn't go to the jury.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes.   David H. Souter  Right.   David H. Souter  Well, when you say it's not litigated, do you mean simply that nobody, none of the witnesses, none of the counsel in argument, disputed that a handgun was there?

Souter  And... and what do you... what do you base that statement on?  In other words, I...

If that's your argument, what is your basis for saying that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And if we accept... going back to our earlier exchange, if we accept the proposition that charging that he used a handgun was sufficient to charge a firearm, then the charge against him was assault in the second degree with the maximum enhancement for use of a firearm.

Souter  You... you and I may disagree on... on how to read... how to understand firearm, but if you read it the way I just suggested, then the charge was assault two with the maximum enhancement.

I thought the reason they conceded the Blakely violation was that in the instructions to the jury, the instruction only went to deadly weapon and the instruction did not specifically refer to firearm.

The point of the affirmative action case is that some criterion which otherwise would be the appropriate criterion of selection is being displaced by a racial mix criterion.  That is not what is happening here.  This is not an affirmative action case.  So why should the statements that have been made in these entirely different contexts necessarily decide this case?   David H. Souter  Let me help you out by taking you back to my question.  One of the characteristics of the affirmative action cases was the displacement of some other otherwise generally acknowledged relevant criterion such as ability as shown in test scores, grade point averages, things like that; and that was a characteristic of those cases.  It is not a characteristic of this case, as I understand it.   David H. Souter  Well, when you state Justice Scalia is right, you are assuming, I think as your brief assumes, that the definition of the benefit to be received here is the active choice, not the provision of an education.  Now the active choice may be of value.  I do not suggest that it is not.  Clearly the school district thinks it does or it wouldn't provide choice.  But it is not the entire benefit that is being provided, and the principal benefit is the education, not the choice of schools.  Isn't that correct?   David H.

INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You can't have it... you can't have it both ways.   David H. Souter  Mr. Bergeron, I have a basic conceptual problem, both with that response and with your larger argument.  Leaving aside how we should classify the reimbursement right or classify reimbursement, you make a broad distinction between the substantive right of the child to the free appropriate public education and on the other hand, the procedural rights of the parent in going through the process that ultimately comes to a conclusion for the child's benefit.  The conceptual problem I have is that I don't understand why it makes sense to say that the parents have procedural rights unless that procedural... or unless those procedural rights of the parents are in aid of some substantive entitlement for the parents.  We give procedural protection to people in order to vindicate some substantive interest that they can claim, and you're, in effect, splitting those two apart.  You're saying one person has a substantive right, the other people have procedural right.  And I don't see conceptually how you can make that split.  And if you don't make that split, then it only makes sense that the right to the free public... the free appropriate public education is, as the statute in one place seems to say, a right of the family group, the parents and the child together, rather than the right of the child alone.  So conceptually, how do you defend the distinction that you make between substantive rights on one person and procedural rights in another?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then why don't we say that they are the procedural rights of the child and the parents are simply stepping into the child's shoes to vindicate them?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I'm sorry.  You go ahead.   David H. Souter  Isn't that the problem?  On the analysis that you're coming up with, parents end up without even the procedural rights, because you're saying the only person who can basically invoke a violation of procedural right is the person whose been denied the substantive right.  The parent hasn't been denied the substantive right.  Therefore, the parent cannot invoke even the procedural right which ostensibly on your own analysis, the parent has been given.  That can't be correct.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but before you direct me to cases--   David H. Souter  --What's wrong with the analytical point that I just made?   David H. Souter  Yeah, but instead of saying they're not eclipsed, you're saying they are totally blocked out.  Because you analysis, I thought was, in response to my earlier objection, that the procedural right, in fact, can only ultimately be invoked for the vindication of the substantive right.  And because the substantive right is the child's, not the parents, it would follow that the parents cannot even invoke their procedural rights, and we know that that can't be correct.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But if the parent's procedural rights are not gone, then the parents must be able to invoke those procedural rights based on what they claim to be a denial of some substantive entitlement.  You're saying that's the entitlement of the child, but if the parents are going to have any procedural right worth having, they've got to invoke it for the purpose of vindicating that substantive right; isn't that correct?   David H. Souter  Okay.  Then why do not the parents, when they are claiming that they are aggrieved, have as much right to make a claim that goes to the substantive denial as to the procedural denial, simply because the two are inseparable?   ",05-983X
0,"David H. Souter  Yes, but your claim doesn't rest on a due process denial of hearing does it?  That's not, that's not the question you brought to us.  So it seems to me that Justice Ginsburg's question is not answered by saying, well, he'd get a hearing in that case.  The fact remains that in that case the, as I understand it, the judge in Chapter 13 could immediately deconvert to Chapter 7, couldn't he?   David H. Souter  But due process is not the issue here.  The fact is the bankruptcy court could deconvert or reconvert to Chapter 7, in effect, following the election that the debtor makes.  That's so, isn't it?   David H. Souter  Well then, why would we have a system as ridiculous as to preclude the court from looking at fraud or bad faith at the moment of election, go through the paperwork and the folderol of converting to 13, and immediately turn around, admittedly having the power, to deconvert?  That would be a rather foolish system.   David H. Souter  But they don't have to.   David H. Souter  And the deconversion could be done prior to the filing of the plan?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But your case as I understand it, your case does not turn on the question whether there was or was not, should or should not have been a hearing in this case, an evidentiary hearing in this case; is that correct?

1,"David H. Souter  Isn't the problem that the motion to quash is going to be made, if counsel is on his toes, is going to be made at the beginning of the trial?  And we want to induce the court to look very carefully at it at that point, because if the court is wrong, somebody has to go through an entire trial as a result of it.  And the way to induce the court to be very careful at the beginning is to say, this is not harmless error, and you've got to take this very seriously and you can't take any chance on the, in effect, the evidence saving you in harmless error analysis later.   David H. Souter  Well, I'm sure that's right.  But that simply reinforces my point.   David H. Souter  The trouble with your a fortiori argument it seems to me is this: If we accept your argument, then whenever a judge is asked to rule on a motion to quash, if the judge is in any doubt, the judge is going to be induced by your rule to deny the motion to quash and wait and see what happens at trial.  And if in fact they get to trial and they don't prove the element, then it can either be thrown out because an element has not been proven or he can go back and revive the motion to quash.  If on the other hand the Government gets its act together at that point and does put in evidence on the element, it's going to be harmless error.  And so the price of, it seems to me, of your rule is that someone will always be put to trial if there is any question about how the judge should rule on the motion to quash, whereas if we go the other way the judge will grant the motion to quash and the Government can go back to the grand jury and get another indictment.  It seems to me that something is seriously lost in that situation if we go your way.   David H. Souter  I'm sure they do grant them.  But I'm concerned about the, we'll say, the doubtful case or the judge who can't make up his mind.  Under your rule the price of that uncertainty is always going to be to subject somebody to trial.   David H. Souter  And it seems to me that the prejudice to the defendant in the two... as between the two situations simply is not comparable.  In Mechanik you had a situation in which two witnesses putting in whatever evidence they were putting in were in the jury room and, yes, one could influence the other, et cetera.  Here, we're talking about a situation in which it may very well be that the defendant should never be put to trial at all.  And your rule says if there's any question about it, put him to trial, judge.   David H. Souter  But Mr. Dreeben, isn't the point that the tremendous cost that you refer to is a tremendous cost that the Government pays by its choice to go to trial, as opposed to going back to the grand jury and making sure that it has an adequate indictment?   ",05-998X
0,"David H. Souter  But your point is not that there was any prejudice here.  Your point is that he was entitled to a grand jury?   David H. Souter  But why isn't your answer to Justice Stevens that in the case in which there is no allegation of an element at all there isn't a sufficient indictment to charge him for anything, whereas in the case of the variance on your theory, as I understand it, there is an indictment and the question is simply whether he was misled by the variance and prejudiced?   David H. Souter  So why isn't the answer is in one case there's an indictment, and in the other case there isn't?   David H. Souter  No, but why isn't your answer to him that in the case in which there is a variance you have an indictment; in the case that you're talking about there is none?  And the reason I press you on that is that I thought the essence of your case was that there is no indictment here, i.e., the grand jury function has not been performed and he is entitled to the grand jury function before he goes to trial.   David H. Souter  And if that is the nub of your position, then I would have thought your answer to Justice Stevens was what I suggested.  If that's not your answer to Justice Stevens, then I'm not sure that I understand your case.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What is the result of what went wrong?  How do you characterize the grand jury product in the case in which, as you put it, something goes wrong?   David H.

1,"David H. Souter  But your answer, as I understand it, to Justice Breyer's question was, could be boiled down to this: The person whose disability benefit or total benefit following disability is calculated on the basis of age 55, is less likely to have worked or is likely to have worked less long than the person whose benefit is imputed and calculated on the basis of 20 years.  And because the odds are that we'll say the person in the 55-year-old category has worked less and endured less risk, it is, therefore, fair to impute less time on average to such a person, and therefore, give a lower benefit.  You're saying there is a tradeoff.  And the tradeoff is because the 55-year-old retiree may get a benefit after very little work and very little risk, it is therefore fair and not a discrimination that on the average the windfall is less for that person by the imputation than the windfall to the person who retires on the basis of age 20.  Is that a fair statement of your argument?   David H. Souter  Okay.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That's... you're sticking in a word, ""arbitrary"", that appears nowhere in the body of the statute.  You picked it up from the preamble, and that's... and you're interpreting the statute with that.  And it isn't customary for this Court to take words that don't appear in the text of the statute and read them in, based on some statement of purpose or preamble.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1037
0,"David H. Souter  But he is saying one thing more.  He is saying it's also highly unlikely that the 55-year-old has worked as long subject to risk at the point at which the calculation is made than is the case with the person who retires on the basis of 20 years.  And so that there is a tradeoff.  And, therefore, you constantly analyze this as the kind of garden variety of discrimination based on age which Congress was aiming for.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes.  I didn't get it either.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  They are exactly the same people.  The only thing that distinguishes the one class, those who voluntarily do and those who are disabled, is happenstance; and the happenstance is disability in the line of service.   David H. Souter  The reason for that is that we accept the criterion at the outset that your pay bears some relationship to what you do.  We are now in a situation in which the benefit does not bear a relationship to what you are doing or going to do.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1037
1,"David H. Souter  No, but you're also arguing, as I understand it, that the... that the search, even in the case of the tax arrest, does fall within the rationale of search incident to an arrest because one of those two rationales is officer safety.  Isn't that your point?   David H. Souter  Okay.  So you reject the premise of the question then?  The premise of the question was that the search incident to the arrest in the tax case is outside the rationale of searches incident to an arrest; and your position is it's not outside it.   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  We would never know about it if the... if the misdemeanor, or jaywalking offense, was not committed in the officer's presence.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That's not a problem for you here, but that is a limitation on what we have held.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1082
0,"David H. Souter  But isn't... isn't the difficulty with that argument that we... we have rejected the, in effect, the trespass rationale; and what you're telling us now, it seems to me, based on in effect trespass concepts, is that so far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned an arrest may constitutionally be made, but the officer following that arrest may not take the step of determining whether the individual arrested has on his person anything that can be used to hurt the officer like a knife or a gun?  And why should be we draw what seems to me... if we scrap, as we have done, the trespass analogy, why should we make what seems to me at least an irrational distinction of saying the Fourth Amendment says it's okay to arrest but it's not okay to protect yourself after you have arrested?  Why should we accept such a rule?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Right.  But we're starting with a different premise.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  We're starting with a constitutional premise.   David H. Souter  If that... if that logic is sound and that logic depends on Justice Powell's use of the word unlawfully, then it seems to me the... the only way to arrest an irrational system would to be conclude that, in fact, the arrest is not constitutionally lawful.  Because on... on your logic, you're still left with the problem that I raised; and a constitutional arrest in which the officer does not violate the Fourth Amendment by apprehending the person, and yet the officer is disabled from protecting himself, if we're going to have a sensible rule, we've either got to say the Fourth Amendment allows him to make the search incident and protect himself, or we've got to have a rule that says the Fourth Amendment doesn't allow him to make the search... make the arrest in the first place.

1,"David H. Souter  Well, in this case if it was not a false exercise in Santos, why was it a false exercise here?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But it, it, it was still an exercise... it was an exercise in this case of the same authority that it was purporting to exercise in Santos, which you conceded.  And that is the authority to determine its own jurisdiction.  I presume that jurisdiction is determined on a case by case basis when a case has already been accepted by the Court, and as Justice Ginsburg said is sub judice.  So if there was, if there was jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction in Santos, I don't see why there wasn't likewise jurisdiction to determine it here.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Once the... once the Ninth Circuit determined that it had no longer a continuing jurisdiction to do anything more than it did, in the order that finally dismissed this, the other side wasn't bound to litigate that here.  All the other side is saying is that up to that point, the court was determining its own jurisdiction.  And therefore it is only when it determined that its jurisdiction no longer existed, that the filing period began to run.  So it seems to me that the crucial question is if it could determine its own jurisdiction in Santos which you concede, why can't it determine its own jurisdiction here?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Isn't that what it was doing?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why... why can't it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But those... those... are they... and you have got me here.  The argument here is that the, that the Ninth Circuit already had taken jurisdiction in this case.  It wasn't a question of whether to accept it or not.   David H. Souter  I--   David H. Souter  --I guess I'm still at a loss on the point that for one purpose, the purpose of the 90-day filing period, you're saying that the Ninth Circuit did not have jurisdiction; but for another purpose, the determination of whether it had jurisdiction, you're saying it does have jurisdiction.  Am I misunderstanding your argument?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I don't see how you can have it both ways.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Maybe I should say I don't know why this Court can have it both ways.  [Laughter]  Don't, don't we have to choose one analytical path or the other analytical path?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, why why does it do any more than the 35 percent value?  That sets a definite limit.   David H. Souter  Well, you say without any responsibility to the voters.  I mean, the voters are going to know that if the valuation is changed and the tax rate isn't, their taxes are going up.  So I assume the voters are going to be vigilant to what is going on and I assume they have telephones and they'll call their representatives.  Why is this... why do you posit this sort of failure of representative democracy?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But if the tax rate is changed, they're going to call twice.   INTERRUPTING David H.

0,"David H. Souter  Well, that may be.  But Congress passed a statute that grants a statutory right to file a motion to reopen no matter what the relief is.  And the thing that seems strange to me, I guess to carry Justice Scalia's question one step further, is what seems strange to me is that Congress would have granted that right in effect across the board, regardless of what the reason for the reopening might be and yet would have done so knowing that the, that the time for adjudication before the IJ is likely to take longer than the period of the, prior to the moment of required departure.  It sounds as though Congress on your view would be... would have been giving a right to reopen that in practical terms in most cases will avail the alien absolutely nothing because he'll have to get out before there can be an adjudication.   David H. Souter  Why?   David H. Souter  Okay, but isn't the question in this case whether what Congress did was as modest as you say?  Because if it is as modest as you say, then in at least a substantial category of cases in which a motion to reopen will be filed, it will in fact be no time in the real world to act on that motion before the voluntary departure date.  And the question is did Congress really intend a right to reopen that is as modest as that.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And it seems strange that it would have.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, it was... was the regulation... was the current regulation in place at the time of the '96 Act, that the... that the departure of the alien, whatever the term is, waives the motion to--   David H. Souter  --So, we assume that Congress knew that.   David H. Souter  Okay, then Congress knew at the time of the '96 Act that, if in fact the motion to reopen was filed in the normal course, it probably couldn't be heard prior to the date at which (a) the alien either will overstay and be in trouble for that or (b) will have departed and, under the existing regulatory regime, have forfeited his right to reopen.  And it's the strangeness that Congress would want... would have wanted to extend the right to reopen to a statutory level under these circumstances unless it contemplated some kind of a tolling scheme that would avoid this sort of Kafka-esque result.   David H. Souter  Yes, but you can't get to court if you haven't been to the BIA, right?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And, again, we are talking about a short period of time, like 30 days.  In practical terms there's no way he is going to get through the BIA in 30 days.  And, therefore, when he leaves the country, he cannot then try to get or complete his BIA review, and he therefore will have no chance to get into court, right?   David H. Souter  There's no reason to assume that you could.   David H.

Souter  Okay.  We got that straight.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Is there any reason he could not unilaterally relinquish the voluntary departure status as distinct from having to get approval from the Board or bureaucrat?   David H. Souter  Well, I know it doesn't... it doesn't address the issue, and my question is--   David H. Souter  --Why?   David H. Souter  No, but the Board is saying, look, I'm granting your request... we are granting your request for a voluntary departure status and there are certain consequences that that status carries.  He is saying, on my hypothesis, I relinquish that status.  Why are conditions that attach when he has the status an indication that he cannot voluntarily relinquish that status without further action by the Board?   ",06-1181
0,"David H. Souter  Well, let me ask a slightly different question from Justice Scalia's.  Is it the position of the Philippine Government that there are any assets in the estate that the Philippine Government does not claim?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Enough assets to satisfy the claims of the individuals who... who brought suit in the United States?   David H. Souter  So the position of the Philippines, going back to Justice Ginsburg's question, was we have no objection and in fact I think it was we support the litigation in the United States, but when it comes time to collect a judgment we're claiming they don't get a penny because everything belongs to us.  Is that a fair summary of the Philippines' position?   David H. Souter  Well, they weren't just suing to condemn the regime.  They weren't asking for a declaratory judgment.  They were asking for a judgment in money.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but we live in a practical world and if in fact there were no apparent assets that might satisfy that judgment that the Philippine Government did not claim, then their... then their support of the... of the earlier litigation was at the very least in tension with their... with their overall position.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then why doesn't the Republic take the position that, because that was vetoed for reasons apart from the Republic's discretion, that the current assets would be an appropriate source of payment?   David H. Souter  Well, it's been doing it on a fairly sporadic basis.  If I remember the facts correctly, first it got a stay with respect to the disposition of assets, and then the stay expired and the government didn't do anything about it, and then the government didn't come into action again until this particular claim was raised.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Maybe... let me put the... sort of my response in the form of a question.  In drawing or refusing to draw the conclusion of ""indispensable party"", do you claim that a court may or may not consider the equitable or inequitable behavior of the government?   David H. Souter  Well, maybe--   David H. Souter  --Well, maybe they have been have been candid about their claims, but they... in real-world practical terms, the claim to these assets and the representation at the same time that it's appropriate for these people to proceed in the United States for a money judgment, are at least in some tension with each other, aren't they?

INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Wait a minute.  I missed your last step.  If it's an in rem proceeding against the share certificates what... what difference does it make whether they ever belonged to the Philippines?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So you're saying an in rem proceeding against the certificates simply will not resolve the issue; that's the... that's the guts of the answer.   David H. Souter  But may I ask you this question, though.  Merrill Lynch refused in the year 2000, but if the proceeding that Justice Breyer has just been describing takes place and there is a judgment to the effect that the share certificates are properly held or the property of the Philippine Government, and the Philippine Government now makes, or then, makes a new request to Merrill Lynch, the fact that they made a request that was refused in 2000, which may be too late to sue on, isn't going to prevent them from suing on their present adjudication that they are the true owners of the share certificates and want the money.   David H. Souter  Okay.  You're saying... I think you're saying that the demand would be ineffectual this time for the same reason it was ineffectual the last time.   David H. Souter  And the suggestion I thought that Justice Breyer had made and that I made was this time they can do something further.  They can take the judgment and go into a United States court and say: We've got this judgment, there's no question that these shares and what they represent are ours; so make Merrill Lynch give us the money.  What prevents them from doing that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  May I go back on exactly that point on the equity to Justice Breyer's last question?  I thought you had given or anticipated his question in something you said a moment ago, and then you didn't repeat it, and I may have misunderstood you.  I thought you had told us that the courts of the Philippines did not recognize, for enforcement purposes there, the judgment that your clients had obtained in the United States, and that in effect they, therefore, if they were going to make a claim on assets in the Philippines, they would have to start from scratch again.  Is that correct?  Did I misunderstand you?   David H. Souter  Let me ask you this: Did the Philippine Government formally take a position in raising these obstructive barriers, the $8 million filing fee, for example?   David H. Souter  Okay.

INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I don't want to... I don't want to emphasize my question, before we get the--   David H.

If we've got three and there's a question, two are accounted for as discriminatory, and the question is the third, we don't have a nexus.  Is that the way you're doing the math?   David H.

I don't have my notes in front of me, but I think my recollection is right on this.  It struck me that the admissible evidence that was indicated by the offer of proof boils down basically to this: There were three employees who would testify that, following their dismissal, some or all of their work was done by a younger person.   David H. Souter  There was one employee who would testify that he received... she saw a spreadsheet in front of one supervisor that indicated age.  There was one employee who would testify that her immediate supervisor had made age-discriminatory remarks.  And another employee would testify that her supervisor's boss had made age-discriminatory remarks.  Now, basically, out of this company of 70,000, that seems to be the sum total of the... the kind of circumstantial evidence of culture that you presented in the offer of proof.  Am I selling your offer of proof short here?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Let's assume the testimony at least shows these points that you and I agreed the offer of proof offers to prove.  They're going to be met... I think it's reasonable to suppose, they're going to be met by counter-evidence.   David H. Souter  We're going to have litigation on these points, and they're going to take... in effect, become subsidiary chapters in this trial.  And what concerns me, I guess, is that, at the end of the day, it's... it strikes me as though there is reason to believe that the proof itself is not going to be anything close to overwhelming.  We will have had a potentially confusing trial on this subsidiary third-party evidence.  And we seem to be very close, if we have not gotten over the line, of the subsidiary evidence, in effect, being substantially misleading or prejudicial.  And... and basically I'm raising a question of weight under 403.  What's your response to that?   INTERRUPTING David H.

Wyeth could have done that at any time, and it simply didn't do it.  And the -- the reason I raise this is because it could have done it at any time, where, going back to Justice Kennedy's first question, where is the conflict?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But as I understand it, Wyeth's argument is not this argument.  Wyeth is not saying the reason there is a conflict here is that we tried to give the kind of warning that the Vermont jury, in effect, says we should have given and the FDA didn't allow us to do it, so that, in fact, there is a conflict between a specific rejection by the FDA of the Vermont rule and the rule that the Vermont jury applied.   David H. Souter  As I understand it, Wyeth's argument is: Whatever is on the label, in fact, is the standard of conflict.  It doesn't matter whether we tried or could have tried or didn't try.  You simply look at the label and you look at what the Vermont jury did; and if there is a -- if there is a difference between them, there is a conflict.  Am I right about your argument?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, is it -- is it strict liability or negligence?  In other words, are they saying you must have done so, or are they saying because you could have done so and didn't you did not conform to the standard of care?   ",06-1249
1,"David H. Souter  With respect to the obligation in this case, may I go back to an earlier question that Justice Scalia asked you?  And I -- I -- if you responded to this particular point, I didn't get it.  He said that he understood that Wyeth had in fact asked the FDA to modify the label, at least to strengthen the warning against IV push, and that request was -- was denied, so that in fact that -- that created the conflict.  What is your response to -- to the factual basis for that -- for that comment?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, regardless of what their, their semantic label was, was there a request at least to -- to beef up the warning against using IV push?  And if so, did the -- did the FDA reject it and say no, you can't do that.   David H. Souter  What would it--   David H. Souter  --What would it have said?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But you -- you also, to be clear on it, as I understand it, you do not accept the position that the FDA puts forward, that the obligation depends upon the accrual of new information.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Any information, new or old, as I understand it, on your argument raises this obligation to -- to act.   David H. Souter  But getting to Justice Scalia's point, as I understand your answer to an earlier question, on the day that the FDA approves the label, if there is no further information indicating danger, then any liability that is based upon what the -- the kind of information that the FDA knew would be pre-empted.  The only time -- you're saying pre-emption does not occur when there is -- forget the word FDA was told, whether it's 1,000 years old or discovered yesterday; and if there is liability predicated on further information beyond what the FDA was told, then there is not pre-emption.  Is that a fair statement of your position?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay, but if -- if the so-called misbranding is determined to be misbranding, based upon information which was given to the FDA, as I understand your position, you would admit that there was pre-emption.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  So there--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --In other words, there is that one exception at least to the broad statement that you gave in answer to Justice Scalia?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But the -- but the misbranding is of no consequence to liability.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  In other words, I think you're saying if there -- if there would be pre-emption it may be misbranded, but there cannot be any recovery in a State tort suit.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  So misbranding under those circumstances is a purely theoretical concept.   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  Well, is your argument that they couldn't have considered these comparative risks, because if they had, they would have come out differently; because they didn't come out differently, we have to infer that they didn't consider it?

1,"David H. Souter  Yes, but it's the individual who has to file the 1040.  What the trustee is filing is the 1041.  And... and why do you place... I was going to ask the same question that Justice Alito did, and that is why do you place so much significance either in the label, i.e., it's fiduciary return, or in the peculiar fact that it is a fiduciary who is filing that return?  It's a tax return and... and I think your... the government's argument is that with respect to... to other items that may be disputed, you should regard them at a fairly general level, i.e., investment advice, not fiduciary investment advice.  But when you come to the tax return, you don't regard it as a general... at a general level; you regard it at a very specific level, i.e., a fiduciary tax return.  It seems to me that the government with respect to the tax return is doing exactly what it criticizes the taxpayer for doing with respect to investment advice.  And I don't understand the distinction.   David H. Souter  Well, it's the only tax return that the fiduciary has to file; isn't that correct?  The fiduciary files that tax return and the beneficiary files a 1040.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But the only return the fiduciary's filing is the 1041; isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay; I understand that that is a factual difference, but I don't understand what it is that makes that a difference in principle.   David H. Souter  Well, can't you ask it... can't... can't you ask this question pointing towards something unique: If the individual investor does a very poor job of managing his investments, all he can ultimately do is cry about it.  But if the trustee does a very poor job, the trustee is going to get sued.  So that when the trustee asks for an investment advisor's advice, the trustee is addressing an issue that the individual does not have.  The trustee wants to be covered.  He also, I presume, wants to be a good trustee.  But he is in fact doing something which is, to use your phrase, in addition to what the individual investor would do.  He is looking out for somebody else and he is looking out for himself if the investment goes south.  Why isn't that a sufficient difference that is at least comparable to the difference that you talk about in the filing of a fiduciary tax return?   David H. Souter  Yes, but whether... whether he gets socked with damages or not is going to depend in part whether he is covered by an investment advisor's bit of advice; and that is... that is a different item in the calculus of liability.  He is providing for something that the individual investor does not provide for or need to provide for.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1286

0,"David H. Souter  How can you call it a passive investment, not only when there was... I think undisputedly... as... as much interest and activity in Nexis's business planning by the Mead people?  But to my mind even more importantly, when in fact Mead, I think a couple of times, merged with... with Nexis... with Lexis... when that provided a tax advantage, by... by giving them loss carryforwards that reduced their taxes.  Why isn't it fair to... to say under the operational function test that if... if the company is... if Nexis is... is mergeable with Mead when it produces a tax advantage and is certainly in a very operational sense functional then, because it's saving them a lot of money... and that's, that has nothing to do with passive investment.  If it's usable in a merger scenario there, it ought when the... when the tide turns be... be regarded as close enough in operational function to be taxable when the gain comes in.   David H. Souter  That's... that's right.  But weren't the enrichment cases in which income was being generated by an investment?  The investor, of course, was the... was the taxpayer company, and it simply reaped the benefits of a profitable investment.  That's something very different from merging corporations, then unmerging them, and then merging them again to provide not merely enrichment, but great tax savings; and if they are operationally close enough to produce great tax savings, why shouldn't they be treated as operationally close enough when in fact they... they produce a capital gain?

Assume, also, as you suggested in a hypo, that Lexis was doing business in Illinois.  So that at least a... a portion of its own activity could be taxed in Illinois.  And assume, third, that the relationship between Mead and Lexis is simply one of passive investment.  Mead simply bought a lot of stock, maybe 100 percent of the stock at the right time; and, otherwise, it kept hands off.  And at this point Mead now... now sells.  On... on your theory, would... would the State of Illinois be able to tax a portion of the capital gain?   David H.

1,"David H. Souter  Isn't the remedy for the finding of market manipulation the abrogation of the contract, which is a separate process from, from the revocation of market based tariff?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  The same reason may support each, but--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --Maybe I think I led us into this, Mr. Kneedler.  The situation that I was positing was a situation in which the power marketer had engaged in market manipulation in the context of which, at the time of which, it made this contract.  And my suggestion to you, which I think you took, was that in a situation like that there would be a basis for public interest review and abrogation of this contract because of the market manipulation in fact.  And the market manipulation would also be a reason to say market power had been acquired.  It had not been mitigated, and hence, the market based tariff authority would also be revoked.  And that was the, that was the limit of my question.  And I take it your answer there is it could do each of those things?   David H. Souter  No, but I guess this is what's bothering us.  Your point does not seem, at least to me, to be a modest point, because if I understand where you're going, you're saying that in a market with the degree of volatility of this one at the time these contracts were made, no contract is enforceable.  It will last only so long as... as one party does not complain about a disadvantage, and the minute it does, it's back in front of FERC.  And the argument is being made that in fact a market based rate cannot be enforced through contract because the very premise... i.e., what you call and what was called a competitive... Judge Ginsburg called a competitive market... was absent.  Isn't that the consequence of what you're arguing?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, how do we know when we're only in the second worst?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, but I mean the problem is--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --And I don't see any... and I realize that you're giving me limiting principles to what seems to me in effect a general rule that says no contracts are enforceable, if they are made during periods of market volatility, however sensible they may be given the premise of that volatility.  And your first proposal for a limiting principle is this is the worst of times, and I don't see how that's going to help because somebody is always going to claim, well, these times are... are almost as bad.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Look--   David H. Souter  --That's a good... I mean that's a fine general phrase, but the question is, is it possible to make an enforceable contract under these circumstances?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I haven't heard a limiting principle yet.  You have three others.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Did these... did... did the Petitioners here... do you claim that the Petitioners here were guilty of failure to report?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That's... that's a different issue.  That... that may be that the Commission was derelict in... in having a nonstatutory condition.  But did these... did these Petitioners... do you claim, is it a basis for your claim before FERC, that these Petitioners failed to follow the reporting requirements that were in effect?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That's what I thought.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay, but here I just want to make sure I understand.  You're saying one... one limiting principle is the re examination of contract might be limited or at least only prompted by a... a failure to follow reporting requirements.  I can understand that and that offhand seems to me perfectly fair.  It may not cover this case, but I can understand that.  What are your other two reasons?   David H. Souter  Okay, but that seems to me consistent with the problem that I have with your argument.  And that is, if you make a contract in a period of high volatility, and it seems reasonable to the two parties to come up with a rate that is certainly a higher rate than anybody would come up with if they were going through cost plus return ratemaking, the contract is vulnerable.  And it seems to me that Commissioner Massey's argument is consistent with the conclusion that all those contracts are vulnerable.  So I don't see that as any limiting principle.  What's your fourth one?   David H. Souter  Okay, I can understand... under your fourth point, I could understand the position if the argument were this is above $74, and therefore it is suspect; but the claim you're making, as I understand it, is a much broader claim.  You're saying the entire contract ought to be abrogated in the public interest, not merely above 74 but below 74.  Isn't that correct?   David H. Souter  And when you get there, you're saying abrogate this contract.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Are you saying... have you at any point said reduce the rates to $74?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I will... I will stop the cross examination, but I just wanted to get the four points.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You were saying that the most... the most reasonable thing for us to do was to enter into a long term contract in order to mitigate the effects of the chaotic spot market.  You understood that.   David H. Souter  Mr. Wright, may I go back to your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question?  She asked you: What do you want FERC to do if it does what you want them to do?  And you said: We want them to make the same kind of adjustments ex post that they made to the spot prices.  Isn't there one big difference here to... between readjusting spot prices and rewriting or abrogating a contract like this?  In the case of adjusting the spot prices, in effect.  What they are saying is: Somebody isn't going to make the killing that he thought he was making.  It was... a spot price indicates it was a snap decision.  People were reacting to... to changes in the market from hour to hour.  And the Commission is going to go back and say, you know, you're out of luck on the killing you thought you made.  When, on the other hand, the Commission, in effect, rewrites or abrogates a contract, it is saying something very different.  It is saying: You may not engage in long term reliance on the agreements that you make.  And isn't that a huge difference?   David H. Souter  Yes, but with respect, doesn't that, in effect, mean... going back to your answer to Justice Ginsburg... that what you really want is to say there wasn't effective competition.  There wasn't effective competition because the market was chaotic.  And, therefore, in a chaotic market, including this one, a long term contract which later turns out to be disadvantageous to one side is unenforceable.  Isn't that what you... your real answer to Justice Ginsburg is.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but I mean... that's where I don't think that, at least with me, helps your argument.  We all know that there is a broad umbrella standard of justness and reasonableness.  One index of justness is the set of conditions under which the parties operate.  The conditions in this case were conditions of chaos.  And what the other side is saying, I think, is: We each tried to make the most reasonable deal we could, the most advantageous for us that we could, under these conditions of chaos.  They certainly produced a rate that wouldn't have been produced in a calm time either by market based tariffs or by cost plus return ratemaking.  But under the circumstances that we did operate in, this is what it produced.  And we were dealing at arm's length.  Nobody was engaging in fraud, et cetera.  So that's just.  And I think when you say, as you did a minute ago, there is an overarching obligation or standard of justness and reasonableness, I think you're saying that that reasoning that I just tried to outline is not sufficient reasoning for sustaining the contract.  Now, if I'm wrong, tell me.  If I'm right, it seems to me you're really saying ditch the contracts if they were entered into in a period of high volatility.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Are you entitled to relief if there was manipulation, but these people were not engaging in the manipulation?  In other words, they are, in effect, innocent of the manipulation; but they, as sellers, are in a chaotic market.  Are you entitled to relief against them under those circumstances?   David H. Souter  The trouble is that justness is a relational category, and you are... I think you are saying we don't have to consider justness to the parties who were doing... we will assume for the sake of the question... the best that they could under bad circumstances.  You are saying justness only goes to the ultimate retail ratepayer.   David H. Souter  Aren't you really arguing... no, but aren't you really making the argument that the notion of justness does have an equitable component that looks to the source of the trouble; and if the source of the chaos in the market are the very people who are trying to make a profit on your contract, that is a reason to say that that market based rate is not a just one, because they created the conditions that gave them the leverage to get you to make the deal that you made?  But if they are not guilty of improper conduct in making it, then, you know, everybody has to take his lumps.  Aren't you saying something like that?   David H. Souter  No, but just as a general premise, in your answer to Justice Scalia weren't you assuming something like that?   David H. Souter  And, to the extent that you make that argument, that's an answer, sort of, to the question that I put to you a couple of times: Why, why isn't your argument anything less broad than the fact that you can't make a contract in a chaotic market?  And you are, at least as a subset of what you are saying, telling us that if the contract... if the chaos in the market was caused by the impropriety of one contracting party, that party should not profit from it.  And I understand that answer.  That if... to the extent that that is your position, it is an answer to my question.   David H. Souter  But I think... and here I want to be clear on this... you're saying they were not just and reasonable on the date they were made, number one, if the market manipulation that caused the chaos was manipulation by these Petitioners.  That at least is part of your argument.  But I think you're also saying that the rates were not just and reasonable if they were the result of market manipulation by others, not these Petitioners.  Am I correct that your argument is broad enough to encompass the second alternative?   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H.

1,"David H. Souter  May I ask you a question which is going to come up sooner or later?  And it's kind of a threshold question.  So, if I may, let me interrupt you with it now.  You emphasize the significance of the limiting condition ""with respect to the stock"".  But before you get to that phrase, Section 301 refers to a distribution by the corporation.  And my question is this: Let's assume that we... we accept your... your position that the circuit was wrong in requiring an offer of proof of intent to return capital.  Isn't it also the case that you would still have an obligation, if you're going to take advantage of this section, to offer some evidence with respect to the fact that there was a corporate distribution involved?  And as I understand it, your evidence is or the Government's evidence and yours is that, you know, there was skimming, there was misdirection, et cetera, but there was no indication, there's no evidence that there was any distribution, in the normal sense of that word, by a corporation.  So it seems to me that if you... if you win the case in the sense of convincing us that the circuit was wrong with respect to the specific intent requirement, you would still be left without a defense because you have not come forward with any evidence that indicates a distribution.  Am I wrong?   David H. Souter  I thought you were going to say that.   David H. Souter  Well, it certainly can be, and there's no question about that, but isn't there some point of informality or some point, I guess, of formality or relevance to corporate practice that has to be reached?  In other words, he may keep lousy books, he may be very sloppy, but directing funds to one's girlfriend is not the act of a corporation.  And it seems to me that the kind of... of actions that he took to get or to direct the payment of moneys could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be regarded as an act of this corporation or of any corporation.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, in this case, he's a 50 percent owner, as I understand it.  He formed the corporation, but isn't 50 percent of the stock owned by the trust for the love child of him and the girlfriend?   David H. Souter  Well, it may be that he cannot embezzle in the sense of committing a separate private act or even a separate, a separate tort that the corporation could object to.  But the question still remains... excuse me... whether the act of, of taking the money in this unorthodox way could be regarded as a corporate act within the meaning of the term ""distribution"".  And I think I understand your point, but I guess the only point that I'm making is the fact that it may not qualify as embezzlement, civilly or criminally, does not necessarily answer the objection that I'm raising.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That explains why I'm making the argument and the Government wasn't in its brief?   David H. Souter  Well am I... am I right that all he would have to do in order to satisfy that burden would be this: He would have the option, which I gather he availed himself of, to show that, in fact, the... the funds were loans or non-income to him.  And he would also have had the option to follow that by putting on the corporate accountant saying: This guy is a stockholder.  It's what the corporate books show.  In fact, that's not in dispute.  No. 2, the corporation didn't have any profits that year.  No. 3, if the money was diverted, if the money was corporate funds, the only thing left under 301 is to treat it as a return of capital.  And if, in fact, the funds exceeded his basis, to treat it as a capital gain.  So all he had to do, in effect, to make the proffer, as I understand it, is to say: If you don't believe me that this was non-income like a loan, then all I have to do is to put in the evidence that the corporation didn't have any... any profits that year, and Section 301 will take care of the rest of it.  Because you have to conclude that it's either a return of capital or a capital gain.  Is that fair?  Is that correct?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But doesn't... doesn't he suffice, on a going forward burden, simply to show that he is a stockholder?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I mean I agree with Justice Scalia, but doesn't he make it at least to the point of putting the Government to its proof by showing that he is a stockholder?   David H. Souter  Yes.   ",06-1509
0,"David H. Souter  Well, aren't you... aren't you saying not that the... that the test of intent that the Ninth Circuit used is, in itself, a sufficient test; but that, rather... and correct me if I'm wrong, because I thought this was the basis really of your argument.  I thought the Government, in effect, was saying in order to treat it as a return of capital, it is a necessary condition that it be intended to be treated as a return of capital.  But that is not a sufficient condition, because if, in fact, it turns out, as in Justice Breyer's example, that there are no earnings, then under 301 it can't be treated as... as a dividend.  And only then, under 301, would it be treated as a return of capital.  So the conditions are, No. 1 necessary intent; No. 2, a determination at the end of the year that, in fact, there were no earnings.  Conversely, if at the end of the year there are profits, even though the first necessary condition, intent, was satisfied, under 301 that would not be enough; and the Government would treat it as income.  Isn't that the nub of your position?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well I... let me... I just want to get clear on how you understand it.  I gave you one alternative in which you defend the Ninth Circuit.  Justice Scalia has given you another alternative in which you don't defend the Ninth Circuit.  Which... which are you going to take?   David H. Souter  Yes, but why talk about that at all?  I mean, on Justice Breyer's third and simplest example, he is basically saying let Section 301 make the determination, in effect, at the end of the year, when we know what the actual situation of the corporation is.  If you wait and see, 301 takes care of it, and you don't have to get into the... sort of the metaphysics of intent.   David H. Souter  Yes.  Distribution with... distribution with respect to stock.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And I think he was assuming and I'm assuming that... that that condition is met.  But, in order to meet that condition, you don't have to have a specific intent that the... on the part of the corporation that the distribution either be a return of capital or that the distribution either be a dividend.  It simply has to be a distribution to this guy because he is a stockholder.   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  It's income to him.  You would be taking a different position if you thought you could attribute it to the corporation and tax the corporation, too.   David H. Souter  Right.  And if you want to go after the corporation, you are specifically going to take the position in this guy's case that, in fact, it was income to the corporation.  If there is no income to the corporation, then you don't care, and that's the situation you're in here.   David H. Souter  But it was not profits; it was not taxable income.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It was not taxable income.   David H. Souter  I think maybe he was simply getting at the fact that under 301, assuming the possibilities of non-301 treatment are excluded, under 301 it will be treated either as a dividend or as a return of capital, depending on the corporate books for that year, and he wasn't making a proffer at that point precisely as to what those corporate books would show, but he was making a proffer that, under 301, it would either be classified as a dividend or as a return of capital.  And wasn't that enough to... to get him... get him the right to introduce the evidence?   ",06-1509

If you start with the Madisonian view, there should be no distinction of the two cases that Justice Scalia puts.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but let's talk about establishing... maybe this is what you're going to do, establishing religion by spending the threepence.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And in this case, when you build the church, you're spending the threepence whether... whether a... a Government employee is laying the bricks or a contract... an outside contractor is laying the bricks or a third party institution to which a grant has been made is laying the bricks.

1,"David H. Souter  Do you believe, as I understood you to suggest a moment ago, that you could prove causation if the statement ""It is terrible"" or ""Sexual harassment is terrible"" had been uttered in effect in the abstract without reference to particular behavior or a charge of particular behavior on the part of a co-worker or an employer?  In other words, if A says ""Sexual harassment is terrible"" and elsewhere in the company sexual harassment is going on and A is then fired, would it be your view that A would at least state a claim if A said, I had expressed disapproval of sexual harassment, it turns out there was sexual harassment being gone -- taking place elsewhere; and I was fired for that reason.  Would that at least state a claim that would get a harassment case into court?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What I'm getting at, doesn't the statement ""It's terrible"" or whatever the opposition may be have to be made in relation to some specific activity?   David H. Souter  Then what is the limit?  It seems to me you've got a cause of action in effect under the statute that would be virtually unlimited.  Anybody who thinks sexual harassment is bad and later gets fired can claim retaliation under the statute if it turns out just as a matter of good luck that somebody was being sexually harassed unbeknownst to the speaker.

0,"David H. Souter  You mean if she had made complaints after she had answered the questions in -- and given the information at issue here, that would convert her prior statements into opposition?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I'm asking you.  You're in effect saying there has got to be some kind of what you call active opposition; and I took it from what you said a moment ago that if she had given the evidence in question here, and then in the period, subsequent period of two months, made some sort of complaint, that that complaint would have qualified her original evidence as opposition.  Is that your position?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You're taking about--   David H. Souter  --If the -- if the employee in response to the inquiry that's being made says yes, I saw my employer do ""X"" and it happened -- and I think it's terrible, that is certainly specific to the act.   David H. Souter  But the reason -- but the reason it doesn't cross the line is you are, in effect, saying that ""oppose"" within the meaning of the statute has got to be read more narrowly than the -- than the notion of oppose as we commonly use that word in common speech.  And I don't know why -- I don't know what your -- what your authority is for saying that ""oppose"" was not used in its commonsense everyday connotation.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But in my hypothetical, we're not talking about a general sense.  In my hypothetical we were talking about a reference to a very specific act.  So the generality problem doesn't arise.  And yet despite the specificity, you say, and despite the fact that in common speech a -- a specific statement like that would be taken as opposition, you say it shouldn't be under the statute.  And the statute doesn't have any definition that narrows it.  Common speech wouldn't narrow it your way.  Why should it be narrowed your way?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, you say it's not made mandatory.  Any employer who doesn't go through it is crazy.  And I don't see how this Court, having imposed in practical terms the requirement that Justice Ginsburg just described, can then say, oh, but we're going to construe this indefinite term of ""investigation"" to exclude this kind of employer activity which our construction of the statute has virtually mandated.  So that if in fact the employer's investigation succeeds in ending the problem and there is no EEOC complaint, those who participated in the investigation are absolutely helpless against retaliation.  That would be a bizarre way to interpret a -- a statute in which we have any -- any opportunity to interpret ""investigation"" to include this kind of investigation.  What do you say to that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  But I'm -- I'm giving you an argument as to why we should construe it to elevate it, and -- and the argument is that we, in effect, in what I think were correct decisions -- you agree, you said a moment ago, were correct decisions -- have in practical terms mandated this kind of an inquiry.  Why then would it be reasonable for us, if we have any option in construing the term ""investigation"", to construe it to exclude this kind of investigation and exclude coverage of the people who under our decisions are supposed to come forward and -- and answer questions?  Why would that be a reasonable construction?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, why isn't it -- why isn't an investigation by the employer an ""investigation""?  That's the language of the statute.   David H. Souter  And instead they would substitute the -- the response to an EEOC investigation in which they would not have the leg to stand on in opposing respondeat superior.  I suppose that would be an inducement for them to go ahead with the investigation; wouldn't you?   David H. Souter  By the way, I take it in -- in this case, although this is not the issue before us, that if you -- if you lose on the issues before us, it is still your position that ultimately you should win this case, because you have good evidence, you say in your briefs, to indicate that the reason for firing had nothing to do with retaliation.  That's true, isn't it?   ",06-1595

Souter  Mr. Shanmugam, I take it that your response to Justice Ginsburg's question would basically be your response to the argument that the other side makes, that on your theory a State misdemeanor can be treated for purposes of the act as... or a conviction for a State misdemeanor can, with the recidivism enhancement, be treated as a felony?   David H. Souter  But if they continue to use just the State terminology such that they continue to use the word ""misdemeanor"" with respect to an offense, which with the enhancement carries more than a one-year penalty, then the two-year provision, the two-year threshold provision, kicks in?   David H. Souter  Yes.   David H. Souter  May I ask you one question before you sit down?  You mentioned a moment ago what you saw as the anomaly in the counter-argument, the anomaly being that someone with the recidivism enhancement could end up with a ten-year sentence when the maximum for the offense is five years.  But isn't... isn't the answer to that just as... as the answer that you gave to Justice Scalia a moment ago, and that is simply that the statute speaks in terms of ""offense"" so that there is... there is no anomaly in getting a ten-year sentence for something which for this purpose carries a maximum of five?

Because it's not that anyone is suggesting here, I think, that under the Endangered Species Act the Federal Government can keep control or that the Federal Government can in effect provide guarantees of what may happen in response to some future development proposal.  What I think they're arguing is that when, when, when the agency gives the approval, it should require that there be some kind of procedure in place on the part of the State so that when problems arise the States will probably respond to them with the same values in mind that the feds would.

David H. Souter  No, but would you answer my question first?  Isn't it likely that the States are going to respond or deal with the problem if they have an obligation in the memorandum of agreement right up front?  I suppose.  But let me, let me, let me explain what is in place.  EPA's regulations require that a State furnish its draft permits to the public, but also specifically to the Federal wildlife agencies.  That gives Fish and Wildlife Service an opportunity to comment about endangered species concerns that may be raised by the draft permit.  The regulations also require the State agency to take into account the comments that are submitted by anyone, including the Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA.  Those provisions built in allow the Federal agencies to bring their concerns to the State agency, and I think there is every reason to believe that the State agencies will--  --Is there an obligation on the part of the State agency to take reasonable action in response to them, or can the State agency simply sit there, listen with a tin ear and then do whatever it wants to?

Neither of them is particularly satisfactory, but neither answer gives you a reason to ignore the problem.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, but by that very reasoning you could say that if assurance are required that the Endangered Species Act is going to be honored, that does not in and of itself prevent any development program.

Souter  No.  The standard of discretion is the same for the poor and the rich, isn't it?  The only difference is that the poor can get into court and the rich cannot.   David H.

0,"David H. Souter  Counsel, may I ask you one thing, which I have assumed, and I think it is correct, but I'd like to be sure of it.  Is it the case, is it correct, that prior to the voir dire questions, no one had given a statement to the venire people of what the law was with respect to the imposition of the death penalty; is that correct?   David H. Souter  Were they told what the... I forget how many factors are enumerated under the Washington law?  Were they told what they were?   David H. Souter  Okay.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I take it your position is that if the State courts had made or had expressed no conclusion other than the final conclusion that he is impaired, that that conclusion itself would be entitled to AEDPA deference if the record could be read to support it; is that correct?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  If that's the case, then AEDPA deference is more than deference, isn't it?  AEDPA deference has reached on your view the conclusion that if there is any factual support in a record, the ultimate conclusion of the court will be upheld, whereas I thought AEDPA deference went to factfinding and to express conclusions that the court drew.   David H. Souter  But the trial judge made no conclusion about demeanor.  He didn't say anything about demeanor, did he?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  If we're going to get... that takes... it seems to me it takes deference yet one further step.  We're saying that even if there is nothing on the record about demeanor, we are supposed to assume that a trial judge drew a conclusion based on demeanor.  I mean, that is not deference.  I mean, that's simply imputing fiction.   David H. Souter  Why is it the defense counsel's obligation to object?  It seems to me that if the State is objecting, saying I want this juror removed, and the trial judge is saying, okay, I will remove him, that there is an obligation to make a record.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Wouldn't there be?  I guess my point is if there isn't, then in effect you are making the defendant responsible for creating a record to support what the other side asks for.   David H. Souter  But that means that the, that the argument for sustaining the trial judge's action on the ground that the trial judge could observe demeanor in effect is the elimination of judicial review on that subject, because we know that if the venire person was present in the courtroom and the judge was present in the courtroom, the judge probably looked at him, and if that is enough to sustain judicial action on the grounds that we defer to demeanor then there's no judicial review at all.  I think that's what Judge Kozinski said.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I'm talking about demeanor.  And there's nothing as I understand it on the record about demeanor.   David H. Souter  And if there is no requirement that there be anything on the record about demeanor, then there is no judicial review on that point at all, is there?   David H. Souter  And the question--   David H. Souter  --Is there any way that he can show that demeanor didn't make a difference when the record is absolutely silent on demeanor?  Is there any way he can show that?   David H. Souter  Is there anything in this record to indicate that the judge did rely on demeanor?   Michael R. Dreeben  What is... no.  There's nothing explicit.  But this Court has said over and over again that there does not have to be because in this case, in particular, since there was no objection, the judge did not elaborate on his reasons at all.  But the Court has gone further in Witt and in Darden and building on cases like Patton versus Yount, and made clear that it is implicit in a judge's action in response to an objection that he has relied on the totality of the law and his observations.  And here there were two instances during the defense colloquy in which the juror specifically said that his example of when the death penalty is appropriate is a circumstance when somebody is incorrigible and will reoffend if released.  And then three times during the prosecution's voir dire, he volunteered, first of all, that it would have to be in my mind very obvious that the person would reoffend.  And this was a particularly significant answer because it wasn't given in response to a death penalty question, it was given in response to whether he could apply the reasonable doubt standard to the crime.  He again comes back to the reoffend notion after having State law explained to him again, and said, could you consider imposing the death penalty, he said I have to give that some thought.   David H. Souter  But he had not been given, as I understand it, the explanation of what the... I keep saying nine factors.  Whatever the enumerated State factors were.  He had not been told that at any point, had he?   Michael R. Dreeben  No, but I think the important point, Justice Souter, is that under Washington law there were really two alternatives, life without parole or death.   David H. Souter  Yeah, but the... the questioning was what grounds are you going to look to make that decision; and he had not been instructed on Washington law on that at all.   Michael R. Dreeben  The concern that I think the prosecutor had and that the judge accepted is that this juror's vision of when capital punishment is appropriate is when somebody will get out and kill again.  And under that analysis, you would never impose capital punishment under Washington law, because the defendant is never going to get--   ",06-413X

David H. Souter  But you're saying--   David H. Souter  --But as I understand your argument, it is the difference between aiding and abetting liability on the part of the Respondents and liability as, in effect, as first line principles, is their intent, or at the very least in knowledge that they were committing a deceptive act as part of this--  scheme.

Souter  Well, do you--   David H. Souter  --Would you answer my question first?  Do you take the position that there can be no 10(b) liability without a statement addressed to investors?   David H. Souter  You mean the statement as such or a statement which could not have been made but for the statements of the Respondents must be communicated to the investors?  Which one?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So are you... so you are saying that there can be no causation and hence, you know... and I think you're going further.  You're saying--  there can be no liability within the description of 10(b) unless there is a statement directly addressed to the investors, is that correct?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well what about in this--  case?  Let's be specific.  As I understood an earlier answer of yours, the answer was that Arthur Andersen knew what was going on.  If I've... if you are... and as I understand it, that's not what was charged... but if that's correct, Arthur Andersen did know what was going on.

Souter  But--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --What if Arthur Andersen--   David H. Souter  --What if Arthur Andersen has a footnote in there saying, this is okay because we have--  this... this letter from I forget which one of the two Respondents it was, saying there's been inflation and therefore we've got to renegotiate the prices and jack them up 20 percent, Arthur Andersen knows that that is false and the Respondent who made it knows that it is false, can the Respondent who made it then be held liable?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but doesn't--   David H. Souter  --Yes, but doesn't... doesn't the Respondent in that case know that it is likely that the auditor is going to indicate the basis for its statement, that the transaction is okay--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --and, therefore, isn't it reasonable to suppose that they anticipated that their statement would be communicated to the market?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But there's a communication to the market there--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --and there's a reason to expect that communication.   David H. Souter  Doesn't that make any difference?   David H. Souter  Is the word ""only"" in there?   David H. Souter  Is the word ""only"" in there?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  In the statute?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So you have an independent defense quite apart from... from the construction of 10b-5?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Let's assume there is reliance and loss causation.  Let me ask a question very similar to what Justice Ginsburg has posed a couple of times.  She has said is there a third category.  My question is, is there an overlap?  Can there be an overlap?   David H. Souter  Why?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Congress intended an expert agency to address solely aiding-and-abetting cases.  My question is if there is an overlap... A, can there be an overlap?  And if so, I don't see why Congress's intent to reserve aiding-and-abetting alone to the agency affects the determination of this case.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  For example, for example, let's assume in this case that Charter said we've, we've got to let the investors know that our cost of doing business is going up, and we want to you make an announcement that you're jacking up your price 20 percent.  In that case there would be primary liability.   David H. Souter  Why in that case is there not also aiding-and-abetting?  We know perfectly well why they are doing it, and they are doing it solely to aid and abet Charter in its scheme themselves enjoying a wash transaction.  Why isn't that both primary and aiding-and-abetting?   David H. Souter  We know it's primary.  Why isn't it also aiding-and-abetting?   David H. Souter  If you can call it, why isn't there the kind of overlap which raises the question that Justice Ginsburg has raised?   David H. Souter  So you are saying there can be an overlap but there is no overlap that helps the Petitioner in this case?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Has the SEC publicly taken a position on that question?   ",06-43XX
0,"David H. Souter  But isn't that answering the wrong question?  I'll be candid with you.  I'm not sure that whatever Morales-Travelers distinction there is really counts here, because the issue here is different from the issue in some of the... in most of the preemption cases, because the issue here starts with the, I think, the agreed assumption that Congress wanted to end a certain category of regulation.  And the question is would Congress have wanted, in effect, to permit a degree of State regulation when it was for a particular purpose?  And the question then is not whether Congress intended or had as an object when it passed this statute an interference with the State's regulation of juvenile contraband.  The question is whether it intended to permit any regulation with respect to delivery services to survive; and isn't that the tough question that you've got to face?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That's because most regulation, you know, has an economic purpose involved.  But the ultimate object, it seems to me, was to end the economic effects of State patchwork transportation regulation.  And therefore I think the question you've got to address is why would they have allowed a certain category of regulation that clearly affects the way these companies perform their services to survive solely on the ground that the regulation was entailed at the State level by the State's choice to go against youthful tobacco use?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But the Synar... I don't have it in front of me, but the Synar Amendment refers to... to a number of objects of State legislation that would be required, but it doesn't say anything about regulating transportation.   David H. Souter  Right.  And we don't normally think of a delivery service as a distributor of goods.  I mean, we... in the sense, I think, that the statute meant.  I... I read the Synar Amendment reference to distributors as being wholesalers, people within the industry who get the cigarettes from, you know, the manufacturing point to the corner store, as opposed simply to a delivery service that delivers all kinds of goods.   David H. Souter  They concede that they can do it beyond the requirement, beyond the force of the statute that precludes the knowing distribution.  In other words, they... they're not appealing the one provision of subsection D that makes it a crime knowingly to get the tobacco into the hands of minors and so on, but do they concede anything beyond that?   David H. Souter  Well, you prove it without a presumption to start with.  That's what the... that's way the issue was left by the district court.   David H. Souter  Mr. Stern, when you say that it takes one second to... I forget whether you said scan or... or examine a label, do you... are you describing simply the physical act of a human being looking at the label?   David H. Souter  You can't tell unless you have an extraordinary memory for all the names on the Attorney General's list.  You can't do that simply by looking at the label.  And I... I thought maybe what you meant by the one second was that the list was... was in a computer, and you had a mechanical device that scanned the... the name on the label and... and it either matched something in the computer, or it didn't.  But I take it you are talking about physical, visual inspection.   David H. Souter  No, I... I just wanted to know what you meant by the ""one second"".  I take it what you mean is there is a physical, visual inspection of the label.  And in that one second, in practical terms, the person looking can tell whether the name is on the Attorney General's list, because there will be some tipoff in the... in the name of the company that... that will alert him?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  But--   David H. Souter  --If someone on the unapproved list wants to... for whatever reason, wants to avoid a tipoff term like incorporating the term ""tobacco"" on to their label, then the person making the one-second inspection is not going to pick it up.  And the only way the company is going to be able to protect itself against the imputed knowledge is either by a visual inspection of the Attorney General's list to see whether it matches what the person is looking at or by some computer scan, right?

David H. Souter  We do have empirical evidence, though, don't we, that the decision of this case is going to be very significant in the sort of battle between Wal-Mart and the Main Street stores; and why should this Court in effect take a shot in the dark at resolving that, as distinct from leaving it to Congress, which is in a position to know more about where the shot is going to land than we are?   David H. Souter  That's my point.

You're arguing for, in effect, an... an ultimate conclusion that excludes innocent conduct.  And aren't you asking for more than just what Matsushita did at... at that later stage?   David H. Souter  But... but Matsushita as I recall did not require it to rise beyond the level of a plausible inference.  And I think you're arguing for something stronger than that.

And if inference is to tie... is, is a term that is tied to what is alleged, then I don't see any... any contradiction between reading those allegations most favorably, but saying the statute in each statute requires that the... that the total force of the inference rise to the level of strength that you speak of.

I think this is of record; you correct me if I'm wrong.  what do we make of that in light of the fact that I believe it is in the record that I forget the appropriate State official said, well, it's true we've let you do this in the past, but this is political or this looks political, which suggests that there was a content basis going on?  What do we make of the court's statement and the record statement by the official in deciding whether there really was in effect a separate kind of order involved in the preliminary injunction from the order that was denied at the end of the case?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Oh, I know that.  I know that.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Because that's why I asked, what do we make of the court's statement subsequently?   David H.

So they're, I'm not sure that it would have been expected to be reinjected into the case.   David H. Souter  So it wasn't moot after the demonstration.   David H. Souter  Okay, but the argument is undercut, as you yourself say, by the settlement rule.  Don't we have the settlement rule simply because we want to promote settlements?  We don't want litigation to go on and on and on simply because somebody wants to establish a right to attorney's fees.  And doesn't that same reasoning apply here when there is a preliminary injunction and that's all the person wants.  By the same reasoning that we accept a settlement, why shouldn't we accept a preliminary injunction as being a sufficient determination of rights to justify fees because we don't want it to go on and on and on when nobody has any issue of substance involved, but is just litigating for the sake of establishing a right to fees later?   Patricia A. Millett  I have three answers to that.  First of all, there are two parties here.  The defendant has a right not to be assessed attorney's fees, which are a form of final relief not interim relief, without a final decision that they violated on the merits.   David H. Souter  But the only attorney's fees that would be assessed would be attorney's fees attributable to the preliminary injunction.   Patricia A. Millett  That's right, but they have a right not to pay anything if they haven't done anything wrong.   David H. Souter  They have been found subject to a preliminary injunction.  The playing field is no longer even.   Patricia A.

And there's not even always a substantial likelihood--   David H.

Millett  Well, the test is the prevailing party, not the substantially likely to prevail party.  And the other reason--   David H. Souter  Then let's not have it in the settlement case.   Patricia A.

Souter  I realize, before you leave that I realize that on a jurisdictional issue like that we have an obligation to raise it ourselves.  But I'm... I'm... I'm curious, was... was jurisdiction contested in that case?   David H. Souter  Wouldn't they get into... no, you.   David H. Souter  Well why doesn't it matter who the defendant is?  Because I don't, this so-called office of Senator Mark Dayton is a construct that I understand, and there is no immunity problem there.  But if, if that office is gone now and getting to your hypothesis, if the, if... if the true party is the Senate of the United States, has there been any unequivocal waiver of immunity with respect to the entire Senator or the Senate of the United States as an institution?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I'm Justice Souter.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You're very flattering.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but I was just going to say if this case continues we've got to accept the proposition that the Office of Senator Mark Dayton is still a, some kind of an entity that has got to be accorded reality by the judiciary, right.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And how do we do it?  I mean, you've said... I don't want to go too far with a metaphor, but you spoke a moment ago of there being sort of a, what did you say, a hole or a space in the legislative sphere when somebody is fired.  In the sphere at the moment is totally empty.  The Senator's gone.  Everybody knows that this, this office of Senator Mark Dayton is a totally fictional construct.  And in reality, as you point out, the money is going to come out of the Senate or some Senate fund.  If we allow this to go forward, we've got to face the reality that it's the Senate which is the defendant and there hasn't been a waiver of immunity.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but at this point that's silly.  There's no Senator.  There's no office in any sense.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Is it unequivocal?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I mean, when it's done on the basis of this fiction, is that what we should accept as an unequivocal waiver?   ",06-618X
1,"David H. Souter  Yes, but what if the Senator doesn't want to put it in?  I mean, what if he does not want to waive the privilege?  Is his only choice in effect to sit moot and lose the case?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  ""Mute"" I guess I should have said.   David H. Souter  Yes.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, why don't, why doesn't that... why doesn't being placed in that dilemma in effect implicate the clause, and why can't he invoke the clause as a basis for dismissal?   David H. Souter  Well, yes, so far as the member's immediate financial concern, they took care of it.  But I'm not sure about the careful way.  They in effect said, you know, if this gets into Speech or Debate Clause issues they prevail.  And that kind of just leaves us with no solution for the problem that Justice Stevens raised and that I'm concerning with, unless there's, there's going to be an automatic dismissal when the member says, look, I cannot respond to this without getting into, into acts within the legislative process which are privileged.  Unless you want to recognize that as kind of an absolute defense upon its invocation, I don't see how we get out of the problem.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And there's no jurisdiction under 412 because?   ",06-618X
1,"David H. Souter  Doesn't that raise, in effect, sort of a distinction between Carbone and United Haulers?  Or at least one way of understanding the distinction between those two cases?  In Carbone the facility, in fact, was not the facility of the government.   David H. Souter  Here the, the immediate beneficiary of the bonds is, in Justice Alito's hypo, is a private entity?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But... correct me if I'm wrong, just a matter of fact.  I thought in most instances the immediate beneficiary would be a private entity who, in effect, was enabled to borrow at a lower rate?   David H. Souter  So don't you have to take... therefore, if you're going to answer Justice Alito as you did, don't you have to take the position that Carbone really is not good law and the Carbone/United Haulers distinction is not a... is simply not a relevant distinction?  As a dissenter in Carbone, I naturally do not find that the worst answer you could give.  [Laughter]  But don't you have to give that answer?   ",06-666X
0,"David H. Souter  But in that case, the only thing the State was doing was taxing.  Here in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, in the case we've got, the State is also participating in a bond market.   David H. Souter  Why do we draw that line?  I mean, you... a moment ago you were talking about the... the realities of subsidy.  Why don't we confront the realities of... of the fact that the State's participation in the bond market and the... and the tax exemption go together hand in hand?  It's unrealistic to divide them.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So what?  The economic reality is precisely the same.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Not constitutionally, we have said, in cases in which the State is not acting purely as the regulator.  Here the State is not acting purely as the regulator.  The State has a dual capacity, and you say ignore one side of that capacity for the other; and my question is why?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but it's not taxing an out-of-State commodity in the sense of a commodity which is manufactured or produced out-of-State.   David H. Souter  In which case the State was not a participant, but the State is here.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  Please.   David H. Souter  And this situation is somewhere in between the two.  Because although we do not have what in form is a subsidy, we have what in economic reality is a subsidy for the benefit of the State's own activity as a bond issuer.  So the question again is, why do we accept your characterization that this case should be treated exactly as if the State were acting merely in a regulatory capacity?   David H. Souter  And the whole purpose of... of the combined effect of market participant for the... acting for the purpose of providing an essentially governmental service is to give the State a free hand.  Why do we ignore that in your argument in favor simply of the regulatory side?   David H. Souter  But the question is whether it will be treated as we treat a facially discriminatory tax when there is no market participation, there is no State participation for the purpose of providing a fundamental governmental service.  If... if in fact there is a good reason to treat them differently, then we don't follow the... the facial discrimination test.  Let me... let me ask a... a question with that as the premise.  Assuming... and I obviously do assume... that we have a choice of analysis here, one good reason to choose the analysis that your brother has... that the State is forwarding is the fact that we have historically a bond market which has grown up since New York issued the first tax-exempt or... a bond.   David H. Souter  And we have an enormous market, the effect of interrupting which we really, as a Court, cannot tell very much.  And that seems to me a very good reason to give the nod to the... to the market participant, the essential services side of what the State is doing, as opposed to the regulatory side, and simply confront the thing under Pike.  Why isn't that a good reason?   INTERRUPTING ",06-666X
0,"David H. Souter  Well what if an individual received actual child pornography in the mail that had not been solicited.  And he calls the chief of police in town and says I just opened my mail, and this envelope is full of child porn.  And he's right.  I mean, there are no body doubles.  This is the real thing in here.  He has presented child pornography to that chief of police and he's violated the statute, hasn't he?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You say no, but you say no because we won't enforce it that way.  But the... but the objective component and the subjective component in my example are both satisfied.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That's... that's fine, but before you get to that point, you have... there's still an indictable offense.  You don't prevent... you don't present affirmative defenses until you're already indicted.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But the ban on possession is not the real problem because, under a normal possession statute, you would indeed have a problem not merely in terms of... that could be raised not merely by affirmative defense but as an element of the statute.  If the possession is merely a matter of happenstance, there's an intent problem and presumably there's no... there's no offense.  There's no knowing offense in acquiring material for the possession.  But in the pandering statute, what we've got here is there is... as you put it earlier, there is an understanding which happens to be correct, objectively correct, that there is child porn, and there is a very clear intent to convey that message by way of presenting this material to a third party, in this case the police.  So I think this is not merely comparable to the problem of haphazard possession.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But how would you do it in the case... you mentioned that if there is not actual child porn shown, and there is a truthful or honest statement about it, that there is nothing to worry about.  But what about the movie reviewer who is reviewing the latest re-release or something of the ""Lolita"" film and says this depicts sexual activity with a minor?  That statement is true.  It would be taken by some naive people as saying boy, this is what it shows, the real thing.  That is a truthful statement.  And yet, it would still fall within the prohibition of the statute.  As I understand your position, the only way that statement would be truthful in a way that would excuse would be if the reviewer said this depicts sexual activity with a minor, but of course the actor wasn't really a minor.  Isn't that correct?   David H. Souter  What if you are 17 years old and you haven't gone to law school and you haven't read these cases?  You may very well assume that.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Wouldn't we use... wouldn't we use a reasonable personal of the sort who goes to movies?   INTERRUPTING David H.

1,"David H. Souter  No, but isn't the problem the problem of your answer to Justice Breyer's hypothetical.  He said, you know, what if we have this appendix and we list... I forget what he said, three dozen examples that the Solicitor General says wouldn't be covered and that sounds fine to us.  Your answer was well, there would still be some examples not covered.  But isn't... isn't the answer to that that there would be some conceivable overbreadth, I suppose, no matter what the appendix said?  Somewhere out there there would be an example not covered that would be the basis for an as-applied challenge, but there wouldn't be substantial overbreadth.  And isn't that the case?  That if Justice Breyer's hypo were in fact the decision of this case, there wouldn't be a fair argument that there is any substantial overbreadth left to the statute, isn't that so?   David H. Souter  But isn't the answer to that you may still have some overbreadth left, but it's not substantial?  Most 17 year olds are, in fact, going to realize that the real thing is not going on in, you know, the Lolita movie.  And if we accept that as a factual proposition, which was the Solicitor General's answer, and if we also accept, not by way of appendix but way of rationale in the opinion, that these various activities have got to be given an essentially commercial or quasi-commercial character, so that they don't pick up the conversations with the neighbor, then that's simply a matter of statutory interpretation that could be part of our rationale.  If we accept the factual proposition about what reasonable viewers are likely to know, and we engage in that kind of interpretation following the Solicitor General's view of how this serial list of activities should be construed, don't we eliminate the possibility... wouldn't we eliminate the possibility of substantial overbreadth?  Some things may get by.  There may still be legitimate applied challenges, but substantial overbreadth, would that be left?   INTERRUPTING David H.

1,"David H. Souter  General, as I understand it the parties are now free to come up with any scheme they want to for selecting an official candidate.   David H. Souter  Let's assume the Democratic Party decides to have a State convention.  If the law in Washington provided that the nominee selected by that convention could state on the ballot not merely a preference for Democrats, but a statement that, I am the nominee of the Democratic Party, your position in this case I take it would be exactly the same.   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  Do you know any Democrats who go around saying I prefer the Democratic Party who do not regard themselves and register themselves as Democrats?  I mean, in the real world I don't know that... I don't know whether this is fatal to your case, but in the real world, it seems to me the distinction you're drawing is simply not drawn.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It's helpful to your case, but, going back to my question, do you know any people who go around saying, well, you know, I really prefer the Democrats; I'm a Republican myself?  I mean that, that doesn't happen.   David H. Souter  There's always one.  But seriously, as a systemic matter, do you really think that's... that's a distinction that anyone would recognize?   David H. Souter  No, but that isn't responsive to my question.  Do you really think that that distinction is a distinction which is accepted as a working way of thinking in this world?   David H. Souter  You really do?   David H. Souter  But it means that they... they will prefer the candidate of one party or another, assuming they vote and there's no independent candidate running.  But it seems to me that the very declaration, the very assumption of status as an independent says, I don't as a systemic matter prefer one party to the other; a pox on both their houses.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It could.  But do you really think, again, in the real world, that that's why people register themselves as independents?   David H. Souter  Well, however the statement is made.   David H. Souter  But may not claim that on the ballot itself?   ",06-713X
0,"David H. Souter  What do you... what do you say about the fact that you have a right to select and designate an official candidate and it's independent of this ballot procedures?   David H. Souter  Okay.  If the rationale in Jones was that the defect was that the association, political association, was being adulterated by the method of, of the use of ballots, to select what was an official nominee, that problem does not exist here.   David H. Souter  You're saying in practical terms, this is a nomination, even though there may be a separate official nomination that nobody pays attention to?   David H. Souter  Then why is one party going to the trouble of establishing a convention system to make nominations?   David H. Souter  Well, they will pay no attention, I take it, in the sense that there will be nothing indicating an official nomination on the ballot itself.  But as I... I am also assuming that the parties through a convention, or whatever other scheme they can come up with, can... can designate an official nominee quite independently of this ballot.  And if they do so designate, they can campaign on that person's behalf.  The person in campaigning can say, I am the official nominee of the X party.  And those facts are true, aren't they?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You're saying that a right to nominate has to be a right to exclude everyone from the ballot except the nominee... everyone from the ballot under that banner, from the nominee.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You... you have identified... in the course of your argument, you've identified two separate problems with the... with the scheme as you see it.  One is, as you put it, that it masks the identity of an official nominee, and the other is that it in effect allows competition on the ballot by a person under the same party banner with the official nominee.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Right.   David H. Souter  I... I... no, I understand that to be your position, but my question is, and I realize there is a certain awkwardness to this, but we... we've got to face it: If the masking of the identity of the candidate is the real flaw, then the... the hypothetical that was included in the... in Jones, in the dictum, of the... of the party that... of the ballot that has no party identification whatsoever, that would equally be bad, wouldn't it?   David H. Souter  But if it's the masking that's the problem, the... the nominee is going to be just as well masked on the ballot or better masked on the ballot that allows no statement of preference at all.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And... and I'm not saying that that's fatally your case, but I mean it's... it's something we need to be careful about when we're doing our thinking, and that's why I'm pressing you on it.   David H. Souter  But if... but if it's just masking in a partisan system, then it seems to me you're making the same argument that you make when you say, by allowing statements of preference, we obscure the character of the official nominee and in effect allow somebody to have a... a second shot at... at getting Republican support as a Republican.  It seems to me that if it's masking in a partisan ballot that's the real problem, there's only one objection and the objection is not so much the masking as it is the submergence of the official nomination by allowing competition under the party's name by another candidate.  Isn't that fair to say?   INTERRUPTING ",06-713X

0,"David H. Souter  What do you say to the argument from drafting history that looks at the history both of little n and little o and it points out that as originally, in the original bill, little o providing for the actual damages required a finding of gross negligence?  Little n used the word ""willful"" just as it does now, suggesting that willful would not include gross negligence or something close to gross negligence like recklessness.  Then in, then in o, they changed the standard from gross negligence to mere negligence, but they made no change in n, which suggests that n stayed whatever it always was, and if the argument from contrast was that n probably meant knowing rather than reckless, it stayed knowing even when the standard was changed to negligence in o.  What do you say to that argument?   David H. Souter  But the fact that they had originally drafted n as it is, in contrast to the original o, does tell us, doesn't it, something about what they had in mind in n.  And they must have had something in mind, probably had in mind, something in n which was a standard higher than gross negligence.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, I mean, there's no question it has been and that is sort of the usual reading in the civil context.  But we also keep repeating, you know, ""willful"" is a word of many meanings and you always look to the context.  And here the argument is that if you look to the context of the, of the two statutory sections right up next to each other, you can draw a, an inference about what ""willful"" means.   David H. Souter  They're making this argument, and I think you got close to it a minute ago when you alluded to statutory purpose.  I think this is what's behind, and you tell me if I'm wrong.  One purpose of the statute is to alert a consumer that the consumer's credit report may contain errors which are doing the consumer some kind of damage.   David H. Souter  And you want this consumer alerted so the consumer can ask to see the report and correct it if possible.   David H. Souter  Reading the adverse action the way you read it, it would give the consumer or consumers a tip-off in the maximum number of cases.  In every case in which the consumer might have done better if the credit report had assumed different facts, on your reading theoretically, the consumer is going to say I want to look at that report and correct it if it's wrong.  But isn't the fallacy of that argument the fallacy of saying because that is one object of the statute, every term within the statute has got to be read in a way that maximizes the effectuation of that object?  And the trouble that we're having on the bench is that discrimination and increase are different terms.  Increase says the rate actually goes up from a baseline that the consumer previously had, whereas discrimination does not.  And your reading in effect, increase to mean discrimination in order to maximize the likelihood that the consumer will look at the report, isn't that the basis of your argument?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, that's a way to give every conceivable effect to that policy.  But the statute in drafting adverse, or drafting the terms of adverse action, may very well have said we don't want to give every conceivable effect to this purpose because if we do, we'll get into the situation that Justice Breyer described.  Everybody will be getting notices and the notices will be meaningless.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  To set the charge.  I mean, that's circular.  To set the charge that it gives you.   David H. Souter  Why do we... how do we know that they were intended to be protected in this way by getting this notice?  That's the issue in the case.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  So that's--   David H. Souter  --Your basic argument is the statute, the definitions of adverse action have got to be read in a way that maximizes the occasion upon which a consumer will get a notice that may lead that consumer to ask to see his credit report.  That's your basic premise?   David H. Souter  All right.   INTERRUPTING ",06-84XX

0,"David H. Souter  Well, that is an oddity but what do you say to Mr. Roberts' argument that the only recovery under (a)(1)(B) is against the plan, and the plan doesn't have the money in the account so that if there is going to be any relief it's got to come from the fiduciary and that gets you into (2).   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay, but we've got to assume at this point that we've... we've got a... a Section (2) claim before us and the argument simply is, is that in effect to be disallowed because it should have been an (a)(1)(B) claim?  And the argument that the United States has made, the argument that the other side has made is, we cannot get to any money under (a)(1)(B).  We've got to get that from the fiduciary and we can only do that under (2).   David H. Souter  Well, the argument of the United States is you can't rob Peter to pay Paul, so that if in fact his account didn't have the money, the plan didn't have any place to get the money, and the only way the money could be had would have been from a fiduciary, which again gets you to subsection (2).   David H. Souter  Okay.  But it seems to me you're answering a different question in that response.  The argument here is basically an argument between the possibility... an argument based on the claim that under (a)(1)(B) you can't go against the fiduciary.  The only way you can get the money is from a fiduciary and therefore (a)(1)(B) would have been of no value to you.  Do you... do you take issue with that premise?   David H. Souter  Okay, then doesn't that leave you in the position of having to say that you've either got to bring the claim under (a)(1)(B), or you've got... subsection (2)... or you've got to bring it under subsection (3)?   David H. Souter  And the answer, if the premise you have just agreed to is correct, will be,  ""you bet. ""  ""He is entitled to have another $150,000 in his account for the benefit of future payments to him. ""   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  ""But we haven't got the money and we can't rob Peter to pay Paul and therefore we are very sorry, go away. ""  That would necessarily be the answer.   David H. Souter  But that's going to the... it seems to... with respect, I think that's going to the merits.  And the question is, if you can recover against anybody, the claim is, the argument is you're going to get nowhere under (a)(1)(B) because the plan can't help you by itself.  The only way you can get any value from your lawsuit is by going against the fiduciary.  Maybe you have good reasons to defend that, but if you're going to have a suit against anyone, it's got to be under subsection (2).   David H. Souter  And they're saying they are careful and interrelated provisions mean that you got to go under subsection (2).   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And you're I think saying, we... we agree with you that ultimately (1)(B) couldn't get you any relief because the fiduciary... the plan doesn't have any money.  And you're now arguing, well, if you go against the fiduciary, ultimately we have a good defense to that.  But the fact is, the question before us is whom do you sue and under what... under what section?  And I think your own logic forces you to say that... that has got to be subsection (2).   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, it hasn't been reached yet, has it?   David H. Souter  No, but you're arguing that ultimately he couldn't prove damages.  We're talking about allegations at the pleading stage.  Let me ask you a slightly different question.  You said there's no... there's no, as Justice Scalia put it, there's no slush fund; there's no pooled assets here.  All the assets are assets which are accounted for, attributable to, individual accounts.  Therefore there can be no... there can be no loss to the plan which is not a loss to an individual account, can there be?   David H. Souter  Then what is your theory on how we determine whether a loss to the plan from an individual account suffices as a loss to the plan for purposes of pleading?  Has it got to be, you know, 500 losses out of 1000?  I don't see why that should make a difference.  I'm going back to Justice Breyer's question.   David H. Souter  No, but why doesn't the--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --There's something I'm not understanding about your argument.  When you say the nature of the fiduciary breach pleaded is what makes the difference, I am understanding you to be answering the question whether on the merits ultimately there will be a... they will be able to make out a claim.  And I am saying, as I said once before, that that seems to me a question that comes after you answer the question before us.  And the question before us is not whether ultimately you've stated a winning claim, but whether ultimately... whether right now you have stated a claim for a loss to the plan.  Now, that is not your view.  Why is it that I am taking your answer to be an answer on the merits to a different question and you're saying my answer, i.e., nature of duty breached or... is one that goes to the question of pleading at this stage?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  If you do that in two accounts is that enough?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why not one?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  If it... if it is the... and I still don't get this, but if it is the nature of the particular dereliction in duty that counts, why do we need more than one?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It's an individualistic kind of breach when it is viewed as... as only one account, but it is a breach against the plan when it is understood that there is nothing to the plan except an aggregation of accounts.  You can't have a breach against one without a breach against the plan.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then why, if that is your answer, why does it matter what the nature of the dereliction is?  Because you're... you're saying the... the really important question is the nature of the dereliction.  If it is, then I don't see why the multiple of the number of accounts affected has anything to do with it.   INTERRUPTING David H.

And I can think of reasons that might result in concluding that, in fact, this was a decision that had been made against the interest of the insured because the person making the decision itself had an interest in it.  I'm not sure which way to go, but I now take into consideration the fact that there was this conflicting interest in the person or the organization that made the decision, and for that reason, I am going to... I'm going to break the tie, and I'm going to conclude that the conflict was to the disadvantage of the insured.  I'm going to rule against the company.  I understood that you said that would be a proper application of Firestone.  Is that still your answer?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, why wouldn't it be?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  In my hypothetical, I've taken into--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --factors that say the company was right, factors that say the company is wrong.  I'm not sure which.  They seem evenly balanced to me, until I take into consideration the fact that there was conflicting interest, and I say that's enough to tip it.  And it does tip it, and I rule against the company.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And am I right or wrong under Firestone?   David H. Souter  That may be, but what's the answer to my question?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Am I right or wrong?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That is not going to--   INTERRUPTING David H.

1,"David H. Souter  Mr.... Mr. Rosenkranz.  I think you set up basically three different kinds of scenarios.  And I want to set... I want to put them into my own words and... and have you tell me whether I understand your... your point correctly.  Scenario number one is the case... in each of these scenarios, we have the same relationship between the... in effect, the trustee and... and the beneficiary that we have here.  There... there is a... there is a built-in conflict.  We don't know what its effect is.  In scenario number one, the... the evidence is that the person making the benefits decision says let's let this person suffer so that we can keep the money.  That is the easy case.  Scenario number two--   David H. Souter  --That's right, the... the e-mail shows up.  In... in case number two, there... there is what you referred to as a decision within the zone of reasonableness, but instead of being sort of in the core of the center of the zone of reasonableness, it's close to the edge.  A decisionmaker could look at that decision and say if there is no reason to be suspicious about it, it's still within the zone of reasonableness, and I don't think there is a conflict.  But if the decisionmaker knows that there is this kind of structural conflict, the decisionmaker can say look, I wasn't born yesterday; the reason it's so close to the edge is that they were giving way to their own self-interest in the conflict, and I'm going to decide for the beneficiary and against the company.  Case number three is the case of the person right on the fence, the decisionmaker.  The decisionmaker says, I've... I've looked at everything there is to look at and I cannot decide for sure what this is, whether it was a legitimate decision or a conflicted one in the... in the decisionmaker's favor, unless I take into consideration the fact that there is this structural conflict.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No the decisionmaker is the person who made the beneficiary... the benefits decision.  And if I take into consideration the structural conflict, that gives the decision to the beneficiary and against the company.  Now, in case number two, it's close but the... but the fact of the conflict is regarded as, itself, as substantive evidence and it... it results in a decision for the beneficiary.  In case number three, the evidence is in equipoise, and to get off equipoise, the conflict rule is taken as the tiebreaker.  My understanding is that your view is the proper way to consider the conflict under Firestone is, as I did in my hypo, in both case number two and case number three.  Am I correct?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  In other words, when we take... it is taken as substantive evidence to... to get us out of the zone of reasonableness in case number two.  It breaks the tie in case number three.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But... but the record has the structural context.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  But in my hypothetical you weren't at the center of the zone of reasonable; you were close to the edge.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Number three Honor we can't make up our mind.   David H. Souter  That's right.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So... so you... I guess you are saying it may be considered as substantive evidence but it is not a process tiebreaker?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  All right.  Here are two ways you could do it.  You've spoken of reasonableness analysis.  By ""reasonableness analysis"", I mean and I assume you mean that the person who is judging the action taken says: Here are the good reasons on one side that support the action; and here are the reasons on the other side that in fact are critical of it, suggest that it was wrong.  Which one of these sets of reasons is the strongest?  That's what I sort of mean by ""reasonableness analysis"".  There are two ways that the structural conflict could be taken into consideration in reasonableness analysis.  One is it could be taken into consideration during this... we'll call it the step one process.  We put the structural conflict on the... on the side of the scale that weighs against affirming the decision.  A second way to do it would be to go through reasonableness analysis leaving the conflict aside for the moment, and say, on regular reasonableness analysis, do the reasons support the decision predominantly or do they go against it, and let it go at that.  But when that kind of ""reasonableness"" analysis results in something close to equipoise, then we take the structural conflict into consideration; and that's what, in effect, sort of breaks the tie.  Which of those models do we use?  Do we use the structural conflict as a reason in the step one weighing, or do we use the structural conflict as a tiebreaker.   David H. Souter  It's a question of when you use it; and on the first hypothetical, you may not have to use it at all.  On the second hypothetical, you have to use it because you can't make a decision any other way.  So you're saying: Use it at step one as one of the substantive reasons in your weighing analysis?

1,"David H. Souter  Well, there's one... there's one more wrinkle that you don't expressly advert to and that is the argument that what is in issue here are the... are the systems and methods patents, rather than the... the equipment component patents.   David H. Souter  And that with respect to the equipment component patents nothing is being retained, but with respect to the systems and method patents nothing was being granted.  What is your answer to that answer to your argument?   David H. Souter  So the answer simply is that that the argument rests upon a mistake of fact which has not been challenged in the record?   David H. Souter  Yes.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But not every infringement of the license is necessarily an unauthorized sale.   David H. Souter  So there could be a restriction in the license which is not a restriction on sale and that could be violated.  And the exhaustion doctrine would still apply, and you might have remedies in some another theory, i.e., contract.   ",06-937X
0,"David H. Souter  What--   David H. Souter  --I'm sorry.  No.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  It's your--   David H. Souter  --Okay.  But assuming a simple notice, the answer to his bicycle hypo is yes, they can chase me down the road.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, because they're saying--   David H. Souter  --They're saying the reason they have done so is that the following distinction is significant.  There's a distinction between a license that says you can't sell this unless certain conditions are satisfied and, on the other hand, a license that says you can sell this, but if you sell it to a buyer who is described by conditions A and B, you've got to tell the buyer that we're going to make a claim against A and B.  And the ones... in the first example, there is a limit to the right to sell.  In the second example, there is no limit on the right to sell, but there's a warning about what we're going to do if you do sell under certain conditions.  And I think they're saying that unless you have a contract of the former sort which limits your right to sell, then when you do sell, exhaustion applies and whatever you may do against the ultimate buyer is... is a contract problem or what-not, but it's not... it's not a matter of patent.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Number one, do you think I am being correct in characterizing, describing the distinction they make?   David H. Souter  And B, if I am, why isn't that distinction an answer to your argument?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  I understand where you're going.  So then what you're saying, I guess, is that the real issue does not involve this distinction between a--   David H. Souter  --a limited right and a right--   David H. Souter  --to go after people--   David H. Souter  --What it... what it involves is the statement that they make that if you license the manufacture, use, and sale of a particular component and that particular component has only one reasonable use--   David H. Souter  --then you have necessarily licensed them to sell with that ultimate use in mind, and when you do... when you license them to sell, the patent-exhaustion doctrine attaches to any patent right that you may have, whether you call it system--   David H. Souter  --or whether you call it component.   David H. Souter  And you are saying that argument is no good because that, in fact, is an implied license argument, and there were findings that there was no implied license.   INTERRUPTING David H.

0,"David H. Souter  I'm not sure why you characterize California as financing one side of a debate, because... and this I think is sort of the nub of the disagreement between the two sides here... their argument is that a State can determine what it wants to buy with its money, but what California is doing is telling its contractor what it can do with the money after the State has got what it paid for.   David H. Souter  And that's the--   David H. Souter  --I understand that is the basic distinction between a case like Rust and a case like this.   David H. Souter  They're trying to control their profits as opposed to determining what they get... what you get for your money.  And how do you respond to that?   David H. Souter  Well, is there any case in which California claims that it has not gotten the service that it paid for as a result of the position which an employer... a grantee employer took on... on a unionization issue?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why do you say  ""while they are still State funds. ""  --the... the money that the... that any employer is using, I presume, to the extent that it can be identified, is money in the employer's pocket.  And the only claim that California would have, it seems to me from the pre-emption argument, is that in fact we are buying a form of speech or a form of promotion of labor policy when we contract with social service agencies or whatnot.  But I don't understand that to be California's argument at all.   David H. Souter  Yes, but if they give them grant money... let's say it's a grant rather than a contract, and I assume that's, you know, the point you're making.  When they give them grant money, I assume they're giving them grant money in order to do or to perform whatever kind of service or function the agency is devoted to performing.   David H. Souter  Not to... not to enforce labor policy of one sort or another, but to promote the arts or conservation or whatever the organization does.  And there's no argument here that the organization is... is failing to promote conservation or the arts or whatever, and that for that reason, California isn't getting what it's paying for.  The argument is that whatever California has to... I'm sorry, whatever the organization has to spend, say, on its labor relations, which is something that is left over from its promotion of the arts, cannot be spent except in accordance with California policy.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but I assume they are entitled to some overhead cost which would include the cost of their employee-related... managing employee relations?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So that wouldn't be money left over.  That would--   David H. Souter  --So, is the argument that the employer in fact... that the employer is in fact devoting less of the grant money to the purpose of the grant, so that it falls within Rust?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then that... then that, it seems to me, cuts the feet off your argument of a moment ago, that in fact the State's concern is that it's getting less of what it thought it was getting for with its grant, because more is being spent on labor policy.  And now, it seems to me, you're saying no, that's not the case.  It is simply the fact that the time that the employer spends in talking with employees, whatever the subject is, involves a policy that California does not want to support, and, therefore, California prohibits them spending that time for purely policy reasons.   David H. Souter  Well, your argument a moment ago is that they were using the State's money because in fact they were providing less of the service that the grant was for and spending that in... in conversation with employees about labor unions.  And it seems to me your answer to Justice Scalia was inconsistent with that.  Your answer to Justice Scalia, as I understood it, was it is simply that they do not want that policy being implemented by anyone who gets any money from the State within that State.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But on your argument, there is no ""your own money"".  You're saying that everything that the grantee gets in a grant situation is the government's money.   David H. Souter  But that distinction that you just made in answer to Justice Scalia could not be drawn.   David H. Souter  No, the hypothesis of this whole argument is that we are talking with a grantee who was fully funded by... I thought fully funded by the State, and I thought that was your strongest argument.  So that this alternative... well, you can use your own money... is an alternative which, you know, by the very hypothesis that we are arguing on, will never exist.   David H. Souter  Well, what about the situation in which the contract runs for a year and you bill monthly?  On your theory the contract is still going on and yet there is no prepayment.  I assume on your argument they would be just as bound by the California policy as if they got a hundred percent payment up front.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, do you concede that if they... if all they did under a 12-month contract was... was bill for services rendered every past 30 days, that there would be either no application of the California law or that the application would be pre-empted?   David H. Souter  It's like saying yes.   ",06-939X
1,"David H. Souter  Well, you're... you're... as I understand it, in order for you to prevail on that point, the only... the only conclusion that has to be drawn, as I understand it, is that the Texas courts have subject matter jurisdiction of this kind of... of order, and that the bar that Texas is asserting is simply, in effect, a procedural bar; and, therefore, in order for this Federal rule to preempt the State bar is not to give the State courts jurisdiction they don't have, but to remove a bar to the exercise of their jurisdiction that State law, absent preemption, would impose; is that correct?   David H. Souter  Mr. Chief Justice, may I ask a further... may I ask a further question?   David H. Souter  Let me try one other variation to make sure that I understand your argument.  What if the President of the United States had said this judgment, the Avena judgment, will not be enforced, and this Court interpreted the Avena judgment as binding, as providing a rule of decision and a rule of decision which was entitled to respect by Texas?  Would this Court's authority to make that declaration and issue a judgment to that effect be displaced by the President's determination that it would not be that the Avena judgment would not be enforced?   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  So--   David H. Souter  --But it does follow then from what you've said that if we take exactly the position that I outlined in my hypo, we could avoid the entire question of presidential authority.   David H. Souter  That's in effect a judicial version of one of the variants in Justice Jackson's hypo in the Steel case--   David H. Souter  --He's talking about the President and Congress; we're talking about the President and the Court.   David H. Souter  Yes.   David H. Souter  --Then what you are saying if I understand you is that Justice Scalia was wrong when he said that would be making it Federal law.  I think you were saying that would be a... the branch that was responsible for determining how to execute, i.e., to apply, Federal law.  Is that your point?   ",06-984X
0,"David H. Souter  Well, that's the... that's the argument, but your brother the Solicitor General has conceded that if we take the position in this case that there is a... a rule of decision that should be respected in this Court and, hence, the subject of a judgment to Texas that, among other things, would suspend Texas's procedural bar law... that that would obviate the question of presidential power.   David H. Souter  Mr. Cruz, you have frequently emphasized the non-self-executing character of the optional protocol.  Is there any rule, any positive rule in existence today either of international law or domestic law that precludes this Court from being the implementing authority as opposed to the executive or the executive and the Senate?

I'm accepting as premise of the question the limitation which you assert, i.e., non-self-executing; and my question is, may the execution, if you will, be made by this Court?  Is there an independent rule that precludes this Court from that role?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I don't mean to be disrespectful of your judgment but what do you base it on... tradition?

Souter  --because Section 9 on its face seems to provide the opposite to what you're asking.  Isn't that the problem?   David H. Souter  Why isn't... I mean the argument that it is meant to be controlling is an argument, first, for the plain language.   David H. Souter  Pardon me?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Section 9.   David H. Souter  Number one, the plain language of the statute.  Number two, an argument that that plain language, as a matter of historical fact, was deliberately chosen when Congress made a choice between two different, basic arbitration schemes.  And they chose the arbitration scheme that, in effect, does not allow the... the kind of variation that you're talking about.  So they say the language is plain; the intent behind the language is plain.  It is restrictive, and you can't do that.  What is your response, in effect, to the plain language construed in terms of the historical argument?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, it may not... it may not say it for the simple reason that it says unequivocally what should happen, and you are asking for a variation on what it unequivocally provides.  That may be the reason it does not go into contingencies.   David H. Souter  All right.  But you're... you're ignoring... when you say that, you're ignoring the development of arbitration in the period after Justice Story; and you are ignoring the argument that the other side makes that a deliberate choice was made between two generally understood arbitration, statutory arbitration, schemes, and they choose... they chose the one that is inconsistent with your position.   David H. Souter  Then how can you get any award enforced, even subject to your terms?   David H. Souter  Then you have to grapple with the question whether in fact under Section 2 you can provide for confirmation in a manner consistent with the provision for confirmation under Section 9.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You simply... I... I don't... maybe I'm missing something, but you seem to stand there and just say baldly: Section 9 doesn't apply.  It doesn't apply, you've repeated that several times.  And I at least don't know why it doesn't apply.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  And what you are arguing is: At this point, even though we didn't agree within the meaning of the preamble to the first sentence--   David H. Souter  --we still have a right to have the award confirmed and enforced--   David H. Souter  --because we agreed to it under Section 2.   David H. Souter  And the question, I think, is when you argue in that fashion: Do you have a right under Section 2 to provide for confirmation and enforcement under terms which are inconsistent with the provision in Section 9.  And I think that's the... that's the question you've got to answer.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  The... the cases--   David H. Souter  --The intent of the parties that's being enforced in those myriad cases is the intent of the parties to arbitrate.  I don't believe any of those cases respond to the... to the issue that we've got before us.  And the issue we've got before us as you are now framing it is this: If you do not have a provision within the meaning of the first sentence of Section 9--   David H. Souter  --for consummation and enforcement--   David H. Souter  --but you have a different contractual provision and its terms are different from the enforcement terms under Section 9--   David H. Souter  --can that contract be recognized?  Do you have a right, in effect, to modify the statute?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And that's what you've got to come to grips with.  And--   David H. Souter  --No, but it does not answer that question simply to say there are lots of cases saying that the intent of the parties to arbitrate should be enforced.  This is a more specific question.   David H. Souter  Where do you... do you have a case that says every facet of the agreement, no matter how inconsistent arguably with other sections of the statute?  [Laughter]  No, you don't.   David H. Souter  That's why we've got this case here.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay, but--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --If we do that, we've got to dispose of the red herring.  So you're going to come back to that?   David H. Souter  What do you say about her argument that we are limited in considering your argument by the severability ruling that you didn't appeal?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but it does... it does preclude... I mean, her answer is an answer to the argument that you were making in response to a question of mine earlier, that in fact you don't have an agreement within the meaning of the preamble portion of Section 9.

I take it that's not the position you took below, and that's not the position you're taking here, but how do you answer him?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but the question is still here: Why should there be a limit if the parties themselves agree?  Because if they didn't come in under arbitration and they simply came in under contract or whatever the causes of action might be in a diversity case, the court would have to be dealing with these issues anyway.   David H. Souter  Pardon me?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That's true in any diversity case.   David H. Souter  Okay, why didn't Congress give any guidance?  One suggestion that the Chief Justice made, and it played through my mind, is maybe the... what seemed to be the plain language limits in Section 9 represent not necessarily a kind of policy choice in a perfect world, but a political policy choice.  Maybe that was the term as you... as you read Section 9, maybe that was the term upon which the act could be passed.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  We will, in effect... we will say: Look, you got to enforce these contracts, arbitration contracts, but you don't have to go one step further.  Maybe that was the political deal.

I -- I've got a bunch of excerpts from the complaint, but let me just go to one, on section -- paragraph, rather, 97.  That charges the defendants Ashcroft and Mueller with willfully and maliciously designing a policy.  It doesn't sound like respondeat superior.  I mean, it seems to -- to charge them directly with coming up with what these people are complaining about.   David H. Souter  Well, why don't -- may I just interrupt you there?  Why don't you think the reference here in the language I just read, to designing a policy, includes the policy which is several times described as being one which called for holding -- for Arab Muslim men of certain countries of origin without reference to any penal purpose?  I mean, that -- I think that is adequately described in there as part of the policy.   David H. Souter  Even -- even if, as the Chief Justice said, they knew and condoned the policy?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, you may be -- you -- I mean, you may be right.  I think there's -- there's a lot of tension in the -- in the allegations here.  I -- I grant you that.  But isn't the proper way to deal with those tensions at this stage to file a motion for a more definite statement and find out for sure?   David H. Souter  The difference, it -- and maybe this isn't a sufficient difference.  But the difference in my mind between this and Bell Atlantic was that, in Bell Atlantic you had a set of allegations in which in -- in effect it was an either-or choice.  There were two possibilities consistent with the allegations in Bell Atlantic.  One was a conspiracy possibility; one was a -- a lawful parallel conduct possibility.  And there just wasn't any way to pick one as being a more probable interpretation of what they were getting at.  Here the problem is not so much an eitheror choice as to which we are clueless, but a just vagueness or uncertainty.  Does the -- Does the talk about the -- the racial criterion go to the policy as devised or the policy as implemented?  And so on.  And it seems to me that here we're -- we're in a kind of conceptually a squishier situation and it might be better to get a more definite statement than to say, well, you -- you've got to make a choice, and there's no way to make a choice.   David H. Souter  But, Mr. Garre, you are using the word ""plausible"" or you're taking the word ""plausible"" out of Bell Atlantic, I think, and you are using it to mean something that probably can be proven to be true.  Bell Atlantic drew that distinction.  They -- the plausibility there is a plausibility that if they prove what they say, they will -- they will establish a violation.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  I -- I think you are right that if somebody makes just a totally bizarre allegation that nobody in the world could take seriously, that -- that the issue can be raised.  But in Justice Breyer's case, the -- that -- that may be the case if the claim is that the president of Coke was -- was personally putting mouses in bottles.  But the claim, it seems to me, that the Attorney General or the Director of the FBI was establishing a policy of no release until cleared or a policy that centered on people with the same characteristics as the hijackers does not have that kind of bizarre character to it and, I think, would not run afoul of the -- of the plausibility standard.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, I would agree, but this is about as far from common government operation as one can get.   INTERRUPTING David H.

I -- I'm starting with the assumption, which I think is -- is in Bell Atlantic, that what we are concerned with in context is that the -- the context tells us how specific you've got to be versus how conclusory you've got to be, and the reason it does so is that some allegations are -- are more likely to be true than others depending on the context.  Is it fair to say -- going back to Justice Breyer's question, is it fair to say that your basic pleading here rests on the following assumption: That it is more plausible that the Attorney General of the United States and the Director of the FBI were in fact directly involved in devising a policy with the racial characteristics and the coercive characteristics that you claim, than that the President of Coca Cola was putting mouses in bottles?   David H. Souter  So you would say, if -- to the Coke question you would say, yes, they've got to get more facts there, this is just -- this is just crazy to think that the president is putting mice in the bottles.  But you're saying that, so far as the close involvement of the Attorney General and the FBI director, it's not crazy to assume what you -- what you say, and, therefore, you don't have to get into more detail in order to have an adequate claim here.  Is that--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --May I ask you this question?  And -- and I ask it, you know, mindful of what you've just said, but I -- I'm not sure that the two issues can be kept as -- as separated as you suggest.  Another avenue to responding to the problem, I think, that Justice Breyer's last hypo raised would be as follows -- and then I'll tell you the difficulty that I have with it, and I was going ask you to comment on the difficulty.  He said that the -- the allegation -- one way to read the allegation, and I think a fair way, is to say that the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI devised a policy and condoned the implementation of a policy that was based on racial and religious grounds with no penological purpose.  Well, under the circumstances of immediate post-9/11, it is not surprising necessarily that they -- they devised a policy that had reference to religion and national origin and so on, given what we knew about the hijackers.  What is not so easy to accept, as a matter of adequate pleading, is the claim that there was no penological interest involved in the decision of how to and how long to hold the individuals who were picked up.  One answer to that, which I think is -- is in your pleadings, is that you refer to specific individuals and in particular to your own client, who was in the position of being held under these conditions for a considerable period of time, and it turns out there's -- there's no indication that there was ultimately a justified penological interest.  So that might be your answer to Justice Breyer's question.  There's enough in here about specific detentions to make it plausible for pleading standards that they were being held without any penological interest.  The difficulty I have with that line of thinking is this: You also allege in there that lower level officials were making decisions on an ad hoc basis without adequate criteria as to -- as to how they should make them.  And that particular line of allegations suggests that what was really going on here, including what was happening to your client, wasn't the result of -- of clear policy decisions made by the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, but they -- they were just being scattered.  So, what in the context of your whole pleading makes it adequate simply to charge on a conclusory basis that these two defendants were devising a policy that had -- that was intended to have an effect of no penological interest?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Did -- you'll have to help me out.  Did you allege that?   David H. Souter  Okay.  That's what you're saying--   INTERRUPTING David H.

INTERRUPTING David H.

The enricher buys it in the -- in the -- I forget the acronym in the case that you just described -- and we don't know -- we have no reason to believe the enricher couldn't go out on the market and buy it if, in fact, the utility didn't supply the feed.

Let's -- let's assume--   David H. Souter  --for the sake of argument that the reasons for -- otherwise the reasons for and against the point you've just made are evenly balanced.  We are on the fence.  Don't we resolve this -- shouldn't we resolve this in favor of the President's position, simply because in the absence of the statutes that we're talking about, starting with the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, the President would have had under the foreign policy power of Presidents the authority to stop suits like this dead in the water simply by taking the position that that should be the result?  So that if in doubt, shouldn't we construe these statutes consistently with the traditional foreign policy authority of the President, in which case we get off the fence and we go in the way of the Petitioners rather than your way?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, it's been profoundly changed if we accept your argument.  I mean, at the moment the question is whether it has been profoundly changed or not.  We've got a statutory mess.  And in a case in which the statutes are seemingly subject to -- to -- to arguments either way, why don't we go with tradition?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but the President, quite apart from the immunity designation, the President had the authority to compromise suits.   David H. Souter  I don't know whether it continues to exist or not for the sake of this argument, and I'm not -- I'm not making that point for the sake of this argument.  I'm simply saying that if it is otherwise unclear, given that that power was traditionally enjoyed by the President, why do we not construe the -- or resolve the equipoise if it gets to that point, in the President's favor rather than your favor?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, he hasn't set it up because he thinks he has got the authority under this statute or had the authority under this statute.   David H. Souter  Oh, I -- I quite agree with that.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --So I suppose the first step in that direction is to stop the suit that's going on now.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And I mean, just to add to that--   David H. Souter  --It said under 620A of Foreign Assistance or any other provision of law.  Clearly they are going beyond, it seems to me, the -- the premise which your argument rests on, the argument that you've just made.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  Fine.  But there is no textual basis for drawing the line once you get beyond 620A at the point you want to draw it.   David H. Souter  Why did -- why did he need the statute to do that?  In other words if the President had the power to designate in the first place, normally that assumes the power to -- to rescind the designation.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And it may also be an indication that he thought he had effectively accomplished what he wanted by -- by acting under this statute, and therefore he had other fish to fry.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I -- I don't know, either.  I mean, I can't -- I can't read minds, but there is an interpretation that is quite possible consistent with the text of this statute, that he thought that by acting under 1503, he had done everything that he needed to do.  Why he had at some subsequent time said, well, you know, I'll -- I'll use belt as well as suspenders, I don't know.  But it would be consistent with the assumption that he had the authority here.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why -- why do you say ""permanently""?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Just under -- just under this statute, if he makes inapplicable, he can rescind the action that made it inapplicable.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well -- no, but during the period in which the statute is applicable, I don't know of any reason why he cannot change his designation of inapplicability.

Souter  Maybe I'm beating a dead horse, but Justice Breyer made the point, and he made it I think very clearly, that although that evidence was in, the argument here -- the argument that was made before the jury in this case is that the witnesses upon whom the defense was specifically relying were witnesses whose account of the defendant's drug use came solely from the defendant himself.  Given that fact, wouldn't it have been mitigating evidence to learn that other people, at times relatively close to the events in question, without being coached by the defendant, had concluded that he was a drug user?

1,"David H. Souter  Well, in your view if an officer was going down the street and he saw an individual as to whom he had no suspicion that a crime was being committed, had been or was about to be, but he said that -- that guy looks like -- like trouble for anybody who has anything to do with him.  So he goes up to him and he says, I want to talk to you.  And because he has reasonable suspicion that the individual looks like trouble, he pats him down.  Is that a good pat down?   David H. Souter  What if the individual gives him -- gives him mean looks and he has a bulge of something on his hip?   David H. Souter  No, but in my hypothesis, there was nothing that would satisfy the first prong of Terry.  There's -- there's no lawful traffic stop.  There is no indication that the individual has committed a crime or is about to or is doing so.  So -- so Terry 1 is blank in my hypothesis, and you nonetheless conclude that as a result of dirty looks and the -- the bulge of a probable gun on the hip, the officer can in effect initiate the -- the action with the individual and pat him down.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But I take it, if I understood your earlier answer, you would extend the application of the rule as you understand it to the encounter simply on the sidewalk by a police officer who has no suspicion that the individual he wants to talk to has been, is, or is about to commit a crime, but if the -- if the officer chooses to initiate the conversation, he then, in effect, if he can articulate any suspicion, like we'll say the dirty look and the bulge on the side, he can go ahead and -- and pat down.  Is that -- that your view?   David H. Souter  Well, there's something fundamentally wrong probably about that, but the -- the -- I think the problem that sort of drives the questioning is that if you extend the rule as far as you want to extend it, we have to take into consideration that the standard of articulable suspicion is the standard that, in practical terms, can pretty well always be met.  You can -- you know, Benjamin Franklin's remark: It's great to be a reasonable person because you can think of a reason for anything you do.  [Laughter]  And that's -- that's what's driving -- at least driving my questions.   David H. Souter  Yes, but what the officer cites is going to be a matter of fact, and the facts at that point are gone.  They're in the past.  And all you've got is the officer saying, you know, this is -- this is what I perceived.  And maybe you've got the -- a defendant somewhere saying, oh, no, it wasn't like that.  But in a -- in a situation like that, if -- if articulable suspicion, in effect, can justify a sidewalk pat down without any articulation of a basis to think crime is afoot, then you've got a -- you've got a pretty wide open standard in the real world.

0,"David H. Souter  Can we pursue that for a minute?  What -- I guess we -- we all start with the common assumption that -- that there was at least a legitimate stop to start with.   David H. Souter  And my -- my question which -- which goes to who's right about whether the seizure -- the legitimate seizure had stopped and the consensual encounter had begun, my question is what is it beyond the conclusory statement of the officer that in effect justifies drawing that conclusion, that the stop was over?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Do we know -- do we have any evidence about duration here?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  My -- my problem in this case, I guess, in taking your position is I don't think we have got an evidentiary basis to conclude that what we start by assuming is a legitimate stop has in fact run its course.  I don't see how we can draw that conclusion.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That's what I'm getting at.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, then, in other words, you -- you are -- I -- I'll be candid with you.  I would have started with the assumption, based on Brendlin, that if the stop of the car and its driver also effects a stop and a seizure of the passenger, that you start out with the assumption that the seizure of the passenger is going to last for the same duration as the seizure of the car and the driver unless you have a good reason to draw some line and say, no, it doesn't.  And I take it that you are not making that initial assumption.  Am I correct there?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, I think -- I think you're rejecting it, aren't you?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  What are those -- what are those special facts?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Are you saying--   David H. Souter  --Are you saying if there's -- if there's a driver and a passenger and there are two police officers, and one police officer is dealing with the driver, saying, you know, where's your insurance papers and so on, and at the same time the other officer is questioning the -- the passenger, are you saying that that independent questioning of the passenger in effect eliminates the -- the passenger's seizure as -- as following from the seizure of the driver?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I -- I don't get it.  Why should the fact that an officer -- a separate officer is talking to the passenger ultimately have anything to do with the duration of the passenger's seizure, absent a situation in which officer two says,  ""by the way, you're totally free to go? ""  We don't have that kind of strange situation.  But short of a strange situation like that, why does the conversation with the passenger have anything much to do -- have any bearing on the -- on the length of the passenger's seizure?   David H. Souter  Yes.   David H. Souter  But we accept as hornbook law when they are -- when the police are -- are questioning one individual whom they've stopped, let's say for a traffic violation, that during that period of seizure, the reasonable period of seizure, the officer can ask questions about other subjects, and that doesn't end the seizure.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So why should--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --it be any different for the passenger?   David H. Souter  I don't want to -- I don't want to take up your whole argument on this hobbyhorse of mine, but I mean my -- my only problem is I don't see that we have got an evidentiary basis here to say that, because of the duration or the mere fact of the questioning, there is a reason to say that as to the passenger, a reasonable passenger could say, I am no longer seized, and -- and this encounter is totally consensual.

0,"David H. Souter  Mr. Miller, could you help me out on how the system works in -- in practice in a different way?  One of your answers a few moments ago was that when -- I think it was Ms. Simmons was told why she lost, she in effect got as much notice as she would have needed to have to in effect do better on a remand.  My first question is: Is there an automatic right to a remand?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  With new evidence?   David H. Souter  Okay.  But even on the -- on the functioning of the system as you have explained it, at the -- at the very least, the person has -- let's assume Ms. Simmons says: Oh, now I understand, and I will get the following piece of evidence, which I didn't realize was my responsibility.  Even on that explanation, it means that the -- that the claimant is going to have to go through another stage in the administrative litigation process.  So I assume that ought to count as -- as some sort of prejudice, and I assume it's something that -- as it were, the burden of which the VA ought to bear rather than the claimant.   David H. Souter  No, but you are going to have to go through another stage of litigation.  I mean, one of the functions of the burden rule -- and it might be too subtle a function to worry much about -- but one of the functions is to put the party with the burden on -- on notice that if you fail in your obligation, you're the one who is going to have to pay, unless you can convince everybody that there was in fact no harm done by this.  And this induces the party with the burden to do what the primary obligation says the party ought to do.  And on your -- and on your analysis, since the government would not have that obligation, the government has less of an inducement to follow the statutory obligation.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, it may have a strong inducement, but I'm talking about a stronger one.  [Laughter]  If the government knows that it is going to bear the burden of any doubt about the significance of its failure, to some extent I suppose that is -- that is going to induce the government to be on its toes.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, that's -- I mean, that's the essential problem with common law adjudication.  And I -- there's not much we can do about that.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Now, at that point, is the claimant disentitled to have a lawyer?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But at the point they get the notice and they are trying to evaluate the significance of the notice, they are not entitled to a lawyer?   David H. Souter  Well, no -- I--   David H. Souter  --No, at the point -- at the point where the statute requires original notice, they are not entitled to a lawyer.   David H. Souter  We -- we agree on that.  Now, they've gone through stage one of litigation and they've lost.  And they are getting a statement of reasons.  At that point, are they entitled to have a lawyer?--   David H. Souter  --But whether -- I -- I guess the -- the situation that I am concerned with is, the person up to that moment not only does not have, but is not entitled to have, a lawyer.  The person then gets a piece of paper in the mail that says: You lost; these are the reasons.  If the person -- if the claimant then says, I don't know what they are talking about, I will go get a lawyer, then I can understand at that point a relatively sophisticated mind is going to come in to understand it.  But if the client simply reads it and says, I really don't know what they are talking about here or at least I think I know what they are talking about, and I guess it's hopeless, the person is not likely to have legal advice.  And what I'm getting at is that the person at that stage, at the moment the notice arrives, is in a position, I would think, of -- of extreme relative disadvantage.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You can see where I am going with the argument.   David H. Souter  No, but there's -- it seems to me that there are two points at which the veteran is at a disadvantage.  And -- and you're talking about the second of the two.  I'm talking about the first of the two.

And the difficulty, I think, with your position here is that on the assumption, which I do make, that the -- that the issue, ""correct in all respect"" issue, was properly raised by the other side, if we accept your position, we in effect are saying the other side is not going to have an opportunity to argue that before the Oregon Supreme Court.

He had asked for more time and -- and had -- had indicated that there were leads that needed to be followed that couldn't be followed unless he got more time and so on, and the State court refused.  Could he then come into the Federal court and say: My claim here is not only ineffective assistance, but ineffective assistance with the overlay of the refusal of the State courts to give me an adequate opportunity to develop my -- my ineffective assistance claim?

I understand you're saying that is not this case.  But isn't that a legitimate problem to -- to face at some point.   David H. Souter  I think you're right in the main.  I think that's generally correct.  The case that I'm concerned with is the case of the -- of the Brady claim, because if we are proceeding under (e) then as I understand the cause and prejudice can only be established in the case we are talking about if there can be shown a probability of a different verdict.  The Brady standard, however, does not require the probability of a different verdict.  Brady uses the term  ""reasonable probability that there would have been a different result. ""  but that has been clearly defined in the cases to mean reasonable possibility.  So that in fact with respect to Brady claims subsection (e) is imposing a higher requirement than Brady did and a higher requirement than would have been applied before Brady.  And that is the case, it seems to me, that we -- it may not be this case, but that's the case that we've got to be concerned about in coming up with doctrine here.  Isn't that a legitimate concern?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But I don't, I don't think this Court understood the implication of it when you get into the Brady issue.

Souter  Now -- but the road map that you are now saying could be followed is the same road map implied by -- in your earlier answer to Justice Scalia, your reference to the new claim as being a defaulted claim.   David H. Souter  But we are concerned -- I think we are all concerned with the -- with the claim in which it is not defaulted, in the sense that he is at fault in any way for failing to get it into the Federal court -- I'm sorry -- get his entire presentation now into the State court then.  So that it is not a defaulted claim in the classic sense.  It is not a claim in which he is at fault by having failed to present it in the State court.  And in that case, if it cannot go back, if the State court will not take it back, don't we have to find at least implicit in the totality of subsections (d) and (e) the possibility of litigating the -- the fully developed claim in the Federal court without a need to defer to the State court findings?   David H. Souter  Well, he -- I agree with you on the -- on the cause part; but the -- up to this point.  He has got to demonstrate cause and prejudice or at least he has got to develop cause.  Let me put it -- ask you this question.  If he simply says look, I tried to get this in to the State court, and he shows that, but the State court for whatever reason just would not take the evidence that he wanted to put in, is that enough for him to have--   David H. Souter  --I'm -- I'm not asking to you stipulate--   David H. Souter  --that it's this case.  But it's the case we are worried about around the corner.   David H. Souter  If that is -- this Court -- that's why I'm saying it's a very established law as to what cause is, and external impediments.  I mean, this Court has many cases that describe that.  The lower courts are very familiar with determining that, and so they can -- they are capable to making that determination as to whether the Federal court can now look at a new matter whether it's a new claim or--  --But all we are -- I think all we are really getting at is that there are different kinds of new matters.  There are some new matters of which he absolutely knew nothing at the State court stage, and he is now saying don't hold that against me: i.e., I'm showing cause and I'll show prejudice.  This is new matter that he did or potentially know about and tried to get into, and under our hypothesis, the State court says no, I'm not going to hear it, or I won't give you the time, whatever the case may be.  In that case, isn't it -- don't we have to say under the statute all he has got to show is cause in the sense that he tried and the State court wouldn't let him?

0,"David H. Souter  Where was the statutory authority suspending the obligation to provide an EIS?  You mentioned a regulation.  Where in the statute does it say that the Council on Environmental Quality can dispense with this requirement?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but that's not the question I am asking.  I am not asking about the consequences of not complying.  I am asking what is the statutory authority for the Council on Environmental Quality to dispense with the statutory obligation to prepare it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That's what -- as I understand it, that's what you're arguing in effect, as an intervening -- as of intervening legal significance.  And I want to know what the statutory authority is for that.  I don't see it in NEPA.   David H. Souter  Okay.  As a general proposition that's fine, but what's the statutory authority for them to engage in rulemaking authority that dispenses with the government's obligation to comply with an EIS requirement?   David H. Souter  But you -- I mean, the claim is that you weren't complying with it at the time the request for an injunction was brought, and everything else is consequent on that.  So I want to go back to the point, in effect, at which the claim was made that the government is not complying.  One of your answers to that is right now, as a result of subsequent Council on Environmental Quality action, we're not in the same situation that we were in when the suit was brought.  And I want to know what the statutory authority is for the Council on Environmental Quality to take the action with the effect that you claim it has.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --seems to cut against you.  I am not getting it.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay, but--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --Let me -- let me switch back.  Chief?  Let me switch back in time for a second to the beginning of these exercises.  One of the -- I mean, one of the arguments, and you have alluded to it, for I guess the appropriateness of the Council on Environmental Quality's action, if it has any power to act, is emergency circumstances.  My understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong on the facts, is that the exercises began in February of 2007.  My understanding is that it was in that same month of February 2007 that the Navy produced the EA, the environmental assessment, so that in effect, as I understand it, the Navy disclosed the fact that it would not provide an EIS at just about the same moment that it began the exercises.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And I guess my question is, to the extent that there was an emergency, wasn't the emergency created by the failure of the Navy to take any timely action?  I am assuming in my question that the Navy had decided before February 1st, 2007, that it was going to have these exercises.  So it sounds to me as though that, if there is an emergency, it's one that the Navy created simply by failing to start an EIS preparation in a timely way at which it tried in effect to sort of neutralize by keeping everybody in the dark until the last moment.  So, why -- why shouldn't we say that -- even assuming the Council on Environmental Quality can somehow dispense with the statute, why shouldn't we say that there was no emergency here except one which was created by the Navy's apparently deliberate inattention?   David H. Souter  Well, it was a gap of less than month, right?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And how long does it -- how long does it take -- going back to Justice Breyer's question, how long does it take to prepare an environmental impact statement?  It takes more than--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --It takes more than a month, doesn't it.   David H. Souter  Okay.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And the Navy knew more than the 1st -- earlier than the 1st of February that it was going to engage in these exercises, didn't it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Sure, but they wouldn't have been in the situation in January of 2008 if they hadn't been in the situation I described in February of 2007.  And it sounds to me as though the Navy played its cards very close to its vest--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --in 2007.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Didn't both the circuit and the district court, although they mentioned that, in fact find that it was -- I forget what their phrase was -- beyond question.   David H. Souter  ""Near certainty"".   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  There is no -- there is no harm.  I mean, the standard may or may not be bright, but there is no harm to the Navy in this case from -- from the use of that standard, I take it.   David H. Souter  Well, we -- we may, but so far as the case is concerned we may -- and we frequently do -- say there -- there -- that certainly there's no harm in this case, the error was harmless.   David H. Souter  But that -- in effect, you are saying the EA is the equivalent to an EIS.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What is the difference between them?  I -- I assume the difference is the EIS is a more comprehensive survey and -- and set of conclusions.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So that without the EIS, the Navy is acting in -- in a state of -- of some degree of ignorance greater than would be the case if -- if it had done -- done the EIS.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And that, I presume, is the harm that the -- that the statute is intended to prevent.   ",07-1239

And it seems to me that all of the requirements that you've been specifying would in an individual case be met simply by showing that there was -- there was an individual in business who had a brain.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, if I set up a newsstand, it's a sole proprietorship and that's all I have to do.  And if -- if I have a -- a functioning brain, I have a decision-making mechanism.  I remember from day-to-day what I did, so I have continuity.  And -- and it seems to me that all of these requirements are -- are virtually satisfied as a matter of course by an individual who engages in any kind of business that might have interstate commerce implications.   David H. Souter  Oh, absolutely.  But it seems to me that it -- it puts you in sort of a -- a difficult position to -- to be calling for or -- or requiring jury instructions that call for, as necessary conditions, findings of structure, continuity, decision-making capacity, and so on, when in fact on -- on at least one variety of enterprise, these conditions are -- are met virtually automatically simply by having somebody doing business in any way.   David H. Souter  Oh, I agree, but an individual can be an -- an enterprise.   David H. Souter  And -- and an association-infact can be an enterprise.  And if we accept those two propositions, then I think you've got a tough row to hoe in saying that any enterprise which is not an individual has got to have all the formal characteristics that you talk about, given the fact that those characteristics are automatically satisfied by an individual.

1,"David H. Souter  Well, would you -- would you agree just as a general rule that unless we find -- unless there is some rule under which we can conclude that the State court should have held a hearing, that there is no occasion to have a Federal evidentiary hearing?   David H. Souter  That would be the general proposition.   David H. Souter  Okay.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Was -- was -- is all of this factual material in the -- in the documents submitted with the habeas -- with the State habeas and the response to the State habeas?   David H. Souter  What -- what did they do?  Did they submit the trial transcript with the -- in -- with the response to the habeas petition at the State?  In other words, how did it get in front of the State court, is all I want to know.   David H. Souter  Ah, okay, yes.   David H. Souter  Okay.  Then if -- if we get to that point, I think your argument is as follows.  I'm not sure.  I want you to tell me.  If the State court adjudication was -- was contrary to what Justice Stevens' hypo suggested might be the ""total fool"" rule, in other words no one but a complete nincompoop would have failed to -- to press forward with this defense, then we can decide the case simply under Strickland, because Strickland unreasonableness is certainly going to cover the total fool case.  But if we have something less egregious than the total fool case, then we've got to look for more precise Supreme Court precedent, and that's what gets us into the Musladin or Musladin rule.   David H. Souter  And if we get to the Musladin sort of level of generality, we do not have any determination from this Court, any clearly established law from this Court, that would indicate that the State court's adjudication or determination was unreasonable here.   David H. Souter  Is that your road map?   David H. Souter  What -- what discretion did the judge have?   ",07-1315
0,"David H. Souter  No, but your -- the need for the evidentiary hearing, as I understand it, was raised by you in the following way.  You said to the California Supreme Court there is on the face of the -- the papers filed here a violation of Strickland and a -- or a misapplication of Strickland in -- in the way the California trial court came out.  But if you do not find a facial violation of Strickland based on these papers, then you should remand for an evidentiary hearing.  And it doesn't seem to me that that follows at all.  If there's no Strickland error, that seems to me a -- an odd premise to say you ought to remand for a hearing.  Aren't you under an obligation to specify factual issues that -- specifically that need to be developed, before you would make out a case for saying they were in error in not holding the evidentiary hearing?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But you're saying that you specified the evidentiary issues that you wanted to develop?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, was that -- I mean, I'm just asking you.  I'm asking you -- I'm throwing you a softball.   David H. Souter  Are -- are you saying that that was, in effect, an adequate way to tell the California Supreme Court that these are the issues that we want to develop in an evidentiary hearing that aren't sufficiently developed in the documents?  Is that your position?   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  Well, maybe -- maybe he did, but when we come to judge prejudice, don't we have to judge prejudice by considering exactly what Justice Ginsburg just said?  In other words, our standard, the -- the standard -- number one, the standard for Strickland prejudice is -- is an objective -- I mean, the standard for -- for -- of performance is an objective standard.  And the standard for prejudice has got to be an objective standard, too.  And even though he said, I didn't do this for tactical reasons, if a -- if a sound lawyer would have entertained exactly the tactical reason that Justice Ginsburg just outlined, isn't that crucial to the determination of prejudice?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, shouldn't that be?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  How did he know that?   David H. Souter  Yes, but the judge hadn't sentenced yet.   David H. Souter  So you're saying the judge had no discretion whatsoever?   David H. Souter  So, therefore--   David H. Souter  --You're saying the terms of the sentence had to be 25 to life?   David H.

1,"David H. Souter  General, the difficulty I have is that not only do they not say so, the Supreme Court of Hawaii didn't say so either.  And it seems to me that we would be well advised to make sure that we understand the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Hawaii before we start talking about the relationship between the various Federal statutes and whatever this claim may be.  I simply don't understand the claim myself.  I do understand your point, because I think this much is clear from the Hawaiian opinion: That they think the Apology Resolution seriously affects the claim.  That we can deal with, but once we get out of that, the -- the whole case seems murky to me.  Am I missing something?   David H. Souter  But that's not what the Hawaiian Supreme Court said, and I'm reading from page 98a of the petition appendix, the concluding portion of the opinion.  ""We hold that: (1) the Apology Resolution and related State legislation, give rise to the State's fiduciary duty. ""  The only Federal statute mentioned is the Apology Resolution, and the rest of their reasoning seems to rest upon some kind of State equity law or trust law.  Now, that trust law may ultimately be inconsistent with prior Federal acts, but the only -- the only thing they are disclosing right now is -- aside from the Apology Resolution, seems to be State trust law.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But trust law is based on somebody's property rights.  We don't know whether they are talking about legal rights or equitable rights, and that's consistent with the statement I just read to you.   David H. Souter  But, General, I think -- with respect, I still don't know what the position of the Hawaiian Supreme Court is going to be if this Court rules that the Apology Resolution does not support the proposition that you just read.  I don't know whether at that point the Hawaiian Supreme Court is going to say, okay, all we've got left to deal with now is State trust law, or whether they've got to pull another rabbit out of the hat and say, but there is -- there is some kind of prior -- there is some kind of a -- a claim against which prior Federal law could not prevail.  I don't know.  And I -- that's -- that's why it seems to me, to say the least, imprudent to wade into it at this point.  The one thing we know that seems to have been significant to their decision is the Apology Resolution.  And I think we would be wise to stick to that.   David H. Souter  But that doesn't seem to be what the Supreme Court of Hawaii has done.  The Supreme Court of Hawaii, in effect, has said the land is tied up until these people who are currently negotiating, the State, the Native Hawaiians and -- what is it, the United Church of Christ, all come to a -- in effect, a resolution and a reconciliation.  Whatever that means, it does not sound to me as though it is the recognition of a legal title claim or indeed the validity, so far as courts are concerned with validity, of any claim the Native Hawaiians are making.  They are just saying, no more land transfers until these people sit down and make up their differences.  Isn't that all the court is saying at this point?   William M. Jay  Well, the court said, Justice Souter, that there is a fiduciary obligation not to make these land transfers at any time until this indeterminate point in the future at which reconciliation is achieved.  But to say -- to say that that -- that they are not thereby pronouncing on the validity of the title -- I think that's inconsistent with the Newlands Resolution.   David H. Souter  But doesn't -- isn't the fact that you and I are having this exchange a pretty good indication that we don't know what they -- they meant exactly by that?  The only thing that we can be sure of is that that thought the Apology Resolution had some legal significance.  They said, you know, it's required after the Apology Resolution.  We can say you are right or you are wrong, and I think we know what -- what we are talking about.  But to go beyond that, it seems to me, that we are wading into an argument that you and I can't settle here.   William M. Jay  Well, I wholly agree, Justice Souter, that the State supreme court thought the Apology Resolution had significance and that the Apology Resolution--   ",07-1372

0,"David H. Souter  The problem, Mr. Coleman, is that -- that the cases you are relying on, it seems to me, are cases in which ultimately what is being judged is a different result in the -- at the end point of the process which was starting.  And the problem that I have with -- with using cases like that and -- and essentially the problem I -- I have with your argument is that it leaves a -- a municipality or a governmental body like New Haven in a -- in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.  Because on -- on the very assumptions that you are making, if they go forward with -- with their -- their hiring plan, they certify the results and go forward with it, they are inevitably facing a disparate impact lawsuit.  If they stop and say, wait a minute, we're starting down the road toward a disparate impact lawsuit and, indeed, there may be something wrong here, they are inevitably facing a disparate treatment suit.  And whatever Congress wanted to attain, it couldn't have wanted to attain that kind of a situation.  Why isn't the most reasonable reading of this set of facts a reading which is consistent with giving the city an opportunity, assuming good faith, to start again?  And I -- I recognize there's got to be a good faith condition, and the -- the good faith can always be attacked.  But isn't that the only way to avoid the damned if you do, damned if you don't situation?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But you make no distinction between race as an animating discriminating object on the one hand and race consciousness on the other.  There is no way to deal with a situation like this any more than there is a way to deal with -- with setting lines in voting districts--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --without pervasive race consciousness.  That is not unconstitutional, and it seems to me that you are not observing that distinction in -- in your reply.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, what -- what if you've got -- what if you've got the basis of Justice Kennedy's hypothetical?  You've -- you've got a municipality.  It's a racially mixed municipality.  It's got two tests.  That's his hypothetical.  One of them seems to suggest that there is going to be a significant racial disparity in the results if they use it.  The other one from the other city or the other State suggests not.  That's all they've got to go on.  Is that a strong basis in evidence, or did they walk their way into a lawsuit by you if they adopt the -- the test that doesn't -- that at least in the other place hasn't produced the disparity?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But you are -- as I understand it, you are imposing your strong basis in evidence test on what you referred to a second ago as the use of race, and that cannot be correct, because the use of race includes race-conscious decisions which are not discriminatory decisions, and they certainly do not implicate the -- the obligation that you want to impose.  You -- if -- if your argument is going to be coherent with what we start with, it can't be based merely on the use of race because if it does, then you are, in effect, turning any race-conscious decision into a discrimination decision, and that equation we certainly haven't made and we're never going to make.   David H. Souter  Then--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --But even--   David H. Souter  --I don't want to turn this into just a rhetoric exercise, but I think the rhetoric is important.  You say the city took the position, we don't like the results of this test.  That kind of a statement is consistent with saying, look, we don't like the race of the people who are going to benefit from this.  It's also consistent with the city's taking the position that there is such a racial disparity here that we are either asking for trouble or walking blindly or perhaps foolishly into a -- a racial disparity lawsuit based on disparate impact.  Those are two very, very different attitudes.  The first one is discriminatory.  I don't see how the second one is discriminatory.   David H. Souter  But the cost of drawing the distinction between this case and Justice Kennedy's hypothetical example is that if we draw that distinction, the only way the city can get itself out of not only a certain lawsuit, but quite probably a successful lawsuit, is to make, in practical terms, a preliminary case against itself.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And it -- I cannot conceive that Congress intended to put a city into that situation saying you've either got to blunder ahead into a losing lawsuit in court, or you have got to stop and expose yourself to another lawsuit which you can only win by proving that you at least had taken some steps in violating the law the first time.  That is inconceivable.   ",07-1428

0,"David H. Souter  Well, Mr. Verrilli, you have spoken of -- of overruling a bright line, but I think there is something else that would be involved in the overruling.  And I -- I haven't pulled Jackson back out since I came on the bench, so this is where you've got to help me out.  There is a -- there is a difference between the way you are phrasing the Sixth Amendment right and the way, for example, Justice Scalia has phrased it in his question.  Justice Scalia has phrased it in terms of determining what is a coerced confession.  You have phrased it in your argument in terms of saying a right to rely upon counsel, which is a much broader concept.  Does Jackson support the notion that he simply has a right to rely upon counsel?  I think that is your principal argument here because that would be the argument that supports your claim that there shouldn't be a distinction between a case in which the State simply appoints counsel without being asked and a case in which he actually asks for counsel.  That would be a nice way of rationalizing that distinction.  Isn't it the case that you understand Jackson to be a broader rule than a merely no-coercion rule?  And, number two, if that is so, then overruling Jackson would, as I take it, in your view be more than simply substituting a -- a one bright-line coercion rule for a different bright-line coercion rule.  So what are your responses to those two questions?   ",07-1529
1,"David H. Souter  Excuse me.  They advised him, you say, of his right to counsel.  If they gave him the standard Miranda warning, what they said was: You have the right to have a counsel appointed.  They didn't say: You have a lawyer who has been appointed.  And, in fact, his testimony at least is that they told him the opposite.  But if all they did was give him the Miranda warning, they certainly were not informing him of his Sixth Amendment right or his Sixth Amendment status.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But that doesn't go to the issue in this case.  The issue in this case, as I understand it, is not that he lost because he failed to make a request.  He lost because he failed to make it affirmatively clear that he accepted the appointment of the lawyer who had, in fact, been appointed for him as he had been told.  That's not a request.  As I understand it, under the -- under the State court ruling, if he had stood at the 72-hour hearing and the court had said, we're appointing the X office to defend you, and he had said, great, that would have changed the result in this case; isn't that correct?   David H. Souter  So the issue is not request.  The issue is acceptance.  That's what it seems -- just to get my point, that's what seems to me to be the acute point of several of the questions you have been asked.  Why -- we're not talking about requests.  Why should it make a constitutional difference whether the man stands in a Tennessee courtroom and simply stands silent when they said, you've got a lawyer--   David H. Souter  --as distinct from a case where they say you have got a lawyer, and he says, that's fine?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You're not merely defending the State court here.  You're asking for a -- in effect, a different rule from that which the State court applied.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then are you equating positive affirmation with request for a lawyer?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then on your -- then on your theory, this individual's Sixth Amendment right would not have attached if he had stood in the courtroom and said, thank you very much, that's great.   David H. Souter  But you're also arguing, it seems to me, that a request -- well, you're -- I think you're arguing two different things.  On the one hand, you're arguing that a request is necessary, and yet on the other hand, I understood you to concede in answer to a question from me that if he had stood in the courtroom in Tennessee, having been told that counsel was appointed for him and had said, yes, thank you, I accept that lawyer, that that would have been sufficient to satisfy Jackson, and that would have made the difference in this case.  Those are two different positions.   David H. Souter  Well, so far as I understand it, and you correct me if I'm wrong, but as I understand it, what the State Supreme Court said was not that he had to make a request, ""I want a lawyer"", but simply that he had to indicate in some way that he accepted the appointment of the lawyer which he had been told had been appointed for him; and that is a different situation from Jackson.  So if -- if you are saying, yes, if he had said  ""thank you, I accept the lawyer. ""  that would have been enough, then that in effect is -- is maintaining the position that the State court took; but if you're saying something more, that he had to say then or later on, ""I want a lawyer"", then I think you're going beyond the case that we have in front of us.  Am I wrong?   David H. Souter  Okay.   ",07-1529

Souter  --That would be an eccentric situation, but it could happen.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But I thought your definition of -- of ""disposal"" implied the disposition of something whose use had, in effect, been exhausted, so that I would have thought your answer to Justice Alito's question would have been different because even in the case in which they hired a sloppy delivery, they're not getting rid of -- or the deliverer is not necessarily getting rid of a product whose use has been exhausted.

In effect, it could either order the buyer, as a condition of receipt of the product, or it could require that as part of the -- its terms with the -- with the deliverer.  It seems to me that the way Shell has set it up indicates that control has passed to somebody else at the moment that the spigot starts going in the tank.   INTERRUPTING David H.

What is your best response to the argument that Ms. Sullivan makes that ""arrange for disposal"" implies something significantly different from ""arrange for transfer"", ""arrange for release"", ""arrange for delivery"" -- that the -- that the combination of arrangement as an intentional act and disposal, as opposed to one of these -- these other processes, implies that the -- in effect, the use of the product intended has become exhausted and that one in getting rid of waste as distinct from merely wasting something.  What is -- what is your best answer to that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But if we're not arguing about that, what you are arguing about, then, is the -- is the implication of disposal, as opposed to a more neutral term like ""transfer"" or ""delivery"" or what-not.  What's your answer to that?   David H. Souter  Oh, but those are certainly ways in which disposal can occur, as I -- I think came out in the argument.  If the -- if Waste Management spills things along the highway on the way to the dump, it may be leakage, but a disposal is going on because in fact it is a way of getting rid of something that no longer has any use.  So I -- I can -- I don't think the -- the inclusion of leakage within the definition answers the question whether disposal is something different from transfer.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, you have discharged, but you -- the question is whether it is disposal.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  ""Discharge"" is a more neutral term.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but I mean, that -- that -- that begs the question.  Because in the course of disposing, in the sense that she argues for, there can be leakage.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  The question is ""disposal"" versus ""transfer"" or some more neutral term.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  When?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but you -- in that case, you have knowledge, but you don't have control because you're using a common carrier.   INTERRUPTING David H.

0,"David H. Souter  But Mr. Stancil, I mean, you say make the record.  You said a moment ago, have standby counsel who can take over.  It seems to me that the... that the trouble with these proposals is that by the time the record is made, if by that you mean courtroom performance, or by the time standby counsel is required to take over, the damage is done.  And it... it seems to me that a trial judge in those situations who says, okay, I declare at this point that the trial has become so farcical it cannot go on like this, the trial judge at that point is... has got a damaged product in the part of the trial that has already taken place.  And the tough question, I think, is not whether he can simply tell standby counsel to take over, but whether anyone can take over without declaring a mistrial at that point.  And the cost of mistrial is a cost in addition to the cost that the State has been arguing for, that it should not be regarded in the public eye as the sponsor of farces.  What do you say to the problem of the likelihood that a mistrial is going to be the cost of correcting or switching over once the... once the damage has been proven?   David H. Souter  What difference does it make?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Because the trial judge has got a problem, and it doesn't matter whether he was on medication or not on medication.  He was saying things like the things Justice Ginsburg has just read.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, a great... frankly, a great deal of psychiatric testimony is irreconcilable with the facts.  Psychiatric testimony can be found for either side of any issue in cases like this.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Mr. Stancil, I'm not sure that I'm following your argument, Because if I understand your most recent answers to these questions, it is no longer your position that an individual who is not disruptive, but merely incoherent and making the trial farcical by his incoherent responses or actions... it is no longer your position that an individual who is merely incoherent could be forced in the midst a trial, after this has been demonstrated, to accept standby counsel to manage the trial.  And, yet a moment ago I thought that was one of the fail safe devices that you were arguing for.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So to the disruptive point?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Somebody who is totally polite to the Court, who does not scream and yell, who talks only when he is allowed to talk, but talks total and complete nonsense, can never be replaced, in your view, by a standby counsel in the middle of the trial after this has been shown to be the way he's acting; isn't that correct?   David H. Souter  How about ""yes"" or ""no""?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  In your judgment, was the Dusky determination in this case erroneous?

0,"David H. Souter  Well, isn't... isn't the difference that, in Holmes, it was the textual basis ""by reason of"" through which the... as we read it... the proximate cause standard was... was brought into the statute.  Here, in fact, there... there isn't any text, it seems to me, that you can... can rely on.  The fact of fraud itself doesn't do it because the statute speaks in terms of an offense for which an individual should be prosecuted.  So it's looking to the criminal rather than the civil model.  And isn't that the distinction, in effect, a textual distinction, between Holmes as a means for importing proximate cause and the statute in this case as a means for importing first-party reliance?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why hasn't it done so simply or sufficiently done so by referring to the... in effect... the criminal mail fraud violation?   David H. Souter  Yes, but we didn't have... I don't think we had in those cases the phrase that occurs here.  I think the phrase here is ""could be prosecuted or indicted"" for something... I think it was prosecution... which tends to narrow it down to the criminal model, rather than allowing us to roam into the civil field.   David H. Souter  Okay.  Well, that means that to that extent the criminal... in effect... the criminal cause of action is narrowed down.  It doesn't follow from that that the statute contemplated adopting a civil model regardless.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You're going to have to help me do that.   David H. Souter  No, but--   David H. Souter  --But isn't the problem with your argument that if this isn't direct enough, there is no injury at all?  The county isn't hurt by this.  The county has got its rotational scheme basically to avoid favoring particular bidders who appear in multiple guises, but the county isn't getting hurt.  So that if it's not direct enough for... for the Plaintiffs in this case to sue, then nobody has a direct enough interest or can show direct enough causation for RICO.   David H. Souter  But how could the property owner be hurt if there is... if we are dealing in a situation here in... in which the penalty is zero percent, and everybody is bidding zero percent, then this is a situation in which the property owner isn't going to get hurt no matter who ends up with it.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but that's the... that's the case here.  So if your direct-injury requirement, as you construe it, applies here, I think we are still left with a situation in which on these facts, nobody would be injured, because nobody... or nobody would be... be able to prove injury by a sufficient direct route to establish causation.

1,"David H. Souter  Well, that's not strictly correct.  I mean, it ""paid or approved"".   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --which means there is a third way, and the third way of reading it is if the sub makes the false statement to the general contractor in order ultimately to get a false claim, i.e., the ultimate contractor's claim for conforming work, approved or this particular claim approved by the government when the government makes the ultimate decision to pay the general contractor, that would be covered by (2).   David H. Souter  But that can simply be done by the false claim to the general contractor, who either accepts it as true or, for that matter, knowingly understands that it is false, and ultimately submits the same claim, i.e., as an element of its ultimate bill for the whole project.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  With respect, I think there is a limiting point.  You are certainly right when you talk about the thousands of contracts that the government ultimately makes or finances for the benefit of lower units of government.  But it does not follow from the government's theory that if the United States makes grants to a sub unit of government, not for the purpose of a given contract or a given project, it simply makes grants, revenue sharing sorts of things, it doesn't follow from the government's position that when one of those sub units of government then makes a contract spending part of that money, that it's covered by this statute.  This statute would cover the myriad of grants made for particular contracts.  It would not cover every subset of funds in a lower government unit, some of which had been contributed by the national government.   ",07-214X

If in fact a fraudulent claim was presented to that agency, it would fall within the qui tam statute?   David H. Souter  Right, no strings attached.   David H. Souter  Why wouldn't there be?   David H. Souter  No, but when your salary is paid, in effect the government's interest stops when it pays for your labor.

1,"David H. Souter  Why should that be?  I mean, why should there be a different rule?  Let's assume... I mean I'll assume for the sake of argument that The Amiable Nancy does not settle the issue absolutely.  Why, then, should the... and it doesn't, it seems to me, settle this distinction at all.  So why should there be a distinction between corporations generally and maritime corporations?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, isn't... isn't part of the reason, at least for the assumption that there's a distinction, something that I think was mentioned in The Amiable Nancy?  And that is in those days, when a ship put to sea, the ship was sort of a floating world by itself.  And the... the contact with the shipowner was simply gone until the thing came back into port again.  That is certainly not the case today, and we know it's not the case in the circumstances here.  So if the... if the relationship to the corporation, to the CEO, if you will, and the captain of a vessel is not in any way different from the relationship of the CEO and, say, a division chief of a corporation, I don't see why that distinction should hold today.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That may be an argument for no punitive damages, but I don't see why it's an argument for distinguishing between maritime corporations and others.  I mean, other... other kinds of enterprises have a lot of risk in them, too.  And I'm missing the distinction there.   INTERRUPTING David H.

Souter  Mr. Fisher, the problem I have... maybe it isn't a problem I have, but a question that that argument raises is this: We know something now that Justice Story did not know, and that is we've had an awful lot more experience with punitive damages practice.  And we've spent the last decade or so of this Court dealing with the problem of how to set constitutional limits for awards which sort of by most people's standards verged on the excessive.  The problem that we've had... we've had two problems in coming up with those constitutional standards: One is we can't simply substitute ourselves as lawmakers for the State.  We're talking about constitutional limits, not optimum standards.  And number two, given those limits on us, we have not been able to come up with anything that could be called determinant standards.  We've never, for example, found a sufficient reason constitutionally to put an absolute ratio kind of limit on it.  But here, as you were pointing out earlier, we're sitting as a kind of common law court.  We are in the position of the States here.  Why shouldn't we recognize the difficulty of trying to deal with indeterminate limits which we've proven in the constitutional context and say, therefore, we've simply got to come up with a number, because no other way is going to give us any kind of an administrable standard; and our number... and I'm not saying this should be it... but our number is going to be double the compensatory damages?

I mean, if you take your two thirds figure and so on, isn't it fair to say that you're probably going to get down to something like 10,000 people or 10,000 plus who are going to be affected in the sense that they're going to have to scurry around if, if they're going to get the appropriate ID?

Souter  May I go back to another point, which is to the same point, and that is consistent with your emphasis on the people was your emphasis a moment ago on the distinction between keeping and bearing arms.  The ""keep"" part sounds in your, in your mind at least, to speak of an individual right not necessarily limited by, by the exigencies of military service.  My question is, if that is correct and ""keep"" should be read as, in effect, an independent guarantee, then what is served by the phrase ""and bear""?  In other words, if the people can keep them and they have them there for use in the militia as well as to hunt deer, why do we... why do we have to have a further reference in there to a right to bear as well as to keep arms?  And my point is it sounds to me as though ""keep and bear"" forms one phrase rather than two.  But I want to know what your answer is to that.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But wait a minute.  You're not saying that if somebody goes hunting deer he is bearing arms, or are you?   INTERRUPTING David H.

INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but they didn't... they didn't limit it to self-defense.

And that raises a question that I had about how Lowenfield ought to be read.  The example that you gave was one of the five instances which the Court said out in the Lowenfield opinion quoting the Louisiana statute.  In each of those five instances, nothing need be proved except, as you have put it, the narrowing circumstance in the law enforcement officer in your example.  But under the Louisiana statute which passed muster in Lowenfield, there were five analogs of which the law enforcement officer was one.  Each of those crimes was defined as a killing with a specific intent to kill or specific intent to inflict great bodily harm.  And then in each one of these instances, there was an extra element added: Law enforcement officer, intent to kill more than three people in Lowenfield, and so on.  In fact, child under 12 was one of the examples.  It seems to me that the... one way to read the Louisiana statute there consistently with the... with the value that Justice Scalia's question raised is this: That Louisiana, in effect, had created a general crime of murder with specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm.  And then it had given five instances in which, as I put it a moment ago, there was an extra element: And that extra element, whether it be killing more than two people, whether it be killing a child under 12, law enforcement officer, functioned like the aggravating circumstance; so that, in fact, we didn't have a statute that merely said if you kill a law officer intentionally, that's capital, period.  What we had was a capital scheme that says if you kill with specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm, that's murder.  And if you commit one of these other five other elements, that narrows it down to capital murder.  Isn't that a proper way of reading the Louisiana murder statute from which you took your example?  And if it is, isn't that example inconsistent with the theory that you're arguing here that you can simply define child rape as capital and let it go at that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I quite agree with that.  My point was just this: You made the argument... as I understood it a moment ago... that the Louisiana child rape statute is not unique; that, in fact, Louisiana defines other crimes very narrowly, so that you were making a different kind of argument.  You were saying we in Louisiana define murder of a law enforcement officer very narrowly.  No requirement to add any narrowing or aggravating circumstance there, and the statute passed muster.  And my point simply is, I don't think that's the way to read the Louisiana statute.  The Louisiana statute instead says killing with intent et cetera is... is capital murder if there is a further circumstance added to it; and five are given.  So all I'm saying is I don't think the fact that your capital murder passed muster under Lowenfield is authority for saying that the child rape statute passes muster here.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, let's find out how much.  [Laughter]   David H. Souter  And isn't... isn't the difference... isn't the difference just what Justice Scalia brought up in an earlier question to Mr. Fisher?  He said what seems to count, the way we have targeted our jurisprudence, turns on how you define the class that is narrowed.  And my suggestion to you was that the class that is narrowed under your homicide statute is a class that consist of all killing with specific intent to kill et cetera, which is then narrowed by five different circumstances set out.  Here, the class is defined as child murder, and there is nothing in the aggravating circumstances, the possible aggravating circumstances that narrows it any more; and isn't that distinction correct?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What do you say about the effect of Enmund and Tison as a... as a means to understand how we ought to read Coker?  You know what I'm getting at.

1,"David H. Souter  What if you had a case and there's a suspicion of something like that that's here, although the courts below did not so find?  What if you had a case in... like this in which the first litigant said to the second, I brought my case and I lost.  I want you to try again for me?  And if you do and you win, I will give you a job making use of the fruits of the litigation?  Would there be an estoppel in that case?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why.   David H. Souter  It held, as I recall, specifically, I think, that there was no collusion found.  And the suggestion was that if collusion had been found... and I was giving you an example of something that I would call collusion at least... that the result might have been different.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why wouldn't my example have done so?  In my example the agreement was I lost; please try again for me.  And if you win, I'm going to give you a job making use of the fruits of the lawsuit.  Would that agreement not have been enough to... to sustain a collusion here?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why should that... why should that matter?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Right.  But if we adopted... as I understand it, if we adopted your theory across the board, it would preclude... it would preclude a preclusion in the case of my hypothetical, and that's what I want to get at.  Should we, by adopting your theory, eliminate the possibility of preclusion in the case that I put to you?  And you're saying, I guess: Well, if... even there, there should be no preclusion unless the first party controlled the case in the... controlled the second case.  And my question is: Why?   David H. Souter  Well, do you think that the collusion point was perhaps just ill-phrased here?  There was no collusion, certainly, in the sense that there was any kind of secret dealing going on.  The second lawsuit, the people involved in it, couldn't Taylor... couldn't have been more candid, I guess, about what was going on.  And so there was no collusion in the sense of concealment or underhandedness.  Do you think that is perhaps the reason that the court of appeals found that there was no collusion; and that, therefore, we ought to discount that finding?   David H. Souter  But here the close relationship seems to boil down to this, and you correct me if I'm wrong here because I may be missing some fact.  But it is inconceivable to me that any reason for Taylor's participation or Taylor's bringing this lawsuit could be found except the reason of trying to relitigate Herrick's lawsuit so that Taylor would then either get the job or have an easier time fulfilling the job of fixing up the airplane.  I can't think of any other reason on the facts as I understand them from the briefs.  Is there a... on the facts of case, any other possible reason?   David H. Souter  Okay.  But why else would he be doing... why else would he have been doing this?  What does the record show as another possible explanation?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But if somebody walked in off the street and began this lawsuit and had absolutely no connection with Herrick, and so on, the issue of preclusion wouldn't come up, or at least it wouldn't come up in the context that it comes up here.  But this isn't somebody who walked in off the street, and the claim is there is a preclusion doctrine because of the relationship between party one and party two.  And the fact that anybody who comes in off the street could have asked... could have made the same request, in effect, is not an answer to the collusion claim; is it?   ",07-371X

And I don't see that we're the appropriate court to draw it.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  But at no point did the D.C.

0,"David H. Souter  Well, are you saying that the... that the regulatory authority could be broader than the adjudicatory authority?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but if that kind of implicit consent applies in the tax context, I don't see why in theory it doesn't apply in the situation we've got here.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  If somebody is going to do business with the tribe, with tribal members, in a way that affects the tribe on the reservation, it makes just as much sense to say, well, they implicitly consent not to discriminate against tribal members because of their Indian status.   David H. Souter  Well, I thought it was implicit in the tax situation, as you responded to Justice Ginsburg's question.   David H. Souter  All right.  Let me take another example, the other explicit example from Montana, which mentioned taxing and licensing.  Are you saying that if a... in any particular activity, say, running a filling station or advertising oneself as a certified mechanic in the... at the filling station on the reservation, and the tribe says, well, we are going to license mechanics to make sure they are competent.  Are you saying that there has got to be an explicit agreement to the licensing in order for the tribe to enforce its licensing restriction against somebody who goes to work for that gas station?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  Then, that's... that's implicit consent then, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  He doesn't sign a document saying ""I consent""; he just goes to work.  And your answer says, okay, that's enough to catch him on licensing.  In Justice Ginsburg's example, if they started doing business, that's enough to catch them on taxation.  And if that is so, why isn't tribal dealing sufficient in effect to supply an implicit consent not to discriminate?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  All right.  Why draw the line where you want to draw it?  We've got a line in which the... I'll put a blank, the ""X"" consent... what did we want... whatever adjective we want suffices for taxation and it suffices for licensing.  Why doesn't it suffice for nondiscrimination?  Why do we draw the line where you want it drawn?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Mr. Banker, you several times have raised a point which seems to me to go to the nature of the first exception in Montana on an issue we haven't discussed yet, and I want to get clear on it.  You have emphasized consistently through your argument the need for consent whether we call it actual, explicit, some kind of consent to at least the regulatory jurisdiction upon which a judicial jurisdiction is premised.  And my understanding is that that's not what... I don't have Montana in front of me, but my understanding is that that is not what Montana, in effect said with respect to the... to the first exception.  As I recall what the court said in Montana it was that there may be situations in which a nonmember enters into a consensual relationship with the tribe or tribal members, and as a result of that consensual relationship, it then would be appropriate to recognize jurisdiction, for example, to tax regulatory jurisdiction.  My understanding is that the consent that Montana was talking about was not a consent to the specific jurisdiction whether it be regulatory or adjudicatory, but rather consent to some kind of, or a consent forming some kind of a relationship that would make it appropriate for the tribe to assert regulatory jurisdiction.  So that the consent does not have to relate to jurisdiction as such.  Am I... if that is correct, then your argument for consent seems to me to miss the point.  But maybe I'm missing the point of... of Montana.  What is your response to that?   David H. Souter  But the point of my question was do you agree that there... within the... the description of the exception in Montana, that there need not be a consent, either to the regulation or to an adjudicatory jurisdiction to enforce the regulation?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So you're saying the Montana exception has been modified by later cases.   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  But if that's your argument what's left of the first exception?   David H. Souter  So the first... but as I understand it the first exception would have no independent application unless the second exception were met... were satisfied, i.e., there was a tribal need based on self-government, economic self-protection and so on which, which would in effect validate the tribe's attempt to regulate, which seems in effect to say that everything turns on the second exception, not the first.

0,"David H. Souter  Mr. Hillier, I... you know, I will accept maybe more than just for the sake of argument that if you stick to the text alone you've got an argument here for some uncertainty, for some ambiguity.  The trouble that I have with your argument is that we're here to consider not only text but statutory history, And the statutory history seems to me pretty tough for you to get over.  The statute was amended.  The word ""unlawfully"" was dropped from it, and there was no amendment made, with respect to its cognates, to conform it to the cognate section on carrying a gun that specified ""in relation to"".  And it seems to me that the most reasonable inference to draw from that statutory history is that when Congress amended and technically re-enacted the statute, when it dropped ""unlawfully"", that it did not want ""during"" to be read, as it was in the handgun statute, ""in relation to"".  And I... that's seems to me the tough point of the argument.  What is your response to that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  The different object... I mean, the trouble with the different object argument is, as the Attorney General said, there was an evident concern in amending the handgun statute not to sweep in the rogue police officer who happens to have a gun on him when he does something that in fact is unlawful.   David H. Souter  The negative inference from that is that there was an intent in the cognate explosives statute to sweep in people, whether in fact it was in relation to or not in relation to.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay, fair enough so far as the argument goes.  But that still leaves Congress taking the... sort of making it as difficult as possible for you to take the position that you're taking, rather than as easy as possible.

0,"David H. Souter  Mr. Kneedler, don't we have to assess the need for -- for showing a specific threatened injury on a -- on a somewhat elastic standard in a case like this?  Because the claim is made on the other side that if we do not allow, if we do not find standing to challenge the regulation per se, there are going to be a number of specific instances which in practical terms can never be challenged when that regulation is applied.  There were one or two instances, as I recall, of cases in which on your theory there could be no challenge because the announcement of the action was made on the very date that the action was taken.  So that if we do not find sufficient elasticity and standing to allow a challenge to the regulation on behalf of people of the sort that Justice Breyer described, there will, in fact, be a preclusion of any challenge to a lot of specific actions.  What's your answer to that?   David H. Souter  Assume for the sake of argument that it is made in this case.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What should you respond?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But your response to that is going to be, I presume, that in fact, absent a specific activity before the court, the -- the challenge is not ripe.  So that if you are going to stick to your position elsewhere in this case, they are going to fail in that enterprise.   David H. Souter  He doesn't know that in advance.  That is the premise of Justice Stevens's question, and it is the premise of mine.  There -- the point is being made by them that this happened so fast that the threat has been realized before they could respond to it.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I will -- I will assume for sake of argument it is the exception, not the rule.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Let's assume we have got the exceptional case.  Would there be standing?   David H. Souter  So that if in Justice Stevens's hypo one could show that there had been three or four or five instances of action so fast it was impossible to challenge it, there would with that as a predicate be standing to challenge the regulation as these people are trying to challenge it?

1,"David H. Souter  Well, discrimination, when you say ""discrimination"", I take it you're meaning discrimination not confined to the discrete categories of racial, age, et cetera.  You're talking about discrimination for any purpose.  And therefore, it seems to me that when you say the government cannot discriminate, I think, in effect, you're saying a government supervisor cannot fire somebody simply because he does not like that person, because that's a discrimination in relation to the people that the supervisor does like; is that correct.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Right.  It's not government efficiency; I just don't want to be around this person.   David H. Souter  Then it is the case, then, that if you prevail in this case, that the notion of paradigmatic, at-will employment within the government in any State that recognizes that now, that will, in fact, be eliminated to... to the degree that there is a... a class-of-one cause of action.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I thought you just agreed that it would happen in the hypothetical because as I... and maybe I do not understand at-will employment, but I thought the concept of at-will employment was that the individual could be fired for a good reason, a bad reason or no reason at all.  Somewhere in that trinity we get Justice Breyer's hypothetical: I don't like him.  And you're saying that won't pass muster, but it would pass muster under an at-will employment rule.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Can we... can we meet your objection--   David H. Souter  --Would it meet your concern if we held number one, yes, there may be a class of claim in the public employment context, but any reason that would be a lawful reason for discharge under the at-will rule is a... a reason that would satisfy the test; and therefore it would be the real outlier that would ever get to the jury?   Lisa S. Blatt  Well, in the at-will context, if an employer says you're fired and gives no reason, that's legitimate; but in their case at least by the time a lawyer is hired and the case goes to court, the State is having... has to articulate a basis that could be second-guessed.  If you write... if you are going to apply class-of-one and write a very broad opinion saying almost anything goes in the employment context, that's certainly preferable than having us go to juries based on pretext and bad motive, which is what happened in this case.  But I still think it would impose a for-cause requirement that's inconsistent with your due process cases, which presuppose that the personnel entitlement must spring from someplace other than the Constitution.   David H. Souter  Well, let me ask you this.  I mean, I wasn't trying a trick question but I... let me be explicit about this.  If we adopted the rule that said anything that goes under the at-will rule goes under equal protection class of one, would there be anything left?   Lisa S. Blatt  No.   David H. Souter  Okay.  So the reason is, if we opted that rule you'd win across the board.   Lisa S. Blatt  Yes.  Unless you leave... right.  There is not point.  I mean the at-will rule is that no reason be given, or it could be a bad reason.  And if there is any concern about the line drawing, I would urge you just to look at the verdict form in this case.  All that was submitted to the jury, after there was the rejection of the national origin, the gender, the race, the color, the retaliation for reporting sexual harassment, was just a simple case of without any rational basis, and solely for arbitrary, vindictive or malicious reasons.   David H.

0,"David H. Souter  No, the reasoning here, Mr. Katsas, it seems to me implicates exactly what Justice Breyer brings up.  We had a colloquy earlier on -- on the extent of the reliance by the BIA for its general policy on Fedorenko, and what the does a see cite mean and so on.  But in -- in this particular case, going to page 6a or 7a from which Mr. Pincus was -- was earlier quoting, if you look on page 7a, the reason that Fedorenko is thought to be appropriate here is, he -- that is to say, the Petitioner here -- has not demonstrated his conduct is distinguishable from that of the alien in that case.  The conduct of the alien in that case was identified as relevant by the voluntary/involuntary distinction.  It was so identified because of the text of the statute, voluntary was used in one place; it wasn't used in the place where the bar was set up.  So that it seems to me that by the express reasoning in this case, this case is governed by a rule that in effect says the distinction between voluntary and involuntary action is not a relevant distinction.  So I don't think you can get by in this case without confronting just what Justice Breyer says.  And I don't see how you can answer his point in this case without admitting that Fedorenko in fact was -- was improvidently relied upon, because it's not good authority here.   David H. Souter  This is not really consistency with Fedorenko.  This -- in this case the BIA is saying that he cannot say that his conduct in effect is different from the conduct in Fedorenko.  And what was relevant about the Fedorenko conduct was it did not have to be voluntary conduct.  So it is bringing -- it seems to me, the reasoning in this case is relying upon a rule that says that the voluntary/involuntary distinction is not significant.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Which answers Justice Breyer's question.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I doubt it, but go ahead.  [Laughter]   David H. Souter  Right.   David H. Souter  But one thing that Congress has not done and it didn't do it in this Act, is to make the express voluntary/involuntary distinction textually that the DPA made in Fedorenko.  And it seems to me that the reasoning set out in this case says this is exactly like the Fedorenko situation; that implies that the same rule in Fedorenko should apply.  If the same rule applies, presumably it should be on the basis of a statute which is identical on the -- on the textual voluntariness point to the statute in Fedorenko.  This one -- this one is not.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, you don't have the voluntary/involuntary distinction here in -- or -- in textual treatment that you had in -- in the DPA statute in Fedorenko, do you?   David H. Souter  You don't -- you don't follow that with the section that uses the word ""voluntary"", whereas the bar does not use the word ""voluntary"", right?   David H. Souter  Can you--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --Can you give me a couple of examples of the voluntariness that creates in effect the same distinction here as under the DPA?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Was that passed as part of the same legislation that created the bar section we are dealing with?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But it's -- I don't want to split hairs here, but I mean the voluntary return behavior is a behavior of the alien in this country with respect to, in effect, an election under existing federal law; whereas, the voluntary/involuntary distinction in the DPA was a distinction that referred to the alien's conduct overseas at the relevant time.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You have convinced me there are contrasts, but I am not sure that they are contrasts that raise the implication in a clear way as it was raised in the DPA.

Why do you assume it will not affect conduct here?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Don't you think it's probable that it will affect conduct?  I mean, if the police know that they are going to lose the case because they are engaging in a negligent or objectively unreasonable way in -- in relation to their warrant-keeping, they are going to be more careful.

Souter  Because in the course of doing incidental searches, they find things.  They know that, and we know that.   INTERRUPTING David H.

If there are isolated incidents of that are we going to -- are we going to say that in fact that does not violate the Fourth Amendment?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  We're starting with the assumption that there is a violation of the -- I think we're starting with background law at this point that there is a violation of the Fourth Amendment if there is an arrest without probable cause or without a valid warrant.   David H. Souter  The warrant itself may be subject to attack, but at least that's sort of the front line of our objective reasonableness inquiry.  And you're making a dent in the warrant requirement for isolated incidents, and I don't see why we can't or why coherence would not require us to make the same dent in the probable cause requirement for equally isolated mistakes.

Souter  But I take it if you're not accepting -- if you're not accepting -- I mean, you're not accepting the proposition that the 13 percent error rate which is not somehow shown to be non-negligent should have a different result, you are saying in the 13 percent case we're still not going to suppress.   David H. Souter  But if you -- if you were to make that argument and it came down to that bald a proposition, I assume you would come in with some kind of evidentiary basis to tell us exactly what the cost is.  And you have spoken of the cost today.  You have not spoken of the benefit and the value of having relatively error-free arrest recordkeeping.  But I haven't heard anything about the unreasonable cost of the exclusionary rule--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --beyond the record.   David H. Souter  Sure, sure it is.  But that does not even get us to, as it were, to half the equation.  We want to be know how much of that there is and we want to be able to measure against that the value that society is getting by requiring valid arrest warrants and in a probable cause case by requiring probable cause.  And you can't just walk in and say, well, there's a cost.  We know there's a cost.   David H. Souter  Don't you think we should if we are in effect -- if you are making what sounds to me like an empirical argument -- there is a cost to society, cases are being lost, criminals are going free -- don't you think that we ought to have a factual basis to know what that cost is?   David H. Souter  We've done an exclusionary rule now and in effect you are arguing for an exception to it because the cost is too great, and it seems to me the burden is on you to tell us what the cost figure is.   David H. Souter  But if you take that argument to the extreme, we won't have an exclusionary rule at all, I suppose.   David H. Souter  But don't you take -- I understood you to take the position and I thought the Court had previously taken the position that the cost benefit analysis had to be a systemic one.   David H. Souter  No, I think that's -- I think that's true.  I mean, we operate -- quite think frankly we operate on the basis of a -- of a good guess and I think your argument is saying let's have -- let's have an exception to the good guess.  And if -- if you start with a good guess as the baseline it seems to me you -- you ought to have something more than another guess to justify the exception.   INTERRUPTING ",07-513X

1,"David H. Souter  Well, there may -- there may not be, but let me on that score, take you back to an answer that Mr. Olson gave.  Assume for the moment, for the sake of the question, that we were to read this the way Justice Kennedy and Justice Breyer suggested, and that is to draw a distinction between the reference -- the now reference between recognition and jurisdiction and say that the now refers to jurisdiction and it refers to the time of passage.  If that is the way we read it, should we remand this case to the circuit?  Mr. Olson said no.  There is no claim that, in fact, the tribe was, in fact, under jurisdiction at the time of passage.  What is your answer?   David H. Souter  Well, tell us what you want us to do.   David H. Souter  In any case, you are not here to represent that, in fact, we may assume that there was no jurisdiction over the tribe at the time of the passage?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, if it hasn't -- if it hasn't, then you're not in the position to make the representation that Mr. Olson -- I think Mr. Olson's answer suggested would be a correct one.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I'm sorry.  Are we in a position to -- to draw or accept that conclusion here?  I mean, that -- that wasn't worked out.  Shouldn't we remand and have that specifically addressed and specifically address the question of jurisdiction?   David H. Souter  Well, you were -- you were saying that the -- that a distinction simply had not been drawn at the BIA level, I guess, between jurisdiction and recognition.  And I don't think -- I don't think we are in a position to say, yes, that's so or, no, that isn't so.  So that would seem to me to argue for a remand in and of itself.   INTERRUPTING David H.

0,"David H. Souter  Well, we do have a -- we do obviously require a justification for the bright-line rule itself.  And -- and the problem that this case raises, I think, if anything more acutely than any of the others that we've had recently, is that it seems if -- if your position is -- is going to be accepted, to divorce the search totally from the justification for the Chimel rule.  And -- and at some point we've either got to say, all right, it's no longer a Chimel rule, there's some other justification for the bright-line rule; or we've got to say, to purport to apply the Chimel rule in a case like this, handcuffed in the back of the police car and so on, is -- is to turn the law into nonsense.  And -- and I -- I think we've got that choice in front of us.  Do we have a new and different rule, or do we apply Chimel and say, you just can't go this far.  This is like the station house.

Do you know of any one of those cases in which the person who got out of the police cruiser made a beeline for -- for his own car?  In fact, so far as I know, we are -- we are not even sure that those people came out of automobiles before they were put in a police cruiser.

1,"David H. Souter  Yes, but why can't you make exactly the same kind of analysis here?  People here are not showing up for work.  They are staying home and getting retirement benefits.  And every day a person who was out for 90 days because of a physical illness other than pregnancy is getting a retirement benefit with an extra dollar.  And everybody who was out -- who was out for 90 days for maternity is only getting an extra 33 cents.  And -- and why isn't the payment of the retirement benefit exactly on par with the payment of the salary in Bazemore?   David H. Souter  Well, do you -- do you see Ledbetter in effect as -- as overruling Bazemore?   David H. Souter  And -- and at the time, in Bazemore, that the private employers discriminated for racial purposes, that was not unconstitutional or illegal, either.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but I mean, that -- with respect, I think that sort of begs the question because if Bazemore is the right template for analyzing this case, then you're not in compliance when you -- when your payment of the pension benefit reflects the pregnancy differential.   David H. Souter  Would you -- would you -- excuse me -- would you agree that if -- well, let me be less rhetorical about it.  What if Congress passed a statute providing that, starting one year from the effective date of the statute, no pension plan will differentiate in computing pension benefits on leaves taken between -- as between leaves taken for -- for conventional sickness and leaves taken for pregnancy.  Would that statute be unconstitutional?   David H. Souter  Yes.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  To make it retroactive.  Yes.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So your -- your argument simply is a -- a purely statutory construction argument: That isn't what Congress had in mind.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  If Congress would have had in mind, then there would be a question whether Congress could do it, and you agree that it could.  So the question is simply: Did it or didn't it in this case?   David H. Souter  Do you -- do you think Ledbetter modified or overruled Bazemore?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, why does it upset--   David H. Souter  --So far as pension benefits are concerned, it doesn't upset any employee's expectations.  The ones who don't have a pregnancy background are going to get the same pension that they -- they bargained for.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, but that -- I mean, that's -- that's an issue that you touched on, on your second point.  I don't know if it is a zero-sum game.  And if -- if I were faced with -- with a problem, and I may be, in which I really have two choices -- I've got two analogies in our cases, I can take either one, and there were evidence in here that the -- that this was going to be so traumatic to the pension system that it would be manifestly unfair and perhaps endanger benefits for others to force these benefits to be paid, that would be a good reason to go one way.  But I don't think we have that in the case.  And--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --And if we don't have it in the case, then this isn't a zero-sum game.   INTERRUPTING ",07-543X
0,"David H. Souter  The -- the point that is not true that -- that Justice Stevens is bringing out is that, in this case, you had a plan which was established at a time when the plan was -- was lawful.  And, in effect, you are saying there is -- there is no value to be given to any reliance interest on the part of the company that established the plan when it funded according -- prior to the passage of the Act, when -- when it -- it calculated it's funding on the basis of what was, in fact, lawful conduct.  And you are saying that is irrelevant.  You didn't have that factor in Bazemore.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, how would it do that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, you're -- you're not asking the Court to do that, are you?  You -- you're saying, look, pay -- pay pension benefits to these people exactly as they would have been calculated if, in fact, their pregnancy had been treated as whatever the regular sick leave was, so that they would get full credit for the time they were out.  You're -- you're not asking for any remedial order that gives them anything less than 100 percent of what they want.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  How -- how do we -- you think that?  How do we know that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  How do we know -- maybe -- maybe I can put the same question in a different way.  Let's assume -- and this isn't a bizarre assumption here -- that we've got two lines of cases, and we could rely on either of those lines of cases, go one way if -- if we rely on line a, and go another way if we rely on line b.  What are the good reasons, apart from simply statements of the cases themselves, to go with the one line or the other line?

0,"David H. Souter  They found the greater offense, so there would have been no need for them to go to the lesser included offense.  Your trouble is -- and I think the problem that we are having is that in finding the greater offense, they may have done so under a theory of accomplice liability that was consistent with the accomplice simply coming in at a late stage in the proceedings.   David H. Souter  I mean, that's the difficulty we are having.   David H. Souter  Right.   David H. Souter  I thought the, the difficulty with using that as a means of answering the first error was that the way the special circumstance instruction was phrased, they could have found the special circumstance without finding anything more than that he came in at a late stage.

One possibility under -- under the instruction at JA 13 is  ""or assisted in the crime of robbery.

Souter  --that might protect those who assigned their interest to the trust, but I don't offhand see what difference it would make, what difference those responsibilities would make vis a vis you and your client.   David H. Souter  But the real issue is not whether the trustee can sue.  The real issue is whether the trust can sue.   David H. Souter  It seems to me in his example if the trust can sue, why can't the aggregator sue?  And your answer was, well, trustees have certain responsibilities.  But I don't see that those responsibilities inure to the benefit of your client or to an opposing party in litigation that a trust brings.  So I don't see how it would differentiate it.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Could you explain that?  That really goes back to your answer in Justice Ginsburg's question and I'm not getting it.  She said why would you go to the Federal court if you can you go to the FCC, and you said, well, you get the benefits of being in Federal court.  What... I should be asking other counsel this question, but as you understand it what is the benefit of being in the Federal court rather than the FCC that makes this so attractive?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So you don't know of any benefits?   David H. Souter  You don't know of any benefits?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, you eliminate step one.  I mean, you go to the FCC, you win there, then you've got to face an appeal before the Federal courts.  Why not go right to the Federal courts immediately?  You eliminate one level of litigation.   David H. Souter  You also pay a price.  I thought that's what you were going to get at.  Talking about prudential standing, 1400 filing fees is pretty prudential.   David H. Souter  I'm sorry.  The only way, it seems to me, that you can eliminate what you regard as a problem is by having 1400 separate actions, so that in any given case if you want discovery, your plaintiff, the person who has got to provide that discovery, is standing right there.  And I don't see how you can get the benefits that you are claiming entitled to without having 1400 separate actions.  If you don't have 1400 separate actions, whether you have an aggregation like this, whether you have a joint action, whether you have a class action, this problem of chasing down, as you describe it, is going to be there.  So it seems to me the prudential question for this Court is: Do we really want to require 1400 separate actions so that you can have your perfect paradigm of private litigation?  And to say, yes, we want 1400 actions, it seems to me is a stretch.  What do you say?   David H. Souter  What does that have to do with... I guess that goes to prudential standing.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It has nothing to do with Article III standing.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Are you saying, in effect, that if we get to the prudential-standing point, the answer is that in the absence of a rule comparable to Rule 23 we should not recognize prudential standing, but that if we adopted a rule that sort of regulated how this would work, prudential standing would be appropriate?  Is that basically it?   ",07-552X
1,"David H. Souter  Mr. Englert, with respect to what weight we should give to those decisions, I just want to put a simple hypo and I'll ask a question on it.  Assume that in this case the assignment... well, assume another case, rather, in which the assignment is identical is identical to this one, except that the terms of the second agreement, i.e., if I the aggregator collect anything I give it to you.  Assume that is part of the first agreement, so that there is an assignment and as part of the assigning document there is a stated obligation on the part of the assignee to pay all proceeds to the assignor.  I am assuming that your position would be the same; is that correct?   David H. Souter  Now, my question is, you're taking that position, I think, just as you did in response to Justice Scalia, on the grounds that there is a huge body of law that assignment for collection conveys adequate standing.  But are any of the assignment for collection cases in that body of law clearly cases like the one in my hypothetical in which the assignment itself by its terms requires the total payment of any benefit back to the assignor?

0,"David H. Souter  Mr. Olson, doesn't your answer in effect, in practical terms, exclude the possibility of inserts like that?  I mean, what else would they be addressing except smoking and health?  That's the only subject on the table.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But, Mr. Olson, isn't the problem that Congress was equally clear, or has at least been assumed to be equally clear, in a contrary line of reasoning that holds against you?  And that line of reasoning is this: You agree -- everybody agrees -- that the FTC can represent -- it can regulate advertising and -- and supposed deception on matters that do affect -- relate to smoking and health.  It is pretty much hornbook law at this stage of the game that the -- that the FTC's regulation of deceptive advertising does not exclude State regulation of deceptive advertising as a general proposition.  In fact, the FTC is very happy to have complementary State regimes.  That state of the law is just as clear.  It is at least as clear as you say the language is here.  Now, given the fact that the FTC can regulate advertising of cigarettes in -- in the -- in the respect that matters here, why don't we have to give some recognition to this complementary regime of State regulation, which, as a general proposition, survives it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And all I'm saying is what we have here is, you say, a clear preemption provision.  But we also have a clear regulatory regime which is at odds with that preemption provision, and presumably we've got to give some effect to that, too.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, it's part of a national scheme, but in practical terms you can say that on any subject matter that the FTC regulates.  And, nonetheless, the complementary State regimes of -- of regulating deception survive.  So that the argument you are making here is an argument that can be made, I suppose, on every subject that the FTC touches.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Perhaps we did not think of it.   ",07-562X
1,"David H. Souter  How can you accept that and then expect to prove damages in the case?  You can accept it to this extent, it seems to me.  You can accept it in saying that what we are going to prove at step number one is that it is false to indicate that smoking light cigarettes will result in the ingestion of less tar and nicotine; and we know why you're saying that.  But in order to prove damages in your case, you would have to say: People get hurt because there is a relationship between the ingestion of tar and nicotine and their health; and the same cause -- the same causal connection is therefore appropriate for -- for -- is therefore necessary in order to prove that people were hurt.   David H. Souter  No, but you're asking for injunctive relief, I guess.   David H. Souter  And the reason -- and the reason the product is of different value is that in fact it is dangerous to health, as opposed to -- or more dangerous or equally dangerous to health as opposed to less dangerous to health; so that at the causation stage you've still got to prove the link between causation and health.   David H. Souter  Do you think you could recover if the evidence showed simply that all your clients had the health of Olympic athletes?   David H. Souter  You do?   INTERRUPTING David H.

0,"David H. Souter  Mr. Salvatore, you take the position that the only thing that is at stake here is simply, in effect, the selection of the arbitral forum.  What do you -- what do you say to the argument that, in fact, the -- under -- under the collective bargaining agreement, the employee is subject not merely to the right of the union to choose the arbitral forum, but, in fact, to -- to assert any claim at all?  What -- what is your answer to that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes.  What -- what--   David H. Souter  --Well, there is at least some.  The collective bargaining agreement is in here.  And if we are deciding anything at all, we are going to decide whether in this case the -- the Second Circuit was correct.  The question is posed in generality, but we are not going to decide the general question in total ignorance of this case.  And in this case, we've got the particular collective bargaining agreement in front of us, and you started to answer the question that -- that I and Justice Ginsburg posed by referring to the ""no discrimination"" clause.   David H. Souter  And will -- will you go on to that?   David H. Souter  Where did we get this phrase -- where do we get the language  ""or the union will turn over to them? ""  The only thing that I can see in here that addresses that is on page 46a.  And the -- the clause there reads:  ""All union claims are brought by the union alone, and no individual shall have the right to compromise or settle any claim without the written permission of the union. ""  There is -- there's a lot of gray area in that, but the one thing that seems clear is that the union has total control of any claim, including an arbitration claim.  And that seems to lend some substance to the -- to the point made by the other side that if we accept your position here, we are accepting a position not nearly -- that the designation -- a procedural designation of a forum should be enforced but that, in fact, total control over the assertion of a statutory Federal right is also being ceded.  Now, why doesn't that language from section 46 support that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, but it says ""all such claims"".  ""Such claims"" refers among other things to the statutory right.   David H. Souter  And if the statutory right is the appropriate section of an arbitration agreement and the union has ultimate control of the arbitration agreement, then it follows that the union has got ultimate control over the assertion of the statutory right.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Where -- where is the guarantee that the -- if the union says, we don't want to touch this, as in this case, that the employee has the right either to arbitrate or, for that matter, to sue?

1,"David H. Souter  But, even in a case in which you don't have -- let's assume -- just assume for the sake of argument that we don't have the discrimination issue or the conflict issue.  I understood you elsewhere to be arguing that there had to be the kind of knowing, intelligent, and individual waiver, which I would suppose a collective bargaining agreement will never include.  So I thought it was the -- ultimately the implication of your argument that in any -- in any case in which arbitration is claimed, there would have to be -- or a right to go to arbitration is claimed by the employer -- there would have to be, not merely the collective bargaining agreement, but a specific waiver by the employee to -- to go ahead and do that.  Is that correct?   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  Right.   David H. Souter  Go ahead.   David H. Souter  But the one thing that's uniform throughout in your answer is that the collective bargaining agreement alone can never subject the employee to -- to mandatory arbitration?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, but those -- I'm sorry.  Those examples are examples.  You're getting down to individual cases.  I thought you drew the global line in answer -- which would answer Justice Breyer's question by saying the -- in the cases that we're talking about here, Congress has passed a statute giving a specific individual right and that individual right cannot in effect be compromised except in -- except in violation of that statute, and that's where we draw the global line.  So that when you got to torts, you'd look at the individual situation rather than draw a categorical line.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I agree with you, but I think -- I don't want to put words in Justice Breyer's mouth--   David H. Souter  --But I thought what he was getting at is, if I hold for you here, am I going to have to hold for you in every case in which somebody has in effect a tort claim which is subject to an arbitration clause?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But doesn't it boil down -- doesn't your argument really boil down to this: That the only case in which it's really going to matter is the case in which the arbitration agreement contains a clause that gives the union plenary authority over the disposition of the claim?  And I say that for this reason.  If -- if this is outside the subject of mandatory bargaining, then the employer can impose it; in effect, as a matter of individual contract.  If it's within the subject of mandatory bargaining but it's not effective unless the employee also signs at the time of the incident or at the time he is hired an individual waiver, then, in fact, the only case in which it's going to make any difference as to whether you win or he wins is the case in which the agreement has got a clause in there that gives the union plenary authority to dispose of the claim.

This is something new, and this is in effect a warning to everybody that things have changed.  Isn't that a pretty clear indication that they are adopting a new policy?   David H. Souter  Well, one thing has changed.  One thing has changed, I think, from the record.  And let me ask you whether if the Commission had given this explanation it would in your judgment satisfy the arbitrary and capricious standard?  What if the Commission said, you know, our touchstone under prong 1 is community broadcast standards.  And we have assumed over the years that people really didn't get too exercised by the usage we have permitted.  But we are now getting all this mail from people who are very angry about it, and they find it extremely offensive.  And therefore, I guess our prior community broadcast standards were wrong.  We weren't taking into consideration the way people actually felt.  Now we know how they felt, because of the mail we are getting and we are changing our policy for that reason.  Leaving aside the Constitutional sufficiency of that, in the matter of arbitrary and capricious standards, would it satisfy it?   David H. Souter  Well, the raw APA standard issue is what we've got here.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  If that's--   David H. Souter  --If that's the case, then the concept of constitutional avoidance is -- is somehow out of this case and similar First Amendment cases, because we are always going to -- and I -- when you say you really cannot separate that precisely, we were always going to be getting into the constitutional issue, either expressly because we accept your view or covertly because we said, boy, we know what's around the corner.

Because you are saying, I think, prior to this -- prior to the change, the Commission interpreted ""indecency"" in terms of indecent practice.  And what the Commission is now doing is defining ""indecency"" in terms of the meaning of a word.

And I think my difficulty goes both to Chevron step one and step two.  And that is this: I think we all start from the premise that, whatever else subsection (b) had in mind, it was imposing some kind of a technology-driven standard criterion.  It's there in the words.  The difficulty that I have is if you are going to apply on at least a site-specific basis a cost-benefit analysis, I'm not sure how it would work.  In other words, it seems to me that when you're talking about the -- the possible harm from pulling in a few fish or a few plankton or a few baby clam larvae and so on, as against the cost conceivably of millions of dollars for extending intake pipes or putting technical -- expensive filtering mechanisms, you are dealing with such incommensurables that I don't know how on a site specific basis you would sensibly apply a cost-benefit analysis.  Are a thousand plankton worth a million dollars?  I don't know.  And my difficulty then is, I don't know how it would work.  And because I don't know how it would work, it seems to me that if you are going to apply a cost-benefit analysis, the odds are what you are going to do is basically eliminate the whole technology-driven point of the statute.  So that's my difficulty.  Can you help me out on that?   David H. Souter  Do we know so far as intake pipes are concerned?  I mean, maybe I am being foolish in thinking it's a little easy to make sense of it when we're talking about toxic discharges, but leaving that aside, do we know that, with respect to these kind of intake technology decisions, that the cost-benefit analysis has been in any way sensible?  In other words, maybe what Congress had in mind was this just doesn't work doing it on a site-specific cost-benefit analysis, and that's why we're going to pass subsection (b) in the first place.  So you say, well, we've had experience with cost-benefit analysis.  What's the experience?   David H. Souter  Yes.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And have these been applications of something more than the outside standard, which I guess everybody agrees would apply in a case like this, that when it just becomes wholly or outrageously disproportionate, there wouldn't be -- that there would in that sense be a cost-benefit cutoff?  These have been more subtle decisions than that?   David H. Souter  Right.  Yes.   David H. Souter  Isn't it easier to quantity that than the value of a plankton?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It is -- let me -- I will -- I will grant you that agencies purport to do this kind of thing.  But my question and I think Justice Ginsburg's question is, does it make any sense in these circumstances to think that you really can do a cost-benefit analysis?  And if the answer is no -- we have been purporting to do it but it really doesn't make a lot of sense -- then it either means that there is just going to be an irrational process going on, or it means that the technology-driven standard basically is going to be read right out of the statute, because you are always going to find some disproportion which is -- which is going to limit your use of technology.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then why didn't they use the word ""cost""?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I mean, your argument is they used ""cost"" here, they used ""cost"" there, they didn't use ""cost"" here, but they must have meant ""cost"".   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And maybe the inference to be drawn is the agency is not supposed to be taking any of these considerations into account.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You've got the -- I mean everybody agrees that there is kind of an ultimate irrationality standard here.  So that's -- that's not -- that -- that kind of a horrible is not really to the point.   ",07-588X
1,"David H. Souter  If ""availability"" -- if ""availability"" includes economic availability, why doesn't ""best"" include ""economically best""?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Our problem is that we -- you've got a clear distinction in mind, and I don't think we are getting the distinction.  Is the distinction in crude terms this: They can consider costs in the sense that on an industry-wide basis they can ask, is there money in the bank or will there be money in the bank to pay for this?  They don't ask cost-benefit in the sense of asking: Is the money in the bank worth what they are going to get for it?  So is -- is the line you are drawing a money in the bank line?  Is that the point you are making?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But is the only question -- when you say they can consider costs, are you saying they are simply asking whether it is economically possible for the industry to afford this, regardless of whether it's any good or not?   David H. Souter  Is that your point?   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  But is the variance a matter of statutory right or -- or is it available under a regulation?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why -- why isn't that simply another name for cost-benefit analysis?   David H. Souter  Well, you are doing it on cost-benefit.  You are saying--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --if we require this and the company goes bankrupt, the value of demanding it is not satisfied by the result.   David H. Souter  Well, is the reason they don't do cost-benefit analysis well because they are forced to do it in a political atmosphere in which it is difficult to make rational decisions?  Is that basically the reason Congress would have come to that conclusion?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Is that--   David H. Souter  --But I think -- I see your point, but I think if I accept your point, all I am doing is saying, they may in a kind of smoke and mirrors way take cost-benefit analysis into consideration sub rosa, when they decide what availability is going to mean; and they make take it into consideration when they decide what a -- a -- an undesirable environmental impact is; and that sort of gets the -- the weighing process out of the public focus.  And if they do it that way, they -- they can bring in just the considerations that Justice Breyer is talking about, but they don't do it in an obvious way.  And I think that's what your argument boils down to.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What costs are relevant to that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And when they made that decision, are they not in effect anticipating the kind of decision that they would make on a more specific basis in a more highly charged political atmosphere, if they engaged in the cost-benefit analysis that you say they can't do?

1,"David H. Souter  Well, have we ever had -- have we ever had a -- a kind of lab report, public record kind of case in -- in which the record was prepared expressly for trial?     David H. Souter  These other records, no, you haven't found them.     Lisa H. Schertler  I would -- I would be happy to, Justice Kennedy.  I -- I don't have information about California.  I do have information about the District of Columbia.  And I can tell the court that in the time period since the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that these sorts of certificates of analysis were testimonial, that the court appearances that have been required of DEA chemists at the Mid-Atlantic laboratory have increased by 500 percent, from seven to 10 appearances per month to routinely over 50 per month, and that the corresponding time that it takes to analyze substance has increased.  Thank you, Your Honor.   David H. Souter  Why don't you insist, even in that case, on the confrontation right to examine the person who actually conducted the test itself and generated the papers that the later expert testifies on in order to determine the admissibility of the -- of the -- the test results themselves?   David H. Souter  Okay.  All I wanted to know was whether you were giving that away or not.   ",07-591X
0,"David H. Souter  What is your answer to Mr. Fisher's argument that if that proposition of yours is -- is -- is, in fact, sound in response to this case, the State can put in its entire case by -- in a circumstantial evidence case, by way of affidavit and, in effect, satisfy the Confrontation Clause by saying, well, you can call the witness as part of the defense case and cross-examine there?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, then that's what you have got to explain to me.  Why is it an exception?   David H. Souter  Well, what about the -- the blue car going down the street statement?  In a circumstantial evidence case the witness comes in and says yes, I saw a blue car go down the street at 10 o'clock.  Is that testimonial?   David H. Souter  And the distinction between that and the lab report saying the substance that was shown to me which I analyzed was cocaine, what's the -- what's the distinction?   David H. Souter  Well, why--   David H. Souter  --Why does that make a difference?  In other words, the -- Justice Scalia said a moment ago, you know, the -- the statement about the blue car is -- is tied in in the hypothetical case by another witness who said yes, at -- at 10:01 when I heard the gun go off there was a blue car there.  In this case the cocaine is tied in by saying, yes, the cocaine which I delivered to X, about which he has testified, is cocaine that I took out of the pocket of the defendant.  There is -- there is a temporal and physical path worked out in both cases.  And it seems to me your attempt to distinguish them is to say well, the temporal path can be extended by one more step in the cocaine case because you can take the cocaine or take something from the cocaine sample and let the defense expert testify to it; which of course is true, but I don't see what that has got to do with the Confrontation Clause or the definition of testimonial evidence.   David H. Souter  But aren't you really saying that the confrontation right is therefore not so important because you have a greater opportunity in the cocaine case of coming up with -- with rebutting evidence, if indeed rebutting evidence can be found.  In other words, if -- if -- if the State's witness is wrong, you've got a better shot at proving him wrong than in the blue car case.  But if that is your argument, I don't see what it's got to do with -- with the basic confrontation right.     INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but Justice Harlan did not take the majority view.  I mean you -- I don't know where you get authority for the proposition that the public record prepared for the purpose of litigation would have come in under the, in effect, the founding era -- or would have been outside the founding era definition of testimonial.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but you say that, it seems to me, because you are -- and I think consistently -- making a distinction between credibility issues and reliability issues.  And I think you are implicitly saying the Confrontation Clause is there to test credibility but not reliability.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  The machine is reliable; therefore, it's outside of confrontation.  And I don't understand the validity of this distinction that is implicit in your answers.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, accuracy--   David H. Souter  --is an aspect of it.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Do you see any reason--   David H.

0,"David H. Souter  Well, do you take -- do you take that as -- as -- as meaning that the union couldn't buy litigation insurance?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Some of those -- some of those premiums are going to subsidize the defense in -- in -- in cases beyond this bargaining unit.  In fact, most of it will.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So -- so in your view, then, even if the agreement with the -- with the parent union in this case involved an explicit obligation on the part of the parent to come in and defend in -- if litigation arose in this unit, that would still be bad?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, I'm not interested in insults.  Is it -- is it constitutional, or isn't it?   David H. Souter  Then -- and -- and -- and you do take the position that a -- a genuine insurance policy issued by an insurer would not violate the constitutional standard?   David H. Souter  Well, there was -- there was mutuality of obligation in the hypothesis that I gave you in which the agreement with the parent union required an affirmative obligation of the parent union to come in and defend if litigation arose.  And you said that still would not be constitutional.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So the -- so the criterion has got to be something other than mutuality of obligation, right?   David H. Souter  And what is the other distinction?   David H. Souter  We -- we -- we start with that premise, but what is the other distinction, then?  If it is not mutuality of obligation, what -- what is the -- what is the -- the -- the -- the point that separates the -- the sheep from the goats here?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What -- what is -- what has rate setting got to do with -- with your basic point?  Your basic point, as I understand it, is that some of the money that's being taken from the -- from the local union and in our example subsidized by the service fee is being used to subsidize litigation for other unions.  And that is, it seems to me, exactly true in the insurance case.  Some of those premiums will subsidize litigation -- speech -- involving speech in -- in other union bargaining areas.  What's the distinction?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I don't know whether that's true or not.  If you buy labor litigation insurance I suppose it is not.  Don't they set their rates with respect to the experience in labor litigation, not in -- on their experience with automobile accidents.   David H. Souter  Neither do I.   David H. Souter  You have several times mentioned the public forum as having a significance in drawing the line and I'm not sure I follow you there.  Why did you say that?   David H. Souter  Let me ask you this.  If an employer and a union local decided that you know they would really let the sunshine in and they would conduct their collective bargaining in a theater with microphones and anybody could drop in and hear, would that change the chargibility of, as against the dissenting nonmembers.   ",07-610X
1,"David H. Souter  But aren't they, aren't they equal chargeable?  Isn't the unspoken premise of your argument and what Lehnert is getting at -- they are not only germane, but isn't there an unspoken premise that just as the union will support -- the union of the dissident objectors in negotiating a collective bargaining agreement, the union will also presumably support them if litigation is necessary later on to enforce it?  So that the so-called standard by which the union's obligation to support the litigation and the unit that includes the dissidents is not somehow precisely spelled out.  The assumption is that they do have some obligation to support the litigation if it comes to the dissidents' unit.  And isn't that -- isn't that the point of your argument?   David H. Souter  Which is a covenant, in effect, of support.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay, so there is no, there is no covenant of support.  There is what?  A covenant of support if the litigation in the local unit that includes the dissidents has wide significance, and therefore could affect other units?  Is that what the -- is that what the obligation is?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Is this any obligation at all?  You said okay, there is an obligation of some kind of fair dealing.  Given the question that we've got, that doesn't matter unless the fair dealing relates at some point to support for litigation, right?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Right?   David H. Souter  Okay.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And how do we articulate what that obligation is?  If it's not covenant to support regardless of what the litigation is, how do we articulate what the degree of the obligation of support is?   David H. Souter  Yes, but the trouble with saying that is exactly the point that the Chief Justice raised.  You don't take the position that no matter what the litigation is, the parent union has got to support it.  Therefore, how do we identify the litigation that they will support?  How do we know that they have any obligation at all?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, it doesn't create a guarantee expressed like the terms of an insurance policy, but there is, in fact, a local practice to which one can refer.  And it seems, it would seem reasonable in a case like that to say, okay, you can force the dissident to pay a fair share on the expectation that the same kind of enforcement litigation will take place if there is a dispute this year or next year.  We don't have, as I understand it, a clear sort of expectation standard when we are talking about affiliation agreements that involve a parent and many, many other locals.  And the point here, it seems to me, is to determine whether there is any obligation at all whether the dissident is getting anything or can expect to get anything for the fee.  And what I want to know is how do we describe that obligation?   INTERRUPTING ",07-610X

It will not look behind the Cubic judgment as such, will it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But that's an entirely separate proceeding.  Assuming the Cubic judgment has not been reversed through the appellate process that it is going through, then the tribunal will take the Cubic judgment as it finds it.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  Doesn't it make it pretty tough to say that the Cubic judgment is at issue?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I mean, I think we understand that.  And -- and it's clear that the United States, in effect, is taking the position that that's all we need to bear in mind.  But it suggests to me that the drafting of the statute did not go as far as it might have gone to protect the interests of the United States.   David H.

And that new judgment may or may not be satisfied by dealing with the prior judgment.  But that doesn't mean that the prior judgment is at issue; it simply means that the prior judgment may be used to discharge in an appropriate case an obligation which is determined in the later proceeding.     --If I may respond.  Your Honor, on that view, even the ACMR is not at issue before the tribunal, because the tribunal cannot order the United States to hand over the ACMR to Iran.  In the A/15 judgment to which Petitioner's counsel alluded earlier, the tribunal recognized that it is not a violation of the United States' obligations under the Algiers Accords not to issue an export license.

But I -- I thought when you are given the alternatives you were just giving, one 80 percent and two 40 percents, that because there is not a principle of maximization there simply is not an abstract or bright-line answer to the question; and that in order to get an answer to the question, you look at all of the other things that districting authorities look to, and you see how they add up, whether we are talking about compactness, congruency with -- with -- with other political lines, and so on.

But I -- I think your brother conceded that when -- when you draw a district, you are bound by our case law as well as tradition to look to something more than maximization, and maximization is in fact not the law.  So I don't see why it would be required.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What's that got to do with maximization?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  There is no question that if they are -- if they win this case, I think there is no question there will be more claims requiring -- or potentially more claims requiring adjustment of lines based on avoiding section 2 violation.  I would almost think that was common ground.  But that is a different thing from saying that the result of those claims is going to be a required maximization.  And that's -- that's the only point that I -- that I meant to pick -- pick up on.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You are saying they will tend to maximization in order to avoid litigation.   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H.

Souter  But -- but you are saying it's an opportunity, and what you mean is it is sufficient to provide an opportunity.  And Justice Breyer's question is: Isn't the two-to-one ratio something that we should consider as also being sufficient to provide an opportunity?   INTERRUPTING David H.

1,"David H. Souter  Well, it seems to me that misses the point of the case.  I mean, the point of the case is that consent to the police was established, consent to police informants was not, and that when I consent I am not consenting to the -- to the whole world.  If I am consenting to somebody who is not a police officer, that is not equivalent to consenting to a police officer.  That's the point of the case; and as I understand it, there was -- there was only one case at the time that this occurred which equated the confidential informant for the police with the police; and that was the Seventh Circuit case; isn't that correct?   David H. Souter  No, but that -- that equates -- in terms of existing law, that equates the government agent, which in this case is not a police officer, but a confidential informant, with a police officer.  And it seems to me that is the nub of the case: Is that person equivalent, so that consent to one in effect is consent to as many police as want to come in, or is it not the case?  And it seems to me what you have got to argue here is that the confidential informant and the police officer for Fourth Amendment purposes should be treated as identical.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And there is no clear law on that.  That's why we are here.  There's one -- at the time that this search was made, as I understand it, there was only one case which held there was such an equivalence, is that correct?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, first -- I want to hear what you say, but tell me, is it correct that at that time there was one case that held the equivalence?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Which was not a circuit case, right?   David H. Souter  District case?   David H. Souter  So there were three circuit court holdings that the confidential informant was equivalent to a police officer?   David H. Souter  Okay, did you -- now, do you have other circuits that held that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Where is Pollard from?   David H. Souter  Sixth.   David H. Souter  Okay.  Now why -- why are they correct?  Why should the confidential informant be treated as equivalent to a police officer?   David H. Souter  He was trying -- and he was trying to make a deal to get leniency with the police.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But you -- you certainly cannot argue -- maybe you are, but I don't see how can you argue in response to Justice Ginsburg that the integrity to be expected from a confidential informant, taking that as a category of law including all sorts of informants, is the integrity that we would expect in a police officer.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why can't I?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then if that -- if that is true, as it clearly is, they run the gamut from the good to the bad.  You can't make -- adopt the proposition categorically that confidential informants should be regarded as having the same integrity as a police officer.   David H. Souter  We're talking about probable cause.  If they got a warrant within an hour or two of the time that that informant says he saw them there, do you seriously question whether there would be probable cause?   David H. Souter  But we're asking for the basis.  You're asking for a rule and our questions go to the reason for having that rule.  And the officers may have said -- and I will assume they said -- in this case: Oh, gee, we weren't sure the drugs would still be there.  But in terms of probable cause law, that's just not a serious answer, is it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  They don't even need an anticipatory warrant.  They need a warrant to go in and search that place on the grounds that there are probably drugs there, and if they saw drugs there a couple of hours beforehand and they had no affirmative evidence which they should bring forward under the Frank standard to indicate that the drugs were being taken out, is there any serious question that probable cause would be found?   David H. Souter  An informant just came out and said there were drugs there and they don't have probable cause?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why not?   David H. Souter  The reason the police are being faulted is that they didn't get a warrant.  And the warrant requirement is a generally good starting place for a Fourth Amendment argument.  Justice Ginsburg's point is that if they had an informant who had seen drugs in the place within two hours, they had, if they'd been before a magistrate, the basis in probable cause to get a warrant.  And I still haven't heard why in fact they couldn't have got one or why they didn't have the probable cause.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I'm not interested in what they personally believed.  We're talking about objective Fourth Amendment standards.  Did they or did they not have a basis to establish probable cause at that point?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That is--   David H. Souter  --I will admit that is the most astonishing view of probable cause I have heard in this courtroom.  Of course they had.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why doesn't it?   David H. Souter  Why doesn't it?  As I understand, the record evidence is that their informant was in that guy's home, and within two hours of the point that we went through, the second entry, he had seen drugs.  Why wasn't there probable cause within that two-hour period?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Is that a reasonable belief?   David H. Souter  I mean, we're talking about probable cause, not an establishment of mathematical certainty.   David H. Souter  They clearly would have been if they had sent a police officer in.  You're asking us to extend the police officer rule to include a confidential informant rule.  One reason for doing so is, or would be, that in practical terms there is a need for it.  Justice Ginsburg's question was, why is there a need for it, when they could have gotten a warrant?  And we still haven't heard an answer.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then why didn't they use the confidential informant to get a warrant?   David H. Souter  That doesn't--   David H. Souter  But if our question is should consent once removed be recognized as a doctrine that covers the confidential informant in this case, one question that we may sensibly ask is, is there a need to recognize that broad a consent doctrine?  And one question that would bear on that would be, in these cases, is there difficulty or impossibility of getting a warrant under normal probable cause standards?  And I think that was the point of Justice Ginsburg's question.  Do you doubt that they could have gotten a warrant within the two-hour period?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But isn't the reason it's insubstantial is that we have a rule for independent reasons having nothing necessarily to do with this kind of situation in which one officer's knowledge is regarded as another officer's knowledge.  The police are regarded as a group, so that we have a rule ready, in place, saying: You show one, you have shown the whole department.  We don't, however, have any such rule with respect to agents generally.   ",07-751X
0,"David H. Souter  Mr. Metzler, what do you say to this line of reasoning, we have in prior cases adopted the positions that for purposes of establishing probable cause, the knowledge of one police officer is also the knowledge of all police officers, at least within a department or working on a particular problem.  So that if in a case in which there is a search without a warrant, if you add up everything that individual officers knew and that amounts to probable cause, then the search is good.  Why don't we apply, in effect, the same rule in the hypothetical case that you have been given, which is a police officer who was admitted by consent and there are other police officers outside.  At the point at which the police officer who has been admitted has the knowledge necessary for an arrest and has that knowledge as a result of the invitation and the waiver of privacy as to him, why don't we regard that on sort of general doctrinal grounds as a waiver of privacy with respect to the police in general, just as we regard police knowledge as being imputed to all police officers?  That way you don't have the problem that, for example, Justice Kennedy's hypo raises, even in the case of exigent circumstances.  But it doesn't open the door to what you were objecting to here.  Why isn't that a proper solution or proper answer to this hypo?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, you are absolutely right in terms of his psychological process, the only person he has invited in is the one person.  The reason for coming up with the answer I suggested is a broader doctrinal reason.  That is the reason that we have for probable cause purposes regarded the police -- or the knowledge of one police officer as the knowledge for all.  Why don't we, for the same reasons, since it is privacy that is at stake in all of these cases, regard the invitation of one police officer as the invitation of all, or to all?   David H. Souter  It would be consent to one officer plus a doctrinal basis to construe that consent for Fourth Amendment purposes as a broader consent.   David H. Souter  That's what we would be doing.  We wouldn't be doing it because the individual in the trailer says I am inviting in the whole L.A. police department.  We are doing it because he invites one L.A. police officer in, and we have doctrinal basis for regarding the police, as it were, collectively rather than individually for probable cause purposes when privacy is at stake.   David H. Souter  Would it not open the door to, I guess, to what you are objecting to?   David H. Souter  Right.  I think I may have created this problem for you and -- and maybe I -- I should get you out of it.  [Laughter]  I'm not suggesting that the probable cause rule is what is operative here.  I'm saying that for probable cause purposes we regard the police collectively, and why, since our privacy is at stake there and is at stake here -- why shouldn't we have a collective consent rule, too?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That -- that's my proposal.   ",07-751X
0,"David H. Souter  Yes, but isn't the problem on your side of the case that there was another  ""in for a dime, in for a dollar. ""  argument and that was the hypothetical holding the hands behind the back while some third party slugged the victim?  And on that hypothetical, there was no reference to a definite crime.  In that hypothetical the victim was killed, and under that hypothetical, there was no reference to the crime, i.e., homicide, and so it seems to me that the prosecutor's arguments, the dime-dollar arguments, went both ways.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Sure, in that case.  But there was another one in which the prosecutor didn't do that.   David H. Souter  I did -- maybe I dreamed this.  I thought the prosecutor also gave as a dime for a dollar example the example of the individual, the accomplice who holds a victim's hands while a third party slugs the victim and in fact kills the victim.  And I thought in that hypothetical argument the prosecutor was saying that the -- that the accomplice was an accomplice to homicide, even though he didn't know at the time the assault started that homicide was intended or would result.   David H. Souter  Well, if you take the argument as a whole you've got at best an ambiguous argument.  You've got an argument that points to a ""the crime"" interpretation and you've got an argument part of which points to an ""any crime"" interpretation, and to the extent that your case may ultimately turn on the significance of the prosecutor's argument, it seems to me that the benefit of the doubt goes to the defendant.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Maybe I'm beating a dead horse, but it seems to me that what we've brought in our questions from the bench is that that is not correct.  In one instance the prosecutor clearly tied it to shooting.  If that's all we had before us we wouldn't have an argument.  But in the other iteration of the dime-dollar argument, the prosecutor didn't tie it to shooting.   David H. Souter  Well, excuse me.  DA issue, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What's the answer to my question?  I mean ""the"" and ""a"" are references to what the accomplice had in mind at the time of acting.  That's an intent issue.   David H. Souter  Well, isn't -- isn't the argument for objective unreasonableness, number one, to begin with, what you just stated.  Of course, there is some ambiguity there.  I'll be candid to say that if I were stating it myself, I would say there is more than some ambiguity here.  It seems to be, if not misleading, at least incapable of informing a jury of exactly what the law is.  Number two, the -- the second point in the argument is, the jury comes back repeatedly, and although, as you point out, it is -- it may well be a proper answer to a jury request for clarification to say, go back and read the instruction; the answer is there.  When it has been demonstrated by repeated jury questions that they are just not getting it, that they still have perplexity, the court has got to do something more than just say, oh, go back and do it again.  And number three, in this situation in which there is ambiguity, there is a demonstration of jury confusion.  There is an argument by the prosecutor which, in fact, is a two-part argument or a two-example argument and it cuts both ways, isn't it objectively reasonable to say under those circumstances that there was an inadequate instruction to the jury in -- in the correct Washington law?   David H. Souter  Then -- then what would it take?   David H. Souter  And you could say, yes, it would be reasonable to say that, but it would also be reasonable to say -- to say otherwise, right?   David H. Souter  The -- the ""opposite"" in this case would mean that the jury was properly instructed and was in a position adequately to understand Washington law correctly?  That's the -- that's the opposite position.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I want to know what you mean.  That's what you mean by the ""opposite position""?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Would you -- you are saying you want -- why don't you answer my question?  My question is: I think you're telling me that it would be objectively reasonable to say that on the scenario I just laid out the jury probably understood Washington law correctly.   David H. Souter  And that way would be the way we just set out, wasn't it: That the jury, if -- if -- if, in fact, it's objectively reasonable to conclude that the jury did understand Washington law correctly on those circumstances, then -- then the -- the Respondent here cannot win in -- in his collateral attack?

0,"David H. Souter  Are there district court... there must be... district court cases in which the State trial court has invalidated on some State constitutional ground legislation redistricting that has been passed by the legislature?  When that happens, have those opinions been precleared?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But isn't the reason that there would be no reason to preclear them?  I mean, if the State court invalidates legislative redistricting, and does so before there has been a preclearance request, in other words, if it gets into State court right off the bat, then there's no State law subsequently to ask the feds to preclear.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, I guess what I'm saying is your ""No"" answer does not prove much.  In other words, you're trying to make the case here that there is something extremely unusual about this.  And I thought your answer to Justice Scalia in effect was one reason that it's unusual is that we don't have any of these cases in, in which a State court has knocked out a State law that is then subject to some kind of preclearance review.  And my only point was, if I understand the situation, as long as the preclearance review had not preceded the State constitutionality judgment, following the State constitutionality judgment there would be no law to take to Washington, whether it be to... to the Justice Department or to... or to the Court, and ask to have precleared.  So the fact that there are no such cases doesn't prove anything.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, that may be--   David H. Souter  --There never would have been perhaps preclearance if it got it right soon enough.   David H. Souter  Well, but if the... if the challenging parties go into court at the first opportunity and you don't have an election sort of coming up next week, I would suppose that in cases like that, the State would at least allow the State litigation to proceed to some level.  And if in point of fact that State litigation resulted in a declaration that the new statute was unconstitutional in some fashion, one would not expect the State then to bull ahead and ask for preclearance, as opposed to trying either to appeal at the State level or to correct the statute.   David H. Souter  I will assume that.   ",07-77XX
1,"David H. Souter  It locks it in.   David H. Souter  May I ask: You're not... correct me if I'm wrong.  I didn't think you were arguing that because of the preclearance followed by the State determination of unconstitutionality, that the State was required to follow that unconstitution law.  I thought your argument simply was that, in effect, there was a stalemate at that point, and the State was going to have to come up with some new law that would be precleared.  Am I correct?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And isn't the answer that no law would be in effect?  I mean, you're in the same situation then that you would be in if there had been no judicial litigation going on, the law had been brought to the Justice Department or the D.C. court, had... preclearance had been refused.  The State at that point didn't have the old law because it had been repealed.  It couldn't apply the new law because it wasn't precleared, and somebody in Alabama would have to do something.  Aren't we in essentially the same position here?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, it was in force and effect.   David H.

0,"David H. Souter  Let's assume that's -- that's what they did mean.  I have to say I read it as broadly as Justice Scalia did, but let's -- let's narrow down the -- the Court's opinion to -- to -- to the claim that you are making right now.  Let me go back to the Chief Justice's hypothetical and add one minor detail.  Let's assume that in a given department they put into effect exactly the policy that you want.  They have a fine system of -- of data collection, far more sophisticated than three by five cards, and the -- the boss D.A. says everybody in this office ought to know what kind of deals are being made and offered at all times.  And they have such a system.  And the boss D.A. also says and don't you disclose one word of it ever in any case.  We are going to defy Giglio.  If he made that or gave that order so that in every case there would be a defiance of Giglio, even though the facts were known, would he have absolute immunity?   David H. Souter  That's right.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, you know if in a given case, if they had this system, and the lawyer comes to him and says, okay, I've consulted our system and I realize we that have got a Giglio obligation.  And the boss D.A. says: Forget it.  Don't tell him a word.  There would be absolute immunity, wouldn't there?   David H. Souter  Okay.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Why would the -- why would the answer be any different if he says don't bother me with particular cases?  I am telling you right now what the answer is going to be in every case in which we have a Giglio obligation and that is, bury it.  Presumably there would be absolute immunity, wouldn't there?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What's your answer?   David H. Souter  The trouble is if you don't have an answer to that hypothetical, then we got to leave open the possibilities as far as your case is concerned that he would have absolute immunity in that case.  And if he would have absolute immunity in that case, then the -- the -- the reason for allowing anything less than absolute immunity with respect to this data collection obligation reduces down to something like an almost a silly point.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  If you can get everything you want, and all the prosecutor has got to say is: Keep it under your hat and there is going to be absolute immunity and nobody gets anything.  What is -- what is to be gained by that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But if the backroom function is reduced to an absolute nullity by an immunized decision to -- to bury the Giglio information in every case, then I don't see the point of saying there's no immunity for the supposed backroom function, because nothing will be accomplished even if there is no absolute immunity.   INTERRUPTING ",07-854X
0,"David H. Souter  No.  Please.   David H. Souter  And don't -- don't you suffer from -- doesn't your position suffer from a -- a more serious problem that doesn't even implicate the pre-emption doctrine?  And that is, as I understand your argument, the -- the local governments are creatures of the State.  Their powers are the powers that the State gives them by statute, as -- as you were pointing out.  The same thing is true for corporations.  Corporations are creatures of the State.  They have the powers, and only the powers, that the State gives to them.  It -- it seems to me, going back to Justice Stevens's initial question, that I don't see where the distinction lies between the -- in effect, the position of the local-government units and corporations, and -- and between the local-government units and the corporations.  And it seems to me that that's a problem for you quite apart from any application of Federal law.   David H. Souter  Well, it has distinct rights under the First Amendment if State law creates a corporate form of -- of -- of business organization.  And the -- the -- when -- when it comes into existence, it then does acquire some rights under the national Constitution.  But if in the first instance it's a creature of State law, its powers, generally speaking, are the powers that State law gives it.  And that is -- that same proposition is true of counties and towns and -- and other sub-State governmental units.   David H. Souter  All right.  Then -- then it seems to me that your argument is not that State law controls what it may do and defines its powers.  Your argument, it seems to me, has to rest upon the fact that what it is doing is a public, as opposed to a private, function.  And that's the extent of the argument.  Isn't that true?   David H. Souter  That's the only distinction that you can maintain.  You can't maintain the distinction based upon the superiority of State law in defining the -- the extent of the governmental unit's powers and so on, because that is just as true of a corporation.  So your distinction has simply got to be a distinction based on the nature of the function that is being performed.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What -- what do you mean by the ""nature of""--   David H. Souter  --Yes, it's doing -- it's doing a governmental job.   David H. Souter  We understand what that is, so I understand that point.   David H. Souter  No.  But -- it -- it is, but I mean when you say, as I think you are now saying, the -- the law for the State to be the law for the subdivision because they are both governmental, the counter-argument is, in fact, there are resemblances to private organizations, too.  And those resemblances are, in effect, their creation and definition by State law; their enjoyment of the powers, and only those powers, which State law gives them; so that, in fact, there is -- there is not only an analogy with the State government, there is an analogy with private corporations, too.  And the question is why should we choose one analogy rather than the other analogy?   David H. Souter  No, but another way of looking at it is to say in each of these instances -- whether we are talking about the State taxing in order to perform functions at the State level or whether the State is authorizing taxation for functions for functions to be performed at the local level -- in all of these instances, the State is in the position to say not that it is sort of our money, but to say it is public money.  And our decision is that public money will not be used to -- by a public entity to underwrite political activity.  And why isn't the State in exactly the same position in making that judgment, whether it's talking about money that goes directly into the State coffer or public tax money that happens to be going into a -- a town coffer?     INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, but the point in the case that you concede that the government may make that choice is that the government is subsidizing it by the activity which the government is refusing to perform.  So it's not nearly a case of saying there shall be this kind of speech and not that kind of speech.  In each instance there is a decision being made in my hypothetical that the government will not subsidize that kind of activity, that kind of speech, by using public money.     Jeremiah A. Collins  If I may answer that question, Mr. Chief Justice?  It's correct that where a law is based on employee behavior, that other kinds of scrutiny can be involved.  Darcetti is, obviously if it's speech in your capacity of doing your job.  But the Hatch Act cases, letter carriers use the Pickering balance.  That's not a mere reasonableness test by a long shot.  That's a comparison as in the NT -- National Treasury Employees honoraria case, same situation, a balancing test between the harm that's perceived from allowing the speech and the benefits of the speech to the individual.  So, there can be that separate analysis, which if it were applied here, the State would also fail.  The State, it says it only prevails under a reasonableness test.  But none of those are near reasonableness analyses.   ",07-869X
1,"David H. Souter  But I'm -- I'm asking you why shouldn't--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --Why shouldn't we, on the theory that what is important is not which particular coffer the penny goes into, but the fact that it is public money, i.e., money being raised from taxpayers under a statute passed by the State authorizing taxation; and it is going to -- and its justification for taxation is the performance of public functions.  And if the State can say it is not a proper public function when the money is being filtered through our particular treasury, why isn't it equally valid for the State legislature to say that when the money is being filtered through a local treasury?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but what you're saying is, I -- you're saying in effect that I -- that you reject my -- my hypothetical assumption here, that what we ought to regard as the proper characterization of the money is not ""our"" State money, but public money raised under a system of public taxation; and you're saying you should not go -- you should not characterize the funds that way.  Of course that's your position--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --because if you do characterize the funds that way, it seems to me you're in trouble.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But why shouldn't I characterize them that way?   David H.

0,"David H. Souter  Well, didn't we furnish the premise for that broader reasoning?  Because we pointed out that the traditional role of the jury was standing in effect as the buffer between the power of the State and the individual, and our concern in the Apprendi cases was that the concept of elements was being manipulated in such a way that the jury no longer stood in that -- in effect, that buffer position.  And I guess the question here would be, is there -- is there room for -- in effect, for manipulation by the law in the consecutive sentencing scheme or the potential consecutive sentencing scheme, so that the jury in effect loses control over the length, the ultimate length of time that an individual is going to serve?  What is your response to that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but isn't the problem with that argument the problem that Justice Scalia raised a moment ago, where you could have made the same argument with respect to a mandatory State guideline, but nonetheless, the change in the law brought to bear on the new law an old concept.  And this is a change in the law, to be sure.  I agree with you, historically.  The judges -- once consecutive sentencing came in at all, they were free to, in effect, do what they wanted to, subject to some kind of a rule of reason.  But we've got to apply the Apprendi concept and the concern of the jury trial right to this new situation.  So I don't think it's an answer to say, well, the judge has never had such a -- such a power.   David H. Souter  But we defined in effect what was the functional element of the greater offense in terms of the -- the power or the capacity of the judge to increase the sentence beyond the range that would have been -- that would have established the maximum in the absence of that factfinding, right?   David H. Souter  All right.  And aren't we in exactly the same position here?  Because the defendant here can correctly say: I cannot be sentenced to the more onerous -- under a more onerous scheme of consecutive sentencing unless some fact is found which has not been found by the jury in coming to verdicts of guilty in any of these crimes; a further fact must be found to expose me to the heavier penalty.  And that is exactly the same as the situation in Apprendi with one possible exception; and that is, do you accept, as I thought you did, the proposition that consecutive sentencing is the heavier penalty or is a more onerous sentencing alternative.  If you accept that, I don't see how you would escape the analogy with Apprendi.   David H. Souter  Everybody agrees.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  If you had a choice between two concurrent sentences and two consecutive sentences, you know which one you are going to choose.  So we -- we know what is the heavier sentence or the heavier sentencing option.   David H. Souter  But the mandatory minimum is at least within the range of sentencing possibilities that the judge could impose anyway without any further factfinding by the jury.   ",07-901X

We start, number one, with a definition, as I understand it, of ""pollutant"" that includes suspended solids.  Number two, there is an existing regulation to the effect that wastewater from this particular method of -- of extracting gold shall -- shall simply not be released, shall not be put into -- into water bodies.  And then the two agencies come along, and in effect they say, by regulation, if the suspended solid in effect comes out of a mine, or if the wastewater has got suspended solid in it, we are going to call it fill and leave it entirely to the Army engineers under 404, subject to an EPA veto.  And on the face of it, it sounds as though they are simply, number one, defining one -- one variant of pollution out of the EPA's jurisdiction and, number two, with respect to the wastewater, in effect coming up with a contradictory determination about what should be done with it.  And it sounds as though, under the Administrative Procedure Act, that with the statutory and the regulatory regime on the one hand and this joint regulation on the other, you've simply got a flat contradiction, and queried whether that can be anything other than arbitrary and capricious under the APA.  Will you address that for--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --Well, let's -- let's assume -- and I -- I don't mean to cut you off there, but before you're done -- I am at least raising it because I find it very difficult to get a handle on this case without dealing with that problem.  So you may say, well, they didn't raise it well enough, but I -- I still want you to deal with it on the merits.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but that's -- that's pretty cold comfort when -- when you treat as an impoundment area a natural lake.  I -- I suppose if the -- if it's proper to do what they're doing here, then the lake in the middle of the Everglades is an impoundment area or our Great Salt Lake is an impoundment area.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  This is a long way from a settling pond.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but what's that -- what's that got to do with the definition of ""impoundment area""?

My understanding is -- and I didn't think it was seriously disputed here -- is that, during the period in which the deposits are going to be made, the natural life of this water body is going to be destroyed.   David H. Souter  And -- and the -- the Corps comes along and says, oh, when it's all over, you know, it will come back.  But when -- when you're destroying the -- the entire living sort of corpus of -- of this lake, it -- it seems to me that it's getting Orwellian to say that there -- there are rigorous environmental standards.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but the--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --But the -- as I understand it -- and you correct me if I am wrong here -- I -- I thought ""suspended solids"", I guess is the buzz word for it, is -- is a form of pollution.  So you're saying, well, we're destroying the fish with one form of pollution rather than another form of pollution.  And I don't know that that advances the ball for your side.   David H. Souter  Yes, but this comes back to my initial question.  You are simply, or the Corps is simply, defining what would otherwise be a pollutant, suspended solids discharged into the water, by calling it fill material.  And it -- in effect it's defining one subject of -- of discharge regulation right out of the law of the United States by -- by redefining it and saying, oh, well, it doesn't exist if it's coming out of a mine.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but if you applied the effects test, the legal effect, is it not, is to define one form of pollution as no longer existent so long as that form of pollution falls within the Corps of Engineers' definition of ""fill""?

0,"David H. Souter  I can -- I can understand your argument if you're saying, look, you can't tell simply from the text what the answer is.  You can only tell the answer if you say -- know what the answer is if you say Congress had victims in mind, and if we are going to worry about victims, we are not going to worry about -- we are going to take a narrow, rather than a broad, view of ""knowingly"".  Is that your position?  Do you agree that if you simply look at the text of this statute without considering congressional policy, you don't win?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, but does it -- does it even come close to supporting it?  I mean, let's start out with your narrowest position.  Your narrowest position is that the ""knowingly"" simply refers to the -- the -- the three acts which are specified by which the identification can -- can be -- the misidentification can be perpetrated.  Transfers, possesses, or uses.  Could Congress possibly have said, gee, he might not know that he was acting to transfer or to possess or to use?  That's not a serious possibility.  So, ""knowingly"" has to refer to something more than the three possible acts.  And once you get beyond the three possible acts, and you say, well, we're going to draw the line between ""without authority"" and ""another person"" -- that seems like an arbitrary line.  And the arbitrariness of the line seems even more obvious when the ""without lawful authority"" is set off as a parenthetical.  And the real object of the statute -- the real -- the operative description is  ""a means of identification of another person. ""  That's why, it seems to me that, if you look at the text, you could say, well, of course, the ""knowingly"" has got to refer to everything that follows, both ""lawful authority"" and ""another person"".  And that's why, it seems to me, if you're going to win, you've got to win on the grounds that Congress wouldn't have meant what seems so natural, because Congress wanted to help victims, not defendants.  Where am I going wrong there, if I'm going wrong?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But Is it worth two years?   David H. Souter  The only thing that we know for sure is that Congress said it's not worth two years' extra unless that of another person was involved.  And if that is what is so significant or necessarily significant in getting a two-year add-on, then it seems reasonable to suppose that Congress thought that the state of mind had to touch that.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  All Congress has got to do is to say ""recklessly"".   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It's an -- it's an accepted term.  Every -- well, almost everybody knows what it means.  There's a model Penal Code standard, and so on.  All they have to do is put the word ""recklessly"" in there.  It would cover every ""knowingly"" case.  It wouldn't omit anything that is covered by this, and it would solve precisely that problem.  And they didn't do it.   ",08-108X
0,"David H. Souter  I -- I don't see that the -- that the section 3 stay follows from that.  It may very well be that in whatever ultimate forum the case is thrashed out in that the -- that the non-signatories will be able to enforce the arbitration agreement.  The question here is whether they can get a stay in midstream in order to litigate that as a separate issue.  And one argument for saying that they should not, that the stay right should be limited to signatories, is that the policy of the -- the Federal Arbitration Act is to enforce arbitration agreements.  It is not a policy simply to promote arbitration under all possible circumstances.  It is a policy to enforce contracts because the contracts, in effect, were being given short shrift before the Act was passed.  If the policy is one to enforce contracts and, as Justice Ginsburg said, they had a chance to make an arbitration agreement and they didn't do it, then that is a good reason to say the Federal courts will not stay the proceedings in midstream for somebody who didn't get the agreement that that person could have gotten.  What is your answer to that argument?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Including -- and -- and you're saying that that covers, in effect, even a point of Federal procedure as to whether you get, in practical terms, an interlocutory appeal.  That's a question of State law?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And the question here is: What is the procedure to be followed in a Federal court when there is disagreement about that?  And to say that that is a question of State law strikes me as a stretch.   David H. Souter  May -- may I ask you this?  Let's assume State law said we -- we don't recognize stays at this stage of the game.  Therefore, we will not give a stay to anyone.  Would State law prevail?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But isn't that the problem?  That's what I'm getting at.  Isn't that the problem for you in this case?  Because you keep arguing that their substantive rights under the agreement are issues of State law, but the question before us is not one of ultimate substantive right.  At some point there will be an -- an appellate process open to them and they can assert those substantive rights if they didn't get them at trial.  The issue here is not substantive right.  The issue here is a procedural right, and it's a procedural right which depends upon the terms of the Federal statute, and that's why it seems to me that it may very well be that the Federal statute determines not only the procedural right, the stay, but who may ask for it, that being a sensible Federal question rather than a State question.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And your argument depends upon, as Justice Scalia pointed out a moment ago, reading section 2 as in effect incorporating State law for purposes of determining substantive rights.   David H. Souter  Okay, but that still begs the question whether the -- whether the incorporation of State law to determine substantive rights controls the question of what law determines procedural rights, when a Federal procedural right is claimed, which is what is involved here.   David H. Souter  And regardless of State law, the answer to the Federal question is independent of it.   David H. Souter  Then I'm -- I'm missing the logic of your argument.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But they are Federal procedural devices, and State law could not contradict them.  That's -- that's what we got into when I said what if State law said there could be no stay?  You agree at that point that of course the Federal law would prevail?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It would apply to what the judge is supposed to do at that moment when somebody says, I want a stay.  And the judge at that point consults Federal law, not State law, doesn't he?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, just stick to my question.  He says: I want a stay.  Does the judge look to State law or Federal law?   ",08-146X
1,"David H. Souter  Okay.  And what is the criterion for identifying a section 3 stay?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And your -- and your position is that the statute should be so construed that only a signatory to the written agreement has a right to the stay, indeed has a right to request the stay under article 3?   David H. Souter  What is your reason for saying that?   David H. Souter  Yes.   David H. Souter  Okay.  Why shouldn't the Federal law be even simpler than that?  And I -- I proposed one, and -- and probably because I don't understand the law well enough, it may -- may have been simply simplistic.  But my suggestion was the -- the issue before us should be construed narrowly as being the question: Who can ask for a stay?  And the answer to that would be only a person -- or one possible answer to that would be only a person who has signed the arbitration agreement, because the Federal policy is to enforce agreements, not force arbitration.  And, therefore, it is sensible as a matter of Federal policy to say, we're not going to stop this trial in mid-track for arbitration unless you who are asking for it to be stopped signed an arbitration agreement yourself, and it's that agreement that you're trying to enforce.  Now, that is maybe a -- a too simplistic approach, but tell me what's good or bad about that approach.   David H. Souter  Okay.  That opens the door to my simplistic theory.  Now--   David H. Souter  --is it a good theory or a bad theory?   David H. Souter  Okay.  But it seems to me that that's not enough, because ""under the written agreement"" leaves open the question of whether the written agreement can be enforced right here and now by getting a stay only by somebody who signed it or by a third-party beneficiary or -- or somebody dependent on the contract plus some other legal theory.  My simplistic suggestion was: Keep it simple and simply say the -- ""under the agreement"" means an agreement signed by you, and the reason we confine it to an agreement signed by you is not because the phrase ""under this agreement"" tells us that.  It doesn't.  That leaves the question open.  We say it is going to be confined to an agreement signed by you because that's really the -- the nub of the Federal policy.  We want to enforce agreements, and we want to confine this extraordinary remedy of a stay to people who went to enough trouble to make -- and I don't know whether that's a good idea or not.  And -- I mean it's favorable to you, so it's in your interest to say it's a good idea, but I may be getting into trouble by that.  And that's what I want you to tell me.   ",08-146X

0,"David H. Souter  I think we know from this case they're likely to bring charges.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but there's -- there's a difference here, and that is, as these cases illustrate, three phone calls for one trifling sale, two for another, this gives a kind of multiplier effect which it's -- it's hard to find a parallel for in the law.  We go from a misdemeanor to 12 years, depending on the fact that there were -- there were a couple of cell phone calls.  That is -- maybe -- maybe that is exactly what Congress intended, and maybe that's good law enforcement policy, but those are not sort of two intuitively obvious positions.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, what about the question?   David H. Souter  --he knows the difference, that -- he knows that he's committing a felony, and the possessor of a gram or less doesn't.   David H. Souter  Mr. Miller, in answer to one of Justice Breyer's earlier questions, he indicated that the premise of his question was the effect of the twin amendments from offense to felony and from felony to misdemeanor for possession of small quantities.  And he said, well, in effect, is -- is that combination of amendments really being rendered nugatory by the view that you take of the statute?  And you said not necessarily, and you said there may be some drug transactions in which it is a misdemeanor on both sides, so that the statute wouldn't apply there.  Are there any other -- are there many examples of that?  I thought not.  And are there any other examples of misdemeanor-misdemeanor cases that the -- that the statute would apply to so that -- so that the anomaly wouldn't be quite so obvious?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  In other words, how important is this?  It looks to us -- I mean, I think it was the premise of the question and it was -- it was my assumption coming in that your view of the statute largely renders those two amendments, or the combined effect of those two amendments, virtually nugatory.  And you said, well, not necessarily because there may be misdemeanor-misdemeanor cases.  And I want to know how many of them there are.  Is that really a significant area for the application or nonapplication of this statute?   David H. Souter  How many separate -- how many misdemeanor-misdemeanor combined offenses are there under the -- under the code?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You -- you don't have any figures on the number of actual prosecutions under -- under the -- in the misdemeanor-misdemeanor combination cases?   David H. Souter  So -- well, then, I guess that leads to my last question, and that is: Isn't it probably true that if we accept your view of the statute, then the effect of those two combined amendments, offense to -- to felony, felony to misdemeanor for small quantities, the -- the combined effect of -- of those two statutes is, in effect, rendered worthless in -- in most cases?  In the substantial number of cases to which the -- the communication facility statute would be applied.  It -- it would render those -- those two amendments, in effect, worthless?   David H. Souter  That may be the relevant inquiry, but what about my irrelevant inquiry?   David H. Souter  It's going to -- your -- your view of the statute is going to render those two amendments virtually dead letters.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Yes, but as you said -- as you said, they -- you don't have figures on the number of prosecutions.  And the number of prosecutions under those misdemeanors, as distinct from the number of applications of the communications statute to conventional buyer-seller transactions, is probably the difference between a very small set and a very large set of cases.  And in the very large set of cases, the two amendments are being rendered, in effect, worthless; isn't that true?   ",08-192X
0,"David H. Souter  I -- I thought the determination was that it had failed to provide funds that could reasonably accomplish the -- the -- the plan which the district itself had adopted.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But the district agreed on that, I take it.  The district said, you've got to do something.  This is our plan.  And I thought the district court then said -- the school district did that, and I thought the district court then said, well, the -- the funding that you have come up with, or the funding scheme you have come up with simply is not rationally related to the plan that you, yourself, have adopted.  Am I -- am I wrong on that?   David H. Souter  Okay.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, I -- help me out then.  I thought the -- the issue was not whether there had been any good faith attempt at compliance, but whether there were two deficiencies under the scheme, under the -- I forget the statute -- the new bill.  One deficiency was that it limited the funding for any given student subject to -- to ELL -- to two-year funding when, in fact, the evidence showed that you couldn't get a kid up to par with two years of education.  The second deficiency was that the -- that the State funds -- strike that, I'm sorry -- that Federal funds were being used to supplant what should have been a State responsibility rather than merely supplementing.  I take it that is simply a matter of degree, but that was the problem.  I thought those were the two problems, two-year funding, supplantation.  Am I -- am I wrong?  So there was no -- my point is that there was no denial that some good faith efforts had been made.  The finding was that there were two deficiencies and these were the two deficiencies; is that correct?   David H. Souter  Well, it should -- has the state law changed?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I mean, the reason -- the reason for getting into this is that the State required it.  Has the State law changed?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, we are not talking about -- I'm sorry.   David H. Souter  What is the district court supposed to do?  The attorney general for the State comes in and says, do it this way.  It seems to me that the State has no standing later on to say: Oh, gee, the district court should have said: Sorry, Mr. Attorney General; you don't know anything about your State law; we won't do it this way.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But that isn't what it -- I don't understand that it has ever said that.  I thought the funding point was basically this: You, Nogales, have come up with plan A.  You have come up with funding B.  Funding B is not enough money to fund plan A.  It is your plan, you've got to fund your plan.  That is not saying that the Federal statute requires a particular level of funding.  It's not saying that the district court can take over the responsibility of deciding what is appropriate funding in a school district.  It's simply saying,  ""If you choose plan A, you have got to pay for plan A. ""   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Am I -- am I wrong?  Did it ever go beyond that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  In other words, it should have said: Before I decide whether your funding for plan A is good enough, I have got to decide whether plan A itself is worth anything?  I mean, I have got to evaluate plan A?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  All right.  Let's go back to Justice Kennedy's point a moment ago.  Let's just talk about Nogales for a minute.  With respect to plan A, that was Nogales' plan.  And the district court said: You can't fund that plan with the amount of money that you have appropriated.  Did the district court go beyond that with respect to Nogales?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No.  But doesn't it -- doesn't it -- don't we come back to Justice Scalia's question of a moment ago?  Even with the -- the changed plan to immersion, isn't the finding that two years of funding per child is not enough?  And you are supplanting, not supplementing.  Isn't that still the problem?   David H. Souter  But those are the issues that the court focused on; are they not?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What has 60(b) got to do with the question of whether the attorney general represents the State before the court?  If the attorney general comes back into court and says, no longer do we want this statewide, then you've got an issue.  If the -- if the attorney general speaking for the State does not do that, then I don't see why Justice Scalia's point is not the answer.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So the district court is supposed to referee a fight between the governor and the attorney general at this point?  Is that what's going on?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Doesn't the attorney general speak for the State?   ",08-289X

1,"David H. Souter  Well, Mr. Ostrager, is -- help me out, because this is an issue of fact, and I don't have the record in front of me now.  But didn't the 1986 order expressly include permission for certain actions alleging insurer misconduct to proceed, those that had already been filed?   David H. Souter  I drew the implication from that that the -- that the bankruptcy court thought its order would be barring such actions if they had not already been filed.  Am I right on the -- on the -- at least on the record point?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But he was saying that -- in effect, that was simply articulating rather more than he had done the first time around and what he intended the first time around.   David H. Souter  How did they get the notice?  You say it's broad notice.  What exactly was done?   INTERRUPTING ",08-295X
0,"David H. Souter  What do you -- what do you make of the provision of the 1986 order to the effect that, as I understand it and as I asked your brother a moment ago, existing claims based upon misbehavior of the -- of the insurance company were not cut off?  The reasonable implication, I think, of that is that any future claims based upon insurance company misconduct would be cut off by the terms of the '86 order.  What -- what do you say about that implication?   David H. Souter  Yes, but it was prospective liability based upon misconduct of the insurance company, not merely derivative of -- of its insurance contract in -- in the conventional sense.   David H. Souter  Okay.  If that is -- if that is the case -- let's assume that that is -- that it was that narrow.  The fact remains, however, that at this point, as Justice Kennedy has suggested several times, my understanding is at least that you cannot collaterally attack the jurisdiction of the court who entered the order it did.  And the only claim that you can make now is that the order by its terms did not cover your cases.  Do you agree?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So it's a question of the scope of the order?   David H. Souter  Okay.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I didn't mean to cut you off.  I'm sorry.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  May I then raise a question there?  I mean, I think there is a legitimate question about that, given the -- given the rather general terms of the -- of the scope of the order.  And I would like your response to this.  It seems to me as a background consideration that we should have in mind in interpreting how broad that order was.  It's been raised a couple times; Justice Breyer raised it a moment ago.  And it's this: It is one argument to say that the bankruptcy court does not have jurisdiction and derivatively an order that it issued should not be interpreted to cover any claim that does not affect or cannot deplete the bankruptcy estate taken as a given fact at the time this later case is brought.  Another view of jurisdiction would be that the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction and hence an order might be interpreted to cover any cases which, if contemplated, would have precluded the settlement that created the bankruptcy estate.  If Travelers had thought that it was going to be liable for these cases of insurer misconduct, it might very well have said: We're not forking over X hundred millions of dollars, leaving this exposure open.  So that the bankruptcy estate would never have attained the size that it had attained if the -- if the insurer and everybody else had not understood that these later claims would be -- were being cut off.  Is that argument a relevant -- number one, is that a -- a legitimate jurisdictional argument?  And number two, is it a relevant argument that we should bear in mind -- in trying to figure out how broad the '86 order really was?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Everybody accepts it's at least that much.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But isn't it the case, to make sure I understand it, the Wise complaints are the -- are the exception?  They are the only complaints, as I understand it in this current round of litigation, that claims that the actual harm to them resulted from actions other than actions of Manville.  Is that correct?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, I understand -- or maybe I don't -- maybe I don't understand the -- every step in the liability claim.  My only question was, among the plaintiffs, is it correct that the only plaintiffs who claim they were hurt physically by asbestos as a result of the actions of somebody, the only ones who are claiming that the somebody was other than Manville are the Wise plaintiffs.  Is that correct?   David H. Souter  No?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Simply because of Manville's position in the--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --So that -- so that you are saying in effect everybody ultimately is claiming against Manville, the Wise plaintiffs and every other set of plaintiffs in this -- in this group of direct liability claimants?   David H. Souter  I -- I understand your cause of action.  Okay.  I don't want to--   ",08-295X
1,"David H. Souter  Mr. Feinerman, can we go back to the time frame again?  I've just got a question of fact.  I should know this, but I don't.  You said that if the -- if the parents and the school district disagree, it can be remedied fairly quickly because there's a fairly tight schedule set for the administrative procedure.  What I don't remember, and my question is this: When the administrative steps have been exhausted, if there is still disagreement, is there any limit on the time in which the -- the judicial appeal has to be resolved?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Isn't that the -- isn't that the kicker here?  In other words, I -- I fully understand your -- your textual argument.  I -- I can see its soundness as a possibility that is open to us and, perhaps on the face of it, the most likely possibility, but there is a cost, and the cost, it seems to me, is that once you get into the -- once you get into appeals, this thing can go on for years, and you can't wait years when -- when a kid is in this kind of condition.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What happens when we get to court?   David H. Souter  What happens when we get to court?  Isn't that when it turns into a matter of years?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  But I think we've got to assume that Congress has some concern for the parents who correctly say, this IEP is no good, it just can't be done in the school system, and the kid needs a special school.  In that case, maybe -- your answer may be that's the exceptional case and it shouldn't drive the -- the inferences to be drawn about congressional intent.  But in that case, if the district and the parents are at good faith loggerheads it can go on for a long, long time, can't it?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but they get the due process hearing.  The ultimate result is that the school proposes an IEP; the parents, based on what their experts tell them, say that isn't going to work, and the parents say the only way we can educate this kid without his falling behind more is to put him in a private school.  At that point, with assuming good faith here, it seems to me you get into court and it can go on for a long time, if we accept your -- your analysis of the text.   David H. Souter  Yes, but doesn't that get to the point of something pretty formalistic?  I mean, somebody in the brief said, given one day under the IEP and the -- if you win, ultimately the check can be written.  That can't be right.   David H. Souter  But you are basically saying that the -- that the only necessary delay in order to satisfy a condition for eligibility, if the parents otherwise prevail, is a ten-day delay.  That's basically your answer?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  But your position is that there are basically two situations: One, the situation in which there is an administrative order to do an IEP and the school district says, no, we won't do it.  Millions for defense; we are going right into appeal, and we are not going to prepare the IEP.  In that situation, as I understand it, you are saying, the parents have no way of getting relief under the statute.  In the case in which there is an order for the IEP and the school district prepares the IEP, even though the parents think it will be inadequate, there in fact is a ready remedy subject to two delays: One, the time to prepare the IEP; and, two, ten days to give it a try before the parents take the kid out of school.  That's basically the scheme that you are proposing that the statute provides; is -- is that correct?   ",08-305X
0,"David H. Souter  No, but the reference is to a right to be heard on certain subjects.  It doesn't say anything about authorizing a particular individual or officer within a school system to award relief.  The problem is, it says you can be heard.  It doesn't say who will tell you or who will tell the school district to write a check.   David H. Souter  But can you raise the -- you can raise the claim to eligibility to a -- a private education here without the hearing officer having the authority to order the school district to provide it.   David H. Souter  No, but it might make senses to say that the hearing officer can determine eligibility; it is then up to the school to pay it; and if the school does not pay it, then you have got to go into court and get an award.   David H. Souter  But the odds are that it would be under the plan.  I mean, what you say is theoretically possible, but in the real world it's probably going to be under the plan, isn't it?

0,"David H. Souter  Well, some -- some of those vessels, I take it, are taxed under other statutes.  Is that correct?   David H. Souter  Well, do you -- do you take the position -- let's say that if the State of Alaska taxed all the other property you had mentioned except for the tankers and the city taxed the tankers, that that would by definition be a discriminatory tax and/or on some other basis violate the Tonnage Clause?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, the reason I raised it was that -- that in -- in your response to my first question, you said, well, you didn't think the city was taxing these other -- these other pieces of property, and I'm -- I'm not sure why that is significant.   David H. Souter  How about the risk in the other direction, that the State will simply take over this tax and remit the proceeds to the city?  Would the result on your view be the same if it did that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Let's -- let's assume that you're -- that a given tanker came into the harbor at Valdez on one occasion and one occasion only.  Would the City of Valdez, under its own statutes, by the terms of its own ordinance, tax that ship?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, let me -- let me just change the question then.  If -- if it came in and sort of took half a tankful that didn't reach the point of a million dollars' value, there would be no tax then.  Is that correct?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Whatever it would take to get it under the minimum.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Okay.  Under the old tonnage laws, wouldn't that ship in the 18th century have been taxed?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, the -- the point that I am getting to is -- and I'd -- I'd like you to address this: One of the arguments on the other side is that one reason this should not be treated as a tonnage tax is that it relies upon the concept of a tax situs.  And the -- the implication is that not every ship that comes into the harbor is going to be subject to the tax; whereas, under the old tonnage laws, any ship that came in would be.  And what is -- what is your response to that argument?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Where do we -- where do we look to find this out?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Do you know of any source that we could look at to support the proposition that you just made?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What about a--   David H. Souter  --I thought you said earlier or implied earlier that we couldn't draw a distinction, really, between capacity and value because tonnage in the 18th century was simply a proxy for the -- for the value of the ship?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So a value tax is going to run into the same problem--   David H. Souter  --as a tonnage tax.   David H. Souter  What about the -- the broader tax situation at the -- at the -- in -- in 1789?  Did -- did ports have sources of -- or exercise the authority at that time to tax property generally, e.g., real estate in the city to support the activities of the ports, or were they dependent solely upon things like import-export taxes, et cetera?   David H. Souter  So -- so that the argument they are taxing other things, therefore it's okay to tax this, would have been an argument just as potent in the 18th century or impotent, as the case may be, as it is now?

1,"David H. Souter  But all you're saying--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --All you're saying is that there are other factors that -- that preclude using tonnage simply as a single crude measure.  But isn't it fair to say that, other things being equal -- the engine capacity, the hull construction, et cetera -- the tonnage is a rough measurement of the value of the ship, for just the reason that Justice Scalia gave?  It determines the amount of cargo the ship can carry, and what it can charge for it, and that is capitalized into the value of the ship.  Isn't that true?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That may be the only way they can accomplish what they want to.  Because as the Chief Justice's question suggested a moment ago, if in the 18th century the port of Boston said, we are not going to charge tonnage anymore, we are simply going to tax on the value of the ship, that is going to have exactly the same effect that a tonnage tax would have.  So maybe exemption is the only way it can be done.   INTERRUPTING ",08-310X
1,"David H. Souter  Exactly.  I mean, I (.) if (.) if you're basing it simply on your subjection to preclearance and there's no contest between you and the government over preclearing anything, I'm not sure why you would be in court.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then isn't (.) isn't that the time for litigating?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But it's not affecting anything you're doing on a day-to-day basis, as I understand it.  There's no claim that (.) that your district is doing anything improper.  No claim is being made against you.  And I guess your whole argument would be maybe some day we want to preclear again, and maybe we wouldn't be as successful as we had been in each of the instances before.  But I don't see how that gets you in court.   David H. Souter  But the suit (.) correct me if I'm wrong, and I may be wrong on this, but I thought this suit eventuated from the fact that you had been denied bailout and that your entire case was brought on the refusal of bailout.  I did not understand that you had brought a general declaratory judgment action or a (.) or a facial attack in gross, as it were, on the statute.  Am I wrong about your pleadings?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Right.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You separately asked for declaratory judgment?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well Mr. Coleman, this is important to me.  Do you (.) do you acknowledge that if we find on your favor on the bailout point we need not reach the constitutional point?   David H. Souter  Mr. Coleman, may I just raise a basic point here.  And I'll be candid with you that it affects my view of your argument.  I just want to start with it.  Your argument is largely based on the assumption that things have significantly changed and that therefore Congress could not by whatever test we use extend the (.) extend section 5.  But what we've got in the record in front of us (.) I don't have a laundry list to read, but I mean, we've got I think at the present time a 6-point (.) a 16-point registration difference on Hispanic and non-Hispanic white voters in Texas.  We've got a record of some 600 interpositions by the (.) by the Justice Department on section 5 proceedings, section 5 objections, over a period of about 20 years.  We got a record that about two-thirds of them were based on the Justice Department's view that it was intentional discrimination.  We've got something like 600 section 2 lawsuits over the same period of time.  The point that I'm getting at is I don't understand, with a record like that, how you can maintain as a basis for this suit that things have radically changed.  They may be better.  But to say that they have radically changed to the point that this becomes an unconstitutional section 5 exercise within Congress's judgment just seems to me to (.) to deny the empirical reality.  I mean, what it your answer to that?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, the evidence that I've been getting into is a pretty good indication (.) I would have thought Congress thought so and I would have thought so too (.) that there is something to be concerned about on the issue of circumvention; that in fact the attitudes have not so radically changed as to render circumvention irrelevant.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What about the evidence that Justice Breyer summarized, that I alluded to?  I mean those (.) that is simply evidence of racial attitude and it seems to me in the real world that can be taken as evidence that if the (.) if the section 5 safeguard is taken away, the pushback is going to start.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It has never stopped.   David H. Souter  They couldn't (.) they couldn't be relied upon apparently in the some 200 cases in which the voting change was withdrawn after DOJ objection.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  This wasn't information over 30 years.  My recollection (.) and I could be wrong on this, but my recollection is that those were statistics from about 20 years prior to the reauthorization.   David H. Souter  Yes, that's correct.   ",08-322X

0,"David H. Souter  I take it the only issue that you have raised before us is whether the evidence that does raise a burden on the defendant's part has got to be, whatever this means, direct or not?  That's the only issue?   David H. Souter  Am I right that the only source of argument for the proposition that it does have to be direct evidence is Justice O'Connor's opinion, separate opinion?   David H. Souter  Well, there are -- there are arguments about the need for substantial evidence.  But the argument for direct evidence goes back to the separate O'Connor opinion.   David H. Souter  And are you -- I mean, we're going to hear about this.  Are you going to make an argument to the effect that that should not be regarded as the controlling opinion, and if that is the source of it, that is the end of the issue?  Are you -- are you going to get into that?   David H. Souter  All right.  I think you should.   David H. Souter  As I understand the White opinion, it had nothing to do with the character of the evidence.  It had to do with the degree of persuasiveness of the evidence.  Is that correct?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Then I don't understand what ""substantial"" means.  What do you think he meant by that?   David H. Souter  Okay.   David H. Souter  Well, correct me if I am wrong.  I assume that in a jury case that simply was left to the jury, and the instruction would be something like this: If you find that the plaintiff has shown that age was a motivating factor, then you look to the next question.  And that is: Has the defendant shown that he would have fired the plaintiff anyway?  Isn't that the way it works?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Regardless of what the parties may prefer, isn't it likely that the jury, regardless of instruction, is going to say something like this: If we find that -- that age really was in the boss's mind when he fired the person, and the boss comes in, regardless of the instructions, and says the guy's work was no good, he got late -- he arrived late every day and so on, the jury is going to say: Did they really fire him because he was old or because he didn't come to work on time?  They are going to do the same thing that they are going to do on the burden-shifting instruction, probably, aren't they?   Lisa S. Blatt  I mean -- there are two kinds of jury findings.  There's the -- but the problem in all this area, if you do ever get a case that's appropriate, I think what the Court should start with the assumption which Justice Alito alluded to: Price Waterhouse was a bench trial.  The 1991 amendments under Title VII were against the backdrop of non-jury trials.  And both the Price Waterhouse decision and the language of Title VII are written ex post.  What -- it's assuming some artificial world where there was a finding of mixed motives.  But in today's world everything needs to be done ex ante.  We need to know how to instruct the jury, and that's the fundamental problem.  If you are looking at ex post world, you are exactly right.  A jury could either find this was all a pretext, I think what was really going on was ageism or sexism or racism, or it could find, a ""split the baby"", I think it's both.  But you just can't possibly know that--   David H. Souter  You can't know it--   Lisa S. Blatt  --going in.   David H. Souter  --but if you said to the jury, do the right thing, they'd probably come out about the same way that they would come out if you gave the burden-shifting instruction, I think.   Lisa S. Blatt  I think you are basically catching on the point that a lot of counsel in the real world are basically deciding, what do we think the jury is going to be most on our side with, with which instruction?  And it's not always clear going into the case, maybe depending on the relative strength of the legitimate factor being asserted.  Some defendants may prefer the affirmative defense.  Some may think, no, it's prejudicial, we don't want that, we want a straight determining-factor instruction.   David H. Souter  But the reason I raise the issue is, if -- if we are saying do we -- do we ditch Price Waterhouse, my questions I guess are suggesting something to the effect, what difference does it make?   Lisa S. Blatt  Well, I don't think you can ditch Price Waterhouse as a practical matter, because you're going to create -- I mean -- massive confusion, not only under the Age Act, but under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, a variety of labor statutes, disability statutes--   David H. Souter  Juries -- juries are smarter than judges.   Lisa S. Blatt  --Well, you can do that, but all the problems you think you are solving, you are going to have to face them in Title VII.  That is the bulk of discrimination law, and you have two standards of causation in that statute right now.  Thank you.   ",08-441X
1,"David H. Souter  Well, you will get to the jury, and if the jury accepts all your evidence, the jury can find in your favor.  But the difference between a prima facie showing and what has to be shown here is, the jury must actually find, based on your at least prima facie evidence, that age was a motivating factor.  And until the jury makes that finding, if it is properly instructed, it doesn't get to the question of whether the defendant has any burden to show something in response.  Isn't that correct?   INTERRUPTING ",08-441X
1,"David H. Souter  But the -- in the -- in the general -- in the field of criminal enforcement generally there isn't any provision comparable to what is now 36(f)(1)(B), at least to my knowledge, and it's set out on pages 46 and 47, the text is in the government's brief:  ""The provisions of any State law to which a branch of a national bank is subject under this paragraph shall be enforced with respect to such branch by the OCC. ""  And that mandate, it  ""shall be enforced with respect to such branch. ""  sounds pretty exclusive to me.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You can't tell for sure.  But why would -- why would Congress, number one, if it -- if Congress simply assumed that there would be a -- a dual system of enforcement, that OCC could -- could say to the bank, you follow State law, and if you don't, we are going to go after you administratively, and leaving it to the State to go after, in any other fashion, what State law provided.  If that was Congress's assumption, why would it have -- have passed this seeming mandate,  ""shall be enforced with respect to such branch. ""  by the -- by the OCC?   David H. Souter  But that -- that's, in effect, saving clause kind of function could have been performed simply by a statute that says OCC may.  And this says it shall be enforced by OCC.   David H. Souter  What do you say about the quotations in the -- the brief that Mr. Waxman filed, as I recall; it may have been the government's brief--   David H. Souter  --which -- which do have references to visitorial powers as including general conformance to the law.  Those are not universal provisions, but they -- they were certainly understood in some cases.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but there was -- there was a point in -- in distinguishing the visitorial powers that Blackstone, in the cases Blackstone was referring to, and those for example that would apply solely to -- to religious or originally religious foundations like Oxford and Cambridge colleges and so on.  So there -- there seems to have been a reason to understand the distinction.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But he didn't need visitorial powers to do that.  I mean, the sovereign had that by virtue of the general law.   INTERRUPTING ",08-453X
0,"David H. Souter  But do you -- do you agree that -- that it is possible to read the OCC, but not necessarily as an exclusive ground?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I want you to come back.  I -- I won't stop -- I don't want to stop you from doing that, but I want to come back to this.  Do you -- do you want to go on to your second example, or do you want to--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --Is there any -- is there any legislative history whatever to the effect that at the time 36(f)(1)(B) was adopted -- to the effect that its effect was to pre-empt State enforcement for--   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  --Senator D'Amato and--   David H. Souter  --Yes, but the -- the problem I have with that is, as a -- as a kind of clear statement of -- of something which is -- is -- would be extraordinary -- is that it talks in terms of supervision.  It doesn't use the -- my recollection is it doesn't use the magic word ""enforcement"".  And I would have thought that if in the course of that colloquy the -- the statement had been made: The States will not have the authority to enforce this, that there would have been rather a dust-up.  And there wasn't.  It's kind of a ""dog that didn't bark"" argument.  And, therefore, if -- if there is uncertainty as to how to construe 36(f)(1)(B), I'm not sure that I -- I don't think the legislative history supports your exclusivity view.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Does that mean -- when they say ""review records"", does that mean that the State auditors in effect can walk into the bank, as distinguished from what we have here, in which the bank is being requested to produce excerpts from records?   David H. Souter  Well, it isn't -- it isn't if--   David H. Souter  --Well, is it--   David H. Souter  --Is it the exercise of visitorial powers, or is it an action which covers the same subject that an exercise of visitorial powers would do?  Let me -- let me propose a distinction, and I don't know whether this is sound.  You know -- I mean, you tell me.  I would suppose that if someone with visitorial powers dealing with discrimination in lending brought an action against the bank or tried to enforce it against the bank and couldn't do so in any other way then by going to court, it would go to court, and it would say court, tell this institution that I have some responsibility for, to obey the law.  But I also assume that if the Attorney General of New York, which is not a visitor, enforces the law, it would go into court and say tell them to obey the law and to pay damages or recompense of some sort to these people whom they have wronged.  The subject matter of each suit is the same, but the relief that is being requested and the judicial power that is being exercised is different in these two cases.  Is that a fair distinction?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  That is the one with Senator D'Amato?   David H. Souter  Uh-huh.   ",08-453X
0,"David H. Souter  Let me ask you about another bright-line rule that I think you're assuming.  You -- you said in the course of describing the justification for this search that one -- one of the points of justification was that there was a health and safety risk.  And I assume from the way you put it that you are grouping every drug, prescription or over the counter, as posing a health and safety risk; is that correct?   David H. Souter  Why -- why should we accept that -- that blanket assumption?  I mean, at some point it gets silly.  Having -- having an aspirin tablet does not present a health and safety risk, and yet that's an over-the-counter drug, and presumably you would have gone through the same search for -- for an aspirin that was conducted here.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Oh, and I agree with you, and I -- I don't have any question with this kind of a, let's say, a -- a broad swath of judicial hands-off in determining what is a risk and what isn't.  But at some point it becomes sufficiently questionable that I do think we have to raise it.  And if your rule would criminalize -- I shouldn't say ""criminalize"" -- would put aspirin in the contraband category and justify the kind of search that went on here, I think we've reached the questionable point.  And I -- my question to you now is, why haven't we?   David H. Souter  Have you ever made -- has your side of the case ever made the argument that it needs this sort of blanket classification rule, any drug over the counter or prescription, because when a, a pill is found, they're not pharmacists, they don't know what it is, and therefore they've got to have a blanket rule or they simply cannot act effectively?  I did not see that argument in the briefs.  Has that argument been raised at any point?   David H. Souter  Where did you argue it?  I mean, I want to know whether that argument is in the case.   David H. Souter  Is it?  I don't remember it.  Do you remember a page?  Do you have a page reference offhand?   David H. Souter  But you say it's in your brief?   David H. Souter  Okay, I'll go back.   David H. Souter  Your basis -- your basis for saying that, I guess, is just sort of the practical one, we don't know how to do that type of thing.  So far as the legal principle on the basis of which you justified this search, you could justify that search, too, couldn't you?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But if -- if we hold in your favor in this case and the next school district says, all right, we're going to have classes in body cavity searches, then there would be no legal basis, if we accept your principle, for saying that's out of bounds as a matter of the Fourth Amendment; isn't that correct?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  So it would not -- it would not be out of bounds under the Fourth Amendment?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But you are -- you are saying basically there is -- there is no general understanding that people carry ibuprofen in -- in their undergarments.   David O'Neil  That is -- that is true.  There was no experience at this school.  There was no reasonable -- no reason to suspect that based on experience in the world.  And, in fact, by the time the officials had conducted their -- this search, they had searched Marissa, who was Respondent's friend.  And they had conducted a search of her pockets and her wallet and they had found pills in her pockets and her wallet.  But they had not found pills in her underwear.  So even if that had been a suspicion that one might have had even before beginning the search, they certainly wouldn't have had that suspicion by the time--   David H. Souter  And I don't see why your answer might not be different if, under the Chief Justice's question, he didn't know it was ibuprofen.  All he knew was that it was a white pill.  He's not a pharmacologist, he doesn't know what's in it.  Wouldn't the reasonableness of the -- wouldn't the scope of reasonable search at least potentially be greater for the undifferentiated white pill than for the known ibuprofen?   David O'Neil  It may, Justice Souter, but I think that the question would be whether the school official has some reason to believe, based on a practice, that -- that pills, for example, are hidden in a student's -- can be hidden in a student's underwear.  Again, the example was crack, and that is a situation where there is an understanding that that is -- can be a place in which suspects will hide that type of item.  But, again, there was no indication in this case whatsoever and no basis for the school official to suspect that that was a likely location.   ",08-479X
1,"David H. Souter  Let me -- let me just, not so much change the facts, but -- but emphasize a couple of different aspects of the facts.  Assuming Justice Breyer's hypothetical of a moment ago and assuming the following thought process on the part of the principal -- I -- strike that.  I will vary the facts in one way.  Let's assume, following your categorical rule that the -- the principal doesn't know whether it's ibuprofen or not.  He just knows that there's a pill and one of the other kids said this person has got pills on -- on her person.  The principal says, I know as a matter of reliable fact that one student got sick, violently sick, within the past week or so on some pill; we don't know exactly what it was.  We also know within a reasonable period of time from where we are now that there have been kids who died from ingesting dangerous drugs.  I've got suspicion that some drug is on this kid's person.  My thought process is I would rather have the kid embarrassed by a strip search, if we can't find anything short of that, than to have some other kids dead because the stuff is distributed at lunchtime and things go awry.  Is that the basis?  Is that thought process, that reasoning, the basis for a -- a reasonable strip search?   David H. Souter  That's right.   David H. Souter  Somewhere between the surface of the clothes and -- and the body.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  You -- you say that the -- the point of my question, this is what I'd like you to focus on -- you're entirely right, I would accept that argument and I think that argument is entirely right, if the stakes are lower.  If the risk of a mistake is going to be less traumatic.  In the hypo that I gave, the risk of the mistake may well be violent sickness or death.  And the thought process in the principal's mind is, the reasonableness analysis in the principal's mind is better embarrassment than violent sickness or death.  What's wrong with that reasoning under the Fourth Amendment?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I'm -- I'm saying it.  [Laughter]  We -- We've got a new case.  And I'm saying to you, why isn't that a -- a reasonable thought process within the concept of Fourth Amendment reasonableness?   David H. Souter  You've got reasonable suspicion that they are somewhere on the person.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And with those stakes in mind, why isn't it reasonable?  In other words, there -- there is a sliding scale of risk which is inherent in my hypo, and why isn't that a sound basis for a -- a Fourth Amendment analysis?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I don't have a belief; I simply have a reasonable suspicion.  That's what I've got all along the way.  And it seems to me, when -- when you take the position that you -- you were taking, you are saying, better to have the risk of violent sickness or death than the risk of embarrassment.  Isn't that what you're saying?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Some search is -- is reasonable, I take it?   David H. Souter  All right.  Now the -- we get to the point as in prior hypos, in which it does -- they find nothing in the pockets.  They find nothing in the pocket book or other garments.  The only thing that's left is a strip search, and that's where you draw the line.  Why do you draw the line there, on the risk analysis?   ",08-479X
1,"David H. Souter  Well, when you say 65 IQ?   David H. Souter  Okay.  I grant you that under -- under the earlier case the 65 IQ was not dispositive, and I mean that was the -- the case in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical.  But it was necessary under the early case to come to a determination of what the IQ was, even though that determination was not dispositive of the result.  And because it was necessary to come to a determination, why shouldn't there be a preclusion?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  It wasn't necessary to reach that particular -- in other words, the determination of 65 was not necessary to reach the conclusion that they reached.   David H. Souter  And you -- you are saying the very fact that it was not dispositive of the result means that it cannot be preclusive now?   David H. Souter  Okay.   INTERRUPTING ",08-598X
0,"David H. Souter  But even -- even if that's so, that's not necessarily an -- an Atkins finding, isn't that correct?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Atkin -- Atkin -- we didn't determine what the definition of retardation was.  We -- we operated in Atkins on a broad conception of retardation and we came down with a general rule.  But we left it for later litigation, starting in the States, to determine exactly how that line ought to be drawn.  We didn't know where the line ought to be drawn at that point and certainly the clinical psychologists didn't know, regardless of what the -- what definition was being used.   David H. Souter  In -- in response to Justice Ginsburg's question, I don't see why it makes any difference which court is doing what.  She -- she raised two objections.  Number one is that so far as the issue being determined in the prior proceeding, the characterization of his mental state as retardation was at most a subsidiary, not an ultimate fact.  Number two, the conclusion of that prior proceeding was that he lost.  And she's saying in those, in either of those circumstances, the subsidiary finding is not preclusive and any finding is not preclusive in the manner in which he wishes to use it here.  I don't see what difference it makes whether we're talking about court A or court B.  What is -- what is your response to those two objections?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  If -- if the Ohio court had found, the court of first instance had found, that the IQ was at some different level, it could have come out exactly the same way it came out in this case, couldn't it?   David H. Souter  So the finding was not necessary to the result?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  I mean, we went through this with your brother, and he pointed out, yes, it was necessary to -- to consider the issue and to make some kind of a finding -- I don't know how precise it had to be -- but the finding that it made, the -- the actual number that was used or the characterization that was used to describe that number was not necessary in order, in fact, to impose the death penalty.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  And -- and the sense of necessity which is used normally in -- in this kind of preclusion analysis just doesn't apply here.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But if that is the argument, then what is being preclusive here is not the first judgment.  I mean, in preclusion cases it's the first judgment that precludes, and we identify a judgment which is preclusive in the way we've been describing.  But in the hypothetical that Justice Breyer gave you, there's nothing preclusive about the first judgment because the first judgment stands and properly can stand.  And you're saying there can't be a second judgment, but you are not depending upon a rule of preclusion that turns on the first.  So whatever your argument is, it's not -- it's not issue preclusion.   David H. Souter  Sure, but you're coming up with a brand new rule.  Whatever your rule is, it's not a rule of double jeopardy and it's not -- it's not the traditional rule of issue preclusion.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  No, but what your rule is, as I understand it in your response to Justice Breyer's question, is if there was a subsidiary fact determination in the first case, even though it was entirely consistent with the judgment against your client, that's subsidiary fact determination can be used as a defense by your client in the second case.  That's your rule, as I understand it, and that is not the rule of Ashe v. Swenson and it is not the rule of issue preclusion.   David H. Souter  Well, you -- do you agree with me that you're asking for a brand-new rule here?   David H. Souter  We have never held this, and I don't know of any court that's ever held this.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, why isn't it brand new?   David H. Souter  Well, maybe the unique procedural posture is precisely the reason that the rule is brand new.  If it's unique, we've never had it before.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But I'm not sure that there's even anything -- I mean, it does raise a judicial estoppel issue, but I'm not sure there is a -- a record hereupon which a -- a judicial estoppel claim could be maintained, because in the passages that you referred us to, first the State's concession and secondly the finding which -- which followed from it, it was a reference to mild mental retardation and a specific reference to an IQ of 69.  I think it's a stretch, would be a stretch, to go from saying that a concession of mild mental retardation for purposes of mitigation analysis should be taken as a concession for dispositive mental retardation for Atkins purposes.  So I -- I have difficulty in seeing any clear inconsistency in the State's two positions.   ",08-598X

Wall  --that the government could have appealed the judgment here as of right, and that is why we think the purposes of the 60-day period were not implicated.  Because the government couldn't appeal, it was not a potential appellant that required the authorization of the Solicitor General, and it didn't need the 60 days.

1,"David H. Souter  Mr. Buffone, may I raise one preliminary issue?  And it's an issue which is -- does not go to the reason we took the case, but I'd like your response to it.  Your argument, your Ashe v. Swenson argument, assumes, as you have said in the brief, that the -- that the verdicts of acquittal essentially determined that your client did not possess insider knowledge, and I question whether the verdicts of acquittal did necessarily establish that fact.  I've looked at the -- at the jury instructions, and I -- I will be candid to say I did not parse the whole jury instruction, so you may very well correct me in the assumption that I'm going to make.  But the point of the -- of the jury instruction that seemed to go to your argument is set out on page 105 of the Joint Appendix, and the judge is telling the jurors what they had to find.  And one of them was that your client made any untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading as charged.  It seems to me that the jury under that instruction could have come back with a verdict of acquittal simply on the assumption that your client had not made affirmative statements at the -- at the meeting in question, therefore he had no obligation to -- to correct any statements, because it is not clear from this instruction that he had to correct the statements of other people who omitted material facts, and that therefore the only thing that the verdict proves or the only thing that the verdict may have assumed is that he didn't speak up and say anything.  Is that a possible analysis?   David H. Souter  No, I -- I agree that -- that did seem to be the point of the cross-examination, and in fact I guess you set it out in one of the briefs.  But is -- is that enough?  We -- to my knowledge, we've never held that that is enough to convert or -- let's say, to -- to -- for us to assume, despite a more protean jury instruction, that the jury necessarily had to find a -- a fact.  And I guess maybe my question boils down to is: Why should what perhaps consumed 60 or 80 seconds of cross-examination suffice to tighten up a jury instruction which -- which basically is open-ended?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Mr. Buffone, you're -- you're going through a logical analysis.  If I understand your position, the logical analysis is not going to win the case for you because, as I understand the case that we've got in front of us, we have in effect two lines of authority, two models, that describe what the law might be in these circumstances.  One model, on -- on the assumption that -- that the acquittals determined what you say they did -- on that model there -- there is -- there is an issue preclusion that is raised.  On the second model, the model of what we do in the case of a hung jury, there is no -- of course, no preclusion, and there is no bar to a retrial.  And we've simply got both in the same case.  The question is: Which model do we follow?  Do we say preclusion is the most important issue here, or do we say the open-endedness and uncertainty of the hung jury, the -- the failure to reach a verdict, is the model that -- that tells us what we ought to do?  How do we choose between those two possibilities, each of which is open to us?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Look, I know that, and -- and by the same token, hung juries have long been recognized as raising no bar to a further trial.  And the question is: Why are the values in the -- the acquittal case predominating, as you say they are, over the values of the retrial possibilities?  Why do I choose one rather than another?   David H. Souter  We have got both.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  What -- what is it -- and I would almost suggest that it has to be something outside the lines of authority, because the issue here is which line of authority are you going to pick?  What is it outside the lines of authority that says we should -- we should pick the acquittal model rather than the hung jury model to determine what to do here?   INTERRUPTING ",08-67XX
0,"David H. Souter  But isn't -- isn't the real problem that -- that you raised by your answer the following problem: That in this age in which there are, as Justice Breyer's hypo suggests, lots of overlapping criminal statutes -- you can indict not only for drugs but for telephones, and I don't know what other overlapping crimes there -- there may be.  Therefore, that gives the government by joining a lot of overlapping charges or lots of charges with common elements in either one indictment through various counts or simply by a series of indictments to be tried together -- it gives the government a bigger chance of getting a hung jury or some irrational resolution on some of those issues.  And if the government can bring loads of counts, increase the likelihood of getting a hung jury on one issue or one indictment, the government in effect has a key to avoiding just what Justice Breyer's hypothetical suggested.  If they wait and bring the second count in June, there's an issue preclusion.  But if they bring it together, they've got an irrational verdict, and there's no issue preclusion.  Therefore, isn't the policy behind both double jeopardy and the issue preclusion extension a policy that argues in favor of saying, don't let the government have all these bites at the apple, because in fact it results or can result in seriatim prosecutions?  What's -- what's your response to that argument?   David H. Souter  But does the -- does the government ask for something more than one fair chance when it comes in with 117 counts?  Maybe the fair chance consists of a fair chance with a number of counts or a number of indictments that one can reasonably expect a -- a jury to handle without either getting totally confused or totally exhausted.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Oh, that's right.  I'm making an argument that he did not make.   ",08-67XX
1,"David H. Souter  I think it's a fluke, too, but you gave -- in my recollection -- I forget where it was -- I think you gave citations to three or four cases in which that actually happened, didn't you?   ",08-681X
0,"David H. Souter  Were the examples that she gives, the two or three cases, properly examples under this section, in your--   David H. Souter  --May I -- may I interrupt you just a second?  When I meant examples, I meant the cited cases.  There were two or three cited cases.   David H. Souter  What difference would it make?  I mean, if he -- if he can satisfy the clear and convincing standard, which is tantamount to saying that on final judgment I win, hands down, what -- what need is there to -- to go into irreparable harm?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But -- but -- but that's -- no, well, in any case, if he's got to show by clear and convincing evidence that he's going to have success on the merits, I don't see any point in any case to going into irreparable harm.  If he goes into irreparable harm without the clear and convincing standard, he loses.  If he satisfies the clear and convincing standard, there's nothing for irreparable harm considerations to add to -- to the -- to the mix of factors.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But it's more than a -- it's certainly more than a preponderance?   David H. Souter  But the ultimate -- the ultimate standard to which they look is a preponderance standard.  In other words, the -- the substantial evidence standard is keyed to what a reasonable fact-finder could find reasonably, based upon substantial evidence.  Is the substantial evidence sufficient for such a fact-finder to find by a preponderance that this person has failed to meet or, put it the other way around, that the fact-finder has unreasonably failed to find that the Petitioner has met the standard?  So ultimately you're talking about a preponderance standard, which is -- which is the key.  Isn't that correct?   David H. Souter  And I -- and I applaud the fact that you don't, but I don't know how you can do it consistently with your view that (b)(3)(B) means the same thing as (f) when (f) is restricted as much as it is.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  God -- God bless you, but I don't -- I don't know how under the statute, on your reading of the statute, you -- you can do it.   David H. Souter  All right.  Then why doesn't that provide the broader authority under (b)(3)(B) stay provision that -- that your friends on the other side are arguing for?   David H. Souter  But this is a longer temporary stay than you conceded a few moments ago.  I mean, you were talking about Friday night to -- to Monday morning, when -- when you were -- when you were conceding the stay on the Hobbs analogy.  I don't know how many months it's been, but -- but this is no Friday-night-to-Monday-morning stay.   ",08-681X
1,"David H. Souter  May I ask you a question that goes at least to one possible application of -- of your argument?  Your argument for the State, the position that you just took, would -- would apply to the period of time, as I understand it, in which the individual named, the defender named Sleigh, had been appointed to -- to represent the defendant.  And as I understand it, when this case was argued in the Supreme Court of Vermont, the State conceded that, in fact, some prejudice should be attributed and it should be held against the State that Sleigh in effect did nothing.  They said, well, don't hold it against us quite as much as you might, but, in any case, that can be held against us.  Here you don't take that position, and I -- I don't know whether it's open to you -- it seems to me that it's not open to you -- to take a different position with respect to Sleigh here than the Attorney General of Vermont did when it was before the Supreme Court of Vermont.  And I -- I have to assume that you just see it differently from the way the Attorney General did.  But would -- would you comment on -- on the position that the State took and tell me why you can take a different position here?   David H. Souter  Yes.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  But it was conceded, wasn't it, in the -- in the Vermont Supreme Court?   David H. Souter  Yes.   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Well, then, why isn't that concession binding here?   David H. Souter  Well, it is, but that is not an issue that is necessarily implied by the -- by the concession that the Attorney General made in the Vermont Supreme Court.   David H. Souter  Before you start, let me just make a comment and a -- and a question based on it.  The comment is I -- I'm willing to accept a lot of what you say here, there is plenty of blame to go around.  But you accept, as I understand it, the proposition that the State has simply got an affirmative duty to make some kind of effective trial and representation arrangement.  It -- it -- it has that duty through providing the public defender, it has that duty simply through providing a court that will keep things moving, and I think that's common ground.  If that, as it seems to be, is common ground, then do we have anything before us in this case, except sort of going through the list of counsel, the list of reasons, the list of delays and reviewing the Vermont Supreme Court on, in effect, the details that it assumed in applying the rule?  In other words, it seems to me that there isn't an issue of principle dividing the parties here, it's a series of issues of details.  Is that an unfair way to look at the case as we've got it?   David H. Souter  Yeah, but if you take Sleigh, Donaldson, and the period in which there was no -- I guess, following Sleigh, in which there was no counsel appointed at all, you're already up to just about a year.  And a year is -- is enough to trigger Neil v. Biggers.  And so, it seems to me that what -- what the fight, what the serious fight is about is, well, within the further total of two-year period, who is to blame for this, who was to blame to that, and I'm -- I'm not sure that it's of any value to just go through and second-guess the Supreme Court of Vermont on those details, because you've got enough in Neil v. Biggers before you even get to those details.   David H. Souter  Right.   David H. Souter  With respect to that last point, let me ask you this question.  Let's assume we -- we have paid counsel in a criminal case and, as a result of -- of delays by the prosecution, but primarily as a result of requests for continuance after continuance after continuance, the -- the case is not tried; it's a simple case and it's not tried for three years.  Is -- is it open to a reviewing court on constitutional grounds to say that the State has got an affirmative obligation, a non-delegable obligation, to bring cases to trial in a reasonable time?  And whether the reason for the failure in this three-year case is because counsel just kept trying to -- to shove it off, or the courts were not diligent in scheduling it for trial, at some point that non-delegable obligation has been violated.  Is -- is that a -- a possible constitutionally based position?   David H. Souter  Well, what if the -- what if we change the facts slightly.  What if the defendant himself never says anything on the record?  The only thing we've got on the record are repeated requests by paid counsel for continuances, and then after three years the defendant fires paid counsel and says: I've been sitting in jail for three years awaiting trial, and I shouldn't have to wait that long.  The State has failed in its non-delegable duty.  Would your answer still be the same?   INTERRUPTING David H. Souter  Lots -- lots of very effective criminal trial lawyers believe that the first tactic is delay, delay, delay, delay, delay.   ",08-88XX
