1,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical was you are entitled to $100 as a statutory penalty but only if it's an individual claim.  If you -- if this is brought as a class action, you don't get the statutory penalty.  I thought that was the substance of her question.  Now, are you saying that also is merely procedural and -- and pre-empted by Rule 23?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, you get $100 or you don't get $100.  How can you be any less substantive than getting the $100 or not getting the $100?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Then under your view, there is absolutely nothing, no law that the State could pass that would not conflict with Rule 23--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --as it -- as with respect to class actions?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You mean the State could do.   ",08-1008
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  But isn't Rule 23 a judgment by Congress that class actions that meet the criteria of Rule 23 are fair and efficient, correct?  That's Congress's judgment?   Sonia Sotomayor  Under your theory, any State could pass a law that says no cause of action under State law can be brought as a class action ever.  That would be your theory because it's substantive, if it's an Erie choice.   Sonia Sotomayor  You haven't quite answered my question.   Sonia Sotomayor  Your State can come in and say, no State cause of action will ever be subject to class treatment.  And you would say there is no conflict between that and Rule 23?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No.  No State cause of action can be brought as a class.  You're saying there is no conflict with Rule 23's judgment about efficiency of Federal court litigation?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Just what it's doing here.  There are some things -- we make a policy choice, the State, that, contrary to Rule 23, that there are some causes of action that are not fairly and efficiently brought as a class.  That's what the State has said as a policy choice, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  It's a policy choice.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you have answered my question.  Under your view, a State could say, no class actions.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And -- and a Federal court, sitting in diversity, could never aggregate those claims, those State law claims?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, how can you say that?  The case itself says: We read the language of the statute; Congress didn't say this was to be a class action; we are not permitting it.  I understand the difference, and it could have argued or analyzed the case the way you said, but the appellate division there did exactly what your adversary said it did.   ",08-1008
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  But that makes no sense because, if you go down that road, then what you're saying is that neither the -- neither a police officer or a different prosecutor who fabricated evidence could be liable, either, because the only person who causes the deprivation is the prosecutor who uses the false evidence at trial.   Sonia Sotomayor  Now, the Second Circuit in its decision, Judge Newman, looked at it and said there are two causes to the injury here.  One is the fabrication, joint tortfeasors.  There are two people who can cause any injury and the prosecutor who actually puts the evidence in at trial.  That's how you hold police officers and different prosecutors liable because they are assisting in the violation that is occurring.   Sonia Sotomayor  Why doesn't that theory fit the same prosecutor who commits two different acts?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  One commits the direct violation, and the other act, the investigatory act, contributes to it, leads to it as a joint activity with it.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You're confusing -- the constitutional injury is the deprivation of liberty.  That's the injury.   Sonia Sotomayor  What causes that injury is not an element of the crime.  It is -- the question is have you proven the violation, have you proven the injury.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why does the use define the scope of the injury?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  A prosecutor is not going to flinch when he suspects evidence is perjured or fabricated?  Do you really want to send a message to police officers that they should not merely flinch but stop if they have reason to believe that evidence is fabricated?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Am I right that none of the -- neither of the two prosecutors in this case were sanctioned in any way for their conduct?   Sonia Sotomayor  But you have no reason to dispute the numerous studies we were provided that show that as a matter of routine prosecutors are not sanctioned for improper prosecutorial conduct in the investigatory stage, are you?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, the problem with every test is that you can find an exception that makes the application ridiculous.  Let's assume that we accept that headquarters or nerve center may have some applicability to a corporation that has a business in a variety of different States.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  That's -- your situation is perhaps the most attractive--   Sonia Sotomayor  --because whether California has 20 percent and Florida 14 or 15 percent, to me the differences are not terribly substantial.  I can imagine McDonald's having 1 percent in every part of the world, and how do you choose then?  California would say, then you -- you go back to headquarters.  But I don't know why you start there.  But let's posit the simpler situation.  Headquarters in New Jersey, but everything else is in California.  Your test would ignore completely that -- and it depends on how you define ""headquarters"".  If they have three corporate executives, that's the entire extent -- or let's say one corporate executive who started the company and who lives in New Jersey, and he flies out to California half the time and runs the business from there but happens to live in New Jersey.  Then you would say diversity is still New Jersey, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But you have not articulated a -- at least to me, a meaningful principle in which to set that exception.  It has to be tied somehow to the test and why the test in some situations would have applicability and others may not.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Because I don't know the difference between one headquarters and two places to do business or three, but I can still see that some factoring has to be done when the places of business are more limited.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what constitutes headquarters?   Sonia Sotomayor  How many executives have to live there?  What else has to exist there?  And then what is the default rule if those things don't exist?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, all you are talking about is not necessarily nerve center, because in reading the examples in your brief, what you are talking about is: Where is the place where they have the most important, significant, influential contact?  Now, the Ninth Circuit has defined that as the place where business is done; you are suggesting that it's the place where the nerve center is.  But it goes back to begging my question: Why -- just simply their declaring it on a tax form doesn't make it important, influential, or significant contact.  There has to be something more to the test, and it can't be just what I declare my headquarters to be.  There has to be some form of activity in that place.   Sonia Sotomayor  That's -- that's the point.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Is there -- is there something to a rule that says headquarters is presumptively the nerve center, but a challenged party, whoever that is, can rebut it?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's the point that I raised, which is that the headquarters is not an important, consequential, or substantial.  You can rebut it if you can show that it is a shell headquarters.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, but--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --That's the problem, which is, the party comes in, alleges by summary judgment that -- in a summary judgment motion: This is my corporate headquarters.  The other side's going to have to come forth with evidence that shows something.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So that it's always a rebuttable presumption.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I actually do not know whether public filings define what ""headquarters"" mean.  Is there a -- I know you have said it in your brief, but what I didn't know is whether those public filings define the activity necessary to designate a place as ""headquarters"".   INTERRUPTING ",08-1107
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Why -- why didn't they say place of doing business?  That's not the terminology that they used.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That would be more consistent with an aggregation of -- of all of the factors the Ninth Circuit starts with.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, what's very clear from all of the articles I have read in the lower court decisions is that Congress may have thought it was picking a well-defined phrase, but, in fact, it wasn't, that the Courts below are confused about what they were doing before the statute.  So I don't know why importing the belief that something was clear into a reality that it's not helps us.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why do you -- why do you think that the circuits courts -- the vast majority of them, the third, the first, the second, the fifth, they all start with the proposition that, if a place has far-flung businesses, then the nerve center test should start the inquiry and control it more than in a situation where there are lesser places of business?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's a big difference.   Sonia Sotomayor  I -- you know, to me, the word 50 percent.  I'm having a hard time understanding what the appreciable difference is between 20 percent and 14 and the balance being spread over so many other places.  What -- that seems very arbitrary in terms of the place that generates the most money.  That's it.  That's the place you are at home.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, but that's what -- but that goes back to the point, if we are talking about shields or swords, Congress had before it a provision that would say, anywhere you do business, you are not a foreigner, because you are there.  The people are going to perceive you as a business -- the local business that is doing business in that location, and Congress rejected that.  So foreign has to have a meaning that was somewhat different.  And you don't think the corporate headquarters where management is, where the direction for the operation of the business is coming from, is the place that needs the most protection in this system because they are the ones making the decisions, and so aren't they the ones who need to be protected from local bias?   Sonia Sotomayor  That's the very first little shop was there.   Sonia Sotomayor  Can you tell me what 100 percent means?  Are the number of workers in Seattle inconsequential?  Is there one worker there or are we talking about 1,000 in--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Isn't that important?  As Justice Scalia said that per capita California is going to dwarf anybody anywhere if you are going to have a multi-location place of business.  So don't you have to know the raw numbers?   ",08-1107
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Is there a -- is there a difference between unethical and illegal advice?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  As an attorney can you under -- give unethical advice?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Under the State rules you can give unethical advice as a lawyer?   Sonia Sotomayor  So if you are not permitted to do so, what in the First Amendment would otherwise give you that right?  I mean, this is a commercial transaction of sorts.  It's a fiduciary duty, but it's a commercial transaction.  They are coming to you and they are paying you for certain advice, so why would the person then protect your right to give unethical advice.   Sonia Sotomayor  We are assuming that it's not read with a limitation with respect to abusive conduct.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Assuming that is read into the statute or is viewed as part of ""in contemplation of bankruptcy"", what in the First Amendment would make that be?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Which doesn't explain why.   Sonia Sotomayor  You don't understand what it means as a lawyer?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Before you go on on 528, could you clarify for me: What is your challenge to 528?  Is it a normal--   Sonia Sotomayor  --528.   Sonia Sotomayor  Is it a normal facial invalidity?  Is it an overbreadth invalidity?  Is it an as-applied challenge?  What exactly are you claiming with respect to that--   Sonia Sotomayor  --528.   Sonia Sotomayor  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Can you tell me how you have an as-applied challenge when I don't even know what ad is at issue?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I have scoured the record for a handbill, meaning -- an advertisement--   Sonia Sotomayor  --by you that I could look at and say, you know, I'm looking at it and it's not misleading.  So where is it in the record?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I truly have never heard of an as-applied challenge when we don't know what it is being applied to.  But putting that aside, so you have an as-applied challenge; do you have a facial challenge or an overbreadth challenge?   Sonia Sotomayor  Yes, the 528.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Did the government bring this lawsuit below?   Sonia Sotomayor  So what, were they supposed to scour your advertisements to find the violation?  Was that it?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could I ask you something?  When you are an attorney advertising as an attorney who gives advice on bankruptcy, why aren't you a debt release -- relief advisor?   ",08-1119
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  That's -- that's the clear case.  How about the person comes in, shows the attorney his or her financial state.  There is no money to pay the fee.  The attorney simply gives a bill and says, ""I need it by Friday"".  No self-respecting person would believe that the individual is going to pay that bill without borrowing money from somewhere, if you have looked at their financial statement and there is no money to be had.  Would the attorney have violated the statute there?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Just one.  So, basically, your bottom line is any advice to incur debt to pay an attorney is illegal?   Sonia Sotomayor  Perhaps I am being -- not quite understanding you.  You are underscoring the more debt, that is going to always be additional, if the advice is to incur it.  So what meaning are you giving to more that I am missing?   Sonia Sotomayor  How about a law firm that represents the biggest companies in the world?  And so they are never going to consciously, intentionally seek out or represent a person defined with the financial limitations of this category.  But it so happens that one of their very rich clients comes in and says, I have a small -- my brother-in-law is running a small business; help him or her.  Is that firm in violation now because their advertisements did not include what 528(a) required?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So they have to -- for this one brother-in-law, they have to amend -- they're now violated the statute ex post facto somehow?   INTERRUPTING ",08-1119
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  It was wrong.  Let's assume--   Sonia Sotomayor  --the circuit -- the district court judge, the bankruptcy court judge, got it wrong, legal error.  Should not have been discharged, a given.  Neither -- the confirmation plan should not have been approved, neither should the discharge order have been entered.  We will go back to what was entered and -- and -- and the effect of that, because I'm not sure of it -- it's an error.  How does that give you a right to undo that judgment 7 years later -- was it 5, 6, 7 years later?  That's the question here.  Why is something that's in error become a void judgment?   Sonia Sotomayor  But so does -- most error committed by courts, inadvertently or otherwise, are in contravention of some statutory command.  This is no different.  Voidness, as I've heard it described by many others, appears to mean that the court is acting either without jurisdiction over the people, and that's not at issue here -- there was jurisdiction over the parties here -- or without jurisdiction over the res.  But the bankruptcy court does have jurisdiction, albeit in some -- in all circumstances, it had jurisdiction over the student debt.  The issue is what could it do with it.  But this is not a case involving a lack of jurisdiction by the court over property.  So why is this more than mere error?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that -- that goes back to something more fundamental.  There's no issue here that the court had jurisdiction over these parties, unlike the insurance company.  And there's no issue that the court didn't have jurisdiction over this res.  They could decide that a student loan was dischargeable.  They just had to follow certain procedures.  It's a very different set of circumstances in that case.   Sonia Sotomayor  So it's not -- it's not that it is not dischargeable.  It's only dischargeable under certain conditions.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So -- so you're almost begging the question, because it's possible to argue that if a debt is not dischargeable at all under any circumstance, your argument might have more legs because then the court has no jurisdiction over that property.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that's not the case with these exceptions.  They can all be discharged.  It's just a matter of whether the conditions have been met or not.   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you go back to the fundamental part of my question to your adversary?  The plan order included a discharge of the student interest -- of the interest on the student loan.   Sonia Sotomayor  It just proposed a discharge of a certain amount lesser than the principal plus interest.   Sonia Sotomayor  Right.  That's the plan.  And then you have a discharge order.  And the two are not congruent.  So what's the final judgment?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, no.  Is it the confirmation order or is it the discharge order?  Are they different judgments?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  One of your amici -- one of the amici suggested that the Florida courts cannot read the Florida Constitution more expansively than the Federal requirements.  Are you rejecting that proposition?   Sonia Sotomayor  And it's a different question.  One of the amici suggests that the Florida Constitution and Florida case law says that they can't read the Florida Constitution more broadly than it is read under Federal law.   Sonia Sotomayor  So this could be a first, if we were to start from the proposition that Justice Ginsburg did?   Sonia Sotomayor  Do -- do you see a conflict between the language of our decisions where we often say that Miranda rights have to be clear and those decisions that say that whatever is said has to reasonably convey the essence of the Miranda warnings?  Is there a difference between those two statements, and which of our cases or statements would control?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you would suggest that if something is not clear and it's ambiguous, that that's enough?  Or -- or is there a difference between reasonable and clarity?  That has to be read in a certain way; otherwise an ambiguous warning--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I have a difficulty in terms of this argument about burdening law enforcement.  This is a preprinted form that the police made up, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  So what's the added burden by making the form absolutely and abundantly clear or conforming the form to the statements in Miranda?  What's the cost to the State?  They're going to print the form anyway.  They are telling their officers to read from the form anyway.  What's the added cost?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, there is a question about how much the subjective intent of the questioner should be involved in this process or not.  There are cases where it appears the plurality of our Court has said it should always be an objective standard, and others where certain members have expressed a question about subjective.  But if we are dealing with a printed form, why wouldn't the intent of the entity at issue be placed in question?  Meaning, you could have -- the police here could have chosen to be explicit, but instead they chose to be -- to obfuscate a little bit and be less explicit.  Shouldn't we assume that that's an intent to deceive or perhaps to confuse?   Sonia Sotomayor  But why?  The -- the easy solution is to do what 90 percent of the jurisdictions are doing: Copy Miranda.   Sonia Sotomayor  Except that Justice Scalia just pointed out, if we approve the language of this, then -- of this particular warning, it becomes the new sort of floor.  And if we make it the new floor, it -- doesn't it provide an incentive for police departments to move away from the explicit warnings that say ""during and"" -- ""before and during"" interrogations; now we're saying -- you know, generalize them more.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Aren't we encouraging that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How many after Duckworth?  Do you know?   Sonia Sotomayor  So we don't know how many--   Sonia Sotomayor  --What -- how do we deal with the fact that, if the purpose of Miranda is to give clear warnings, and your adversary says -- not your adversary -- your co-counsel -- Petitioner's counsel says that means -- ""clear"" means does it reasonably convey?  We've got a split of circuit courts and State courts on whether this reasonably conveys or not.  Shouldn't that be enough of an ambiguity for us to conclude it can't reasonably convey, if there's this many courts holding that it doesn't?   Sonia Sotomayor  Are you calling the Florida State Supreme Court majority unreasonable jurists?   Sonia Sotomayor  What happens now is that we are dealing with the exception rather than the rule, and -- but this was the rule, meaning this was the form that they were reading.  And if it has some significant ambiguity in it, sufficient for at least one court to say it wasn't sufficiently clear, it wasn't explicit enough, should we worry about the exception as an exception?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Just so I get the bottom line -- if all this warning had said was, you have a right to a lawyer before questioning--   Sonia Sotomayor  --You have a right to a lawyer before questioning--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --it would be your position that standing alone that would be enough?

Sonia Sotomayor  Could -- what would happen if Congress said, as part of a sentence, a judge could incorporate a civil commitment finding and say: You are going to serve X amount in jail and Y amount, and then we are going to civilly commit you indefinitely, because as of today, I am finding you a sexual predator subject to a mental illness.  Would that be constitutional, and if not, why not?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I -- let's assume it incorporates all the protections of -- of this statute with respect to periodic review.   Sonia Sotomayor  So it's constitutional because it's part of the sentence?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.

They were concerned with people who had disappeared, but why is it logical for them to be worried about people who disappear prospectively as opposed to the people who have already disappeared and have failed to -- that's basically the -- the government's argument, which is: One of the main purposes of the statute is to capture those people who have disappeared.  And so why limit it?   Sonia Sotomayor  The problem is that the people who had traveled previously and failed to register would no longer be subject to any -- either any registration process or presumably any punishment either, because they were no longer in the State in which the conviction occurred, so any change in that statute wouldn't affect them.   Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I think that I remain a little bit confused by the question one of my colleagues answered, and I'm not sure if this last answer by you is helping me understand it, which is if SORNA now -- if every State is supposed to pass legislation which requires sex offenders who have been convicted elsewhere and moved to their State to register, why do you -- I think that's what you -- that you answered affirmatively for Justice Kennedy, correct?  SORNA requires every State to pass laws that obligate people who have been convicted in other States to register, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So why do you need SORNA?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So then, what is -- what is wrong with the purpose of a school to say we don't wish any group that doesn't -- that discriminates?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But this sounds like a debate over whether the policy as the school believes it should be implemented is not a good one.  But isn't that their choice?

Sonia Sotomayor  You're not--   Sonia Sotomayor  --You keep talking about being forced to let people in.  And this is where I'm a little bit confused by your yellow brief.  The school has taken the position that any group can apply to use its facilities; priority and funding, et cetera, will only go to recognized student groups.  But your group is not being excluded or ostracized completely from the school.  Presumably, you can meet in the cafeteria.  You can meet in open spaces in the school.  You can apply like everyone else, any other nonstudent group, recognized student group.  But you have been saying repeatedly in your presentation that you're barred from the campus.

I think that's what Justice Breyer is getting at.  With such a truncated voir dire and one in which the judge basically said to the lawyers, I'm not giving you much leeway at all, how can we be satisfied that there was a fair and impartial jury picked when the judge doesn't follow up on a witness who says, I'm a victim of this fraud?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It would not meet the Duren's second prong.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Does that make any sense to you?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I don't think that -- that any court has suggested that the complete absence of the protected group in that kind of number wouldn't give rise to a fair representation claim.  That's why this Court, the Michigan court, and many others have said that the absolute disparity test just can't be used in every circumstance.   Sonia Sotomayor  I don't.  The question I have you for you is -- that's what you have been advocating, or at least your brief suggested we should.  Wouldn't it be better for to us leave this in the hands of the courts to sort of figure out what test is better under what circumstances than us announce a flat rule that would lead to a result like the example that I just used?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I agree that if a protected group is 1 percent of the population, that it's not likely that their absence is going to give rise to any flags.   Sonia Sotomayor  But I think there is a difference.  I don't -- I just don't know statistically where.  And we have to leave this in the judgment of the lower courts as to where between 1 and 9 or 1 and 10 a difference makes sense.

Sonia Sotomayor  Well, except this would be a violation of a statute, not a violation of a constitutional right.  So under Ex parte Young they couldn't necessarily get an injunction.   Sonia Sotomayor  But that has nothing to do with whether the language is clear or not to constitute a waiver.  There is no principle of law that you are articulating that says it -- it has to be -- this is not clear enough for the Federal Government, but it is clear enough for the State.  ""Appropriate relief"" either has a meaning or it doesn't.   Sarah Harrington  --Right.  And again, we are not relying so much on the use of the phrase ""appropriate relief"" in the statute.  What that -- the work that does is it affirms that the background presumption of the Bell v. Hood cases applies to proper defendants under RLUIPA, which include State governments.  But as this Court said in Barnes, when a -- when a recipient of Federal funds takes the funds, it is on notice that it is going to be subject not only to the remedies explicitly provided in the text of the relevant legislation, but also to remedies that are traditionally available in suits for breach of contract, and those include compensatory damages and injunctive relief.  Now the State would have this Court turn that presumption, in terms of traditional contract rules, on its head by saying that this -- that this Court should hold that the State presumptively waived its immunity to suits for injunctive relief but not for damages.   ",08-1438
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  If it is, why is injunctive relief included at all?  Meaning, what you seem to be saying to me is that no relief should be appropriate, because no relief is clear whether it's injunctive relief or damages?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Some would say that injunctive relief attaches more to the public FISC then compensatory relief.  Because future conduct or change of conduct can have an enormous intrusion on the public FISC, so why do we draw the line between saying one is more intrusive than the other?   Sonia Sotomayor  So now we have three distinctions.  With respect to land use discrimination, the Rehab Act would presumably apply.  So the Rehab Act says compensatory damages are permissible for that kind of discriminatory claim, so now we have compensatory damages for that.  We have, potentially, compensatory damages for local governments, but not for State or Federal level.  We are chopping up the statute at each stage, correct?  We are treating different defendants differently and different claims differently with respect to the relief that's permissible?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could you explain why?

We decide whether a category of speech has a historical tradition of being regulated.  Now, other than some State statutes that you point to, some of which are very clearly the same as those that we struck down in Wynn, where is the tradition of regulating violence?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's an interesting concession on your part, that the labeling doesn't have a need separate from the restriction on sale.  I would have thought that if you wanted a lesser restriction, that you would have promoted labeling as a reasonable strict scrutiny restriction to permit the control of sale of these materials to minors; but you seem to have given up that argument altogether.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, you have conceded it by not appealing it.  But we're not -- your case on labeling rises and falls on the sale to minors?   Sonia Sotomayor  Would a video game that portrayed a Vulcan as opposed to a human being, being maimed and tortured, would that be covered by the act?   Sonia Sotomayor  So if the video producer says this is not a human being, it's an android computer simulated person, then all they have to do is put a little artificial feature on the creature and they could sell the video game?   Sonia Sotomayor  So what happens when the character gets maimed, head chopped off and immediately after it happens they spring back to life and they continue their battle.

It has -- I understand the word ""delegated"" to mean it's given over its power to a subgroup.  If it wants to take it back, it needs a quorum to do that.  That's what I understand.   Sonia Sotomayor  But the problem is that that exists whether we read your rule or not in the way you want.  You have -- you've conceded that a three-member board could lose a member, a three-member group could lose a member and its acts still be binding, as long as you say there is -- there is three members on the full board.

The latter might imply to me that he waived, but the former certainly would be neutral.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what do we do with our case law that says that you can't infer waiver simply from the confession?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I mean, we have said that.  So that's pretty clearly established statement--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --by the Court.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I think certainly in -- in Butler, if someone in their confession says, I know I don't have to talk to you, but I want to, that that would be using those words.

""   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  My -- but we go back to the point you made earlier.  Your position is the moment that someone confesses, that's an implicit waiver.   Sonia Sotomayor  Excuse me.  As I read this transcript, the police's tactic, by their own statement, was to approach him and say: This is our evidence.  Explain yourself -- that's the words the officer used -- but he's entitled to an alternative explanation.  Tell us.  What's clear is that at no point did he answer those questions, because nothing about the nods of the head or anything else showed a willingness to confess.  And even in the responses he gave, he answered a series of questions with a ""yes"", but not with an explanation, which was what was being requested.  So my question is, how does one infer a voluntary statement from a situation in which someone's really not talking?  I've never understood how a yes or a nod to questions that don't -- that's what the circuit said, to questions that we don't know what they were about -- do you want a mint or not, I don't even know that -- can reflect voluntariness?  And I understand that in Butler when someone says I don't want to sign that, but I'm going to spill my guts now, and does, that's a course of conduct one could view as voluntary.   ",08-1470

I think the -- the Solicitor General's position is that it doesn't apply to any import or export.  Is it yours that it doesn't apply to imports?   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you tell me something?  Is there -- do you know if there is a railroad line from the U.S. through to -- through Mexico?  I know there is one from New York to Canada, a freight line.   Sonia Sotomayor  There are?

If it's considered--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Where is that defined in Carmack?  Where in the pre-1978 provisions or in the current statute is that to be read?   Sonia Sotomayor  That's -- I am trying to find it, statutorily.  And what case says that?  What case of ours defines a -- a receiving carrier in that particular way?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The only one--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --The only one who has -- the board has jurisdiction over is the railroad.  It doesn't have jurisdiction over the ocean carrier receiving.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And so you are the -- you have to be the person -- the railroad has to be the person receiving the goods, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But you are not reading the language.  Doesn't the language say the person who receives under the jurisdiction of the board?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I keep going back to: What language tells me that particular point in the statute?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's my problem.   Sonia Sotomayor  I always thought that the purpose of Carmack was to ensure rail responsibility, rail carrier responsibility, so that it was one bill of lading with respect to all railroad connections.  If that was the purpose of Carmack--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --But on the rail line.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  On rail -- on rail transportation.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Historically you say that?   Sonia Sotomayor  In the pre-1978 Carmack, there is a -- if you want to take a look at it, it is in page 99a of your petition.  It reads:  ""If the loss, damage, or injury occurs while the property is in the custody of a carrier by water, that liability -- the liability of such carrier shall be determined by the bill of lading of the carrier by water and by and under the laws applicable to transportation by water. ""   Sonia Sotomayor  So--   Sonia Sotomayor  --So explain to me what happens in domestic water cases.  It says that you can have a different bill of lading for the water transport.  That bill of lading controls your damage on the water, and it separates that out from damage on the rail side?   Sonia Sotomayor  And the railroad is covered by any damage that occurs on land?   Sonia Sotomayor  So there already is domestically two different forms of liability protection?   ",08-1553
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Excuse me, can I go back to Justice Breyer's question?   Sonia Sotomayor  And perhaps, as I understand this, I think we are all forgetting that none of these liability provisions come into play until there is proof that an incident has occurred somewhere, either on a railroad or on the ocean, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  And so the issue becomes which set of rules governs that particular incident--   Sonia Sotomayor  --where it happens.   Sonia Sotomayor  I think Justice Breyer asked you why it made sense that there would be two rules in effect for what happens on the ocean and what happens on land; and if we had it, wouldn't it create great difficulty.  I think -- you may correct me.   Sonia Sotomayor  Is your case -- does your case end if we hold that ""K"" Line is not a railroad carrier?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.   Sonia Sotomayor  As a delivering carrier.   Sonia Sotomayor  Could I just -- just briefly before you answer the Justice -- the Chief.   Sonia Sotomayor  In what capacity -- ""K"" Line is the contracting party with Union Pacific.  Under what contract could the shipper sue Union Pacific?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If ""K"" Line is -- is the shipper.   Sonia Sotomayor  Regardless of whether the shipment was by them directly or not?   Sonia Sotomayor  I think -- I am a little bit confused now.  Now, back to being confused.  You are suggesting that from the landing, it's an ocean carrier.  And the minute that the containers are unloaded from the vessel and put on land, it becomes a railroad carrier, even though its delivery contract may have ended at that point?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what about -- what is it that you're arguing makes them a railroad carrier once they put it there.  Let's assume the reverse is the hypothetical that you -- that you posited.  They deliver to the dock, and Union Pacific is the one that owns those three to six miles of connection to its main railroad.  It's the one who is going to provide the motor carriage.  It's the one who is going to take it from the -- the dock and bring it in.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So it's not merely that it has possession of the container that it has dropped somewhere.  It has to transport it in some way in relationship to the railroad?   Sonia Sotomayor  When you say ""engaging in"", are you talking about vis-à-vis this shipment?   Sonia Sotomayor  Or is it just in general?  Vis-à-vis you?   INTERRUPTING ",08-1553

Sonia Sotomayor  So your--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Wait a minute.  Why -- why -- that doesn't make any sense to me.  Why would we have had the creation of all of these common law immunities attached to foreign individuals like consular and diplomatic and heads of state if state sovereign immunity was going to cover them naturally?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm trying to go before the Act, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, before it was passed, because that was Congress's first statement, and we have to figure out what they intended to replace or not replace.  Before the Act came in, what activities of a consular office would not have been covered under the foreign sovereign immunity of a state?  What activity could a diplomat have engaged in or a consular officer have engaged in that state immunity, as it was understood at the time, would not have given him or her?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Is there any case by us in which we -- prior to the FSIA, where we recognize that an individual was immunized in the way that the state was, if he was acting as an agent of the state?  Or were all of our cases having to do with other common law doctrines?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Wouldn't that be the same question that you would ask invoking a common law protection like head of state or act of state?  Isn't it -- whether it's under the FSIA or under a common law theory -- the identical question?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Isn't that the very point?  If the inquiry is the same under the FSIA and under the common law, and we're unsure what Congress intended in the FSIA, because it certainly doesn't explicitly say it covers individual acts, shouldn't we defer to the Executive's decisionmaking in what is -- has been, for centuries now, within its jurisdiction?

What's -- what's irrational about reading the statute that way when it uses the word ""subsection""?  It didn't use ""subparagraph"".   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But it didn't.  It kept in (A) the subdivisions of use and brandishing, which we all agree are elements of the crime.  So I don't know what it means to say that it moved it away from the elements.  It mixed up in (A) elements and sentencing factors, and so what we have to discern was, did it intend to make (B) sentencing factors or not?  And I think what Justice Breyer was asking you: What in the legislative history shows that?  Where do we read, outside of Castillo, a conclusion that somehow Congress radically changed the assumptions we identified in Castillo, which is historically it's not a sentencing element?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Is there a Sixth Amendment problem with reading a statute this way, with -- with reading a statute to provide for an unlimited maximum when Congress hasn't specified it, and now you're going to have the judge find the minimum and the maximum?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What you can rely on in an indeterminate sentencing regime without a minimum is that you've got a statutory maximum, whatever it may be, but a judge's discretion to start from zero.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Olson, are you giving up on your earlier arguments that there are ways to avoid the constitutional question to resolve this case?  I know that we asked for further briefing on this particular issue of overturning two of our Court's precedents.  But are you giving up on your earlier arguments that there are statutory interpretations that would avoid the constitutional question?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Olson, my difficulty is that you make very impassioned arguments about why this is a bad system that the courts have developed in its jurisprudence, but we don't have any record developed below.  You make a lot of arguments about how far and the nature of corporations, single corporations, single stockholder corporations, et cetera.  But there is no record that I am reviewing that actually goes into the very question that you're arguing exists, which is a patchwork of regulatory and jurisprudential guidelines that are so unclear.   Sonia Sotomayor  But the facial challenge--   Sonia Sotomayor  Going back to the question of stare decisis, the one thing that is very interesting about this area of law for the last 100 years is the active involvement of both State and Federal legislatures in trying to find that balance between the interest of protecting in their views how the electoral process should proceed and the interests of the First Amendment.  And so my question to you is, once we say they can't, except on the basis of a compelling government interest narrowly tailored, are we cutting off or would we be cutting off that future democratic process?  Because what you are suggesting is that the courts who created corporations as persons, gave birth to corporations as persons, and there could be an argument made that that was the Court's error to start with, not Austin or McConnell, but the fact that the Court imbued a creature of State law with human characteristics.  But we can go back to the very basics that way, but wouldn't we be doing some more harm than good by a broad ruling in a case that doesn't involve more business corporations and actually doesn't even involve the traditional nonprofit corporation?  It involves an advocacy corporation that has a very particular interest.   ",08-205X

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  How will that happen?  Meaning, how will they know, A, that the investigation is occurring; and second, what can they do under Federal or State law to require the disclose of ongoing investigative materials?  I don't know -- mind you, I haven't studied them -- but the ones that I am familiar with never permit the public -- none of the Freedom of Information Act-type legislation, never permit the disclosure of ongoing investigative material.  So I am a little bit confused by how that would happen.   Sonia Sotomayor  But Congress obviously wanted more than that, because if Congress's intent was the one that you are announcing then it should have just permitted original sources to sue.  But that's not the choice it made.  It broadened the scope of qui tam actions to include more sources or more reward for individuals who don't have original information.   Sonia Sotomayor  But why can't it -- why can't it protect itself if these reports are in its possession?  How are they any more in the -- or less in the government's possession than articles in the news media, than State, criminal, civil, and administrative hearings?  You, yourself, make it very clear that the government -- it isn't keeping track of all of those other sources.     Well, Your Honor, Petitioners' reference to this audit being in the possession of the government -- it's happenstance that this particular report, the Crisp & Hughes report, was sent to the Federal government official.  But the vast majority of State and local governmental investigations, audits, and reports, are not going to be given to the Federal government, and even though they are -- they cite the Single Audit Act, which is only a very narrow subset of audits that States or local governments perform -- do not actually disclose the allegations of the fraud.  In order to get to the actual information of the fraud, the -- first of all, it would have to be brought to the attention of the relevant Federal agency.  Usually, the cognizant agency is the one that has the most money at stake, but the fraud may have to do with a different Federal program, so it has to be brought to the attention of the program whose interests are actually at stake.  They have to go beyond the report that is -- that is publicly available in the clearinghouse website, which tells you virtually nothing, to an underlying report which is itself, generally, fairly vague, and all Petitioners say is that the working papers of the auditor are available to the government, not even in the government's possession, they are available to the government if it requests it.  The government has to drill down many levels before it necessarily is going to know about that fraud.   Sonia Sotomayor  Isn't that argument suggesting that the court didn't even need to reach this issue, even assuming that the State administrative reports are included in the bar?     No -- no, Your Honor, I don't think so.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, aren't you arguing that what was in this audit report wasn't sufficient to show the fraud?  That's not your argument?     No -- again, this report here did have information that was indicative of fraud, and this report--   Sonia Sotomayor  In which way?     --Excuse me?   Sonia Sotomayor  Which way?  All it said was that this person wasn't chosen by bidding.  But aren't there situations in which non-bids are permitted?     There -- there were multiple allegations.  One of the allegations underlying the relator's claim is that the government -- the county certified that certain procedures were followed that would have included a requirement that it be bid out, and that it was not.  Another was that certain work was paid for or billed for, but wasn't performed or was not performed well, so there were -- there were different allegations, and where that would be disclosed to a single person, that would constitute a public disclosure, at least with respect to Federal--   ",08-304X

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Is there any other area -- is there any other area of law where we permit a prejudgment attachment and/or seizure of property without a neutral magistrate reviewing the reason for that seizure?  We don't permit a pretrial attachment, do we, except in some narrow circumstances?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that's--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I don't deny that there's a State interest.  The question is who tests that interest?  In what time frame?  Meaning you can assert an interest, but someone has to determine whether it really exists or not.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So am I forgetting, but didn't this start out as a class action and wasn't the claim -- wasn't the class action denied?   Sonia Sotomayor  And you didn't appeal that?   Sonia Sotomayor  What did the Illinois court do?  Didn't it remand for an appropriate hearing to be given?   William M. Jay  Your Honor, the Seventh Circuit remanded for the district court to fashion -- to fashion some kind of procedure, that's right.  And after that remand order the plaintiffs, interpreting what the Seventh Circuit had said, filed the amended motion for class certification that Mr. Castiglione referred to, and in that they said they wanted a class certified to pursue damages for the time that their property was detained, and they wanted the court to certify a class of anyone who had had their property held for more than 7 days this time without -- without a proper hearing.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  You take the car and then you investigate?   William M. Jay  --Your Honor, there's more to investigate than just the probable cause to seize.  In many cases, the probable cause to believe the car is forfeitable is ironclad, but there is more to investigate because, for example, an innocent owner in Illinois by statute is entitled not to have her car or her gun or her personal -- other personal property -- it could be currency -- forfeited.  And that--   Sonia Sotomayor  But -- but you are -- but you're sort of begging the question.  You are saying to me that initial period is for the government to figure out if it made a mistake or not, and we're entitled to that time.  You're not entitled, meaning you, property owner, to go to a neutral magistrate who will make that decision without a personal interest in the outcome, because the person who seized does have an interest of some sort.  Many local police departments do in seizing property, because they keep the proceeds.  So what you're saying is that constitutionally it's okay for the party holding on to property without a warrant to decide whether or not it wants to give something back, whether or not there's -- there's a viable defense.  I'm a little confused.   William M. Jay  --Let me respond to that in a couple of steps.  And the first is to respond to your point about the incentives that local police departments may face.  There is no incentive to -- to hold property longer than necessary because, while the property is being held, there is no ability to access that property.  If it's currency, for example -- as Mr. Castiglione pointed out, 85 percent of their seizures are -- the currency is held in a suspense account and is not accessible by the -- by the seizing government at all.  So the government has no interest in delaying longer than necessary, especially for cars.  The government has to take care of the car, maintain it in a lot, you know, preserve it from -- from harm.  Second, on the basic question of what is the government doing during this time?  The government has a due process obligation, especially in an in rem proceeding like this one, which deals with a piece of property to which there may be competing claims.  The government has a -- itself has a due process obligation to notify everyone who has a claim to this property that it's in the government's custody and that there will be a proceeding to adjudicate the competing claims to it.  I mean, this Court in Robinson v. Hanrahan, a decision in 1972, held that Illinois under its forfeiture statute had violated due process by not providing notice to the owner -- to the registered owner of a car, because it sent notice to that owner at his address when in fact he was in the custody of the State of Illinois in a criminal proceeding.  The State has an obligation to notify -- to investigate, especially after a seizure, even if it is a car which only a minority of seizures are -- even if it is a car.  Identifying the driver is not enough to identify who has a claim to that car.  There may be a registered owner.  There may be -- there may be a security interest.  In currency cases, it's even more difficult, because on the face of currency there is no indication who owns the currency--   ",08-351X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  No, it wasn't.  The appeal in Geraghty included an appeal of the denial of class certification.   Sonia Sotomayor  So both issues -- both the merits and the denial of the class certification -- were still active before the Court.  Here you didn't appeal the dismissal of the class certification or the mootness of it.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But -- but in many appeals parties plead in the alternative and say, if you -- if we win on the merits, reverse the dismissal of the class certification because we still want to proceed as a class.  You didn't do that.  You waited for the merits to be adjudicated and then filed a new class action.  It's a very different procedural step.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, can you unpackage for me this hearing?  Because there is a confusion in it that appears, both in your papers and in this argument.  There's a probable cause component, which is the police coming before a neutral magistrate and saying, this is the reason I seized; I have probable cause to believe that this car was involved in an illegal activity, and this is why.  And then there is what sounds like, to me, a sort of remission-type component to the hearing you are looking at, which is a magistrate saying, okay, you have probable cause, but there's no reason for the seizing authorities to keep the car because you can post a bond instead, or something else should be done to mitigate the damage to you during this process of forfeiture.  Am I correct that there are two components to your request?  And if there are, I understand the probable cause component, but I'm not sure how you get to the second component of how and why due process would require the State to have a -- I'm calling it remission -- but a remission-like proceeding?  Am I correct?  Am I understanding what -- what it is you're--   INTERRUPTING ",08-351X

If you thought that he didn't have standing to challenge the cross at all and that the injunction itself directing you to cover up the cross was wrong, you should have come to the Court.  It was a permanent injunction.  You were told you have interlocutory appeal rights, you have final judgment rights.  At any point you could have come and said: The order for us to take that flag -- to take that cross off this land was just plain wrong.   Sonia Sotomayor  But interlocutory appeal or finality doesn't matter what you are going to do to get away from the injunction.  The issue is did you give up any rights to challenge any of the issues embodied in that injunction and you haven't answered why not.  You may have a right, and you do, to challenge a modification of that injunction.  That's what you are here to do, to say the Ninth Circuit erred in modifying the injunction and stopping the transfer.  Perfectly legitimate point, because the injunction has been changed.  But you can't go back and relitigate whether he had standing to challenge that -- the presence of that cross.

So really your argument is that the reason this Court -- this cross on private land, if it becomes private, is offensive to the Establishment Clause is because of the government's prior history with respect to that cross, correct?

Maybe your adversary has to answer that instead of you, but all of the other private property owners.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, no, no.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Now, under your rule, the trustee has 30 days to get this good faith basis.  Does that mean that he or she has to get a valuation on everything that's listed at full value, that that is really the burden we're talking about?  It's not the burden of filing a piece of paper that says I want an a exemption, or even one that says I have an objection.  It's what it takes to support that objection and how much effort goes to that activity.   Sonia Sotomayor  No, there's a huge difference between a rule that says you don't have to actually go after this information in a formal way.  If someone's claiming only the exempt amount, then I'll go ahead and I'll administer the estate, and over time I'll talk informally to people and get a sense of whether the valuation is right or not, but I won't actually -- actually have to get a formal appraisal because I'll just use my judgment.  Your rule would require something else.  They would have to get the appraisal to lodge the request for an extension or to lodge the request for an objection.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, in -- what's interesting is that all of the circuits or most, the majority, have not announced the fixed rule.  The rule they've said is: It depends on the circumstances.  And so it appears to me that most of the courts are saying to us: We don't want a default rule, because we have to see what has happened and see what has happened between the parties to determine in one situation rather than another what the intent was.  It's not an irrational rule.  Why shouldn't we be considering that as an alternative?  Because once we make an announcement like the one that you're proposing, it is an inducement to undervalue your property, for a debtor, because -- in the hopes that an overly worked trustee won't have either the time or opportunity or wherewithal to understand that the value is off and that they're going to lose something that the estate is entitled to.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No.  There are comparable circuit court opinions and situations very analogous to this one, where the circuit courts have looked at what the trustee and the debtor have done during the process.  And if the debtor has not made it clear that they're seeking the full value of the property, as happened here, there was a conversation that the value was off, the debtor did not tell the trustee that she was claiming the full amount of the property.  And there are analogous situations where the circuits have said, no, that doesn't show your intent because you didn't articulate it to the trustee in the informal meetings.  That's not an irrational conclusion by those circuits.   Sonia Sotomayor  No.  What it says is, if you're engaged in good faith negotiation over a value or over the claimed exemption, you should -- both sides should be open about it.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Most of these cases, the objections are -- the discussions are not at the time of objection.  They are at the time of the creditors' meeting.  It is part of the discussion.  That's what the courts are looking to.  What's happening between the parties?  Have they made their intent clear, and what does that intent reflect?   ",08-538X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, can I unpackage your argument a little bit.  Because using the word ""fair fee"" in my mind is meaningless, because it has to be fair in relationship to something.  And so what is your definition of what that something is that it's fair to, and -- or unfair against?  And start from there, because I understood the Seventh Circuit to be saying: Look, a fair fee is paying market value.  If one takes a sort of reading -- whatever negotiation goes on between the two, as long as there has been full disclosure as required, that's the market.  So that's fair.  You're saying it's something else.  What's that something else?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So you start there.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So let's stop confusing this -- the articulation of the standard, which is -- that's fair.  What would an arm's-length transaction produce?  And let's go to what seems to be part of your argument and sort of what everyone's skirting around, which is what's the proof that a particular transaction is not arm's-length?  The Seventh Circuit appeared to be saying, it's arm's-length when the parties have done all of the disclosure that is required, because then the buyer can decide whether they want to pay that fee or not, and once they choose to it's a fair price.  It's an arm's length transaction.  You are saying not, and that's what -- that's where I am trying to get to the nub of why not?  Why is--   Sonia Sotomayor  --That's -- now, that's begging the question, because Congress hasn't said a reasonable fee.  It did say fiduciary duty, but it didn't -- there is a subtle but very important difference between reasonable and -- a reasonable fee and a fiduciary duty with respect to fees.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm still begging the question, fair against what.   Sonia Sotomayor  Even if they agree to pay double the price?   Sonia Sotomayor  That -- that's what -- are you advocating that there is a stand-alone cause of action or breach of duty when there isn't full disclosure, even if the fee is within arm's length -- normal -- begging the question of what's normal, but assuming that it's within an arm's-length transaction range in the market?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, how much deviance, and what is the scope of the range?   ",08-586X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Let's assume -- let's assume that all of the independent board of director members vote for a particular fee, but the fee is negotiated by an insider, and the insider is the one who does the evaluation, looks at them and says: I think this is really a great deal, guys.  And they just fell for it.  Is that a process that would guarantee an arm's-length transaction in the sense that Congress intended in this act?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Which cause of action--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --under what?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So, then their process is part of your definition of ""fiduciary duty""?  A court has to look at the nature of process?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Now -- now you are adding what has been added, which is outside of the range, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  But what you are -- but what you are arguing is, if the process is fair, even if the fee is outside the range of an arm'slength transaction, there is no cause of action?   Sonia Sotomayor  Except that they claim that you were receiving additional payment for the services, or some or at least a substantial number of the services, that you claim are attributed by the difference.  So they're saying if you compare apples to apples, you are charging twice the amount.  If you compare apples to oranges, there are differences because the oranges were different, but you were getting paid for those oranges separately.  I think that was their argument.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's the issue of disputed fact.  So let's go back.  Are you disavowing the Seventh Circuit's approach?  Because I read your brief and it doesn't appear as if you are defending their market approach that says so long as the process was fair, any fee is okay.  That's how I thought they had reached their conclusion.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's what I'm talking -- I am using his words in terms of case--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --And you're disavowing that?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, the circuit court did things in an unusual order.  Instead of reaching the statutory question, it reached the constitutional question, in par, because it viewed the two as intertwined.  Why isn't its judgment that there's a statutory violation what's at issue before us, because that's what they said?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why not?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No.  It's an award that is contrary to the act.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's the--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Well, I saw it in their brief to the Ninth Circuit.  The Ninth Circuit analyzed the requirements of the act and of circular one and said the board's ruling is not based on those.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's true generally, but if the board believes that as a matter of law it can't hear this dispute and consider normal grounds for excusing a failure to include something in the record because, in its own language, we can't do it, the law doesn't permit us to do it, we have no jurisdiction to consider matters outside the record, we don't apply normal rules of waiver or forfeiture or any of the other rules that attend themselves to a failure of a party to immediately raise a defense like you could have done and waited two and a half years to do, doesn't that suggest that the board is not reaching -- merely resting its decision on a merely procedural rule, it's resting its decision on its erroneous view that the law deprives it of jurisdiction to hear the case?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, but that -- this is not merely a question of law.  This is a question of jurisdiction: Is it entitled to hear a dispute by law?   Sonia Sotomayor  Don't you think there is a big difference between the adjudicator saying: I could, but I choose not to because there is no reason for your failure, from: I won't because I can't.   Sonia Sotomayor  Those are -- those are two very different concepts.   Sonia Sotomayor  Can -- can we -- I'm sorry.  Let's assume that in a published opinion there are two procedural defaults.  One, the union does; the other, the railroad does.  The board says, you know, I am resolving this dispute.  I'm not forgiving the union's procedural default, but I will forgive the railroad's procedural default, because they're an important lifeline business for America and we've got to make sure that they're protected at all costs, and union members are just not important enough to that scheme.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  In your theory, there is no due process violation in that case?  They have heard the arguments, they have given you a full opportunity to make your point about the procedural default.  They are announcing a new rule.  It's okay.  So what's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Under what theory?   Sonia Sotomayor  Why?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, point me to any rule, that -- you know, anybody could point to a rule and says it commands a result.  They -- there are rules here that say disputes should be submitted to the board and resolved.  And they are resolving the dispute, the dispute, and they are saying, you have defaulted, you didn't.   Sonia Sotomayor  But they can do that.  That's what -- that's what the circuit said.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  They could have passed a rule that told people, warned them, and said this is a procedural rule we are going to apply.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  At what point does the interpretation of rules that don't command a result become improper, outside the board's jurisdiction?  According to you, never.   Sonia Sotomayor  But there is a difference between governmentally ordered arbitrations and private contracts.  In private contracts the parties negotiate the rules and they set them forth, and the arbitrators then follow--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Is it your position that if you go through the first phase and as everybody is walking out the two adversaries in the first investigative space say this is never going to be settled, this is the most important case in the history of this -- the railroad system.  Let's go take it to the board.   Sonia Sotomayor  That they can't waive the grievance procedure, that they just can't go straight to you?   Sonia Sotomayor  But we disagree with you.  You say if the board was just plain wrong.  If we look at the Act and circular one and say we can't find what they said anywhere in there, does that doom your argument?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, a plea is something more than: I'm guilty.  It is a strategic decision not to put the government to its burden of proof.  Your definition of voluntariness suggests that there is only one component to it, do I know what my rights are, as opposed to, do I know what they are and making an informed decision to waive those rights.  Your articulation of the rule leaves out the second component: Am I making an informed decision to waive those rights?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But how do you do that?  I mean, your adversary's argument is in their particular case -- and I know that you dispute this -- there is a defense that could win at trial.  And the defendant comes in and says: Okay, what are my choices?  I go to trial and I may serve a longer sentence, but I don't go to trial, I may serve that -- I do go to trial and I serve that longer sentence, but it's here in the U.S. and not in my home country, where I might starve to death.  I think I will stay here and take that risk.  You're -- you're sort of ignoring that component of information in terms of informing the strategic choice of whether to take the risk and go to trial.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, then that goes to the Solicitor General's position, which is: You may be right, an attorney doesn't have to give more information than what's necessary, but doesn't the calculus change when the defendant says, this is important to me; give me accurate advice, if you are going to give me advice?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  But there was no joint venture with respect to the television rights, meaning there was no separate activity, other than the televising of the shows at issue.  Here, the Solicitor General is saying there is a joint venture, and it has to do with the licensing of trademarks, with their quality control, et cetera.  Isn't that a substantial difference?   Sonia Sotomayor  They couldn't -- they couldn't stop that team from joining another league?  Let's assume -- and I -- you know, I don't know enough about football, but let's assume there are two leagues playing.  One of them plays on Saturday and the other plays on Sunday.  You are suggesting that the joint venture couldn't stop their members from joining that other league?  What's the purpose of being in a venture if -- if you are free to reject it and go to somewhere else?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, you -- the Solicitor General is asking us to remand under his new test to find out whether you are challenging the joint venture or challenging simply the licensing to one individual or one entity.  What are you doing?  Do you have an answer to that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Meaning -- I don't--   Sonia Sotomayor  Could it -- using your example, could you tell me what the different questions would be under the single control theory you are proposing and a rule of reason application in its normal course?  So what are the questions you would ask under your theory, and how do they differ from what would happen under a rule of reason analysis?   Malcolm L. Stewart  --I guess under our theory, we would first ask, as to an entity like this, which is entity that is compete in some respects--   Sonia Sotomayor  Let's not go into this case.  Let's -- let's stay with your single commissioner.   Malcolm L. Stewart  --I think we would ask first: Is -- is the commissioner acting as a single entity when he exercises delegated authority in making a business judgment about which supplier to buy paper or what the wages should be?  If the answer is yes, then the Section 1 inquiry is over, then the case is no different from a challenge to--   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, how does that stop any group of competitors from coming in and saying: Gee, I want to sell my gas; I'm going to let this single commissioner decide how much my gas will sell for, and if he chooses to sell it at the same price to everybody, both gas products, that's okay?  How do you get to that?   Malcolm L. Stewart  --Well, if you get -- if a single business is deciding whether to buy paper from one supplier or from several, that wouldn't be subject to Section 1 review, because the decision of the single business might affect the welfare of the competitors, but it wouldn't be concerted action.  And our point is that when -- I think the way in which our position differs from that of the two parties is that on the one hand, I think it is the logical implication of Petitioner's position that because the commissioner's authority to buy supplies for the League or hire referees for the League is ultimately derived from the consent of the individual teams who are independently owned.  The logic of Petitioner's position suggests that that would be subject to Section 1 scrutiny.  On the other hand, the logic of the NFL's position suggests that because the commissioner can set price, can decide from whom to buy paper on behalf of the League, the Jets and the Giants could reach a similar agreement, and the -- or the Jets and the Giants could agree on the prices they will pay secretaries--   ",08-661X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Excuse me.  Did the teams -- did the NFL Properties or some centralized entity always exploit the trademarks of all the franchises, or was there a long period of time in which they each individually franchised their products?   Sonia Sotomayor  But there was some, and that was done by the individual teams?   Sonia Sotomayor  What decision could the sports teams make that would be subject to the antitrust scrutiny under your definition of the permissible range of the joint venture activities?  It seems to me that if the venture wanted to make sure all the teams hired secretaries at the same $1,000-a-year salary, that under your theory, that's okay, because it's a joint venture.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So the answer to my question is, there is -- you are seeking through this ruling what you haven't gotten from Congress: An absolute bar to an antitrust claim.   Sonia Sotomayor  So -- so answer my question.  What decision--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --The -- if the reasonableness of this decision, that T-shirts promotes the game, is so self-evident, then why wouldn't the rule of reason control completely?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why do we need to even go to the single-entity question when, by your own answer, it is undisputed, so abundantly clear, so reasonable--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --what's the need to -- to label it single entity, as opposed to label it what it is, reasonable?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But it's a single purpose -- and I certainly sympathize with that argument.  But isn't the proposition of antitrust law that we have a reason for worrying about concerted activity?  We have a genuine concern as -- or Congress does -- about independent entities joining together and fixing prices.  And we permit them to do so, as Justice Breyer indicated, when the venture has a purpose that is independent than -- from the individual interest, but we say, when it doesn't, we have to ensure, under the rule of reason, that what they are doing is reasonable.  I'm -- I am very swayed by your arguments, but I can very much see a counterargument that promoting T-shirts is only to make money.  It doesn't really promote the game.  It promotes the making of money.  And once you fix prices for making money, that's a Sherman Act violation.   Sonia Sotomayor  But they own the trademarks, so they could.   INTERRUPTING ",08-661X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  But what if the court doesn't, as Justice Scalia has posited?  The court here could do the same thing, depending on the secret being disclosed.  It could set up any number of protective mechanisms.  The issue is broader than that, which is: Why is the public policy of anti-disclosure any more important in the attorney-client privilege than in the trade secret context?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Ah.  Are you sure?   Sonia Sotomayor  But isn't the role -- the central role -- role, is to encourage the frank and open communication between client and attorney?  That's the purpose of the rule, isn't it?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  If that is the purpose, the very existence of exceptions infringes that purpose.  The minute you create an exception, you are placing some sort of limitation to the frank and open discussion that you are permitting, so the damage is already done.  The further disclosure doesn't really serve the purpose -- or help the purpose in any meaningful way.  The fact that an erroneous decision on attorney-client disclosure is not going to stop people from talking to lawyers if they really need to and they are staying within the rules.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well -- but that's what I'm trying to figure out, because you are positing that erroneous decisions on disclosures are being made routinely by the lower courts.  Assuming, as I do, that there are some erroneous disclosures, but that that's not necessarily the majority, why is there an incremental erosion significant enough to overcome our interests in the finality rule?   Sonia Sotomayor  What is the use -- I'm -- I'm sorry if I cut you off.  But what is the use by the adversary lawyer that you are worried about?  That the lawyer is going to use the information against your client, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  So there is a remedy.  After final judgment, if the information was disclosed erroneously, the court sets aside the judgment, sends it back, and says, you can't use it in the future and so make your case without it.   Sonia Sotomayor  Why isn't that an effective remedy for the harm that you are claiming exists in the disclosure?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You have to a right to choose your lawyer and not to be -- and not to be represented by a -- by a different lawyer, and yet we don't permit that to be interlocutorily appealed.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why is this any greater in terms of the harm that your client suffers?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I understand what the court below did.  I'm just following up on your point about the importance of this privilege and why it's critical that it be subject to interlocutory appeal as opposed to the final judgment ruling.   Sonia Sotomayor  Are you -- just so I'm clear about your position, are you arguing that all issues related to attorney-client, whether they are waiver, crime or fraud, scope of the privilege, et cetera, that all issues are immediately appealable because the public interest is the same in all cases related to the attorney-client privilege, or are you wanting us to limit this rule only to the waiver cases?   Sonia Sotomayor  So -- but your position logically would apply to everything, wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Otherwise, how do we distinguish or make a difference in your analysis?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No one is doubting its importance.  The issue is whether or that importance outweighs the finality rule.  That's a very different thing for you.   ",08-678X

Because it's not just freedom from suits like qualified immunity or double jeopardy.  We have granted interlocutory appeal in other areas, including in the Cohen case.

Sonia Sotomayor  So presumably they shouldn't re-engage until the lawyer is present, correct?  That's what Edwards tells them not to do.

This is the time and the fact that such a prolonged period of time has minimized any coercive effect, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Catch and release then no longer -- catch and release is unimportant to you?  There is no meaning to Edwards in that situation, because every prisoner, because he is a captive, is questioned in a place and then told to go back to his room.

I -- I have been trying to figure out why the State court would know in its decisionmaking that Mills commanded a different result when Mills was issued after the State denied its petition for rehearing.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, finality in that sense is generally looked at in terms of AEDPA statute of limitations.  Why should the same rule apply to the question of whether a State has acted contrary to or unreasonably in light of Supreme Court precedent when the precedent didn't exist at the time it was rendering its decision?  How can a court act?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  We don't have to go any further if we simply address the question, at what point in time are we talking about a State court's decision, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Isn't your adversary's position -- I'm sure they will speak for themselves, but their position would be that this is a step further than Jones or other cases because if in fact -- what you are tilling us is that if the jury hangs, the court will have to impose a life sentence or some form of it.

Sonia Sotomayor  But you just--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Is it unconstitutional for the President not to be able to appoint an inferior officer?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  I don't know what's so discretionary and harmful about a bribery or kickback case.  Let's take just the limiting principle of the trunk.  Whether it's in the private or the public sector, why would, offering, there be any discretion or any sense of vagueness about saying: It's illegal to give a bribery?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  To get a contract, to pass legislation, it's illegal to take a kickback.  There is nothing seemingly vague about that or seemingly troublesome about prosecutorial discretion in those -- at least those two situations.  We could then go to the self-dealing question.   Sonia Sotomayor  --I know you are running out of time, but you are speaking so fast I can't even follow you anymore.   ",08-876X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel--   Sonia Sotomayor  --does Skilling -- I'm sorry.   Sonia Sotomayor  Directly answer this question: Does Skilling present the pure question or not?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  We don't know if that's going to be--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Then what's the source -- and I think that's inherent in the Chief Justice's question -- what is it -- where did he draw the line and where do we go to look to where you draw the line on what information needs to be disclosed?  Because if it's not a niece, my best friend is going to get a 1.4 million on this deal.  Where is the line drawn, and what is the source of the law that we look to to figure out where to draw that line?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you are talking about private gain?  Do I gain something as opposed to -- because that -- I know that is the Skilling case.  But if--   Sonia Sotomayor  --No, but that's -- you have to, because you have to tell us what draws -- you have to give us the source or some source of limiting, of limitation.  And that's what Justice Breyer has been talking about.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But defined how?  That's what I'm -- I'm trying -- material in what way?  Because if you don't how by an economic loss to the victim or by private gain to the -- to the perpetrator, then you are left with what substance to the issue of materiality?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What becomes important?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That the -- for an auditor on April 14th his guy -- or April 1st his employee goes off to a ball game?  It could be a huge economic loss to that employer by that employee's decision at that particular moment to go to a baseball game as opposed to working.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But the Second Circuit said economic loss--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --that there has to be the risk of economic loss--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --in the private sector.   Sonia Sotomayor  But is the problem the nondisclosure?   Sonia Sotomayor  Or is the problem the -- the self-dealing itself, the fact that the person is receiving a gain?  There's where I'm trying to draw the line because I keep going back to -- what is the source of information that would put a limitation on how much you disclose or don't disclose?  It has to be -- the issue has to be looked at differently, which is the evil is the self-dealing, the gain the person's receiving.  I know, you don't want me to go there because of Skilling, but I'm troubled because the issue of disclosure creates a Federal common law of what's important to tell either the public or a private employer?  And I don't know how to define that issue of importance--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --other than to say that it's a gain that the individual's receiving or something the individual's doing.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counselor, that presumes that then Congress is using unnecessary words when it differentiates in a statute between discovery of facts constituting a violation and a different statute, like section 13 or 77m, however you want to call it, when it says ""due diligence"".   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So are we supposed to presume that they like using unnecessary words?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you're answering me yes, it's unnecessary.   Sonia Sotomayor  Can you tell me--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Can you tell me what that investigation would entail?  Meaning, you started by saying, go talk to experts, but I'm not sure what talking to experts would have added to the market mix of information.  You either pick one expert who said the theory was sound or one who didn't.  Outside of publicly available information, what -- and finding it -- what other inquiry could they have made that would have led them to discover sufficient information to file a lawsuit?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Assuming they had talked to those lawyers, is there anything to suggest that those lawyers had more information than the ones they included in the publicly available lawsuit?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You haven't answered my question.  Is there some information in some publicly filed lawsuit up until the time of the filing of this lawsuit that disclosed more information about scienter than existed?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could you -- could you tell me what the difference is between actual knowledge and constructive knowledge?  Because as I read the amici who have submitted briefs arguing that actual discovery should be our standard, they appear to say that actual discovery or actual knowledge includes anything that's in the public domain; that parties are presumed -- and we have plenty of cases that say that -- to know what's out there.  So outside of that, how would constructive knowledge or constructive discovery be any different?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It would require the shareholder to find the guy in Burma?  Or to go and attempt in every case to engage employees in dishonorable conduct by talking about their business in private, company business -- as I understood it, we were asking employees to engage in potentially fiduciary breaches?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's going further than the amici are suggesting.  The amici are suggesting -- and assuming we accept their suggestion -- that it should be everything that's in the public domain, which seems reasonable to me.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What, in addition, do you think constructive knowledge would include that the actual knowledge standard doesn't?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Putting all of that--   Sonia Sotomayor  --what in addition to that would it include, in your mind?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So -- so you are conceding amici's point that actual -- an actual knowledge standard is the same as a constructive knowledge standard?   INTERRUPTING ",08-905X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Can -- can you tell me what you see as the difference between the two?  I keep going back to what the amici has argued, which is actual knowledge that includes knowledge of what's in the public domain, under the theory that every shareholder is presumed to know what's in the public domain because that's what they buy with and that's the market theory of securities law.  So, what do you see as a difference between the two?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But I -- it sounds right, but give me a practical -- give me a practical example--   Sonia Sotomayor  --of what you are talking about, where -- where an individual investor would have something that's not in the public domain.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well -- but actual knowledge would include anything the investor had in their possession because that's what actual knowledge is; I have it in my possession -- or I have it in the public domain.  You start it from there.   Sonia Sotomayor  The -- the only difference then would be information the individual would have been able to get that wouldn't have been in the public domain?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I -- so we are in agreement that on a fraud-on-the-market case, it might have a different -- they would be identical?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You are suggesting that, in an individual fraud case, the inquiry has to be constructive knowledge because there could be things that--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --So you are admitting that you filed an improper complaint, that you didn't have a basis -- a good faith basis for the complaint you filed?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So, if you had a good faith basis, what was -- what was in your possession that gave you that good faith basis?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I -- whether it's a legal nullity or not, answer my question which is: You had to have a basis for your complaint.  What was in your possession or in the public possession that gave you that basis?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, you think there was, because you filed suit a month after that study in 2003.   ",08-905X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  Could you repeat what the market was?  Was it the market for all attorneys or only for attorneys doing this type of work?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How about you get a second-year associate whose billing rate for 2 years of experience is $200, and a partner's rate is $500, and a judge says: This individual didn't perform like a 2-year associate; he did the quality and kind of work of someone far superior in years in skill and experience.  That would not, under your argument, entitle the court to give an enhancement?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But you haven't dealt with my hypothetical.  He didn't perform like a second-year associate.  He performed like a 15-year lawyer.  The difference is not with respect to skill and experience.  It's with respect to performance.  And so what Justice Ginsburg was asking is, what you are basically saying, the quality of that representation, even though it reflected more than the market one would look at objectively on the basis of the years of experience, that judge can't enhance, even though someone performed far above whatever else the market would consider his or her skills at the moment.   Sonia Sotomayor  That's not true.  Law firms get bonuses from clients all the time.  They get negotiated.  Some of the amici gave examples of what's happening in the -- what happens in the marketplace.   Sonia Sotomayor  So why can't the judge determine a reasonable fee in the same way the market does?  Which is--   Sonia Sotomayor  --No, but the -- but the Congress didn't use the per-hour lodestar--   Sonia Sotomayor  --as the method.  If that's all it wanted, it could have, and there were suggestions that it consider limiting the -- the award to just a lodestar calculation.  So obviously Congress was thinking of something broader than just that.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That part of the market anyway.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, but that's why we have held in our cases that it should be a rare and exceptional circumstance.  The difference that we are engaged in is whether the quality of performance can ever constitute that rare exception that would justify a district court saying, you performed greater than what the market would have valued you at before your performance.  That's really what the issue is.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  One of the purposes of Congress -- one of the purposes of Congress was to ensure that litigants under these fee-shifting statutes could attract competent counsel, correct?   Pratik A. Shah  Yes, Your Honor.   Sonia Sotomayor  If the market doesn't give them attorneys to start with because there are so many risks involved in this process and it sets a reduced fee because of those risks, how do you attract competent counsel?  How do you attract counsel that is better than the norm in that field to pursue as private attorney generals cases that Congress has determined are worthy of being pursued, unless you have a quality adjustment factor?   Pratik A. Shah  Two responses, Your Honor: First, the problem that you posit about attorneys having -- being deterred by having to absorb, you know, the -- the upfront outlay of significant expert expenses or to having absorbed the contingency risks, those are problems created by this Court's precedent in Dague, not before this Court now.   Sonia Sotomayor  That doesn't mean Dague was right, right?   Pratik A. Shah  Well, Your Honor, no one has asked--   Sonia Sotomayor  No one is arguing a different point?   Pratik A. Shah  --No one in this case has asked the Court to revisit Dague.  But more -- more to the point of your question, the type -- even accepting Respondents' formulation of this enhancement, it would only be available in the rare and exceptional case.  And no reasonable attorney making an ex ante determination to whether to take on a representation would rely on the speculative and remote possibility that the district judge is going to have found this to be one of the best cases he has ever seen in making that calculation.  Respondents' own numbers suggest that these are granted less than one time -- once a year.  That suggests that no reasonable attorney would take that into consideration, and it does not, in fact, further the statutory purpose in that event of attracting competent counsel.  I would like to make one last point, and this is to bring us back to the facts of this case.  I think Respondents' own trial counsel -- the discussion that they give of the lodestar rates used in this case I think is particularly telling.  And this is the affidavit of Marcia Lowry, who was the lead plaintiff's trial counsel, and this was submitted during the fee -- setting hearing, and the relevant excerpt appears on page 41 of the Joint Appendix.  And I want to read from paragraph 25, and here's what she has to say about the rates used by the court:  ""The standard hourly rates reflected in Exhibit 2. ""  --and those are the rates used by the district court --  ""are fair, reasonable and consistent with the hourly rates in the Atlanta market for the price of legal services of comparable quality rendered in cases demanding similar skill, judgment, and performance. ""  Now, the affidavit goes on to say that the rates are still too low for the other factors that Mr. Cohen discussed -- contingency risk, delayed payment, expert fees -- but not for attorney performance.   ",08-970X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Aren't you -- most of your arguments are suggesting that the counter -- that your adversary is now limiting, that the adjustment should be made -- tied to something, and that something would be the actual rate.  And most of the factors you are talking about -- whether the person's a national attorney with overhead or whether that person's a -- has done better work -- the example I used, a second-year associate, could be adjusted just in the rate, and that would give you a grounded place to make a judgment about the exercise of a court's discretion.  Why isn't that a more structured, more--   INTERRUPTING ",08-970X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, the language of the statute of 703 is to  ""limit, segregate, or classify. ""   Sonia Sotomayor  So is it your position that the violation occurs at the classification that's announced and that every subsequent hiring has limited someone's opportunity so that they -- there's a violation subsequently under the limit clause as opposed to the classification clause, or it's each event is a classification violation?   ",08-974X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  So why don't we look at subsection (h)--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --that says -- and it's an --  ""it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to give and. ""  --conjunctive -- ""and act upon the results"".   Sonia Sotomayor  So when you hire, aren't you acting upon the results?  And how are you acting upon -- you may be acting upon it, as Petitioner argues, when you classify, but why aren't you acting upon when you hire?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I go back to Justice Breyer's point.  Isn't it, in the very act of hiring, you are using the test results and saying -- each time you do it, you're saying: I'm going to cut off at this limit, and I'm not going to consider someone outside of this limited tier.   Sonia Sotomayor  But isn't that what ""practice and policy"" means?  Meaning that each time, as you continue forward, you are using a particular practice, a particular policy?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So could you answer Justice Stevens's hypothetical?  What is the difference between those people and each person who does not have a high school diploma is not -- and is not hired?  Does that mean that the moment that they announce the high school diploma requirement, that everybody who had already received one, whether they wanted to work at this job or not, had to sue, and it's only those people who just received the high school diploma who can sue 10 years later?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what is the difference between the policy announcement that each time I hire, I'm not going to use a high school -- I'm not going to look at people who don't have a high school diploma, and I'm not going to look at people who don't have a test score above 89.  What's the difference between those?   INTERRUPTING ",08-974X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  But this wasn't the ruling by the court in analyzing your cases and saying -- you know, in six out of the cases -- six out of the ten cases, discretion was exercised, in four it wasn't, and so it's not firmly established because the numbers are skewed.  Justice Ginsburg -- you pointed Justice Ginsburg to page 23, and the Court very directly there says, look, we are rejecting the State's argument that the waiver rule was mandatory.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And so it characterized your argument that way, that you were saying the district court had no discretion.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, whether you think you did or didn't, that's how the court described it, so it understood you to be taking a different position.  Are we going to correct it because it misunderstood you?  Or--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --What court has said?  As I read the Third Circuit, it says: A procedural rule that is consistently applied in the vast majority of cases; even if State courts are willing to occasionally overlook it and review the merits of a claim, that that's okay.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what other circuit has said that any measure of discretion or even a lot of use of discretion bars deference to the State rule?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How many of those cases resulted in the overturning or the grant of habeas--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --But do we -- what -- what does that tell us about us establishing the rule that you propose?   Sonia Sotomayor  But you are asking us to take away a part of the inquiry.   Sonia Sotomayor  Your notice -- your notice and an opportunity to comply doesn't address a repeated statement by us, which is that whatever test is applied has to get to whether the State court is attempting to evade Federal review of constitutional questions.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  And so your test does nothing to inform that question, for example, the Flowers situation.  There was a clear rule, there was more than an adequate opportunity to comply, and yet we said it didn't qualify for deference because it was clearly, given the circumstances of the State application of the rule at issue, an attempt to evade a constitutional right.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I don't know how you say that.  Yes, it was clearly established that the district court had discretion -- none of the justices below disagreed with this -- to dismiss post-verdict motions on the basis of flight.  The courts below themselves said: What we don't have a rule about is what we do with respect to a post-judgment motion to reinstate or how we the appellate court will treat that waiver once it comes before us.  Will we apply it to the appellate process as well?  I understood the Third Circuit to be saying that it was those two latter components, which the courts below themselves identified as new questions, that it was resolving, that involve new rules.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's as simply as I thought the issue was.  Maybe your adversary will dissuade me and concede your point that what the court was saying, the discretionary application, is what was at issue, but if as I've described things is correct, how does your position continue to be sustained?   Sonia Sotomayor  So what you are disagreeing with is the Third Circuit's conclusion of what the status of Pennsylvania law was?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, Doctor dealt with what will the court do with respect to, not post-verdict motions, but with respect to appeals that are raised before or after flight.   Sonia Sotomayor  And that's what Doctor said?   Sonia Sotomayor  So now the only other -- Kindler now raises a new question: What are we going to do -- according to the courts below, what are we going to do with post-verdict motions to reinstate and to appeals that result after flight and after waiver; correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's where the disagreement lies: Did the Third Circuit get Pennsylvania law wrong on this issue.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  Let's assume the Third Circuit, that we take the hypothetical that they were right.  How do you still win?   INTERRUPTING ",08-992X

Are you saying, like your adversary, that they were saying because it was discretionary and there were a lot of exceptions to it, it wasn't firmly established?  Or were you -- or do you read it as saying, now that you have made it mandatory, that's a new rule -- the waiver mandatory, that's a new rule?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's not what you are saying.  What do you think the Third Circuit said?   Sonia Sotomayor  What was the change--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --that you think the Third Circuit was identifying?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Let's assume that a lower court in this case had said: You know, we have discretion, but we're not going to exercise it because you escaped twice and were away much longer than most fugitives.  There is a presumption that witnesses' memories fade, that it's harder for trials that are so distant from the event, that distant from an event.  We are not going to exercise our discretion.  Is it your view -- because that's the undertone I'm hearing -- that under firmly established ground that the court would have still ruled that that exercise of discretion was not adequate under--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Sure, it is.  But what you -- there is a tone to the way you presented this case that says because they chose often to exercise discretion in the past, if they choose not to in any case, it's no longer an independent State ground.  That's what -- is that the point you are arguing?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Because that's the question presented.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that begs your adversary's question, which is every case has one or more differences in it.

Sonia Sotomayor  At all levels.  What is your reading of what the new rule that the State was announcing was announcing?  That it was doing away with the State court's relaxed waiver rule?  Was it doing it away with its own relaxed waiver rule?  What's your position in this case?   Sonia Sotomayor  None of them, including the trial court?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  What do you -- what do you do with the contention that the court is bounded by other requirements such as the timing of the meeting of creditors and the plan confirmation, that that binds the district court from resetting it?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, why -- what commends going through all these machinations, all of these alternative ways of avoiding absurd results?  Isn't the answer simply that we just narrow the circumstances in which a court can deviate from the statutory formula?  I mean, it's not -- even before this change, it wasn't that the district courts could at whim change the projected income.  They have to have a clear ground to do so.  Why is that inadequate to protect the interests that Congress had in creating this new formula for income and expenses?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  There was a formula before.  It was somewhat ambiguous, and that's what led to the more defined terms for income and expense.  But that says nothing about changing the court's power to act in a situation where the formula's clearly not going to work.  That was the standard before.   Sonia Sotomayor  How do you file an amended plan and have the court restart the clock, when 101(10A) says only if the debtor has not filed a schedule of current income?  If there's been a plan confirmed or a plan proposed, then the income schedule had to have been filed.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You don't do one without the other.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Forget about 1329.  I'm going to the situation where the plan has been proposed, let's say.  The courts -- if a schedule of income has been filed, then it's without any jurisdiction to change the 6-month lookback period, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it can't under 101(10A).   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  His words were ""known to a virtual certainty"", which are -- likely to happen is different than likely to happen.   Sarah Harrington  --I think, in part, it depends on what type of change you are talking about.  Again, we would never say that a court should speculate about what should happen.  But, for instance, to take another example on the expense side, if a debtor when she proposes her plan owns a second home, a vacation home that is secured by a mortgage, then that secured debt payment is an expense that would be deducted from her income in the calculation of her current disposable income.  But if she proposes to surrender that property as a condition of her plan, she will no longer have that debt payment going forward.  And so that's the type of -- so it will no longer be an expense going forward.

Sonia Sotomayor  With the exception of the fact that the defense attorneys only worked 6 hours, the billing records.  I think that's the only underlying facts in the opinion that appear new; am I correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  So we are only talking about the expert opinion facts being new?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What -- besides the opinion, what were they?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, he did allege that in his petition before the State court?   Sonia Sotomayor  Not specifically, but he said that his counsel didn't prepare.   Sonia Sotomayor  And he pointed to the fact that counsel basically said at the trial, I didn't think we were to have a mitigation hearing, as proof of that, correct.   Sonia Sotomayor  Can we just be clear?   Sonia Sotomayor  I thought that Dr. Stahlberg's affidavit in the State court said that he had brain damage of some sort.   Sonia Sotomayor  I thought it said that he -- the school records show evidence of mental disturbances and some degree of brain damage.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What he did say -- I think there is a difference between -- because he pointed to epilepsy.  He pointed to a series of things that showed some brain damage.  I just want to clarify.  It's not organic damage; the issue is whether the organic damage created a dysfunctionality that contributed to the events.  That's what he didn't know, and he said: It's not -- I would have needed more information to figure that out.   Sonia Sotomayor  No, no, no.  Organic brain damage dysfunctionality.  There is a difference between the two diagnoses.   Sonia Sotomayor  Your adversary points to the difference in language between (d)(1) and (d)(2).   Sonia Sotomayor  (D)(2) refers to unreasonable in light of the facts, unreasonable determination of facts in light of the record before the Court, and subdivision (1) doesn't.  It speaks only an unreasonable decision.  Could you address the difference in the language and why that difference doesn't suggest that the question of an unreasonable legal determination should be based on the record before the Federal court, which in most instances, the vast majority of instances, is just a State court record?   Sonia Sotomayor  But there are exceptions in (e)(2) for hearings.   Sonia Sotomayor  So why shouldn't the first subdivision be read to mean unreasonable legal determination in light of the record before the court?   Sonia Sotomayor  Are you suggesting that if a State court gets a proffer of evidence from a State petitioner who says: I have a billing record that shows that my attorney worked only 6 hours, and the State says: We are not admitting that billing record because it hasn't been authenticated, so we're not looking at that fact, and the Federal habeas looks at what was proffered and says: This is authentication under any rule, State or Federal.  It was improperly admitted, so their legal determination was wrong.  Not unreasonable legal determination as to the IAC, because in fact -- I used the example of 6 hours.  The billing record could show 5 minutes, so that there is no dispute that the person spent essentially no time on mitigation, didn't present anything.  The clearest case you want.  You are suggesting that a habeas corpus court is no longer permitted to look at that new evidence?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But I'm going back to (d)(1).   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's not symmetrical.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  There is a paragraph right after what you cite that basically says unless there is a hearing.  So -- Holland -- doesn't stop at the point that you are quoting.  It goes on in the very next sentence to say  ""unless a hearing has been held. ""   Sonia Sotomayor  So why don't we start the way that you are proposing, which is to start with (e)(2), was the hearing appropriately held, first?  And if it was, why are we excluding the evidence that was developed at that hearing?  What you are proposing is the reverse, to say we start at (d)(1)--   Sonia Sotomayor  --and only if the Petitioner wins under (d)(1), on proving that the decision on the facts before that -- the State court were reasonable, that you ever get to (e)(2).   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why is that logical?  Why isn't it logical to start with (e)(2), which is -- it says in (e)(2) these are the prerequisites to having a hearing, you prove you are entitled to it.  Why are we excluding those facts from the decisionmakers' consideration?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I can tell you the one thing you've said that makes no sense.  There is nothing logical about this statute, or clear about this statute, as the legion of cases that the lower courts have addressed in trying to interpret it, and as the legion Supreme Court cases that have dealt with this statute--   Sonia Sotomayor  --No.   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you clarify the procedure question I asked earlier: Were the billing records made part of the record that went up to the California reviewing courts?   Sonia Sotomayor  Are you claiming the 6-hour one didn't go up?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm just asking a simple question.  Was the -- were the billing records that were used ultimately to calculate the six hours--   Sonia Sotomayor  --were they before the California reviewing courts?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But if I'm on the reviewing court, and the lawyer spent no time preparing--   Sonia Sotomayor  --When I was reviewing judge on the Court of Appeals, someone said he didn't spend any time doing X, Y, and Z, and the first thing I went to was the billing records.  Do the billing records dispute that or not?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So I have to assume -- I don't have to assume, but it's not new evidence.  They had it before them.   ",09-1088
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Could you go back to Justice Kagan's earlier question of how we draw the line?  At what level of generality is sufficient to say that a factual basis of a claim has been developed?   Sonia Sotomayor  But why?  Explain why that -- the opinion is not a fact, that's different.   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you just clarify again for me?  I'm not sure I understand.  Do the billing records, when do they get disclosed to--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, could I just ask one clarifying question.  In the Second Circuit for many years you had the record on appeal which the parties prepared, but you also had the record below which was sent automatically to the judges to review as well.  The billing records that we're talking about, you say they were part of the record below, would that automatically have been sent under California law to the reviewing court?   ",09-1088

Doesn't it make a difference who the reports are coming from and what the substance of those reports may do to your product?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, you got cert granted on a limited question, and the limited question was whether in a complaint that alleges only adverse reports can you prove materiality and scienter without proving statistical importance.  That's the question presented.  Justice Kagan started with the point that the FDA doesn't require that.  It requires just reasonable evidence of a connection, not statistical.  Many of the amici here have done a wonderful job of explaining why statistical importance can't be a measure because it depends on the nature of the study at issue.  So given all of that -- and even in your brief, in a footnote, you answered the question by saying, no, we can't establish that rule as an absolute, because there are additional factors that could prove materiality and scienter.  So you've already answered the question presented.  Are we down to what Justice Scalia asked you, which is: We got a no to the question: Are the facts in this case enough?  I don't know why we would have granted cert on that, but you presented a different question presented.  Given the question presented, is the answer no?  And if not, why not?   Sonia Sotomayor  Can I just interrupt a second?   Sonia Sotomayor  This wasn't an FDA-approved drug.   Sonia Sotomayor  So there weren't any adverse reports in the legal sense of that word.   Sonia Sotomayor  In the FDA sense.  So we're using a misnomer here to start with.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Continue.   INTERRUPTING ",09-1156
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  How was your -- that long litany of factors you mentioned a few moments ago about how a company will go about determining whether an adverse event report is material or not or should be disclosed or not, are you saying that companies don't have to respond to irrational securities holders?  Are you accepting your adversary's proposition that on some level -- you said credible evidence -- that they don't have to respond to things they judge are not credible?   ",09-1156
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Could I -- could I--   Sonia Sotomayor  --just -- just focus the question?  Because we keep talking about whether the APA-type definition of licensing is what Congress intended or not, but you don't disagree that Congress at least intended that if someone violated the Federal law and hired illegal aliens of Hispanic -- undocumented aliens and was found to have violated it, that the State can revoke their license, correct, to do business?   Sonia Sotomayor  So it really doesn't matter whether they are revoking their right to do business in the State.  And they can only revoke their charter or their articles of incorporation if they're -- if they were filed in that State.  They wouldn't have power to revoke a Delaware--   Sonia Sotomayor  --All right.  So it's stopping them from doing business.  So really, the only conflict you are talking about is not the power to stop them from doing business, because you accept that this saving clause gives them the power to do that, to revoke the right to do business.  What you are talking about is a conflict in the adjudication of that issue.   Sonia Sotomayor  So I'm -- you know, how they define ""license"" or not is irrelevant to me.  Walk me through whether -- what expressly preempts that adjudication right--   Sonia Sotomayor  --or what implicitly preempts that adjudication right.   Sonia Sotomayor  Because that is, for me, what the center of this question is.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But it can't be uniformity of sanction, because the court permitted licensing sanctions.   Sonia Sotomayor  So let's go back to my question of adjudication.  What you are saying is what's specifically preempted is the right to adjudicate--   Sonia Sotomayor  --whether someone has hired undocumented aliens, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  Your argument sounds to me like, look at the law and see what its purpose is.  If the purpose is to regulate undocumented aliens, then it's struck down.  If it happens to put its revocation provisions in its licensing law, then its okay.  It doesn't make much sense to me.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The face of the statute talks only about if you hire undocumented aliens your license is revoked.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But the savings clause says that it is okay.  Civil or criminal sanctions other than through licensing and similar laws.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If we disagree with you, could you answer the question I posed to your adversary, which is what makes the adjudication of status preempted?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  At the time the statute was passed there were many, many State laws that adjudicated revocation of licenses.  Perhaps not many have addressed the issue of hiring undocumented aliens, but many State laws existed that independently adjudicated revocations.  What in the legislative history or in the words of the statute show that Congress intended in any way to limit those adjudications?   ",09-115X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm -- doesn't it frustrate the congressional intent when the Federal law says that the I-9 can be used for no purpose other than the Federal adjudication of whether a violation has occurred or not?  Doesn't it frustrate that law to have the States raise a defense that depends on forcing someone to disclose something that the Federal law protects?  I mean, this is a vicious circle.  Federal law says you can't do the I-9, you can't use it for any purpose other than the Federal adjudication.  Now you are creating a defense that says, you have to supply us with something that Federal law otherwise protects from disclosure.   Sonia Sotomayor  That doesn't answer my point.  Doesn't it frustrate Federal law when the Federal law says that I-9 can be used for no purpose other than the Federal adjudication of the status of employees?  I think that's--   Sonia Sotomayor  --So in answer to Justice Breyer's earlier question, in fact, relying on the I-9 does not provide a safe harbor, because under the E-Verify system you can't just rely on the I-9 forms and statutes.  You have to rely on the E-Verify.   Sonia Sotomayor  Wouldn't it be easier, if that is Justice Scalia's concern, to take the Solicitor General's position, that if you are adjudicating good faith or intent differently in any way from the Federal government, that it's granted?  Isn't that what waiting for an as-applied challenge means, whether or not you are putting different requirements on proving good faith?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Then let me ask the question directly.  If Arizona's system does not permit an employer to rely on non-suspect documents, the I-9 documents that are permitted employers to rely on, the Arizona system says, no, you can't rely on those.  Is that preempted or not?  You can't rely on I-9, or the Arizona system says -- on the I-9 documents.  Or the Arizona system says, you can't hire someone who hasn't been approved under the e-verification system.  Is that preempted?   ",09-115X

So there has to be a meaning to the decision to limit the amendment.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, in Rose we talked about a legitimate public purpose in seeking information.  I tie my question to Justice Alito's, which is at what point does -- is it legitimate for the public to seek information, internal information relating to the rules and practices of personnel?  Can the public seek information that places the community at a severe security risk?  Is it possible for us to say that that kind of information, given our line of reasoning in Rose, could not be legitimate public information?   ",09-1163
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Could you tell me what the textual basing for Crooker's ""predominantly internal"" and ""circumvention of agency regulation"" requirements is?  Where in the text are those words and how do you create them except through sort of judicial crafting?   Sonia Sotomayor  The problem with that in this case is that it's a mixed document.  It is predominantly for internal use, but not exclusively.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So how do you square that with the words ""related solely to internal""?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, the case summaries there were internal solely.  They were created only for purposes of the agency's honor code review or discipline review.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And yet we ordered it disclosed.  We created an exception to the plain language of the rule, it seems to me.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Oh, I agree.  But I think the distinction it made was that it's only internal rules and practices of the agency, personnel agency, if the public has no legitimate interest in it.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that begs, I think Justice Scalia's question.  One could argue that everything that the agency develops except rules telling the public how to come to the agency with a complaint, et cetera -- virtually everything will govern either the internal personnel practices or the agency's practices vis-a-vis the public.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So basically anything that the agency uses to craft its internal employee practices and rules gets swept up as private, as internal?   Sonia Sotomayor  If -- if--   Sonia Sotomayor  --So you are taking out the records related to personnel and not making it a condition of the disclosure.  You are saying if any document circumvents the agency's functioning, that is exempted.  You are not tying -- that's where I'm--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --How do the documents that the agency reviews to determine and craft its internal rules and practices fall under the rubric of being related to, solely related to, personnel practices and rules?  If they were created separately, if they were created for multiple purposes, if they were used in different circumstances besides the relationship of employees to others--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --The map doesn't.  You use the map to do the latter things.   Sonia Sotomayor  Do you see -- I'm sorry.  I'm cutting you off because your light is on.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  On the ground that the court here, the Federal court, decided that they weren't predominant issues based mostly on the fact that, like the Virginia court has now, it's decided that there is no economic loss, what were the differences?  What were the differences here?  How would the difference in standard play out here?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The -- I'm sorry.  I don't mean to cut you off, but you're really arguing that due process requires the same treatment, essentially, of notice and an opportunity to be heard that we are giving to a substantive decision that blocks a future member from pursuing his or her claim, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You're almost treating it as a property right, and -- and you're basically saying we're equating it with, essentially, a property right.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If we disagree with you, because there is a difference of some sort between procedure and substantive rights, then what would command the due process violation in a situation in which the Federal litigation has applied essentially the same standard that the State has and there has been adequate representation on the procedural question, where no substantive right of a plaintiff has been extinguished?  That's a lot of conditions, but those are the three conditions of this case.  So what in due process requires that outcome, your outcome?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You're extinguishing a substantive right?  Return to my question of what makes a procedural right substantive.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Actually not true.  The plaintiff here received the same thing.  The issue is how much money the lawyers are going to receive, really, because plaintiff gets their attorney's fees, gets a statutory violation amount, which is going to be the same whether it's in a class action or an individual action, so it's really not the plaintiff who stands to win.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, under the Anti-Injunction Act, would it permit a blanket injunction that says, against all future State court class proceedings across the United States?  Could a court just order a re-litigation bar?   Sonia Sotomayor  That's my question to you.   Sonia Sotomayor  So articulate what we're comparing when we're saying that the relitigation bar can apply to a procedural ruling.   Sonia Sotomayor  We started a little bit on the question.  Is there any requirement that that issue have been fully and fairly adjudicated in the prior proceedings?   Sonia Sotomayor  Let's say -- you talked about different standards.  Your adversary said that in this State reliance doesn't need to be proven.  Let's assume that fact.  And the district court's ruling here was based on a reliance requirement and said no predominance because each individual plaintiff will have to prove reliance.  Does that become the same -- a different standard or no?   Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I -- I'm posing it as a hypothetical.   Sonia Sotomayor  As a hypothetical.   Sonia Sotomayor  You see, the problem is that I don't know how you get and when you get to the question of whether reliance needs to be proven or not, if you're going to bar the State court from reaching that -- that substantive question, not that substantive issue, but that substantive question, which is not very different from here, which is what does economic loss require in terms of proof?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I'm shifting them only to try to get--   Sonia Sotomayor  --a sense of what different standards mean--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --to you, and how we articulate that rule in a way that doesn't preclude -- doesn't permit the barring--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --of claims when there is a different standard.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Excuse me, could you tell me from your briefs, I just haven't understood what the alternative steps are?  The court below talked about some proposals like construction and said the legislature has struck them down.  There's -- the fiscal crisis has gotten worse, so construction is really not an option.  I don't see how you wait for an option that doesn't exist.  They talked about hiring more staff, but the conclusion was that even if you maximize the staff, you don't have the facilities to add more staff, which is what you need to cure the constitutional violation.  So tell me what specific steps outside of this order should have been given time to be implemented because the receiver has basically said, “I've tried, and the small progress we made has been reversed because the population just keeps growing.  So we can never get ahead of the problem.”  So slow down from the rhetoric and give me concrete –   Sonia Sotomayor  -- details about what the least restrictive means would have been other than to say, throw it back to a receiver and special master who are saying, we don't have a solution outside of reducing overcrowding.

Tell me -- give me concrete steps that are least -- less restrictive.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you go back to that panel because it invited you to.

So what you are saying is you are going to do it and if you don't, they invited you to come back and -- you really don't think that if you hit 140 percentage, that the court is going to order an immediate release of the 2.5 percent over the limit it set?

Is that -- is that what you're objecting to?   Sonia Sotomayor  Can you do it in 5 years?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, the best interest of the State of California, isn't it to deliver adequate constitutional care to the people that it incarcerates?  That's a constitutional obligation.   Sonia Sotomayor  So when are you going to get to that?  What are you going to avoid the needless deaths that were reported in this record?  When are you going to avoid or get around people sitting in their feces for days in a dazed state?  When are you going to get to a point where you are going to deliver care that is going to be adequate?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, did you--   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, this issue about evidence, did you proffer to the judge anywhere in this record what the additional evidence it was that you wanted to show?  I know that the decrease in suicides happened post-trial, so you couldn't have proffered that pretrial.   Sonia Sotomayor  But you are from the prisons.  I presume that you could have yourself without discovery set forth or proffer for the court that says, “We had a wait time between diagnosis and treatment that was 60 days, 90 days, 120 days in the past and we have reduced that down now to two weeks or whatever the reality is.

Because there's no noise that was described by this police officer.  It was simply not answering the door and moving.  So if that's all it takes, any police officer will come in and say: In my experience, most drug dealers destroy the evidence when we knock.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could you -- does a ruling in this case that any lawful conduct by the police mean that the police knock, somebody gets up on the other side and walks through a closed door, and closes a door in the back, and police say in my experience it's -- it's consistent with the destruction of property that drug dealers will go into a closed room to get rid of it.  Is that enough?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But what makes that different than knocking on the door and saying, open the door or I'm going to kick it in?  You're saying that's lawful because until the person submits, you're suggesting there's no coercion in that whatsoever.

Sonia Sotomayor  So there's no bad faith measure whatsoever in your--   Sonia Sotomayor  --analysis, and lawfulness is defined by actual physical seizure.

And Congress may have specified some terms to include; but--   Sonia Sotomayor  --How do you answer the point that, if Congress wanted to make this a pure regulatory statute, it wouldn't have even required a contract?

Why do we even need a contract, unless inherent with it is some discretion in the agency who's administering it?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --discretion that is consistent with normal contract principles?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Phillips--   Sonia Sotomayor  --why wasn't the need to share that technology a part of this contract or a condition to the contract.  I've gone through the contract -- or, not all of it; enough of it.  I haven't found anywhere in the contract that it requires the U.S. to share information with you.  Does that have anything to do with what due process would require?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm going to pose a hypothetical.  Let's assume the contract required the sharing of state secrets and the government then invokes its privilege.  Is that a different case than this one in terms of due process?  Wouldn't the -- wouldn't the former situation, where it's been made a condition of the contract, require a different treatment than this situation where the government's just saying, if you want to raise a defense that's not part of the contract, then you do what every other litigant with a privilege does -- who a privilege has been invoked against; you proceed with whatever evidence you have.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's usually what happens with other privileges.   Sonia Sotomayor  Wait a minute.  Where's the obligation of the government to tell you, build it this way using the technology we already have.  I thought your claim was that you were promised this information and you structured the contract based on that promise.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, there's a factual dispute about that.  I think somewhere I read that there is a claim that they told you your weight estimates weren't right.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Phillips, give us a way, a reasoned way, to reach the result Justice Scalia is suggesting, because you are being greedy.  You admitted it.  The termination--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --A termination for--   Sonia Sotomayor  --convenience carries its own automatic consequences that appear unfair in light of the fact that the litigation of the default termination has been invoked because there is a risk to the United States.  So, is there a reasoned way to do it--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --to not -- to not impose that unfairness on the government?  And if there's not, then explain to me why it's unfair, given that you're two sophisticated contracting parties, to say you entered a contract knowing the government could invoke state secrets, it has, and so you bear the risk of that.  I mean, you always knew the government could do this.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It goes back to my original question is--   Sonia Sotomayor  --you could have contracted around it.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Just before we get there, that showing was based on the court's in camera review of quite a bit of already confidential information, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  And the nonprivileged information.  So it made this judgment on the basis of a great deal of information, and yet it couldn't conclude that you were right as a matter of law, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  On what principle of law?

Wasn't your president, your English president, present at the Las Vegas show in which this New Jersey company first saw the machine?  Is that correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  I know there's a--   Sonia Sotomayor  --And you approved all marketing efforts.

Sonia Sotomayor  You did make suggestions with respect to advertising?  At least with -- at least once, but you did?   Sonia Sotomayor  Okay.

Sonia Sotomayor  I think--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I'm sorry.  Could you -- just one quick point of clarification.   Sonia Sotomayor  It's a point that your adversary raised in passing.  I'm not quite sure, do you sell outright to the American company?  Do you ship a product and they pay you, or they only pay you when they receive the money from their customer?

Sonia Sotomayor  How do you see or what difference do you see between their loss causation evidence and an inefficient market?  Could they -- assuming there was no stipulation in this case, do you see any difference in -- in how they could use the fact that other information affected the market and not this one?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  What kind of case, hypothetically, would qualify under your theory as a petitioning case to the sovereign?

You have to from -- you can't invite a question as to whether the sovereign is responsible until you litigate the issue.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Those are clear cases.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I was asking the flip.   Sonia Sotomayor  How much of your argument is premised on the fact that there was an alternative mechanism to the court system available.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counselor, your client won everything in his collective bargaining grievance.  He got his pay back, he got them to stop doing what they did, and he found a lawyer to file a constitutional claim.  So your suggestion that lawyers won't fight semi-chaotic adventures is realistic as well.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  People get upset about how they're treated all of the time, and they find lawyers to file suits about that treatment.   INTERRUPTING ",09-1476
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, on that issue, do you accept the First Circuit's rule in U.S. v. Hood that if the government is found to be attempting to frustrate the operation of the Speedy Trial Act, that those motions and their delays won't be counted?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It suggests that qualification?   Sonia Sotomayor  Sanctionable against the government, or--   Sonia Sotomayor  --How does that help a defendant whose speedy trial rights have been violated?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You haven't answered my question.  The rights that this statute protects are the rights to have your trial start within 70 days absent or extended to these exclusions.  If the government frustrates that and makes the trial start later, why shouldn't a defendant have the benefit of the Act and have the indictment dismissed with or without prejudice?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I hope you won't sit down without addressing the (h)(1)(F) issue and explain why we shouldn't reach it, because the issue is, as I see it, one of law, not like Nobles, one of discretion.  And although you say it's unimportant because of a change in Rule 45, how could any criminal conviction that's inappropriate be unimportant to the defendant or insignificant enough for this Court to address the question once the case is before us?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel--   Sonia Sotomayor  --there's a lot--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, there's a lot of discussion about the applicability or nonapplicability of this rule to this case.  The rule by its terms applies to computing any period of time specified in these rules, any local rule or any court order.  None of that includes the statute at issue here, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  So this whole debate about whether the rule applies or not is irrelevant.  The only question is what does the statute intend, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So if what the statute intends hasn't changed--   Sonia Sotomayor  --between the old rule or the revised rule, correct?  Congress hasn't--   Sonia Sotomayor  --made an amendment; correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  Will you like the way we're going if I accept your proposition that when Congress uses 10 days, it really means 10 business days?  I take words in a statute like that at their plain meaning.  It says 10 days, not 10 business days.  So--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --But Congress has used 10 -- has used business days in other provisions, hasn't it?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So Congress changed its mind between the two rules?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How do I know that?  Where?  Rule 45 doesn't apply to statutes.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Where in the statute does it -- say, apply the criminal rules?   ",09-1498
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Excuse me, but isn't that what the statute says?  Meaning, if you look at (h), the beginning paragraph at (h), it says,  ""The following periods of delay shall be excluded in computing the time within which the trial of any such offense must commence. ""  It's not talking about the delay of the trial.  It's talking about the computation of the start date for the trial.  So if that's what that commands you to do, doesn't -- isn't only the Solicitor General's position consistent with that?  It's telling you to take the periods of delay and compute the date the trial must start by excluding those.  That's the language.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's the--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Well, but that's what (h) says; (h) says you compute the start date of the trial, when it must start, by excluding all of these periods of delay.  It's defining it for you.   Sonia Sotomayor  So it doesn't matter how substantial and important a motion is, whether it was your motion to dismiss for Speedy Trial Act reasons or the administrative motions here that you say really didn't require time?  It doesn't matter; all that matters is keeping track from day one, the commencement of the trial, as to when the Court is about to set the trial date, that it does it at the end of all the motions.  That's the only time the court can do it.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why wouldn't it matter?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, actually it happens all the time.  In the ""rocket docket"" in Virginia, the court sets a trial date, and you file whatever motions you're going to file.  Under your theory, until that last motion actually delays the trial date, none of those motions exclude time.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I don't believe I had a trial in my district court days where between the time I had the pretrial conference and the time trial started, there wasn't a slew of motions, because that's about the time counsel tends to wake up.   Sonia Sotomayor  Okay?  And -- and decide that really now they've got to get ready.   Sonia Sotomayor  Why should we care whether it's an administrative motion or simply to clarify the functioning of the trial?  Why should we not exclude those times, because those -- those motions, whether they're administrative or not, will cause the trial to go faster, because issues that would otherwise consume the time of the court during trial are being resolved before trial.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  But whose primary purpose is it?  I mean, the victim here knew that the incident hadn't happened there.  There was nothing he had to share with the police, because they could see he was bleeding from his stomach and he had been shot.  He apparently didn't fear any threat, or there doesn't seem to be any circumstances suggesting an immediate threat to him.  He had driven away.  Rick didn't know where he had gone.  So what's the ongoing emergency to the victim?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, wait a minute.  What is the primary -- isn't -- doesn't -- isn't there a footnote that says the primary purpose of the declarant is what is at issue?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, in Davis, the issue is: Why was the declarant talking?  What you were trying to do was to figure out whether the declarant was seeking help or attempting to get someone arrested.  That's how I read the situation.  The questions provided context for that.  Are you seeking immediate ongoing help or are you talking about an event, attempting to get the police to intercede and arrest the person?  Isn't that a fair reading of that case?   Sonia Sotomayor  But what does that have to do -- we are back to the reliability test, really, because they didn't do anything wrong.  They were trying to assess the situation.  But that's just what they do when any report of criminal activity occurs.  That's a different inquiry than the inquiry of: Why should that statement be permitted to be introduced at trial?  It goes to the very essence of reliability.  Was the statement made under circumstances that would suggest an intent to testify?  That's really what you're getting at, isn't it?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, you are, because you were trying to pigeonhole yourself into an ongoing emergency that suggests that in those situations, whatever the person is saying is okay, because it was done to assess an emergency situation and not done for purposes of catching somebody, primary purpose of catching somebody.   Sonia Sotomayor  For all crimes, or only for shooting crimes or knifing crimes?  For explosions?  What kinds of crimes would qualify?   Sonia Sotomayor  Let's go to formality.  It can't be that you arrive at a scene of a crime and everything a victim tells you is admissible.  There has to be some emergency.  That's what we have said.   Sonia Sotomayor  Correct?  So the issue here is how do you define that dividing line between emergency and non when the police officers are just asking questions that by their nature are always going to be testimonial, because they are going to use or try to use whatever is said later.  So in discerning the primary purpose, I think your adversary is saying, you can't go by what the police officer are asking, because they are going to be asking dual motive always.  You have to look to what the Declarant tells you.  And is he or she telling you something that suggests an emergency?

Sonia Sotomayor  So this immunity would come along until they go to the FDA and say, Well, we've gotten enough incidents to prove--   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you please just answer that question?  What is the motivation for the manufacturer to either continue the testing of their product and voluntarily stopping it if a better design has been found by someone else or even an inducement for them to find a better design if a competitor comes around?

I mean, won't most of these cases get resolved on a motion for summary judgment?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Point me to the FDA regulations or law where the FDA, in giving a license to or permitting a new vaccine, actually looks at whether that vaccine is the most efficacious way with the least serious harm to the population.  Is there a regulation that requires that judgment by them before they issue permission to market?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  What is the motivation?  If there is no -- there's no approval mechanism for the FDA to look at that issue, what is the motivation for manufacturers to voluntarily remove a drug that is causing harm to the public before the FDA acts?  If they are completely immune under your reading of this preemption statute, what motivates them to act more quickly?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What is the inducement for them to do it voluntarily?   Sonia Sotomayor  I am not asking about the FDA.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I said the manufacturers' motivations.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Does the victim of that withholding have a private cause of action?  I don't see anything in this that would give them--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Or there is something better on the market than this that won't cause that.

Sonia Sotomayor  It couldn't have been.   Sonia Sotomayor  Not only do they compensate victims, but they permitted victims to go into State court.   Sonia Sotomayor  No, no, no.  That's your assumption.  My point is that if we are talking about what the purpose was, you can't assume that--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --So what you are suggesting is there is no compensation for an injury that was avoidable in its normal sense, which is--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --If this drug had not been sold and another drug had been used the person would have avoided their injury.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Excuse me -- going back to the point you just started with--   Sonia Sotomayor  --which was is this -- is the Control -- Disease Center, is it making a judgment before it approves a drug for licensing, that it's the most efficacious drug on market?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel--   Sonia Sotomayor  --assume I accept your argument, and I am the cruise operator -- the cruise owner, cruise ship owner, and I look at the complaint, and I say: I think they really meant me, but -- I think.  Now, within the 4(m) period, which is the period in which I am supposed to reasonably know that I would have been named absent a mistake, here an answer is filed, and you are told there is a mistake, and you don't correct the mistake.  What conclusion would a reasonable person at that second juncture make about whether you made a mistake or not?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And I think that's what the issue is here, which is, assuming the complaint could be read as a mistake during the 4(m) period, wasn't that mistake corrected, and you refused or failed to act?   Sonia Sotomayor  That makes so little sense to me.  Here I think -- and for the following reason: You seriously I don't think could contend that if you had sought to amend a year later, that that would have been timely, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  But putting aside prejudice--   Sonia Sotomayor  --what the lower court said was because your delay speaks to a choice, that that's the only thing a reasonable defendant would have assumed, that having been told that you sued the wrong party and you continued in that action, that that's what you intended to do, to sue that wrong party.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  You have 120 days to amend, don't you, from the filing of the complaint?   Sonia Sotomayor  Right.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Complaint.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  So why can't Costa Cruise be perceived to hold one of those roles?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's not what the rule says.  The rule doesn't talk about what kind of mistake or why.  The rule says what the defendant should have known.  And so, when you read this complaint, it's very clear you know you're the carrier.   Sonia Sotomayor  You know cruise -- the other line, the sales agent, can't be the carrier, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So it's either a factual or a legal mistake.  There is no other way to read that other than that there is a mistake.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Because -- then have you to answer Justice Breyer's question, which is: What conceivable reason that is not either negligence or unintentional or inadvertent or just plain stupidity, however you want to define it, that someone who is injured would want to name a party who wasn't responsible for the injury?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But, counsel, don't -- what you're really talking about is whether once the answer was filed, they were dilatory in making their motion.  I don't understand how you can argue that the day you received this complaint, you didn't understand that some sort of mistake had been made.  The day that the answer came in, you might start to have a doubt because of their delay in the motion to amend, but doesn't that go to a 15(a) question, whether the judge should have given leave to amend because of dilatory tactics?  Isn't that a 15(a) question, not a 15(c) question?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Is there anything in the face of the complaint that would suggest anything but a mistake?  Now, forget -- I'm being very specific.  On the face of the complaint.  You read that.   Sonia Sotomayor  Where does it say that?  Where does it say:  ""I know that the carrier is Costa Crociere? ""   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What the complaint says is that Costa Cruise, the operator of the vessel, injured me, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And is that an accurate statement of fact?   Sonia Sotomayor  So--   ",09-337X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Excuse me.  The content of the first note was a query of the court.  And that query was:  ""What happens if we can't reach a verdict? ""  Isn't that substantially different?  Doesn't that suggest that the jury is trying to figure out what are the consequences of its actions and whether reaching a consensus is possible?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Excuse me.  How long before that last note was that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Did anybody hear the voices?   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you tell me what facts found by the lower courts or the trial courts show that the Court acted, quote, and this is from our earlier Perez case, the very first in this area,  ""deliberately, responsibly, and not precipitously. ""  in declaring a mistrial.  What in the facts you have recited--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --show that activity?   Sonia Sotomayor  What is the factual finding that you think we have to give deference to?  I know the facts you've recited.  There don't appear to be any of the facts with respect to what occurred during the activity.  So what factual finding do we have to give deference to?   Sonia Sotomayor  But I'm not sure how that finding supports the finding, or a finding, that the Court was acting deliberately, responsibly, and not precipitously.   Sonia Sotomayor  Have you found any case where a judge has declared a mistrial without conferring with counsel, where the declaration was upheld?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well you can't read from that one, because in that one it was -- the mistrial was held, not because of a jury deadlock, but because of improper prejudicial actions during the trial.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Those are different questions.   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you -- yes, but that doesn't mean none.  What -- other than we have cases where judges have declared mistrials because they are going on vacation.  Those are easy, okay?  But somewhere the word ""abuse of discretion"" means that someone has discretion, but is improperly exercising it.  What facts would it take for you to believe that that would have been the case?  What do you have to take out of this case to say, ah, that was -- that would have been an abuse of discretion?  What point?  If he got the note and declared a mistrial, that would be enough, right?  Or would it?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why isn't that this one, meaning the jury doesn't say, we are deadlocked, hopelessly deadlocked, we cannot reach a verdict.  It asks: What happens if we don't?  And the foreperson hasn't conferred with the jury to determine whether or not as a group they believe they are hopelessly deadlocked.  Why isn't this precipitous action?   Sonia Sotomayor  You can't say, can you, that every time the jury records that it can't reach a verdict or it hasn't reached a unanimous verdict, that that's a legal deadlock requiring a mistrial, can you?   Sonia Sotomayor  So obviously the word ""deadlock"", and as I read the judge's questions, he defined it merely as a disagreement as to the verdict.  And later he uses ""hopelessly deadlocked"", but changes the question when he asks the foreperson to respond.  Isn't there a difference between hopelessly, i.e., no further deliberations is likely to reach a verdict, as opposed to you can't ever reach a verdict?   INTERRUPTING ",09-338X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, there is no case in our jurisprudence with identical or nearly identical facts, so this is not under the 24 -- of 2254(d)(1).  So it has to be under the ""unreasonable application"".  Particularly for me, what Supreme Court precedent do you think was unreasonably applied, and explain how and why?   ",09-338X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  --ignore the injunction, can you go to the State and force the State to -- in that circumstance, to get someone to issue the license on your behalf?   Sonia Sotomayor  Or the municipality.  I misspoke.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what you are saying is that a State agent or a municipality can continue to ignore a constitutional violation until, what -- you are denied the license five times?   Sonia Sotomayor  How many times do you have to show that you are not getting that license that you are entitled to?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So what do you do with ANCRA section 11178(a)(2), which tells you that the municipality is responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and retention of the reports sent to the State?  It's not your policy to ignore your obligation and not figure out what to do about the retentions of improperly submitted names?   Sonia Sotomayor  But that's what it is charged with doing.  It is charged with the responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, and retention of these reports.  So if you're charged with the accuracy, completeness, and retention of the reports, why shouldn't you be responsible for the failure to maintain accurate reports?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's your adversary's argument, which is by this lawsuit, you have been told that there's something wrong.  It seems pretty natural that a report would be kept on the registry.  That is then declared just plain wrong.  The court has said there is no foundation whatsoever for the accuracy of what's in that report, and you have failed to establish a procedure to remove the name.  Why aren't you viable under Monell?   Sonia Sotomayor  Who would they sue to do that?  As I am reading ANCRA, it makes the California Department of Justice only the repository of reports.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So who -- who do they sue in the State to--   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, they gave you an example.  Clerk says I'm not giving marriage license to interracial couples.  I think that's constitutional.  Clerk resigns and the municipality says we think he was right, that's constitutional.  It's not our policy.  We didn't really think about it, but we think it's constitutional.  You're arguing that because it was the agent who made that decision, was the city had no policy, you can't give injunctive relief ordering the city to give you a license.   Sonia Sotomayor  How is that different from what the Chief Justice proposed, which is, no, we didn't have a policy, but we are going to defend you anyway because we think it's okay.  Now you are calling that a policy?   Sonia Sotomayor  They are not going to say that, they are going to say, policy, no policy, we don't even think that way.  What he did was okay, we're going to defend that, it's constitutional.  And the court says what he did is not constitutional.  X has to be done instead.  By you, the municipality, even though the agents that you had before was acting on his or her own.     Andrew J. Pincus  In those circumstances where the public is not a party, you can only hold the public party liability when its policy actually inflicted that injury.  These people re-apply for a license and they're denied and a policymaker knows that, then they absolutely are going to come in under Monell and I think it's going to be a sign--   Sonia Sotomayor  So we are now going to have a situation where what you are proposing is that you have to sue the individual actor, get a ruling on the constitutionality of whatever is being done, and then let that suit finish and ask the municipality to perform or not perform, and if it doesn't then you relitigate all these issues?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, could you stop talking in the abstract--   Sonia Sotomayor  --and give me an example.  Give me an example of a situation where a State official under Ex Parte Young has been held to have violated the Constitution where a Monell finding had not been applied already.   Sonia Sotomayor  Exactly.   Sonia Sotomayor  No.  I was trying to do just an analogy in terms of -- because one of his arguments has been that Ex Parte Young doesn't have, inherently, a Monell requirement.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I -- I'm still -- I am sort of asking for a hypothetical and to take it from the abstract.  Tell me what's -- here, you define the ongoing violation as the failure to institute procedures, I'm assuming, to remove a name from the registry, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  That's the ongoing failure that you are alleging entitles you to injunctive relief?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Or was it that you thought the city could remove the name?  I'm not quite sure what it is that you think -- what was the continuing violation?   Sonia Sotomayor  So to prove a future violation, you have to show that the municipality can do that; correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Right.  So why isn't that a policy, practice, or custom?  That's what I'm trying to understand: How--   Sonia Sotomayor  --their failure or omission could be anything but.   INTERRUPTING ",09-350X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Excuse me.  Is your argument that if the district court -- for whatever reason, unlikely as it may be -- starts a hearing the day after the rest of the sentence was imposed and has to continue that hearing for 91 days before it can render a judgment--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --that it's now barred from entering that judgment?   Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I'm not sure I understood your response to my question.  It must impose that restitution order, complete all its proceedings within the 90-day period?   Sonia Sotomayor  So it can't hold a hearing over from the 90th day to the 91st day?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Is there any circuit court who has addressed this issue of when an appeal is timely, in a situation in which a restitution order has not been entered at the initial sentencing?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  They couldn't do that until the end of the 90 days.  If the judge has 90 days to order restitution, that's a vicious cycle argument.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that's not true.  I don't know if you've had time to look at 3582 or 35--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Those do appear to say that once there's a term of imprisonment, that that constitutes a final judgment.   INTERRUPTING ",09-367X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Under your view of things, however, that's fortuity that the underlying conviction was still in the appeal process, because there is no statute of limitations under your reading.  A victim could come 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 100 years later and say: I'm entitled to restitution.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And absent prejudice to the defendant, that would be okay?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, that's 60 days after the restitution order has been issued.  Am I--   Sonia Sotomayor  --That 60 days says after there has been an -- a restitution order.  I'm positing the situation where the victim comes 10 years later.   Sonia Sotomayor  That says there's no restitution order.  It's the initial action.  And you're saying that's okay?  It's an endless statute?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Except that that was a bail question, where there's not issues of finality at play, and bail is a question that repeats itself throughout the proceedings.  Defendants are denied bail and then make a different showing of either resources or less danger or whatever, and they get out.  And vice versa, defendants are out and are put in.  That's it.  There are no finality questions there.  What do you do in this situation when you're dealing with a criminal sentence where there are finality rules?  And I'm going to tie that back to my starting point, which is I'm looking in your brief for the precedent and/or legal basis for us to treat restitution as not part of the final judgment in this criminal action.  What -- what other examples do we have in the criminal context?   ",09-367X

I mean, you answered or appeared to be answering Justice Alito that in a 10-year history if one report of discrimination existed that that would shift the burden to the employer.  Is that an accurate statement of law?  That one report has to play a role that is more than a mere existence, doesn't it?   Sonia Sotomayor  Than the SG?

What does that test that you proposed in your brief -- how does it fit into this?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Let's look at the hypothetical.  Take it out of the facts of this case.  There are two supervisors, each of them have anti-military animus, and they both report that this gentleman was late when he wasn't.   Sonia Sotomayor  Absolutely a falsehood.  They go in, they report it to Miss Buck.  Miss Buck does an investigation.  There are no witnesses.  There is no one else to prove that they came in late.  She just takes the supervisors' word.  She looks at their report moments after the employee didn't show up, and she says: He's a late-goer.  I don't know anything about anti-animus; I simply fired him because two supervisors who are trustworthy, I've looked at their files, they've never lied about anything before, they are pretty honest people.  What happens in that situation?   Sonia Sotomayor  How?  She went and looked for witnesses, didn't find them.  She looked at their records.  She did -- what happened here; other people have complained about these people, don't particularly like them.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's the question.  You just added a very important fact, which is a 10-year history of being late.  But on this day he wasn't late.  On this day the two supervisors made it up.  Would she have fired him absent that report?  Isn't that what the jury has to decide?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, what this circuit's ""cat's paw"" theory does and what others do say, if she engaged in any investigation there's no liability.   Sonia Sotomayor  But that assumes that the employment decision is solely hers.  It's hers, not based on her peccadilloes; it's hers based on the information that she has gathered.   Sonia Sotomayor  But -- but she's not acting in a vacuum.  She's acting on information that has been supplied to her by people who are authorized to supply that to her in the employment context.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  We are now talking past the individual case.   Sonia Sotomayor  I am talking about just the legal analysis, which is: She is a decisionmaker, but there are multiple actors on behalf of the employer.  That's your adversary's position -- or participating in the process.  And they are saying if any of those actors in the process has been delegated employment duties that permit them to participate in this way, then if what motivates them is bias of this kind, then the employer is responsible, not just for Ms. Buck's activities, but for the two supervisors' discriminatory activities.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, in most situations an employer comes in and says: I fired X for X, Y, and Z reasons.  And if they don't mention one of those inconsequential or immaterial reports, why would a court rely on it at all?  It's not a motivating factor.   ",09-400X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  What do you define as -- assuming that we go back to our prior language and use -- in Ruckelshaus, ""some success on the merits"", what's the ""some success on the merits"" that you claim your client reached?   Sonia Sotomayor  Now, I believe that this circuit said, yes, there are cases where we have so held, but that's because there was a cause of action under the complaint that -- that alleged a violation of the Act.  But here there wasn't.  Here, there was a claim for benefits only, and you didn't get benefits.  That was the circuit's reasoning.  So tell me where they erred and how we go back to defining ""some success on the merits"" in light of that position by the circuit?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what do you think our -- the meaning of our footnote, Chief Justice Rehnquist's footnote in Ruckelshaus, who said a procedural victory is not some success on the merits.  How do you differentiate what he meant by a -- some procedural victory is not enough?   Sonia Sotomayor  How could somebody have some success on the merits if they don't achieve a judgment of some sort?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But under your theory, presumably no relief has to be granted?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But then what -- what's the difference -- is it your theory that if the district court -- for whatever reason, if this wasn't an ERISA case where a remand -- or where the court said they did violate, but I've now looked at the evidence that you're proffering, the new evidence they did not consider, and it's not enough for benefits; you don't get it.  Is your argument that you are entitled to fees because they decided there was -- the court decided there was a violation of ERISA?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Going back to Justice Scalia's question, what's the difference between Hanrahan, where there's a violation of the civil procedure code which is an entitlement to process?  Why aren't you successful, if this is a non-ERISA situation, merely for a finding that the district court acted improperly?   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you tell me whether you differ in your definition of ""some success on the merits"" than your predecessor colleague?  Do you define it as in the manner he did, that it's any legal judgment in the Petitioner's favor that another party has done a wrongful act?  I think -- I think I'm summarizing his position accurately.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, that's different than what he said.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  Yes, here there was an order of remand.  That's clear.  And I can understand the difference between an order, because there are many decisions of the court that end up in orders that are not final judgments.  But there are decisions, like this one, I think according to him, that if the district court had said there was a violation of ERISA and the parties then settled without a judicial order reflecting that finding and/or requiring a remand, I think according to him he would say this party was entitled to fees.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, I didn't assume this case.   Sonia Sotomayor  No order, just a finding.   Sonia Sotomayor  And then a settlement.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that seems like a catalyst theory, and that was, at least in dicta, rejected in -- in Ruckelshaus.  So how do you deal with that?   INTERRUPTING ",09-448X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  His point -- your adversary's point -- is the court couldn't effect that procedural move without taking step one in what was requested.  It had to find some sort of violation, either to remand or to grant benefits, so that the relief sought, by definition, needed a finding by the court.  And your adversary says the court found an ERISA violation.  Now, the type of relief it grants is up to its discretion.  This is an equitable situation, and it exercised its discretion by doing a remand.  Why is that view different than calling it a procedural step?  Isn't that a substantive win?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That -- that's difficult.  Let's assume that a claims administrator or a plan administrator is not deciding the claim.  The party comes to court and says: Under ERISA, I have a right to a decision within X number of days; force them, mandamus them to give me a decision.  The court says: Reasonable; you have a right to one.  And orders them to.  Under your theory, they've won nothing?   Sonia Sotomayor  So you're -- you're -- wait a minute.  Then we go back to a question that was asked by one of my colleagues.  If a plan participant came in and said they didn't consider evidence they should have; they didn't seek my treating physician's documents, and here they are; they should consider them now, and the court says you're right, enters a remand order, and dismisses the case -- that's enough?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, what -- what's the difference between the first example I gave, a mandamus to issue a decision -- that's not a claim for benefits, either; it's a claim for a decision.  What's the difference between that and the second hypothetical?   Sonia Sotomayor  So what is the difference between prevailing party and some success on the merits for you?  The only difference is whether they won on one cause of action as opposed to four?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So under Buckhannon, 51 percent only entitles you to fees.  And under your view of this statute, you have -- as long as you get 1 percent order, that's enough.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you -- you see no difference today?   INTERRUPTING ",09-448X

You keep saying -- I know you appealed it originally, but the point is that you didn't seek certiorari on that ground.

This seems more like factual correction which you're getting into.  Put it into a legal box for me.  What are your legal claims?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could you go to the second part of Justice Alito's question, which was the issue of standing, both yours and the Petitioners'.  What is it exactly that we're being asked to review?  Obviously, you're going ahead with the EIS.  You haven't sought a stay of that.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So what's the basis of the challenge to the injunction?   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you have -- let's just -- if this had -- if the order had vacated the deregulation and sent it back to you, what would you have -- the agency have had to do to issue temporary regulations consistent with the ones you proposed to the district court?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But you short-circuited that.  Isn't this more akin to you seeking a stay of the vacating order?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The district court vacated the deregulation.  No one can plant.  You and the Petitioners go into court and say to the court: Stay that deregulation with respect to this kind of planting.  Aren't you the one seeking the stay?  And if so, isn't it your burden to show that you're entitled to whatever it is you seek?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So that's the legal error you identify?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's a little different than answering Justice Kennedy's question, which is: Did you preserve the issue that the district court exceeded its jurisdiction in stopping you from further deregulation?  That's a different question than whether or not it should have granted your further injunction which is, according to you, a further deregulation.  But it's a different question.   Sonia Sotomayor  I have a real problem if the whole appeal is over whether or not the district court should have accepted the agency's views.  The agency has told us that it has side-stepped going through all of the regular -- all of the administrative steps it was required to.  It may not have needed to give notice, but it needed to do some form of an EA and get comments and do other things.  And it didn't do that.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So how can we say that the district court acted improperly, when it's the government who is asking the district court to forgive it from doing something it's legally required to do?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, no.  My problem is I don't see that argument either in your brief or theirs.

It says--   Sonia Sotomayor  --anything that affects 924(c); and then in other places in its brief it says the --  ""the ""except"" clause refers to any higher minimum sentence for possessing, using or carrying a firearm in relationship to a drug or -- drug offense or a crime of violence. ""  Those are two different formulations.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I am focusing on the second formulation.   Sonia Sotomayor  --charging--   INTERRUPTING ",09-479X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, could I just ask one simple question, the one I started with earlier, which was, which of the two statements are you advocating, that the 924(c) explicitly, or are you saying the ""except"" clause -- and I'm quoting from your brief, in two different places --  ""The ""except"" clause refers to a higher minimum sentence for possessing, using a firearm in relationship to a crime of violence or a drug offense? ""   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  If that's the case, your adversary just said, Mr. Abbott's attorney just said, that you don't believe that section 924(c)(1)(A) is trumped by 924(c)(1)(B) or by 18 U.S.C. section 930(c).  Is his allegation correct or is he wrong?   Sonia Sotomayor  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  So that if he discharges a firearm and it says it is a sentence of not less than 10 years and he -- and that firearm is also a short barrelled rifle with a 10 year minimum, does he get 10 years or does he get 20 years?   Sonia Sotomayor  How?   Sonia Sotomayor  So if it's a machine gun where there is a 30-year minimum, does he get 40 or 30?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What do you do with 930(c)?  Don't leave without answering my question.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But your answer to me was, you read the ""except"" clause as applying to any higher minimum sentence for possessing, using or carrying a firearm in relationship to a drug offense or crime of violence.  Isn't killing a person a crime of violence?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And isn't bringing of a firearm into a Federal facility the carrying of a firearm?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, but I'm still trying to understand your position, which is -- I read what you said to me the 930(c) and I couldn't figure out why you didn't list it.   Sonia Sotomayor  How?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  A person who kills any person--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --So how is your reading different from Mr. Abbott's?   ",09-479X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  You have--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, is your problem with unconscionability being -- as described by the Chief Justice or Justice Scalia, being forced to or coerced into signing something -- that's okay for the courts, but this type of argument that goes to the unfairness of the process, that's for the arbitrator; is that your position?   Sonia Sotomayor  So why -- isn't that an unwieldy rule?  Isn't your quarrel with what the court defined as remissible unconscionability as a legal matter, as opposed to trying to parse out what unconscionability means otherwise?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  We just gave you one that didn't: If someone was forced into signing the agreement in an unconscionable way.   Sonia Sotomayor  The problem -- I -- I keep going back to my initial question to you, is you want to parse out what making is from unconscionability, and you want us to say, well, if it's too onerous a fee for arbitration, that goes to the making, because you're depriving the party of -- of an arbitration forum.  If it's discovery, that doesn't go to depriving them of anything because the arbitrator could give them more discovery if he or she chose.  Am I correct, this is your argument?   INTERRUPTING ",09-497X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Could you describe for us what is unconscionable about this contract?  What is your claim of unconscionability?  He says it's not arbitration per se; it's just certain of the provisions here; if you change the provisions, I'm happy with arbitration.  Is that your position?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I think I heard Justice Kennedy's question to be -- let's not confuse the contract as a whole.  There's only one contract here.   Sonia Sotomayor  It's an agreement to arbitrate.   Sonia Sotomayor  So an attack on the -- as I think Justice Breyer noted, you -- an argument that it's one-sided goes to the entire arbitration agreement.  I don't want to arbitrate because that's not what I chose to do freely.  Correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  That, you say, is for the court.   Sonia Sotomayor  The difference here is that there are provisions within how the arbitration is going to be held that, standing alone, you think are unconscionable, even though the agreement to arbitrate is not.  Am I correct in understanding your allegation?   Sonia Sotomayor  You see, that's what I'm confused by, because when I first asked you this question, you said: I would be happy to arbitrate if the court struck the discovery provision and, I guess, the fees provision.  Which answer are you giving me?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Okay.  Let's assume--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Okay.  That -- now I understand that part of your argument.  But let's assume that that wasn't Nevada law, that Nevada law would say severability works, and there is an agreement to arbitrate, and all we have to or could do is strike the unfair provisions.  Let's assume that situation.  Who decides whether to strike the unfair provisions?   INTERRUPTING ",09-497X

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Excuse me.  May I pose a hypothetical so that I understand?  And I think it follows up on what Justice Alito was saying.  Let's assume all taxes are equal between water carriers and railroads, except there is an excise tax: 4 percent on the railroads, 2 percent on the water carriers.   Sonia Sotomayor  Everybody else pays 4 percent.  On your theory, is that discrimination or not?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But this is not an exemption area, so what meaning do you give -- that's what I'm trying to figure out.  Are you saying -- what meaning are you giving to discrimination at all, other than -- unless we accept that the class always has to be the commercial class?   Sonia Sotomayor  So if there's 100 businesses, where does the line between singling out the railroad get drawn?  When they exempt 98?  When they exempt 97?  When they exempt 95, or is it at 80?  Where do we draw the singling out?  If the State says the general tax is 4 percent, but everybody -- but how many are exempted?   Sonia Sotomayor  What sense would there be for Congress to use the word 4 percent like everyone else, but their competitors, for no reason other than that the State wants to favor the water carrier, is only paying 2 percent?  What -- what conceivable reason would Congress want that differential to exist?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm not talking about an exemption.  I'm talking about a rate difference.   Sonia Sotomayor  So to answer that question, you are telling us that we have to define what discrimination means?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's not quite -- it's not quite that.  You forget the other part of the test, which is without a reason.  Now, the other side hasn't defined what a legitimate reason would be.  And that's a separate inquiry.  But if there is a -- some form of legitimate reason to treat people differently, I think the other side is saying that's okay.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  In their particular facts of their case.  I mean, that's what they have to come up and explain to us, what's the -- what's the defining principle of acceptable or unacceptable different treatment, because it can't be -- you're right, logically, it can't be most favored taxpayer status.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, so far, yes, unless they can give--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I'm having a problem.  I thought as you argued in your brief that you were only arguing that States can tax-exempt, but you are asking us to rule more broadly to say that States can treat -- impose taxes differently.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So it doesn't really matter that it's a tax exemption; you are just saying if the tax is a positive imposition or a negative one, taking someone out, it doesn't matter.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, is -- who is the violator alleged here?  Not in the complaint, but in the briefs?  As I read the briefs, they claim that Janus itself did not make the false statement, that the two appellants did, that they are the actual speakers because they were talking about their activities, and they used Janus as a conduit to deceive the market.  That's, I think, what they're alleging.   Sonia Sotomayor  So how do we sustain the intermediary cases when the company, through market analysts, divulges misleading statements?  We don't talk about the market analysts' falsity; we talk about the company's falsity, because the market analysts didn't have scienter.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, what's the difference between an omission or a commission if a company purposely divulges a falsehood to an analyst, knowing it's going to be distributed and told?  So who is making the false statement, the analyst or the company?   Sonia Sotomayor  So why isn't -- why aren't the two appellants, on their theory, on -- we can talk about whether the complaint does or does not adequately allege their theory.  That's a different issue.  I accept that.  But under their theory, why isn't the appellants the primary violator, not even a secondary?  Because they -- they claim, I think -- and I'm going to find out from them -- that Janus had no scienter, that it didn't make the false statements, that all of this was done in secret by the appellants, so they were the only violator.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Do you mean to say to me that puppets become a legal defense for someone who intentionally manipulates the market information?   Sonia Sotomayor  That's the control person statute?   Sonia Sotomayor  But I -- but if Janus had no scienter, if its board of directors did not know that the statements were false, they had no way of knowing, because as I understand the complaint, and this is alleged, the deal was secret.  So Janus itself could not be a primary violator.  Who is?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Even though there was no scheme with another actor?  Even though it was the only violator, which is a fair reading of the complaint?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Except that I, as I read your brief, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, you were arguing that since there was an independent board of directors, presumably because there are two corporate -- different corporate funds -- two different corporate forms, that there couldn't be control person liability under 20(a).  You seem that -- I thought, reading your brief, that's what you were alleging.  So you can't have your cake and eat it, too.  Either the independence of the board makes no difference or it does, so which is your position?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Under what theory would you defend an allegation that the investment manager who had control over the everyday affairs of the company, drafted or helped draft the prospectus, hired the lawyers who helped draft it, wouldn't be a control person?  How would you defend that?   Sonia Sotomayor  Exactly.  So you -- you're -- if they can't be control persons because they're separate companies, then how do they escape being primary violators?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But it's not in this case, because the allegation is that it -- not the company, that it chose to deceive the market.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You're -- you're not suggesting, are you, that they did this for purposes of protecting your client from lawsuit?   Sonia Sotomayor  When it -- no, they did it for a business reason, that having separate entities was economically more useful for the market, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So -- but that doesn't answer Justice Breyer's question, now.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Assuming that they didn't do it for that reason, what does it mean?   ",09-525X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Is your claim premised on Janus being duped or not?  If Janus was not duped, if its board knew and JCM was doing the activity with either the consent or acquiescence of the board, would you have a claim here?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Then go back to Justice Breyer's question, because I can see when there's one primary violator who uses another entity as a dupe or as a puppet, but I can't, and I don't know how to distinguish what you're proposing, from aiding and abetting.  There has to be something to differentiate the two, so what is it?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, could you start by taking your brief and distilling it down to three sentences?  Define what a primary violator is, what a secondary violator is who aids and abets, and who a control person is?  And then tell me how that definition would exclude lawyers, auditors, investment -- general investment advisors, et cetera.  I've read your brief, but I've been trying to distill it down to three sentences.  So try to do that for me.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Give me an example of that.  What do you see as all of the elements?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I understand.  But--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --And that becomes -- how is that different from aiding and abetting the making of a statement?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that's every lawyer--  --who writes the false statement knowing it's false.  So, are you saying every lawyer who writes the statement knowing that it's false is a primary--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, could you have -- you just admitted if there -- if the company was duped, you couldn't have aiding and abetting liability.  Could you impose a 20(b) or 20(b) control person liability?   ",09-525X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Why is that true?  If they are separate corporate entities, what legal rule would stop a separate corporate entity from suing another?  Is there -- if they are part of the same company, I think that's a different issue.  If they are the same company, that's a different issue and just a different branch or a different office.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I'm not quite sure what the premise of your argument is.  You seem to be arguing that the independence of the state agency is what makes this particular entity capable of suing.  Yet in your brief you rely on Verizon's simple test, which says if you are asserting a Federal claim you can sue and you're not -- and you are looking for prospective injunctive relief; you can sue the State.  That general rule wouldn't look at who's suing.  That was part of your argument.  Yet now you are arguing the independence of the agency.  Which is your position.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And if it is the one about the State's independence, how do you articulate why that becomes important or not?  What's the legal significance of that vis-a-vis this case and any ones moving forward?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, following up on Justice Scalia's question to you, his question in fact is in part what happened here.  Virginia at some point did require every State agency to seek the permission of its attorney general, is it, to sue?  And the government said that's not independent enough, and if you want the money you've got to make VOPA eligible to sue without that permission; is that correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could you be a little bit more specific for me on what you mean about an Article 3 problem?  Justice Kennedy was concerned about State attorney generals willy-nilly suing -- or not willy-nilly, suing governors to comply with Federal law.  Why do you think it won't happen, and what are the legal impediments to that occurring?   INTERRUPTING ",09-529X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, I think there are concepts being confused.  There is no question that it hasn't waived sovereign immunity.  VOPA doesn't claim that.  And this is not a direct suit against the State, it's a suit against a State official.  And the entire premise of Ex parte Young is that this doesn't offend sovereign immunity for a party to seek enforcement, prospectively, of a Federal right.  So I don't know why it really matters who the Plaintiff is so long as the sovereign interests that we recognized, that the issue of sovereignty is one that respects a State's coffers and State's laws and we are not going to interfere with any of them, but we are going to ensure that because of the preemptive effect of the Constitution and our laws that Federal laws are respected.  So what's in this case the intrusion on State sovereignty when the State knew and consented consciously to letting VOPA sue for records when it needed to?   Sonia Sotomayor  The State should have expected that.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It hasn't happened.  Why do you think?  Don't you think it hasn't happened because there are so many practical political restraints on that kind of activity?  What would happen I think in that State where there was a rogue attorney general is somebody would win; the governor would win by getting a legislative act that says it can't be done, or the attorney general will win because the political sentiments are so strong in his or her favor that the suit is actually welcomed by the population.  So where is the intrusion on sovereignty?  States do what they want.  The only issue is how do we protect Federal rights.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm not sure that -- what you are forgetting is that Virginia took a lot of money to set up and get the benefits of Federal funds by creating an independent agency.  It had expressed its desire to control the agency more, and it was told very directly: You can't.  You have to let that agency sue.  What I don't understand is why you think that it's a greater affront to sovereignty that the suit is here as opposed to State court.  The State has already said: We're going to take your money and this is what we're going to permit, a suit.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But we use -- we don't bring the State in.  We bring in the State official who is violating a Federal law.   ",09-529X

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  We do, because I have to start with the question of: What are the limits on the Government, if any?  Are you taking the position that as an employer, there are absolutely none, or are you taking the position that there are some, and what would they be?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what you are saying is, there is no limit?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Were these two forms approved by Congress?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's a restriction on disclosure, but the same Congress can change that, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  I'm not sure I understand the answer.  Only 128 times has somebody identified themselves as a drug user?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So it could be for any other answers as well?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If you were not saying that, then what is the narrower ruling?  Because that's what I thought I heard at the beginning of our colloquy today.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, why wouldn't that violate it if the question involved a fundamental right?  If you were asking the question that Justice Alito asked, which is, what's your sexual practices in the bedroom, if there are security checks against you disclosing it, you are saying even that would be okay?   Sonia Sotomayor  Don't -- this is a bit unsatisfying.  Because you start by saying to us, as long as there are some nondisclosure protections, then virtually any question, whether it impinges a fundamental right or not, would be okay, because there's -- I don't even know what the Government's interest is in asking every question it wants to.  There has to be a need for a set of questions, doesn't there?   Sonia Sotomayor  Are you conceding you can't meet that standard or are you saying that the Ninth Circuit misapplied that standard?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Do you think there is something wrong with the Government having to explain why it seeks information?  I mean, I would think that would be fairly simple in virtually every situation.  I ask that question because that begs the question of can you ask anything you want regardless of why?   ",09-530X

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, this is a single incident, and Canton said if you know that a tort is likely to happen without training then one incident is enough.  Every prosecutor knows that there can be Brady violations if people are not taught what Brady means, because it's not self-evident in every situation.  Correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So if you know that rookie prosecutors -- and most prosecutors' offices are filled with young ADA's who have just come out of law school.  If you know that they are going to meet some situations where the answer is not intuitively known, like that if you get a lab report, you should turn it over, don't you have an obligation, isn't that what the jury said, to train them to turn over lab reports?  Now, I know you claim you had that policy.   Sonia Sotomayor  We can talk later about whether or not there was sufficient evidence for the jury to disbelieve that you had that policy or not.  That's a sufficiency of the evidence question.  But if you know that lab reports have to be turned over, you've conceded it's a Brady violation not to do it, and there was sufficient -- and you had no policy -- I know you are disputing that -- and you had no policy of turning it over, why aren't you responsible for a Canton-like violation?   Sonia Sotomayor  Now what you are suggesting is that for certainty you know that a lawyer's judgment is going to go astray because a particular area of law is that complicated.  Your people disagreed -- some of your people disagreed or didn't know whether turning over a lab report was a -- failure to turn over a lab report when you didn't know a defendant's blood type was a Brady violation.  That has been conceded in this case, so I accept as a working proposition that they should have known that.  What you are suggesting is you get a pass because, even though you know that there's an area of law that a young lawyer is not going to be able to figure out on their own, you fail to train them and you're okay.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That that is not the Canton example.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's what you are saying.   Sonia Sotomayor  I understood -- and maybe I'm confused -- that you were arguing that there was no set of circumstances in which a prosecutor could be handled -- could be liable on a theory of failure to train for one incident.   Sonia Sotomayor  That that was the petition.   Sonia Sotomayor  So it doesn't matter what the facts are.  The facts that Justice Kagan gave you would never constitute an actionable claim against a prosecutor; is that your position in this case?

You didn't present to us an issue of whether the jury instruction--   Sonia Sotomayor  --was wrong or not.   Sonia Sotomayor  You see, what I'm trying to figure out is whether your position is that under no circumstance, even the hypothetical that Justice Kagan set forth, could you be charged with a single incident Canton violation.  That is your -- your theory?   Sonia Sotomayor  The Brady situation.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, how do you exercise legal judgment if you don't even know what you are supposed to turn over?  That was Justice Ginsburg's question.   ",09-571X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Wait a minute.  What evidence is there that they put this in their hip pocket?  There was a disclosure that the evidence existed.  Where is the evidence that the defense counsel didn't have access to asking for it?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Or asking for it to be tested?  Where was that suppressed?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And where is the Brady violation for telling a defense attorney, there was a blood sample there, you can test it?   Sonia Sotomayor  So that you are claiming there was suppression of that evidence?   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you please state in simple terms to me what exactly they failed to train these prosecutors to do, that the prosecutors didn't do?  What training -- Justice Alito asked it generally, I'm asking specifically -- what is the exact training that was required in this situation that caused the violation in this case?   Sonia Sotomayor  Forget about no Brady training.  What -- I think Justice Alito asked this question.  What specifically would the training have said or done that would have avoided this Brady violation?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Now that seems to suggest that you are claiming that if there was an intentional violation by prosecutors, that that statement would have avoided the prosecutor from doing something he or she knew was illegal.  Is that what you are intending?   Sonia Sotomayor  Okay.  So tell me.   Sonia Sotomayor  That goes to the sufficiency--   Sonia Sotomayor  --of whether they had a policy to turn over or -- because it was tested, so there was no Brady violation from the failure to test here.   Sonia Sotomayor  But you see, it was tested.  And it was made available to the defense.  Turning over -- using the word turning over is ridiculous, because they are not going to physically give it to the defense attorney to go off and do what he wants.  They are going to give it to a lab that will establish a chain of custody, et cetera, et cetera.  So it was made available.  He went to look at it but the looking at it wouldn't have told the defense attorney anything.  They had to make it available for testing.  He never asked for testing.  They did the lab reports.  So now we come down to the only failure is in the turning over of this report.  Correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Now what did I just say?  The failure to turn over the report.  Correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  Never knew it existed?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I don't know that you answered Justice Kennedy's question.   Sonia Sotomayor  I don't know you answered his question.  His question was: If you can deny or deny on the merits, what is the difference between the two?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And there's two choices, so they have to have different meanings in some way.   Sonia Sotomayor  They showed us the docket for that day--   Sonia Sotomayor  --of the denial here, and there were different ones.  If it's the same court taking action, why would they choose one over the other for particular cases?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's what -- that's feeding into your adversary's argument, that when the court does a summary denial, you don't know whether it's procedural or merits.  That's his argument.  You're adopting his argument.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What was the basis of that?   Sonia Sotomayor  So it took 14 months for this petition to be filed to the State court.  Do you have cases that show whether those 14 months are presumptively unreasonable under California law?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So there is great validity, you think, to your timeliness, so this timeliness claim.  And despite that, you believe the silent denial was an adjudication on the merits.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Did they say that?   Sonia Sotomayor  Did they explicitly say in every single case you have to consult an expert?   Sonia Sotomayor  Or did they say the circumstances of this case, given the nature of the issues, that consultation would have been effective?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  We could take issue with the timing of that consultation, but let's assume that it turns out afterwards that if he had consulted an expert, that that expert would have told him that one of those blood spots absolutely had to be Klein's near the bedroom.  You would have no quarrel with saying it would have been ineffective for that counsel to have failed to confer with an expert, wouldn't you?   Sonia Sotomayor  You would say, even if the expert were to -- an expert would have given that kind of exculpatory information, that that would not have been ineffective?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm not talking -- I gave you a hypothetical different from the facts of this case.  I take the Ninth Circuit to be saying, if you are in an area, and you are a lawyer, where you have no expertise and your case depends on a technical issue, it behooves you to at least talk to an expert to find out if you are on the right track.  And if you fail to and you get something that's completely exculpatory, you are ineffective.  So I posed the hypothetical: If an expert would have looked at all of these test results and said, that has to be Klein's blood there, it can't be Johnson's for this reason, you are positing that even under that circumstance there would not have been ineffectiveness for the failure to consult with an expert?  Is that what you are telling us?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You keep wanting to return to this case, and I respect why you want to, but I am positing a hypothetical that underlies, I think, the Ninth Circuit's point.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It may well be in this case that the consultation would have resulted in no prejudice.  That's different from whether it was effective to ignore a consultation.  Those are two different questions.   Sonia Sotomayor  It wasn't part of the cert, the question, we added the question.   Sonia Sotomayor  No, no.  I'm saying they didn't raise it to start with, we added the question.   Sonia Sotomayor  So it wasn't as if they were trying to get around their own waiver?   ",09-587X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr.--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, there is a lot of talk about the importance of this pool of blood, but as I read Detective Bell's testimony, he never posited or talks about how that pool was formed.  Only your expert knows that.  What Bell does talk about, however, is that there's a high-velocity blood splatter in front of the couch and that the pooling of blood on Klein's face shows that he was shot there.  Your experts do nothing to refute that testimony, which was really the basis of Bell's testimony.  He had nothing to say about the pool of blood.  He talked about why Klein was shot where he was shot.  And there is no expert testimony to refute that.  So how do you get past there being a reasonable probability of a different verdict when there is nothing to refute the critical testimony at issue, that Klein was shot where he was shot because there's high-velocity blood splatter in front of him and because the pooling on his face shows that?   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you explain the blood pooling in the face for me?  You talk about the high-velocity.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm having a very hard time with your reliance on that footnote because the very last paragraph of that footnote says when Respondent's asserts, and I'm shortening the introductory line, a State procedural bar and when nevertheless our order disposing of a habeas corpus decision does not impose the proposed bar or bars as to that claim, that signifies that we considered Respondent's assertion and have determined that the claim or subclaim is not barred on the procedural ground.  So the footnote itself says unless we invoke the procedural bar we are not applying it.   Sonia Sotomayor  Right.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What others could apply in this case?

What would have had to have been determined in a State conviction for you to recognize, under your argument, that it would qualify as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act?   Sonia Sotomayor  Do you know of any State law that is analogous to the Federal law, precisely analogous?   Sonia Sotomayor  That's what I'm trying to -- to get to.  What are the elements of that finding?  What exactly -- because different labels are attached to different crimes that qualify you for recidivism under some State statutes, et cetera.  I'm trying to get you to articulate what finding of recidivism counts, what are the underlying--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Which court now, the State court?   Sonia Sotomayor  So are you arguing that a State court has to make a finding of a valid prior conviction; is that it?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could I--   ",09-60XX

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could I just ask you one--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Under the Federal--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Under the Federal statute, it's only punishable on -- for recidivism purposes if the prior conviction was valid, because, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the statute permits a defendant to object.  Who has the burden of proof of proving validity is irrelevant.  It's not punishable as recidivism unless the prior conviction was valid, constitutionally valid.  So why isn't that same standard or proof thereof required either in the State conviction under your -- under any theory, or by the IJ?  The IJ fails to make that finding, how has he and on what basis has he ruled that there was a valid prior conviction?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But only under a process that requires notice--   Sonia Sotomayor  --And--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, you would suggest, then, that even if a prior State court conviction was secured without the advice of counsel, that would qualify as a Federal offense of recidivism.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Is it -- if I am understanding your argument, it is that the Court erred in assuming that if the confession had been suppressed -- which you're not arguing for or against.  I'm assuming you are not taking your amicus's position that we have to get to the question of what would have happened in a motion to suppress -- but that under all circumstances, if there's a suppressible confession, a defendant should never plead guilty.  You are saying that that conclusion is what the Ninth Circuit drew and that was wrong?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So it's another way of saying what I said, which is, no defendant should plead guilty if it's a suppressible confession?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So now, what is the other information that would have made a plain guilty in this case inevitable?  However, that's a higher standard than you need to meet, but--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Were those higher than the minimum he pled to?  Were those mandatory minimums higher?   Sonia Sotomayor  Without any confession -- forget about the brother or the girlfriend -- assume that there had been no confession, wouldn't it have been a fair conclusion to draw that without any confession whatsoever that the plea bargaining strength of the defendant in this case would have been appreciably higher and that the prosecutor would have had to offer something--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --None of the three--  MR. KROGER -- had been made.  --whatsoever.  I mean, if the brother's confession -- or the confession to the brother is a very big piece of why a plea would have been reasonable in this case.  Let's assume no confession.   ",09-658X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  I am having a little bit of trouble here with your argument for the following reasons.  Assume we suppress the confession.  Why is it unreasonable for the defense attorney to have concluded that the evidence showing your client's presence at the shooting, and identification as the shooter, that it was solely that he should have gone to trial on a defense that he wasn't involved in the shooting at all.  Once you put him in this shooting, then the only issue he seems to be confused about is that he thinks that because it was accidental that that presents a defense to felony murder.  And that's clearly an erroneous position on his part.  So what made the case so weak that the Government was never going without the confession to prove felony murder?   Sonia Sotomayor  What would have been the defense?   Sonia Sotomayor  What would have been the defense absent the confession?  You have one at trial on the confession, suppressing it, how would he have defended the this case?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What motive would his brother have had to put him at the scene of this shooting as the accidental killer?  That's all his brother would have had to say.  He was at the scene, he accidentally -- this gun went accidentally off.   Sonia Sotomayor  His brother had no pending charges against him at the time.   Sonia Sotomayor  So what does that have to do with what interest does his brother have when he has no pending charges against him at the time, he's going to use this as a future chip in case he does something wrong?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  To put his brother into jail for 25 years?  This is illogical, counsel.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Impeachable how?  What motive did he have to implicate his brother?  You still haven't answered that question.  All you keep saying is, he was a past cooperator, he had no pending charges, and now he has a motive to do this against his brother because of that?   Sonia Sotomayor  And a competent -- and a competent counsel is supposed to accept their irrational client, who doesn't want to understand the law, and let him risk getting an aggravated felony charge brought against him, or a capital murder charge brought against him, and not -- and just go ahead?  And try the case because he's not going to recommend to the client, go to trial, take the plea, because you're irrational?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's really what you are saying, that a competent attorney would not recommend to his client take the plea, and that his client wouldn't ultimately accept the plea, because the objective reality is his upside horrible and his downside is almost a given.   Sonia Sotomayor  But four witnesses put him at the scene to kidnap this guy and scare him to death.  Or scare him.   ",09-658X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  That answer is not addressing Justice Alito's point, which he said a Rule 50 motion is not jurisdictional.  You are in essence claiming it is.  You are saying they lacked the power, but Justice Alito's question to you said they don't, that they've misread the fact that this is not a jurisdictional motion.  So address that question: Why is it jurisdictional as opposed to a claim processing?   Sonia Sotomayor  In claim processing rules we have said that, unless you object, the court doesn't lack power.  Since you didn't object below to a argument that Rule 50(b) precluded consideration by the court of appeals, why wasn't that argument waived before the court?   Sonia Sotomayor  It just -- just finish: Because if Ms. Jordan had reported the incident that she was required to, they would have put Ms. Ortiz in segregation automatically; is that it?

What is the answer you want us to give on the question presented?   Sonia Sotomayor  In no circumstances?   ",09-737X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  So that we should -- I think what that means to me is that you really ignore whether it was raised at summary judgment.  If you are going to look at the evidence at trial, what do we look at, at trial, to see that the claim of qualified immunity was preserved?  Because it's a little illogical to say you're reviewing the summary judgment record when you're not.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What was that instruction?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Do you have a cite to the record?   Sonia Sotomayor  How -- could you--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Could -- could you articulate for me the line that you see between assuming all of the facts and it's not enough as a matter of law, and a sufficiency claim.  And let's break out the two claims: one against Ms. Jordan, one against Ms. Bright.  On the due process claim against Ms. Bright there are two prongs I think to your argument.  One is that as a matter of law under Sandin putting her in solitary confinement did not violate any -- any constitutional right.  And then there's ""she didn't retaliate"" part of your claim.  The two seemed mixed up to me below.  And I thought in reading your submissions to the district court you were saying that if she retaliated in putting her in segregated confinement, it doesn't matter whether there is a Sandin violation or not; she couldn't do the retaliatory act; is that correct?

Why is that such a horrible thing?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You -- I'm not sure that answers the question.  Isn't it better for the Court of Appeals to know a district court's opinion on every issue that's going to come up on appeal, and wouldn't our announcement of the rule -- that whether it's an issue of law or fact, it has to be renewed under 50(b), so everybody's on the same page as to what's going to be heard on appeal -- why is that a bad rule?  Why would that be a bad outcome as a matter of law?   ",09-737X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Excuse me--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Were they encouraged--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, I'm trying to tease out the importance of the -- whether the person's a private -- or public figure -- a private person or a public figure.  Does it make a difference if I am directing public comments to a public or private figure?   Sonia Sotomayor  No, I'm talking about in terms of infliction of emotional distress.  If I am talking to you as a Marine, if you were a Marine, and I was talking about the Iran war and saying that you are perpetuating the horrors that America's doing and said other things that were offensive, would you have a cause of action because you are being called a perpetrator of the American experience?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But you are saying yes.  So public speech, speech on a public matter, if directed to a private person, should be treated differently under the law?  I think that was part of what Justice Breyer was asking.  Is that what your position is?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  And under what theory of the First Amendment would we do that?  What case would stand for, our case, stand for the proposition that public speech or speech on a public matter should be treated differently depending on the recipient of the speech?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That was defamation.  That's false -- truth or falsity.   Sonia Sotomayor  But have they done it in the context of differentiating between public and private speech?   Sonia Sotomayor  I was not talking about State cases.  I was talking about a Supreme Court case that suggested that we would treat -- we would treat the First Amendment and the right to -- to speak on public matters differently, depending on the person to whom it was directed?   Sonia Sotomayor  So it goes -- it goes to the context.  Now, going to the context of this speech, do we look at the words on a sign alone or do we look at the entire context of what all of the other signs said at the demonstration, to determine whether or not the speech here was public or private speech?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, in that case--   ",09-751X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I am following your argument that the bulk of your speech in the epic, and even the bulk of your signs, involve public speech.  What you have not explained to me is how your speech directed at the Snyders constituted public speech, or speech about a public matter.  Because you are talking about them raising Matthew for the devil, teaching him to, I think, defy the creator, to divorce and commit adultery.  At what point and how do we take personal attacks and permit those, as opposed to -- I fully accept you're entitled in some circumstances to speak about any political issue you want.  But what's the line between doing that and then personalizing it and creating hardship to an individual?   Sonia Sotomayor  So if we disagree that that made him a public figure, if we view him as a private figure, is that enough to defeat your argument?   Sonia Sotomayor  Assume that the Matthews are private figures and you did this.  So explain to me how you are protected by the First Amendment.   Sonia Sotomayor  You want to change my assumption.   Sonia Sotomayor  We assume that he is a private figure.  You have now made a public statement and directed personal comments at an individual who is a private figure.  Is that actionable?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  So you mean that if the Government says you've got to file a complaint with us by either calling us or submitting something in writing, and at a cocktail party a worker goes up to a Government employee in that agency, and says, you know, my company is violating the law.  That that's enough?   Sonia Sotomayor  The reason I'm asking that question is related to Justice Alito's question, which is, what does filing a complaint mean?  Does it have to be relative to the procedures adopted by the person that you are reporting this to?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, at a cocktail party that employee may be there on personal time, but when he goes back to work the next morning he could do something.  Is that enough?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what you are doing is he is estopping the Government from saying, the only way that you can file a complaint with us is to do it in writing.  We are now forcing the Government to adopt an oral procedure even if it chose not to?  Even if it thought an oral procedure would create havoc, et cetera, et cetera?   Sonia Sotomayor  What does file -- what is the meaning of ""filed""?   Sonia Sotomayor  That goes to your adversary's first argument or second argument where he says when this act was passed for all of those people, they would never have thought of going to their employer because the work ethos at the time was that those employees couldn't complain to their employers.  They would always naturally go to the Government.  How do you answer that?  How do you disprove that point: That historically at the time this was passed in 1938, that there was a number of those employees who as a regular course of their business, filed complaints with their employers as opposed to the Government?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.   ",09-834X

What makes this worse than these other statutes?  What would create more cases in this area as opposed to some of the other areas?  Oral complaints are explicitly--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --This is the -- this was the Lochner era where they weren't even sure they could do this.  But why should we read their language with a narrow reading of any complaint?   Sonia Sotomayor  What grievance -- would the bringing of a grievance, the example that Justice Breyer suggested, an employee goes to his union and says, they are violating the statute.  Let's grieve it.  And according to the proceedings established by the employer, they meet with the employer, and the employee does everything in the grievance and they now fire that employee.  Under your reading, that's not instituting a proceeding?   Sonia Sotomayor  Then we have to address your second question, not the first.  You are saying the oral wouldn't work in there?   Sonia Sotomayor  Would it work if they instituted a proceeding orally and the proceeding required itself to start orally?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So we should give it no weight at all?

Sonia Sotomayor  Then we're back to if Congress meant filing any complaints, either oral or in writing.  I'm asking a different question, which is--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --That Congress's intent was not to protect a worker who publicly took an oath in front of an arbitrator and testified about a violation of law, that they would not have considered that retaliatory under the statute.

So the issue for me is: Is the Treasury Department's identification of how to draw that line unreasonable?  Do we owe them deference?  Let's use the example that's been floating around the briefs: The general counsel of the university who takes classes to increase his knowledge.  Is he a student who is working or is he a worker who is studying?

Why isn't he part of--   Sonia Sotomayor  --So why wouldn't common sense lead you to the conclusion that if someone is working 40 unsupervised hours without an attending physician at their side, taking care of patients, that that's really not a student?  That's what the Treasury Department is saying.   Sonia Sotomayor  You don't think receiving $50,000 or $60,000 a year is enough to make you an employee of someone?

Sonia Sotomayor  So what you would have the statute read is: The debtor's monthly expenses shall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amount specified, as a -- as a maximum.  You would have to add ""maximum"" somewhere there.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what you are proposing is that every debtor has to go to the Bankruptcy Court and show what their monthly food bills have been over what period of time, how much their personal supplies have been over what period of time?  How can you calculate forward what they are going to spend on a monthly basis for each of those items?  Isn't that the reason the tables are used, so that you don't have to do that?   ",09-907X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Excuse me.  Were those -- were those amendments submitted before they took effect or after they had taken affect, like here?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's where I'm a little bit confused.  The injunction here only stopped you from implementing the rate changes until you got approval from HHS in its administrative process that it was going to approve the amendment, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  That's a separate question about whether the courts are required to give deference to an HHS finding.  But the injunction here wasn't one that said you could never do this.  It just said go finish the process, right?   Sonia Sotomayor  And if it's not, could you please -- you said yes, it is.   Sonia Sotomayor  But give me the theoretical foundation?  The Supremacy Clause doesn't, I am assuming you agree with your -- with Petitioner that it doesn't provide for a cause of action?   Sonia Sotomayor  Is that your position?   Sonia Sotomayor  Then what gets all of the cases that we've had since 1824 into this Court that have granted injunctive relief on supremacy arguments?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, but we have plenty that don't -- King, Townsend, Carlson.  We have had many others that are not dissimilar to this case.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So go back and explain to me how all of those cases, what's the theoretical.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So go to your Petitioner's response to one of my colleague's -- to Justice Scalia, when she said yes, if these providers decide to charge the old rate to their patients, the State will go after them.  How is that any different than the cases where we are talking about railroads charging -- not charging customers more than a State commands because the penalty's too high, or those types of cases that fall into this preemptive category that you're talking about?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Can I ask -- why are you fighting Justice Breyer so much?   Sonia Sotomayor  It sounds like you are and that's why I am having some difficulty.  There are two points.  Following up on his and then my second question.  Engage the Solicitor General's question that this isn't a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause, but that it is a cause of action under some implied equitable--   Sonia Sotomayor  --doctrine, okay?  Which may square enough now.  Coming back to Justice Breyer's question.  I agree with all you were trying to say about what the State did or didn't do here, but if it's a primary jurisdiction question, what's wrong with just saying that the court's power is limited under equity to issuing an injunction that gives the matter over to the administrative agency that puts in the status quo -- assuming there is some sort of violation of Federal law or seeming violation of Federal law -- a preventive injunction that just stops the State from acting until the administrative process concludes?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, no; they are saying you can't have any.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But -- but Justice Breyer's question I think was slightly different, which is, what's the limit on the court's power?  And how do you--   Sonia Sotomayor  --But you engaged the question that -- the approach that the Solicitor General has been making, which is don't find a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause; find it in the court's -- an implied cause of action.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I might, if you continue in your earlier position that a Supremacy Clause cause of action would stop Congress from having a -- a voice in enforcement and cutting it off clearly.  If Congress were to write a law that says no one can enforce this, either in damages or in injunctive relief, your earlier answer seemed to suggest that Congress didn't have the power under the Supremacy Clause to do that.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If this were an equitable--   ",09-958X

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Excuse me.  There is a legal obligation to advise the FDA when you have reports of adverse results that suggest the label may be wrong.  Are you disavowing your -- your obligation to tell the FDA when something's wrong?   Sonia Sotomayor  So please describe what the difference between that obligation and the obligation to suggest a label change when you know it's been misbranded.   Sonia Sotomayor  So what's -- so what's the conflict with State law, meaning you have an obligation to keep your label as it is, but if you also have a Federal obligation to advise the FDA of adverse -- of adverse results and of needs for change, why can't you then comply with a duty to warn obligation because you can go to the -- to the FDA?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, do you think--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, do you think Congress really intended to create a market in which consumers can only sue brand-named products?  Because if that's the case, why would anybody ever take a genetic?  And why in the world would Congress create a different, or even the FDA, a different obligation on brand-named products or generic products to give them information about labels when they know there's been a misbranding?  What the government says is you start by instructing a jury that there had to actually have been information that proved a misbranding.  That's the first step of the tort suit according to the government.  So why should you or why would Congress or the FDA have intended to treat the two differently?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, all you're arguing is that this rule will have little practical effect, that there is going to be very few lawsuits that could be brought against your companies because you're just not going to have enough information to suggest a label change.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, the difference, as I see it, is that they're not suing you for a failure to tell the FDA.  They're suing you for a failure to tell them.  It's you who are interposing a defense and saying I manufacture a dangerous drug, and I have no obligation to monitor and ensure that the label is accurate.  And what the government is saying, as I understand it is, no, you do.  Yes, we understand you want to sell more cheaply, but not at the cost of public health.  So what's wrong with that argument?

You come in and you say there's a drug, it has an adverse effect, there should have been a warning about it because look at all of this literature, look at all of this proof--   Sonia Sotomayor  --that this drug is, in fact, in some way plausibly or otherwise causing this incident, and the label was inadequate to tell me not to do it.  Is that your obligation completely?  You don't have an obligation to show that this particular manufacturer knew that in some way?   Sonia Sotomayor  Am I -- am I to understand -- and I think I am understanding you.  There is a legal obligation in the statute to report adverse events.  You're saying that the statute also requires every manufacturer, of whatever type, to monitor the safety of the drug they're selling?  Is that what you're saying?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  So basically you are taking the position or you are conceding that the California courts are not consistent in their application of the timeliness rule?   Sonia Sotomayor  Your brief doesn't even try to defend that position.  Are you conceding that there is inconsistent application of the rule?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well -- I might be speaking for her, but I thought that the Habeas Corpus Resource Center brief showed that the court, the California court, did reach some cases where an explanation had not been proffered.  And so it can't be just a simple rule, that if you don't proffer an explanation you won't get heard.  So what's the next step in that?  Why do they reach some and not others?   Sonia Sotomayor  How could it be complex when there is no justification offered?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, they pointed to a certain number of cases that were 5 years or above in delay where no justification was offered, and in some they reached the merits and in others they applied a procedural bar.  So how is that consistent?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So how do we know that the California court just thinks that the Federal question is too hard and it doesn't want to reach it?  It may be meritorious.  How do we know they are not applying the decision to reach the merits on an arbitrary and capricious basis or one that seeks to avoid hard Federal questions?   Sonia Sotomayor  But claims here--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I'm a little bit confused by your response to Justice Scalia.  I thought from your brief that you were positing that there was no claim of inconsistent application of the rule that could ever survive.  Let's assume for the sake of argument the following hypothetical, and probably not far off the mark.  Litigants who don't know the law, who claim they are not educated in it, say that they have just learned about a new California case that gives them a ground to challenge their prior sentence.  And the litigants learn about the case anywhere between 3 and 6 months of the issuance of the case by the supreme court.  A dozen litigants apply for this discretionary review and half of them are granted review and half are not.  Half of them get a correction of the sentence and half of them don't.  There is no difference between them that's discernible.  They each just claim ignorance.  Is that a case where someone would be out of luck, and why, for a claim of inconsistent application?   Sonia Sotomayor  Getting time-barred.  Some are time-barred; some--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Exactly.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No.  Some -- all of them are within that small framework of 3 to 6 months from the time the supreme court decision was issued.  They all claimed they just learned of it and filed immediately, and some are getting relief and some are not.  Is that an inconsistent application that would be cognizable under your view of the rule as it should be?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It does.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  What?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's the issue.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Which is: What rule do you want us to impose and how does that rule capture that case?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You are not answering my question.   Sonia Sotomayor  But it doesn't answer why inconsistent application among similarly situated individuals should not provide an avenue of relief.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  5 years is different.  I'm talking about treatment of similarly situated individuals differently.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Oh, I don't disagree with you.  So that the question I have for your adversary is whether or not he can point to any case where a litigant who proffered an -- something that was evident on the trial record and on the appellate record was ever granted a merits review after 5 years.  Because I don't see them proffering any case that shows that.  But -- and I think that may be your argument.   INTERRUPTING ",09-996X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Well, but what did you present below, or what has Habeas Corpus Resource Center presented?  A case with a 5-year delay where the claimed errors are apparent on the trial record and the appellate record, and no justification for the delay is proffered.  Those are the three seminal facts that go to the requirements of Robbins and the other Supreme Court -- other California Supreme Court cases.  Do you have one case that's similar where the court went to the merits?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No.  Was that someone who made the claim based on the trial and appellate record with no justification?   Sonia Sotomayor  Uh-huh.   Sonia Sotomayor  So is the solution for California to say, if you delay more than a year from when you should have known you are barred, except we will excuse it for any number of reasons?   Sonia Sotomayor  That would be a regularly and consistently applied rule in your mind?  That would be enough?   Sonia Sotomayor  And pro se litigants who don't know deadlines generally are going to live with knowing that, what?   ",09-996X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  How does this work now, counsel?  How are you proposing this work?  Right now in the Federal system a pro se litigant comes in and says: I have an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.  Most district courts say, ask the attorney to submit an affidavit, and then decides whether on the face of the claims there is reason to appoint counsel and hold a hearing.  Under your theory, every State would be obligated to appoint counsel ab initio to check out whether there is the potential for an <IAC> [= IAC] claim?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what you are essentially saying, every State is obligated to appoint an attorney on the first leg?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, there is a huge reliance interest that has developed since Finley and its progeny, and States don't routinely appoint post-conviction counsel.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What are we going to do about that reliance interest and the burdens on States?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I know -- I know for a fact that most do in capital cases.  But I don't know if that's the same figure for non-capital cases.   ",10-1001
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it's only a cost if that second counsel, however its secured, can actually make a credible or sustainable claim that appellate counsel, the first tier counsel, was ineffective.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Federal courts handle them routinely.   Sonia Sotomayor  Federal courts handle them routinely on papers, and most of them are denied.  Is the State system different?  Where first level counsel, appellate counsel, post-conviction counsel raises ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  How many of those cases end up in hearing?   Sonia Sotomayor  Exactly.  Very few.   Sonia Sotomayor  Can I go back to just clarify the record for a second?  What authorized Levitt to file the post-conviction relief motion?  Wasn't he appointed simply to prosecute the direct appeal?   Sonia Sotomayor  What gave him the authority to file the 32 motion?  Obviously, he didn't seek his client's approval because the client when he received it said: I don't understand what you are saying; I only speak Spanish.  So what gave Levitt the authority to do what she did?   Sonia Sotomayor  By an attorney appointed just on the direct review?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what would have been -- what was the tactical advantage of doing what she did?  What conceivable reason was there for her to file the rule 32 motion before direct review finished?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, you know that she didn't.  So answer my question.  What reason did Levitt have, strategic or otherwise, to file the rule 32 motion?   Sonia Sotomayor  But she files essentially an Ander's brief that says: I don't see anything.  What was the strategic reason for doing that?  What conceivable strategic reason?   Sonia Sotomayor  You mean -- that makes no sense to me.  That happens quite frequently on direct appeal where a variety of issues are raised and the court -- the circuit court or the appellate courts send it back to trial counsel to develop the record further.  Your position is every time there is a sending back, that stops the need for effective counsel?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  47 States and the Federal Government does?   Sonia Sotomayor  What you haven't told me is a reason why he shouldn't have had effective counsel in the first post-conviction proceeding?  I mean, our entire line of cases under Douglas were premised on the fact that defendants would not be or couldn't be charged with the ability to prosecute their claims through direct appeal.  Discretionary appeal, we said the likelihood is they could do it on discretionary appeal because they would have a record from below, they would have competent counsel below who would make the best arguments possible, they could then pursue their discretionary appeals because they had something to work with.  But if your first chance is to present ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a post-conviction proceeding, you have no record to work with.   ",10-1001
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counselor, I -- I take your argument, but if you look at the legislative record, the reports, the findings, et cetera, and the statements repeatedly by many congresspeople, there appears to be -- have been a dual motive for this provision.  They were in fact engaged in the question of discrimination against pregnant women.  That was recognized in Hibbs, and that's clear.  But with respect to this particular provision, they were also concerned about economic effect that -- that happened to everyone, men and women, who became disabled.  And so they appear to have had dual motivation.  Part of the bill was gender-related, part of the bill seemed to be disability-related.  What do -- how do we judge that kind of bill, where Congress may have been expanding the benefits it's giving to people, not solely because of gender discrimination, but because of this desire to address disability discrimination?   Sonia Sotomayor  Can I -- I'm sorry.   ",10-1016
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  But, there certainly was -- there was certainly much conversation and testimony that, whether they in fact took the same amount of leave time or not, that women who were pregnant or were perceived as capable of getting pregnant were hired less frequently because subjectively the employers thought that they were more likely to take the time.  So, frankly, for years there was questions about whether law firms were hiring young -- not hiring young women because they feared they would leave in the middle of a big case or something else.  We all know those stories, so it is sort of common knowledge in many ways, but there was plenty of testimony related to that.  So assume that that was Congress's perception, because it was supported by the record or as much of the record as Hibbs recognized as adequate.  Where does that leave your argument?   Sonia Sotomayor  I thought Justice Alito was trying to help you.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm working from a different proposition than you are in response to this question.  I don't think that the actual amount of time that men and women take is relevant.  The question is: What is the employer's perception, and did Congress have a valid basis, as Justice Kagan pointed out earlier, to believe that employers thought women took more time.   INTERRUPTING ",10-1016
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm a little bit confused by that, because in your brief, the Solicitor General's brief in Doe, it described the earlier version of general damages in the following way -- and I'm quoting from your brief there:  ""The general damages provision in the Senate bill likely derived from the common law of tort of invasion of privacy where general damages may be awarded as. ""  --quote --  """"presumed damages"", without proof of harm. ""  So I think there in Doe you argued that general damages presumed injury.  But that's very different than, I think, the question Justice Ginsburg was asking you.  It's -- and I read your brief and your arguments as sort of an -- an assumption that if you suffer nonpecuniary harm, you haven't been injured.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  There is a big difference between presumed damages and proven injury.  In Gertz we reference the common law tort as requiring actual proof of injury for emotional distress.  Most State laws say you have to prove the emotional distress.  We are not presuming the injury.  So, I guess what I'm saying to you, aren't you the one confusing what injury is from presumed damage?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why is that different from actual injury?  I have -- I'm not sleeping, I have a nervous stomach, I'm not eating.  The typical things that juries look at to determine whether you have proven emotional distress.  Why is that not actual injury?   Sonia Sotomayor  I have looked at those cases and in all of them except for two, where the reference wasn't really precise, it was because the use of ""actual damages"" in the particular statute were limited to pecuniary harms or the nature of the harms at issue were pecuniary by nature.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  Are you arguing that the emotional distress component can't be?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you're -- as I understand the definition of ""special damages"" in common law, if you proved any pecuniary harm you were also entitled to the mental distress damages as well.  So you want half of the common law award -- award?   Sonia Sotomayor  We may have a difference of history there.  Because, yes, special damages require pecuniary harm, but once you prove that, it also permitted recovery of nonpecuniary losses as well.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I thought that's what your brief said, actually.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But we're not talking any differently.  That's what I just said.  If you--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Sort of odd for Congress to borrow from the defamation context and with a defined term of art, ""special damages"", and not use it in the Privacy Act if that's what it intended.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And to use a term ""actual damages"", which has a much broader meaning than ""special damages"".   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, you seem to be arguing throughout that general damages meant actual damages, when general damages, in my understanding, meant two things: presumed and actual.  So why is it illogical for Congress to look at what general damages meant, and pick the meaning that included proven damages, actual?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm still confused.  General damages meant presumed or actual.  Congress says we don't want general damages because it includes presumed.  So we are going to use the word ""actual"".  How do you get from that that Congress meant ""only pecuniary""?  I mean, that has its -- why didn't they just use that?  Instead of ""actual damages"", why didn't they just say ""pecuniary damages"", if that's what they intended?   ",10-1024

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, under your reading, as I understand it, the words ""portion, split or percentage"" means an amount less than the whole?   Sonia Sotomayor  So what happens if a service provider gives 100 percent to the other side, as opposed to an amount less than the whole?   Sonia Sotomayor  Does that make much sense, that if you give one meaning -- if you stay consistent with your meaning, what you are saying is a situation where the service provider gives away everything, 100 percent, they are just not liable under (b); if they give away 1 percent, they are -- if they keep 1 percent, they are liable?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Is -- is -- is there -- Judge Higginbotham, in his dissent, said there is a big difference between unearned fees and overcharge fees.  He said unearned fees, in their simplest form, is no service whatsoever.  Overcharges are some service, but an excessive value.  What is wrong with that definition?  Why is that definition unworkable in terms of limiting and defining this statute?   Sonia Sotomayor  You think not?  How about with subsidiaries?  Wasn't it common practice -- isn't it common practice that subsidiaries are often receiving parts of the payments because then they become -- they come out of the gross income of the major parent?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why isn't it a potential common practice that they are getting 100 percent of something they didn't do?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If they are rendering -- if they are already rendering services?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, if your reading of the language is not plain, if there are two ways to read this statute, give me your best reason for why the policy statement should not be given deference.  I know you said because it didn't go through notice -- through notice; but outside of that, why isn't this a HUD interpretation that the statute tells us HUD can do, an interpretation of the statute.  We can argue about whether it's an interpretation of Regulation X or not, but why wouldn't it be entitled to deference?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The Second Circuit had said something a lot different, and HUD came back and invited HUD to do something, and HUD came back and said: You read it that way; we think this is a better reading.  What more do we need from an agency?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I'm sorry.  May I just correct you on that?   Sonia Sotomayor  Didn't HUD in that preamble say explicitly,  ""The Secretary, charged by statute with interpreting RESPA, interprets 18(b) to mean that two persons are not required? ""  It says that explicitly.   Sonia Sotomayor  Not in the policy statement; in the preamble to Regulation X.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  In, in 1996.  I thought that was the final rulemaking you were talking about, because it didn't do rulemaking with respect to the policy statement.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But I'm not sure.  Congress didn't say that HUD could only give interpretations through rules.  It said it could give rules, pass rules and regulations, and give interpretations.  So what's the procedural defect in it just giving an interpretation?   Sonia Sotomayor  We go back to whether the policy -- whether the policy -- whether the statute is ambiguous or not.   Sonia Sotomayor  And what I'm trying to figure out is what's the deficiency in the policy statement that's independent of the ambiguity you rely upon.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it says it's longstanding for it--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, I'm -- I'm a little confused.  Under your interpretation or theirs, the Court gets involved in determining whether fees, services were rendered.  I mean, it's not as if your interpretation is going to keep the Court out of that business.  To be able to find a kickback, the Court has to determine whether services were rendered or not.  So what's the difference in that inquiry when it involves a kickback and when it involves a single provider?  In a kickback situation, the Court has to decide whether there was actually a service rendered that entitled the person to a percentage or not; correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  So what's the difference between deciding that question and deciding that the -- the one individual provided a service?   Sonia Sotomayor  And it listed, as Justice Ginsburg said, unearned fees.  Why would it matter to Congress?  Give me a reason that it would matter to Congress whether the unearned fee was by one person in a dual relationship or a single person alone?  The issue was unearned fees.  Rendering -- charging for a service you didn't render.  That's what the whole kickback idea was about, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, could you go back to Justice Scalia's question?  If a -- if a bank has an appraisal fee from the past and decides, I don't need a new one, but still charges you for an appraisal fee, would that violate the statute?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Or if the bank charged you for a title search that it did?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If it had one already?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, no.  So, going back to Justice Scalia's question, if the provider decides I'm going to use what I had before; I'm not going to redo the work, but still charges you a second time, they are not liable under your reading of the statute?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Waxman, the Solicitor General suggests that the failure in this case or the failure to appoint counsel arises from a due process complaint that the -- that the -- that the Petitioner here didn't know that he had indigency as a defense, or what he needed to prove or to bring to court to prove that.  Why wouldn't the Solicitor General's solution of saying as long as a State tells a defendant that they have a burden of proof and some contours of what proof they need to supply or -- on that issue, that that would satisfy due process?  What can a lawyer do when someone comes in and says, I'm not earning any money, I can't earn it, blah, blah, blah, end of story?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What do you need?  Why do you need--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --He admitted that.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  At least up until the accident.   Sonia Sotomayor  And you don't think an individual is capable of saying, I can't -- I'm -- yes, I am or no I'm not using up my money on drugs; that's my preference?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Or I have a $1,500 car, but I need it to be able to do something else?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Where is that form in the record?   Sonia Sotomayor  Where is the form in the record?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  I'm not hearing you.  Could you speak more loudly?   Leondra R. Kruger  --I'm sorry.  Certainly.  The first is -- as, Justice Sotomayor, you referenced earlier, the first is information in advance of the hearing that a critical question to be answered at the hearing is going to concern ability to pay, and a form or other type of procedure that would elicit information that's relevant to the alleged contemnor's financial condition.  The second would be a hearing at which the alleged contemnor has the opportunity to respond to any further inquiries that may be triggered by information that's already been provided.  This is, I think, a common feature of many systems outside of South Carolina which, by case law, have recognized that when a court has concerns that information on a financial affidavit might be misleading or inaccurate, they have a duty to inquire further and to require supporting documentation as necessary to confirm or dispel concerns about the accuracy of the information.  And then finally, I think we would require an express finding that the -- the alleged contemnor has the ability to satisfy the purge conditions such that the person can be said, not only theoretically, but also realistically, to have the keys to the jail cell in their pocket.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, as I -- and then I think one of the deficiencies in addressing your argument is that I don't really know what the State's procedures are.  Your -- your co-counsel, Mr. Waxman, has said there was actually a form.  I don't know what that form looks like.  The only thing that does seem missing that the State clearly provides is a requirement that the judge explain what the basis of his contempt finding is.  I'm looking at 60A and 61A, and this judge left it completely blank.  So is this a due process violation facially, or is this a due process violation as applied, meaning it's just not clear to me whether south -- the State's process, in fact, has all of the elements that you're speaking about or how I make that judgment and whether the -- we didn't grant cert on the question of whether, as applied, there was a failure or not.  I mean, one of the difficulties in this case is that there was really very -- no findings by the judge whatsoever.   Leondra R. Kruger  I think that's right, and I think it's also right that South Carolina, at least insofar as the record reveals, doesn't require a finding that the alleged contemnor has the ability to comply with a purge condition, as opposed to requiring a finding of willful violation of the court's order.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, the -- the form, the order for contempt of court itself, 61A, does require the judge to fill out an answer as to whether he thinks the defendant is gainfully employed or has the ability to make the payments.  So it was just absent here.   Leondra R. Kruger  The -- the question on the form relates to a past condition, as opposed to present ability to comply with a purge condition.  So the two inquiries are distinct.   ",10-10XX
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, do we have jurisdiction over any matter that isn't rendered in a final judgment in State court?   Sonia Sotomayor  So if we don't have jurisdiction over anything but a final judgment, how could we ever grant a stay if the State refused to?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If a State refused to grant a stay.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And why would South -- why would the State here have granted a stay, if it believes there's no Sixth Amendment right whatsoever to counsel?  How could that litigant ever evade mootness?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Can you point to any case involving support payments in which the South Carolina court has ever granted a stay?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I -- I took the solicitor general's position to be, they may accuse me of not being accurate in what I took their position to be, which is the rule would be simple.  You, a State, are free to run these procedures as you choose, but not to provide counsel, you have to meet some minimum Mathews v. Eldridge requirements, and so the rule is simple.  The State can do what it wants, but it has to provide minimum due process, and they've previously set forth the three, all right?  So really the answer is, no, you're not automatically entitled to a lawyer if you're providing minimum due process.  If you're not, then you have to provide a lawyer.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  What's wrong with that rule?  That, I think, is what the solicitor general is suggesting.  So first, what's wrong with the rule?  And, then, second, in a case in which I did not see and haven't yet a form that really talks about or tells the contemptor about his defense and what he needs to prove, yes, he did get a hearing but not a hearing that explored his statement that he'd been looking for work and couldn't find it, and a form, a judgment that doesn't address his current ability to pay.  How does the South Carolina system comply with those minimums of due process?   Sonia Sotomayor  I don't know that that answers my question, because the way I phrased the question was very specific.  South Carolina, there's no constitutional right to counsel in every proceeding, but the question presented was whether South Carolina erred that an indigent defendant has no constitutional right to appoint counsel in any civil contempt proceeding.  And if the answer to that is, if the civil contempt proceeding does not comply with minimum due process requirements, counsel is required.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Then isn't that an answer to the question presented?   Sonia Sotomayor  We can argue about that later.   Sonia Sotomayor  Okay.  The point--   ",10-10XX
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Could you address the question posed earlier of what were to happen if there was a State law that gave absolute immunity to these private correctional officers and that was the case before us.  This particular State, it's undisputed, would not permit any kind of intentional or negligence suit against these officers.   Sonia Sotomayor  Interesting, because what you are proposing is a sort of State by State, circuit by circuit, presumably existence of a Bivens claim or not.  That -- that is really the outcome of your position.   Sonia Sotomayor  Then I guess the question is, yes, when you talk about an overlap of remedies, we have said that it doesn't need to be a matching one to one remedy, but you do need some degree of meaningful overlap, don't you?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So how -- define how much or how do we describe the adequacy of that order?   INTERRUPTING ",10-1104

Sonia Sotomayor  Right.   ",10-1104
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, can I understand what legal analysis you're proposing?  Your blue brief seems to suggest, as does your argument a few minutes ago, that you want the Sixth Circuit's rule, which is the only circuit that applies this rule, that says when the facts are identical and intertwined, the defendant gets no fees.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All of the other circuits, as far as I can tell, don't go to that extreme.  They say something closer to what you started with, and your yellow brief suggests, is a but-for cause: The defendant is entitled to those costs related to the defense of the frivolous claim.  Which of the two theories are you advocating?  And then a separate question, of what standard of review should be imposed in those situations in which the activities are so intertwined, but there is still a core essence of defense of the Federal claim, which is some of the hypotheticals my colleagues--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --assume.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But there are difference -- are differences in how we read those other circuits, but I'll accept your proposition.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, did the -- the district court here said they're intertwined claims, they all relate to the frivolous claim, they're entitled to full fees.  The Fifth Circuit seemed to do the but-for test.  Are you agreeing with that?  It's -- the language it uses sounds like a but-for test:  ""A defendant is only entitled to attorney's fees for work which can be distinctly traced to frivolous claims. ""  ""We are confident that the district court can assess the amount of attorney's fees attributable exclusively to a plaintiff's frivolous claims. ""  Is that correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  You think they misapplied that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Two.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And they joined the Ninth and the -- and the other circuits that have the but-for.  So it's three places.  They said we're not joining an exclusive fees entitlement either way, we're joining what the majority of the circuits are doing.   INTERRUPTING ",10-114X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  So why can't you prove that?   Sonia Sotomayor  Why can't you prove that in a but-for situation?  Why don't you tell me what you -- your proposed standard is.  As I understand it, you would say if the Federal claim is frivolous, then you're entitled to all fees, even if the State law claims overlap and have merit or potential merit.  I think -- is that your position?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Eligibility, it has to be a frivolous claim, that's--   Sonia Sotomayor  --But I thought what Congress said and what we've said in Hensley, that the only thing that the defendant is entitled to fees for is the burden of the frivolous Federal claim.  Your -- your answer to Justice Kagan is suggesting that even if the plaintiff wins, wins everything they were seeking, you're still entitled to 80 percent of your fees, even though the Federal claim didn't add anything to your work -- to your work, except 20 percent?   Sonia Sotomayor  But tell me why we would, given the differences that we've announced in Hensley between prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants -- because you can only prevail as to a frivolous fee.  Why do we start with your entitlement to your entire fee and deduct from it, instead of starting the other way, which seems more logical, which is you're entitled to the fees related to your frivolous claim, so why don't you have to prove that first?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No.  No, no, no.  We're assuming a lawsuit that has -- as this one, that has both Federal and State claims and only one -- whether it's one frivolous Federal claim or multiple Federal claims and two are frivolous, one is not, and there is a bunch of State court claims.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why do we start with your total fee and deduct down, rather than start where all the circuits are starting, which is to say, what can be attributed to that frivolous claim, which is the only thing you're entitled to fees from?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, every other circuit except for the Sixth has dealt with the but-for test or some variant of it.  Even the Fifth did it in this case and ruled in your favor.  What you're asking for is, I think, very akin to the opposite rule of saying if we dismiss the Federal litigation, you're not entitled to any fees, because this case was about -- is in Federal Court, so that's the only thing that matters.  That seems to be your rule.  Every other circuit has some variant of but-for, and they seem to manage it just fine.  Nobody likes attorney's fees.   Sonia Sotomayor  Espouse your test for me, because I still don't understand it except for flipping through Hensley, but Hensley has a different predicate, which is that plaintiffs are -- if they win, they're entitled to fees.

It's within a range, two ranges actually.  And so it has already changed one range, and that's not the subject of the district court's finding that the lower number it's proposing is infringing.  So it's not as broad as you are stating.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it took that position, but the district court narrowed it to 15 percent, to 15--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --It can offer the test.   Sonia Sotomayor  It can offer the test.  It just can't recommend the dosage to the doctor.

The profit belonged to the shareholders or the corporation, not to the insider.  So--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --textually the nature of the claim here is the very injury, plaintiff's injury.

Sonia Sotomayor  Tell me what logic there is in reading this as a statute of repose, other than your argument about finality and its importance.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If we take your adversary's position that this statute of limitations was geared under an understanding that an insider would in fact make the requirements -- would file the statements required by 16(a), then it makes absolute sense to think of it as a statute of repose.  But if Congress understood that some wouldn't do the statutory requirement and file in a timely manner, why wouldn't equitable tolling be a more appropriate way to look at this?   Sonia Sotomayor  Is there a public document that a -- that a shareholder can look at to see whether an insider has traded within 6 months?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I didn't ask that.

Sonia Sotomayor  Could you answer what I consider a very strong argument on their side, which is Congress who creates a statute of repose for intentional conduct like fraud, why would they not create a statute of repose for what is a strict liability statute?   Sonia Sotomayor  Or the SG's.   ",10-1261
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  Can you remind me of what the outcome of that testing was?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, as I read your briefs, I think you're making, perhaps, two different arguments.  And I want to focus you in on which one you are really concentrating on.   Sonia Sotomayor  Which is, this presentation seems to be that, regardless of what standard we apply to the court of appeals review of what the district court did in denying the motion to substitute counsel, that it was wrong.  And I presume that means it was wrong for the standard you are proposing and it was wrong for the interest of justice standard, am I correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  As I read the Ninth Circuit's decision, assuming an interest of justice standard because that's the one they invoked, they said what happened here is that the district court didn't hold a hearing to determine itself exactly what the dispute was about, and so it was a process failure, basically is what they're saying.  Now, you make assumptions based on matters that have come up since that hearing about what the dispute was about and -- but I still don't know what the Federal defender's position was as to whether or not communications had broken down with the client to a point where they thought, as they did on appeal, that they couldn't continue.  So, tell me why, assuming we accept that an interest of justice standard applies, the circuit court has no power or applied it improperly by saying -- forget about the remedy -- has no power to say, district court judges, you have to at a minimum inquire and set forth your reasons based on the facts of that inquiry.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But what does that have to do with  ""I think they are doing a good? ""  ""I mean, it -- it could well be that the judge later decides, after he hears from the Federal defender, I don't think that -- we don't think there is anything to be done, he disagrees. ""  ""But he really never got an explanation from the Federal defenders. ""   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  He never got an explanation from the Federal defenders.   Sonia Sotomayor  You are familiar with 3599(e), aren't you?   Sonia Sotomayor  Which requires counsel to participate in subsequent proceedings.   Sonia Sotomayor  Of a certain type and limited.  Is it your position that if there is a complete breakdown of communications with an attorney, post habeas decision, that that is inadequate in the interest of justice or otherwise for a court to say, that could implicate proceedings after 3599, so I should substitute now?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Oh, but you are presuming you are going to win.   Sonia Sotomayor  You are presuming you are going to win.  I think 3599 applies to situations in which the habeas petitioner wins a remand or otherwise has something that's going to follow the habeas decision.   Sonia Sotomayor  So this is sort of a made-up standard.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Can you point to one case in which this standard has been used by any district court or court of appeals?   Sonia Sotomayor  Can you point to any inquiry by Congress in which such a test was discussed, considered in any way?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, so what you're suggesting is in noncapital cases, which are less serious, you are going to have a higher bar for a right that the statute gives a judge without any limitation.  The capital limitation is that the judge on its own motion or a motion by defendant can substitute.   Sonia Sotomayor  So how about a standard that the courts are used to and one that has a basis in Congress's choice, like interest of justice?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, could I give you an example?  Beginning of the litigation, all right?  Capital counsel is appointed.  Capital counsel wants to raise challenges to the conviction and sentence, and defendant says: I don't -- I want to die.  Is the district court entitled to substitute that counsel under your theory?  Because you said to me it has to be counsel that's -- that counsel that has abandoned the client.  Counsel doesn't want to abandon the client, counsel wants to prosecute the case.  There is no conflict of interest.  Counsel's not representing anybody else.  And what was your third criteria?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, this is Seth Waxman, sitting right next to you.   Sonia Sotomayor  I suspect that's the case.   Sonia Sotomayor  So beginning of the case, first decision, and defendant comes in and says: Substitute my attorney.  What would be your argument under your test?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So there are some decisions that the client controls?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that's not abandonment.  That's an error.  That's a problem.  But it's not abandonment under your definition.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, if I tell my attorney, follow these leads, that's a failure of an agent as well.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Given my example, isn't it the case that under the interest of justice standard there will be situations in which a substitution like the one I just posited would be right, that wouldn't be right under your standard?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Are you suggesting that for noncapital defendants Congress chose to give them more rather than less?   Sonia Sotomayor  But you are saying capital have lesser rights.   Sonia Sotomayor  Isn't delay one of the factors that courts routinely look at under the interest of justice standard?   Sonia Sotomayor  So we go back to Justice Breyer's point that, even under the interest of justice standard, you are claiming there was an error?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Can you tell us whether that testing has been done or not?     Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, no, you don't think it has been?   Sonia Sotomayor  In the appendix.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  Then your answer is yes, Mr. Goh's prints don't match the prints found in the file.   Sonia Sotomayor  That doesn't worry your prosecutor's office?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If the fingerprints that were found at the scene of this crime matched Goh, that wouldn't give you pause?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, what?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mister--   Sonia Sotomayor  --It has to go with the scope of the remedy that they did.   Sonia Sotomayor  Assuming, as I do and you just said, that what the Ninth Circuit said is there is -- he should have gotten a reason, an explanation, but now there is a new attorney anyway, so what do we do, isn't the normal thing to do just to remand it, to let the district court decide what steps it wants to take, including to decide whether or not it would have granted the motion for substitution if it had heard the explanation?   Sonia Sotomayor  Meaning, there was a new judge.  But, that doesn't -- a new judge is never stopped from considering what has happened in the case.   Sonia Sotomayor  And to decide whether under the facts as they existed at the time.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But it's not academic.  It wasn't academic for the judge below, the new judge--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --to say, what happened back then; I don't believe the motion was timely; I don't believe that you were foreclosed from doing other things; motion to substitute would have been denied; end of case.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, one--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, I thought that part of your argument was that, given the instructions in this case, which the jury appears to have followed to the T, they can't get to a lesser count unless they have acquitted on the preceding count.   Sonia Sotomayor  When the judge asks them, did you reach criminal negligence, they say: We were told not to.  Now, the judge, whether he was right or wrong under Hughes as to whether they followed the instructions or he misunderstood them, I don't know.  But it's very clear in context from the government's arguments to the jury, to the defense argument to the jury, you don't reach the split count or even talk about it unless you've been acquitted.  So, given that the jury responds at the end, we haven't reached a verdict; and the jury said earlier that they hadn't reached a verdict on the one issue, isn't the -- the only assumption is that they didn't go back?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, what do several States have?  If I read what those States you're saying, including the Massachusetts State that you point to, it's a very simple rule, and you seem to be arguing past it or around it or -- I think what they say is, once the jury announces an acquittal, then that's the substance, the person's been acquitted, once they have made a judgment and announced it.  It -- the Constitution doesn't -- the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't entitle someone to have it announced, doesn't entitle someone to force the jury to announce it.  But if the jury gets up at the end of the trial in a State that doesn't permit partial verdicts and said, contrary to the instructions of the judge, contrary to the law of the State, the jury says, we acquitted on counts one and two, we're hung on count three, the Constitution says jeopardy attaches because there has been an announcement of a verdict.  Isn't that your position?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, our case in Ball says it doesn't matter whether a judgment is entered or not.  As far back as 1896, Ball said the judgment is irrelevant.  It is the verdict of acquittal, and it basically equated that verdict with -- it doesn't matter if -- if it's entered properly, if the jury is polled, if anything happens.  It's as soon as the jury announces acquittal, that's the operative double jeopardy kicker.  Isn't that what you're saying?   Sonia Sotomayor  And I thought I heard you arguing that here the lack of manifest necessity was that the judge had heard they reached that verdict.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And he should not have discharged the jury without asking them could they reach a verdict that -- had they reached the verdict that they announced.   ",10-1320
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  I'm so totally confused by you ignoring Hughes.  The Arkansas charge says:  ""If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt on the charge of capital murder, you will consider the charge of murder in the first degree. ""  And I thought the Arkansas cases said no one juror is going to think they can go to the next count.  They have to understand from this charge that it has to be unanimous.  And that's what the prosecutor argued, it's what the defense argued, it's what your Supreme Court has said has to happen.  I'm a little confused given your case law, your Supreme Court case law, that says you can't move on to the next one unless it's unanimous.  How you can answer Justice Kagan's question the way you have.  There is nothing in your case law--   Sonia Sotomayor  --For instance if they had -- if the judge had called them back in and said, are you deadlocked on the third count.  And my hypothetical to your adversary, they said, well, we have acquitted on capital murder, we've acquitted on the second count, we are still, judge, deadlocked.  If this had been announced at the very end, what would be your position today?   Sonia Sotomayor  Doesn't sound like the judge was interested in any of the defense counsel's positions on mistrial.  He announced whether the jury told them they were deadlocked or not he was going to call them back.  So I don't know that the judge would have done what you suggested.  Because the judge -- the defense attorney did ask for partial verdicts after their first announcement.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So if the state rule says we don't take partial verdicts and the judge had entered a verdict -- a judgment -- declared a mistrial or entered a judgment saying hung jury as to all counts, would jeopardy have attached.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No.  If the jury had announced what it did, but following Arkansas law, as you read it, you don't take partial verdicts, it could only be one hung jury.   Sonia Sotomayor  Jeopardy has attached.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So the only issue here is whether it's reasonable to conclude that a jury that has been told acquit first comes back and says, we're only hung on this, and the jury says, listen to each other on what your hung on, that that jury reasonably -- the judge could have ignored their stated verdict and entered a trial -- a mistrial on everything else.   Sonia Sotomayor  General, how do you deal with our cases, Ball, Martin Linen, and the whole line that says the State -- the form of State law judgments doesn't control?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm not sure what that means.  And that's the problem with all of this area, which is -- States vary on how they enter judgments after the jury speaks its verdict.  So where do we draw the line as to when a State law trumps -- when a Federal law, the Double Jeopardy Clause -- trumps a State system?   ",10-1320
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, would Justice Scalia's reading in your judgment -- accept his proposition that those currently receiving voluntary payments from the employer fall under subsection (c).  Would his reading require the employer every year to recalculate the benefits to the maximum that's established that year?   Sonia Sotomayor  And that's why his reading--   Sonia Sotomayor  --The function of (b) is to set a maximum that will control all payments present and future.   Sonia Sotomayor  And so if you read it the way he does, that maximum would change each year.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, so what happens to your argument if we disagree with you that employers have a way to seek a compensation order?  As I read the regulations, the only way they can do that is if the employee files a claim, and the employee's filing of the claim then sets the process in motion.  I can't imagine that any employee, knowing that a future award could help them, would bother filing a claim to help the employer lock in his rate.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's not my question.  Most of your argument is premised on the -- I thought, that the employer could lock in his rate--   Sonia Sotomayor  --by seeking an award.   Sonia Sotomayor  If I disagree with you that the Act doesn't provide for that and neither do the regulations, that only employees can seek awards, what happens to your argument?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  As I've studied it, I think that's the case.  Assume that fact to be true, that employers have no regulatory or statutory right to seek an award.  They can either stop paying and have the employee make a claim or not.  How -- what does this do to your argument, if that's accurate?   Sonia Sotomayor  By stopping payment.   Sonia Sotomayor  So that destroys the whole voluntary payment aspect.   Sonia Sotomayor  That's an odd statute.   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Gillelan, could I just--   ",10-1399

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Can I make sure that I understand the extent of your argument?  Are you saying that it's interpretation, oral interpretation, just in the courtroom?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I have to say that if you read it the way you do, then what you are suggesting is that for appointed experts, they only get recompensed for the time they're testifying, because that's the only time they spend in court.   Sonia Sotomayor  Yes.   Sonia Sotomayor  But court experts get--  a -- get paid for their prep work.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could I -- one further question.   Sonia Sotomayor  I take all your arguments, but I read the common dictionary and there is no question that the primary meaning of ""interpreter"" is interpretation of oral languages.  But the dictionary is broad enough to include translation work as well.  Given that the courts for 70 years have been awarding, most of the them -- except for I think the Seventh here, virtually every court over a 70-year period has been awarding translation fees as -- as authorized; why shouldn't that be enough for us?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Meaning, if the dictionary term is broad enough and that's what the courts have been doing and the world hasn't crashed, despite one case where a large amount was given -- your adversary points to the fact that most of the translation fees tend to be fairly reasonable -- why should we muck with what works?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I think I am drawing -- I am drawing from ways that my colleague next to me usually asks a question.  [Laughter]   Sonia Sotomayor  Could we get back to the issue.  In the legislative history of this provision, is there any indication that Congress explicitly rejected translation work from its coverage?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Outside of the text.  Is there a statement by one of the sponsors in the congressional bill?   Sonia Sotomayor  Those are the other provisions that they passed with respect to--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --So if a lawyer sits down with an interpreter now in his office and says to the interpreter,  ""I can't pay for translation work. ""  ""Now, you sit here and interpret what this letter says for me. ""  Is that what we're asking lawyers to do now--   Sonia Sotomayor  --if we accept your reading?   Sonia Sotomayor  But you would say that might be different in a courtroom.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Because the lawyer is communicating something live.  It could be in the courtroom, but not outside.   Sonia Sotomayor  Is there something logical about this?   Sonia Sotomayor  I guess I'm -- I'm having a problem with they're ""potentially large"".  Interpretive services are potentially large, although you claim that they don't -- they have sort of a terminus point.  I've been in trials where we've had multiple languages simultaneously being translated to multiple defendants, with witnesses speaking even other languages.  I was in the Southern District of New York.  And fees there without translation, just for the oral courtroom work, sometimes went ahead for months.  So potentiality's not the question.  If you're talking about disproportionality, then that goes to the word ""reasonable"" in the statute, doesn't it?  I mean, the Ortho case you point to, the court did sizably cut the translation fees.  And more importantly, from the little I can tell, that was a huge patent case with a patent that was claimed to control 60 percent of a market.  So I don't know that that was a small case by anyone's definition.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  As far back as 19 -- It was a district court.  But it was as far back as the 1930s.  Some in the '40s, some in the '50s.   Sonia Sotomayor  No, no.  Clearly.  But these awards have been common.   INTERRUPTING ",10-1472

[Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Justice Breyer is asking, can you think of an example where words are not on their face plain, and the court has looked to the practices that have been impugned into that word incentive and we decided that they will be accepted in the way that practice has given them meaning?   ",10-1472
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  But did it make that determination as a legal matter or as an exercise of its discretion?  As I read its opinion, it felt that it had to come to that conclusion as a matter of law.  If we were to find--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --the statute ambiguous, where has it explained its policy decisions independent of its legal conclusions?   Sonia Sotomayor  Assuming we don't accept Respondent's, what appears to be their argument, that being an LPR is not a requirement of the statute, if we assume that being an LPR is what triggers the availability for the Attorney General's exercise of discretion, how does that -- how does the imputation rule harm the statute?  The child has lived with the parents for 5 years, whether before or after -- well, after it wouldn't be an issue, but before the grant of LPR status.  How does that harm the purposes of the statute?  I thought the idea of the statute was to give individuals who had ties to the United States an opportunity to stay.  If a child's been with their parents for 5, 10, 15 years, what sense does it make to deprive them of the Attorney General's exercise of discretion merely because the administrative process has taken too long to give them something which they are going to get and which they've gotten?   Sonia Sotomayor  So why is a parent's fraudulent conduct imputed to a child?  There's no intent there.  The child obviously doesn't have an intent or couldn't have an intent to commit a crime.  So why is that imputed by the BIA, other than that it's a holding against the immigrant, which your adversary points out is not a very favorable outlook for the agency, it only imputes when it harms the immigrant.  But putting that aside, there is no intent involved in the fraud.  It's just the commission of an act.   Sonia Sotomayor  What's the state of mind of committing an act, like a fraudulent act?   Sonia Sotomayor  The child doesn't commit a fraudulent act.   ",10-1542
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  One of the problems that I have is that I see the imputation as an equitable doctrine.   Sonia Sotomayor  And to me that often means discretionary.   Sonia Sotomayor  If it is that, discretionary, I -- I don't know what more the BIA has to say than 1229b(a)(2).  Isn't that an end run on stopping this continuous 7-year statute, or 10, whatever it is, if we are imputing a parent's residence, or any of the things that you are -- that the government said, the BIA said, in rendering its decision?  I mean, you can't force a court to impute -- the BIA to impute.  So what more do they have to say than: We don't think it's consistent with the statute, even if it is ambiguous to do this?   Sonia Sotomayor  What is so reasonable about a child who lives with their grandparents outside the country?  Why should their parents being in the U.S. be imputed to the benefit of that child?  I certainly understand it in your client's situation.  Your client is the one who has been here since 5 years old.   Sonia Sotomayor  So--   Sonia Sotomayor  Just for factual correction, the record doesn't tell us whether he was living with his mother, Mr. Sawyers was living with his mother.   Sonia Sotomayor  And the answer to that is?  Is this is child living with a grandparent out of the country or not?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, that's a very big assumption.  Yes, it's the two biggest circuits who have defined domicile and imputation, but it wasn't us, number 1.  And number 2, going back to Justice Alito's question, they didn't adopt the same word, ""domicile"", they changed it.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And that's what the BIA was saying.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And if you posit a no, what's the limiting principle?   ",10-179X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counselor, that sort of begs the question, because I think what I haven't unpackaged -- and I want you to unpackage it with me -- you are obviously not deprived of a State or Federal trial forum to decide your claim.  What you're -- what you're deprived of -- you can get your judgment.  No one's telling you, you can't go to those courts and get a declaration of your rights.  What you're being told is you can't get paid on it.  But that happens all of the time, either by the vagrancies of the fact that a debtor goes bankrupt and doesn't file in the Bankruptcy Court or does file and there's been a discharge.  What you haven't said to me is what entitles you, outside of equity, and what stops either a State court or a Federal -- a State legislature or a congressional legislature, from saying when someone is in bankruptcy this is the res and these are the people who are entitled to it.  It's a separate claim.  It's not the State law claim.  It may be measured by State law entitlement, but it's a separate claim.  Why isn't it just a separate claim?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that's what you have to become to make that claim, meaning you would need to adjudicate your State law entitlement.  You get a judgment saying she defamed you.  Then what do you do with that judgment?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's -- that's my problem, which is if Congress could do that, why can't it do what it did here, which is to say if you -- not to make an equitable claim against the estate.  It's not going to be in the amount of your judgment because they're in bankruptcy because they can't pay your judgment.  If you want a piece of this, you have to consent to all claims, all compulsory claims -- let's not try to get into the compulsory/permissive category -- to be adjudicated.  Otherwise, like with preferences, there is an unfairness that makes this unequitable.  You're asking the estate to give you something, but you're not willing to submit in equity to deciding whether there's something you should give the estate back.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Compulsorily.  I mean, you know, not -- I'm trying to take the permissive issue out.   Sonia Sotomayor  Every -- every bankruptcy priority rule extinguishes someone's entitlement to money.  The security rules mean the people who have secured interests get paid before unsecured people get paid, and there are insider rules.  Equity, as in terms of how the bankruptcy sets up the rest, is at the vagrancies of the legislature.   Sonia Sotomayor  They choose what they're going to permit you to take under what circumstances.  So why is it inequitable to -- to force you -- not to -- to force you, we'll use that word -- to say if you want money from the res, what you trade off is letting the debtor sue you for what you owe.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You don't have a constitutional right to collect your debt.  You have a constitutional right to have your claim adjudicated by a court.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You can go to a state -- well, once you get the stay lifted at the end of the discharge, you could sue the estate.  You may not get a judgment that you can collect after that.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Without a proof of claim?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, by your theory, you're basically saying that Congress cannot delegate any State law-based claim to which a jury is entitled to the bankruptcy counterclaim at all.  So if you have a claim by lawyers for their fees in a defense of malpractice, maybe they can adjudicate that, but they can't adjudicate the malpractice claim.  It would be a counterclaim.  Correct?

And I think that, translating what he said, the very reasonable view by the court was, the prosecutor may think of a lesser charge, because if this guy really wanted to kill this woman he would have hit her head or her chest, but he aimed low, so he was really just angry and shooting enough so that if he hit her, okay, if she died, okay.  But he really didn't have that heinous intent to execute a gunshot to the brain.  And so he was hoping to negotiate something better.  If that's -- and Justice Breyer's shaking his head.  If that in fact, if this is an AEDPA case, and we have to give deference to the State courts, doesn't that resolve this case?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  We have to give deference to their finding.   Sonia Sotomayor  You're -- you are begging the question.   Sonia Sotomayor  Okay?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  In most cases in which a trial is had, where the defendant is pleading misidentification or: I just didn't do this act.  In those cases, do most of the trial judges not permit or don't find that the defendant has met their burden of proving that he or she would have taken the plea?

But assuming that it were pertinent, because I'm not quite sure how its discussion doesn't fit the needs here, one of the factors you haven't mentioned in terms of de minimis is the portage and its use with respect to commerce; and by that I mean, it appears to me in Montello, what the Court was saying was the history of use of this river showed that these obstructions didn't stop the flow of commerce.  That what people did was -- it appeared some extreme things.  They got off -- they got their goods off one boat, walked it a certain distance or drove it by wagon another distance and then put it on another boat or the same boat that they had lessened the load on and moved it over.  And so it doesn't talk about the distance of that portage; it talks about the impact on commerce.   Sonia Sotomayor  So why isn't that a factor in the de minimis issue?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If there were a history here.   Sonia Sotomayor  There was a canal in there, wasn't there?   Sonia Sotomayor  But in The Montello, get they took the cargo off some boats--   Sonia Sotomayor  --and moved it overland to another spot before they put it back on the boat.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  We can both look at the opinion, but I think there is one spot where the court says that in some areas they had to change boats.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I don't disagree with you, but what I'm asking is, if we had a history of navigation of cargo that went to the beginning of one of these rivers, and I'm not a sailor so my terms -- the cargo is taken off and driven by wagon or some other mode to another spot and picked up again.  Is that a different situation than one where that doesn't happen?  That because this length of portage is so long that it is both economically and physically impossible to transport cargo in that way.  Is that a different case for the question of navigability?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  17 miles is very long.   Sonia Sotomayor  I think the Thompson is only 2.8 and that is really close to Montello where it talked about, about two miles for some portage areas.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But I'm not a Midwesterner, and rivers of 200 miles are longer than--   Sonia Sotomayor  So what's de minimis?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could 2.8 be de minimis in one situation and not, and how do we tell--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --If there's no falls but there are riparian waters that don't permit navigability over 2.8, than that's still navigable?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, your whole argument is on express preemption.   Sonia Sotomayor  You've given up any argument on implied.   Sonia Sotomayor  Please tell me why you think the sale of the meat is expressly preempted?  The Solicitor General says it's a closer question on sale of the meat because the slaughterhouse processes -- the law is involved only with the operations and -- of the premises and manner of slaughtering.   Sonia Sotomayor  It has nothing to do with sales.  So why is the sale of the meat preempted?

",10-224X

Sonia Sotomayor  I understood that the Federal regulation -- you can correct me if I'm misunderstanding -- is that if there is a suspect animal of any kind that it requires a slaughterhouse to wait until the Federal inspector comes and finds out whether it's just suspect or it's something that can't be sold.  And the reason why the inspection occurs as I understand it is that there are some diseases that are so contagious that if the inspector decides that that animal is carrying that disease that the whole lot will be quarantined or otherwise destroyed.  So are you fighting with -- that that's what the purpose of pre-inspection under the Federal system is for?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm having a hard time drawing that distinction.  If there is a valid purpose to the pre-mortem inspection -- and I can't see how you can argue otherwise -- that there may be some diseases that are so contagious that the entire lot, ambulatory or nonambulatory swine, are affected, then I don't see how you can argue that you aren't trenching on the scope of the statute.  If the scope of the statute is to ensure that meat is unadulterated and if there is the risk of contagion, that has to be within the scope.   Sonia Sotomayor  But you define the scope almost exclusively by purpose and regulatory power is broader than purpose.  I mean, as is reflected by the regulations here which are dealing not merely with animals that are adulterated, but are dealing with the whole process of what happens from the minute they arrive to the minute they are sold.  So if we don't accept your limitation based on a scope being defined by purpose, how do you win?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, you seem to be assuming that in effecting its obligations that only when it finds adulterated meat is that within the scope.  The government has basically said: We have got to figure out if it is and this is how we are going to do it: We are going to do it starting from the receipt of the swine through its sale, and we are going to have inspections all through the process, whether or not the meat will ultimately be sold or not; our scope is what happens in that slaughterhouse.  That--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I'm sorry; you're not seriously arguing that the Secretary couldn't regulate in the manner California has?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, you keep -- I -- I just want to understand exactly what you claim the burden is, because I thought that what the circuit and the courts below said was that there was no evidence that any candidate actually didn't speak or didn't fund raise because of this law.  There's some claims to the contrary in your briefs before us, but I've looked for that below, and there doesn't appear to be any record of that.  So, I'm going to start from that -- that assumption, that there was no evidence in the courts below that any candidate stopped speaking because of or stopped collecting money because of this.  So exactly what is the burden otherwise?  What are you claiming the burden is?  The burden is that the -- that the government is choosing to give someone else money?

Sonia Sotomayor  No, if you spend it -- if you spend it at the time you want to, you collect it at the time you want, no one's -- the law's not telling you not to do it.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I thought their expert didn't aggregate them together.  He did it regionally, not store by store, as your expert did, number one; and, number two, that he performed, as accepted by the district court, and affirmed by the circuit court, any number of controlled variable comparisons, including job history, job ratings, and other things, and found that the disparity could not be explained on any of the normal variables that one would expect and that the disparity was significantly much higher than the 10 competitors of Wal-Mart and what they were paying their labor force.  So, what is speculative about that, number one?  And, two, why is that kind of statistical analysis inadequate to show that a policy of some sort exists?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that begs the legal question, which is -- you're right.  Ultimately, you may win and prove to a factfinder that this analysis is fatally flawed, but what the district court concluded was that on the basis of your expert, whom he discounted because your expert was -- was basing analysis on -- on premises that the court found not acceptable, that there was enough here after a rigorous analysis.  What's the standard that the court should use in upsetting that factual conclusion?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, would--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Would that bar the (b)(2) class?  Meaning if their claim is, as they state it, that they're seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against a discriminatory impact or -- case or a pattern and practice case, wouldn't that have value and wouldn't that value be, standing alone without the damages component, be that the plaintiffs who come in later have a presumption that discrimination affected them and the burden shifts to Wal-Mart to prove that there was a nondiscriminatory reason?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Even if they did, why couldn't you separate out the (b)(2) issue from the (b)(3) question of whether monetary damages have enough common facts and law to warrant a certification under (b)(3)?   Sonia Sotomayor  So, would you address the -- address them separately for me, and tell me why a (b)(2) class couldn't exist only on injunctive relief?  And if it can, if you're conceding it can, then is your attack merely that the monetary component of this, the back pay -- which, you know, I know the dispute on whether that's equitable relief or compensatory relief or not -- why that just can't be separated out and put into the (b)(3) claim?   Sonia Sotomayor  That begs my question.  Are you talking about any monetary relief?  You're -- you're claiming, I'm assuming, that monetary relief includes equitable relief.   Sonia Sotomayor  The Fifth Circuit has described a test where it doesn't use the predominant question; it uses the incidental test.  What's wrong with that test?   Sonia Sotomayor  I -- that's where I'm going to.  Would you accept that incidental test as appropriate to the question of when monetary damages predominate or don't?   Sonia Sotomayor  You don't -- you don't seriously contend that if a plaintiff, if a policy were found or practice of discrimination that a woman couldn't come in and say they put X in, I had a longer history at Wal-Mart, I had far superior job ratings, I had no criticisms of my work, and I wasn't promoted.  Wouldn't that be enough for her to show that that policy influenced her lack of selection?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And your personal database has all that information.

What that doesn't answer is when in this process is the defendant going to be given an opportunity to defend against that finding?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I -- I -- having read some of those cases that you've cited that you claim weakened or eliminated the burden of proof standard, most of them didn't quite eliminate it.  Virtually all of them added an instruction to the jury of some sort that said that the application of the standard should take into account the fact that the PTO did not consider evidence -- did not consider the prior art relied upon in the invalidity challenge.  You didn't ask for such an instruction in this case; is that correct?  And if you didn't, why isn't that adequate to convey the point that you're trying to convey, that a jury should, in fact, consider that the PTO never got to see that prior art?   Sonia Sotomayor  But other judges give a slightly different standard.  They give a clear and convincing standard, and they add a separate instruction that tells the jury, in applying that standard, you should consider the fact that the PTO did not see this evidence.  You didn't ask for that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You just asked for the preponderance of the evidence charge?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I know you're saying that, but everybody's arguing about what the TRO and the TRRO say or don't say.  But I go behind that and I go -- I think the government's entire argument is not based even on those.  It's based on the LCO regulations themselves.  They've cited two, which is 51.305 and 51.321.  They're not relying on those TROs in their back and forth there, they are relying on the regulation.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So how do you address their point that there are two different charges at issue?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --that one -- that interconnection by definition includes transport.  It's hard for me to think of how it doesn't, because they've got to travel from one place to another, so--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Now you're reading limitation into the statute.  All the statute says is, you're obligated to provide interconnection services.  It doesn't say how or limit it only to things that are not bottlenecks or things that are bottlenecks.  It just says you're obligated to do X, and that's what the agency's saying.   Sonia Sotomayor  In that regard, in all of these years, are -- you mean to tell me there is no other incumbent that has provided interconnection services at an entrance facility and charged TELRIC rates?   Sonia Sotomayor  But that's -- that's (c)(3).   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  (C)(2) says you just -- you have to.  It imposes an affirmative obligation to provide interconnection and -- interconnection.   Sonia Sotomayor  But wait a minute.  Does -- don't the regulations now and the commission's TRO, et cetera, say that an entrance facility is within your network?  You haven't challenged that?   Sonia Sotomayor  It's now--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --If they're not--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Figure 4.   Sonia Sotomayor  I guess the problem I'm having is that you tell me on the one hand that up until, what, 2005, you were always paying the cost plus profit rates, the TELRIC's rates, for interconnection at a -- at an entrance facility.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it did in the footnotes.  It said -- that's what the whole dispute is about, which is, we're not changing the obligation to provide interconnection services.  So it said it clearly.  Its view--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Accepting their policy arguments, what does that do to your main argument?

Congress has made a judgment that interconnection is the mainstay of competition in this area, so if I accept that--   ",10-313X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, all of the statutes relating to these funds use the word ""trust"".  Not one statute defines trust and says in any way this is not a fiduciary relationship.  To the contrary, in fact, most of the statutes require what would be consistent with fiduciary obligations, and at least one of them that you rely on says ""but not limited to"".  So the issue before us doesn't involve a competing sovereign interest by the U.S. You've conceded that in your cert petition.  The circuit below said this is not a case where there is an independent sovereign issue governing the U.S. activities.  Just explain to me what's the rationale that would permit a trustee of a trust fund to withhold from the beneficiary the kinds of documents that relate to the management of the fund?  If the funds exist for the benefit of the Indian tribe, why aren't they entitled to management documents?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's the part that doesn't make -- that you're not explaining.   Sonia Sotomayor  But in both -- in all of those cases, counsel, it was a limitation related to competing interests, meaning it was recognizing that there are potentially moments in which an attorney is acting both in the interest of the government and in the interest of the tribe.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that was a jurisdictional question, not a question with respect to -- to the -- to the obligation.  You're not seriously suggesting that if you're a trustee of an Indian fund that you can breach your fiduciary duty by simply not exercising care in your investment strategies.  So some form of -- of duty exists.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --from the common law, and the common law has to define that.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And so why would, if it imposes those duties, protect you from disclosing items that might -- attorney confidences that go to that very act, the very act of investing in the way, even under your definition, that the trust requires you to?   Sonia Sotomayor  But this argument, frankly, would be -- we wouldn't have any need for 501, because if as an evidentiary rule the government is always different, then there is no situation in which fiduciary duties in common law would ever exist.   Sonia Sotomayor  Is there -- is there any greater value to a fiduciary duty than to manage the account for the benefit of the beneficiary?  That's the very essence of what a trust means, and so I'm having a hard time understanding not a competing interest situation where you're addressing a different statutory requirement, but merely -- and that's what this case was presented as, merely the management of the trust.  So what you're, it seems to me, you're arguing is there is no duty.  You're saying it's all defined by statute only, but you're rendering -- there's no need to use the word ""trust"" because it wouldn't be a trust.   ",10-382X

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, sometimes one's experience has to be challenged.  I for one have never heard of a case in which parties are discussing a plea, except in the most unusual of circumstances, and they advance a court date to enter the plea.  In most cases, they just wait until the court date and tell the judge: I'm ready to plead guilty.  This is such an unusual case, because the plea happens on day 1.  The courts below is assuming that between day 1 and day 5, or 3 or 4, the guy would have come in and pled guilty, would have advanced the later court date?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, that's the second plea.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm talking about the plea--   Sonia Sotomayor  --He commits the crime on the 29th or the 30th.  He commits a second offense on the 29th or 30th?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  My -- my point is, how reasonable could it be for the -- for a court to assume that the plea offer had been made and that he would have taken it before the January court date that was set?   Sonia Sotomayor  Are you taking the same position your -- I don't want to call it co-counsel -- Petitioner's counsel is taking, that you are not entitled to an attorney at plea bargaining, unless you waive your -- unless your right to a trial?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I think the issue that Justice Kennedy was alluding to was the example the Ninth Circuit used: A pitcher on the mound throws a baseball and hits the batter.  The situs is not the mound, but the injury has occurred as a result of pitching, and so he's coming up with examples and I think that's what the Ninth Circuit was saying when it was creating the test of the substantial nexus between the operation and the injury.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, there was no limit here, meaning these foreign works were never given the opportunity to be copyrighted.  Isn't that a substantial difference from the hypothetical that you're trying to proffer?  You're -- the hypothetical -- and I think that's what Justice Ginsburg was responding to -- is you had a copyright, it expired, and now Congress wants to revive it.  Isn't that different from not having had the opportunity at all, and being given a term to exploit your work and protect it?   Sonia Sotomayor  The problem--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I -- I know, but it didn't do it when it set up the copyright system.   Sonia Sotomayor  In 1790, counsel, there were three States that didn't give copyrights.  There were other States, and you make a big deal in your brief about common law protection, but common law protection, particularly in New York, which you relied on, only extended to unpublished works.  Once a work was published, it was no longer protected under the common law.  That was true of most States.  And some States gave copyright protection to residents of their own State but not to residents from other States.  So it took a whole body of public works and gave them copyright protection the day they decided to pass the copyright law.  So what are you doing telling us that there has never been a historical experience with Congress taking public works out of the public domain?   Sonia Sotomayor  Read those words to me?

If Congress did what I believe it did, would your argument fail?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --it started in the place you want Congress to have started now.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It said, moving forward, there is a Federal copyright.  It didn't have to take things out of the public domain.  We are arguing about whether they did or didn't.  But assuming they did.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You don't think that there are some foreign authors who didn't or wouldn't come into the U.S. market because they couldn't protect their works here, and kept their works in other markets that -- in which it was protected?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And it doesn't encourage them to sort of make investments?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why not?  Foreign authors who decided not to exploit their works here wouldn't be induced to think about coming into this market because now they can protect their works?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You're -- you're not answering my question.  You don't think that this law induces those foreign authors to come here and promote their work?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, it might be his incentive to buy it or not, but the question is the author's incentive to sell it here.  Those are two different incentives.  Whether -- you know, he could go anywhere and buy a cheaper book if he chose to take the trip or get on the internet and find it.  He could do that now.  Copyrighted materials here go at a different price than they do elsewhere.  That's not the issue.  The issue is the author's incentive.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, if you can't incentivize them, they are not going to claim their rights.   Sonia Sotomayor  They are not going to come and claim their rights.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, most of the circuits have recognized a ministerial exception.  But they've in one form or another created a pretext exception.  The reason for that is the situation that troubles me.  How about a teacher who reports sexual abuse to the government and is fired because of that reporting?  Now, we know from the news recently that there was a church whose religious beliefs centered around sexually exploiting women and I believe children.  Regardless of whether it's a religious belief or not, doesn't society have a right at some point to say certain conduct is unacceptable, even if religious -- smoking peyote?  And once we say that's unacceptable, can and why shouldn't we protect the people who are doing what the law requires, i.e. reporting it?  So how do we deal with that situation under your theory?  Under your theory, nothing survives if the individual is a minister, no claim, private claim.   Sonia Sotomayor  The problem with that is that it doesn't take account of the societal interest in encouraging the reporting.  And in fact, if we -- if we define the ministerial exception in the way you want, we take away the incentive for reporting; we actually do the opposite of what society needs.   Sonia Sotomayor  How?  Give me a theoretical framework for this?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  Going back to the question Justice Kagan asked you, if one of these Protestant teachers that's not Lutheran led the cafeteria prayer, as they are required to, you're now saying that the law must recognize that lay teacher as a minister and apply the ministerial exception, even though the religion doesn't consider her a minister?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, but that was the answer you gave.  If she taught a religious class--   Sonia Sotomayor  --What is your definition of minister?  Maybe we need to find out.  So it's not a title.  It's really -- the only function, you're saying anyone who teaches religion?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Laycock, I'm not sure why the status of the individual matters under your theory.  It seems to me what you're saying is, so long as a religious organization gives a religious reason of any kind, genuine or not, for firing someone that's associated with it, whether minister or not, that that invokes the exception.  Am I hearing your argument right?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So why is there a difference?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you would say with janitors, you can get into the pretext question.   Sonia Sotomayor  So you're limiting your test to whether that person is minister.

This is a functionary in the clerk's office who sends out notices, receives back mail that's not returned.  There has to be some local counsel that does work.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How is he supposed to know the difference between those that do, and those that don't?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Garre, I have two questions for you.  Is that -- is this State the only one that doesn't appoint counsel in a post-conviction capital case?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But the vast majority do?   Sonia Sotomayor  In capital cases.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  Number two, I thought there were two questions in this, in this part of your case.  The first is, don't we have to decide that abandonment, which you have termed, is cause--   Sonia Sotomayor  --in a -- to excuse a procedural bar in a State court.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So we have to decide first whether we extend Holland to this setting.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's the due process.  I'm talking about -- yes, both we would have to decide.  But assuming -- we have to decide the first question.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Will we extend Holland to this type of situation.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Yes, I understand.   Sonia Sotomayor  Yes.   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Garre, we don't know, we don't know.  Isn't that just proof that if we were to find that Holland applied, the Holland exception applied, that we would have to remand this case?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  In that regard, there is one part of Holland that you don't really address, which is that Holland contrasted a statute of limitations issue with respect to access to a Federal court with a procedural bar and said that the State's procedural bar had interest of federalism, that we had to be cautious of ignoring a State procedural bar because of federalism.  If we were to extend Holland in the way you want, how do we justify ignoring federalism in that situation?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, do you know how often Holland's brief has been granted -- since it's very recent, but how -- how -- how frequently Collins relief has been granted by the courts below?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Is that surprising?  I think Justice Kennedy asked your adversary: How often do appeals lie from the denial of State post-conviction remedies?   Sonia Sotomayor  In a capital case.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, could we go back to the Chief Justice's initial question?  Let's assume the two letters went to Sullivan & Cromwell and came back, ""left firm"", as they did, and that the letter to Butler came back ""deceased"".  Would there be cause in that situation to excuse the State's procedural ground?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, we know that both lawyers in this case didn't move to another firm.  Both of them took jobs that precluded them from representing this defendant.  So I don't know how I define abandonment other than I take a job where I can't work for you anymore.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So he had figured out that something had terminated the relationship between Mr. Maples and his lawyers?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, could you tell me -- I'm assuming you have practiced in your State for a while.   Sonia Sotomayor  How frequent is it in the Alabama capital system that local counsel takes the laboring oar, or even an active participation in the defense or actions of a capital defendant?  Your -- the amici here says generally they did what Mr. Butler did, they just facilitated the -- the admission of the volunteer attorneys.  Was that your experience?   Sonia Sotomayor  I guess the problem is, accept the rule; it exists.  But if a lawyer says,  ""I don't care, I'm not going to do whatever the rules require me to do. ""  what more do you need for abandonment?  If a lawyer comes in and says,  ""I understand this is a rule of the court. ""  ""I understand that I'm supposed to do x, y, and z. ""  ""I don't care. ""  ""I'm just not. ""  that's the question.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What's the difference between ""I don't care"" and abandonment?

Sonia Sotomayor  So go to the test of freedom to leave.   Sonia Sotomayor  You're taken from your cell and locked into a room -- and let's change the facts--   Sonia Sotomayor  --and locked in a room and said: Talk to me; you have to tell me what happened.  Is that person free to go?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So what makes this case different?  He's taken from a -- Except being told that he could leave.  If he had been taken from his cell, removed from the prison, his normal setting, taken by armed guards to another building, and with guards at the door, sat down and told: Talk to us about this incident.  Why would he think he was free to leave?  There is one fact I'm taking out of it, which is that he was told he was free to go.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  As I see the record, he claims twice he said: I don't want to talk to you.  And when he asked to leave at the end, it took 20 minutes, and they continued the questioning.  Doesn't that counter the rest of what you are saying?   Sonia Sotomayor  The Chief asked you in his question which way does it cut, meaning you seem to be advocating a rule that says merely because he's in prison is irrelevant, standing alone.  I think your adversary is saying you can't take out the fact that this person's liberty is restrained from the equation.  So going back to my hypothetical, if you are forced to leave the prison, as this gentleman was, and put in another room, what presumption should you start with?  Shouldn't the presumption be that if you are forced to go to another place that you are in custody?   Sonia Sotomayor  What -- what would make someone who is forced to go somewhere think that they are free to go back, absent being told?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  But you're not -- you're not--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I go back to Justice Breyer's question.  What you just said made logical sense; the category of gun possession doesn't go in.  Visa fraud doesn't become a crime of moral turpitude.  But we have cases that have said generically, manslaughter which involves violence is a crime of moral turpitude.  Others have qualified sexual abuse of a minor.  I don't know of anyone who would think that that category of crimes, whether you call it indecency, touching or -- we've already said touching alone may not qualify -- but my point is, you now are saying, I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, that aggravated violent felons is an entire category, and anything that falls under that label can't be a grounds of exclusion.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's how I read your categorical comparison, though.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So now why is manslaughter not a crime of moral turpitude?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I keep going back to my question.  There's only one category now, aggravated violent felony.  That's the only category you are looking at.  It doesn't matter, in your judgment.  That -- that is your test.   Sonia Sotomayor  If it qualifies as an aggravated violent felony, it cannot be a crime of moral turpitude.   Sonia Sotomayor  Let's go back to a concrete example following Justice Ginsburg's example.  Someone is charged with a crime of violence, voluntary manslaughter.  And would an officer at the airport say you're not admittable; that's a crime involving moral turpitude?  Could the officer say that?   Sonia Sotomayor  And could he then waive that ground under 212(c)?   Sonia Sotomayor  Now let's assume that he did, that he waives that crime of moral turpitude.  Would the government now put that individual in deportation and say this voluntary manslaughter doesn't meet the statutory counterpart test.  So for that very crime, we are going to deport you, even though we let you in, because it's a crime involving violence.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Would you?  Can you?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Is that where your test leads you?   Sonia Sotomayor  Could I ask just a practical question?  Does this issue go away finally when there are no more St. Cyr people?  Meaning is there -- there is no 212(c) anymore.   Sonia Sotomayor  Exactly.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And so really the issue that we have at the moment is whether your decision to effect what has happened now in the past, to do what Congress has done moving forward, and to avoid St. Cyr, is just to say, if it's an aggravated crime of violence it just doesn't qualify anymore.  That's what you are doing.  You're not giving 212(c) to anybody anymore?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But you were just saying if they are aggravated -- if they've committed an aggravated crime of violence they are not getting it anymore.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I thought in the Leon case that in fact, just like the claim in this case, that the affidavit was submitted to supervisors and the Court created the Leon test in spite of that.  So to say that we have a case on point, Leon itself is on point.  We created the test in the face supervisor's review.  You are not actually, are you, arguing a Nuremberg defense now?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That -- that simply because supervisors decide that it's okay, that that--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --exculpates someone from responsibility?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  Then let's go to the other two ways that I think you are asking us to overrule our precedent.  The first is using subjective information that a police officer knows, but hasn't disclosed in the warrant.  I'm having a little bit of difficulty understanding how an entire warrant regime that presumes that the magistrate has all pertinent information, and that's why you would be let off the hook, how you can excuse a police officer when he doesn't place that information in front of the magistrate?   Sonia Sotomayor  Tell me how, this case, the bare-bone affidavit was sufficient?  All it says is that this defendant is a member of a gang, but when the police officer is questioned, he is asked whether this crime at issue had any connection to his gang relationship and the answer was no.  So how is the request of the warrant to search for all gang-related indicia anything more than the general warrant that our Founding Fathers in part passed the Fourth Amendment against?   Sonia Sotomayor  This is almost like--   Sonia Sotomayor  --What do we do with the officer's testimony when he said,  ""Did you have any reason to believe there were any more weapons in the house? ""  He said, ""No"".  What -- when an officer says that, why would then he think that he has complete license to go and ask for a warrant that's looking for more guns, when there is only evidence of him possessing one?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you are answering -- you are answering Justice Ginsburg by saying that any time a gang member commits any crime, the police are entitled to seek a warrant that permits the search for anything they have in their home that relates to their gang membership and to -- to guns?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That did not involve -- by the officer's admission and your own, that wasn't gang-related.   Sonia Sotomayor  The assault--   Sonia Sotomayor  --But wait a minute.  That has nothing to do with the gang, unless you are saying that you had proof that the gang did something illegally in helping him procure the weapon.  What information did you have to suggest that?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel--   Sonia Sotomayor  --But tell me something.  There is ten people in this house.  There is ten people in this house and as I understand it from the questioning, they also knew other gang members were there.  So even if they found gang colors, did they tell the manufacturer or the magistrate that -- what would that prove when there is multiple members in the house.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, he admitted to that.   Sonia Sotomayor  What does that have to do with anything other than a general search -- a general search.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Because again, in the hope of finding evidence of other crimes.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's what it sounds like.

But in those States in which there is no such mandate, you seem to be arguing that Congress can't ever presume damages or injury, that even in those cases the plaintiff has to come in and prove that they would have paid less.  Is that the position you are taking?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, no.  Please tell me, in those States in which insurance is not fixed by the State, what does the plaintiff have to do other than to say,  ""they didn't disclose to me that there was a kickback and I want the amount I paid for the service?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you are in fact arguing very broadly that there is no presumption of -- of injury in these cases, that the plaintiff still has to come in and prove--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --that in fact they would have gotten a cheaper -- a cheaper policy?   Sonia Sotomayor  Same thing with nominal damages and statutory damages?  You're -- you're taking a very broad position now.

Sonia Sotomayor  Would that be enough in -- in Justice Breyer's example, of someone who says, I received a call at midnight and it bothered me?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Goldstein, I -- I understand your argument and I have a difficulty.  Today with the Internet and with computers, there's virtually no privacy individuals have.  Any transaction you do could be spread across the world instantaneously, and for the longest time catalogs would sell your name and address to other catalogers, and if you bought one product from one company, you would get a thousand catalogs from 50 million others.  Today the industry is policing that, in part to get the State not to intercede, by giving you an opt-out option.  And so, if you're a consumer who doesn't want a million catalogs, the industry is giving you the right to opt out, so they don't sell your address.  If there is, as I see, some interest that the State legitimately has in protecting that part of the public who says, I entered into this transaction, I didn't really want you to sell my name, I didn't want you to do other things with it, all I did was this transaction, why can't the State say -- there is a difference in my mind between an opt-in and opt-out?  Why can't the State say, your desire to enter a transaction in which you're doing just that transaction and not others is something we can protect?   Sonia Sotomayor  I read in one of the briefs that pharmacies were not permitting either patients and/or doctors to opt out; that if a patient came in and said I don't want my doctor's information sold, or a doctor has called the pharmacy and said, I don't want you to sell my information, the pharmacies are not respecting those limitations.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why don't I read this statute as simply doing what the consumer statutes are doing, which is giving people some control outside of the limited transaction that they're engaged in?   Sonia Sotomayor  So what you're saying I think to Justice Kennedy is answering my earlier question by saying the State cannot constitutionally stop the spread of information.  So if the State said to the pharmacy, all you can do is fill the prescription, that's what doctors think pharmacies are doing, and that's all you can do, you're saying that's unconstitutional?   Sonia Sotomayor  So you're really -- you are really hinging your argument on the discrimination aspect--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --that -- that drug companies or detailers are being treated differently than any other user of this information?

Sonia Sotomayor  Could you tell me what -- the United States as amica is supporting a vacatur and remand on the ground that there might be adequate independent evidence from the grand jury testimony in this case to sustain a cause of action.  Do you agree with their recommendation?  And if you don't agree, assume that we were to adopt the United States' position.  What would be the independent evidence that you have that would support a malicious prosecution claim?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Now, the court below took that into account and said: You are only relying on the grand jury testimony to prove the conspiracy and that's not enough.   ",10-788X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  I don't know what an independent cause of action could be, because it is the grand jury proceeding that initiates the action.  So, why would the common law permit it unless it recognized that a complaining witness has to do something to get the grand jury up and running, and go in and testify to something false to be liable for malicious prosecution.  But the point I'm making is, I don't see how your position differs from the government's at all, and I'm not sure what -- how you could have independent guilt proven that requires anything more than proof, than the proof they proffered below, which was that this police officer issued subpoenas and took other steps to start the grand jury's process.  And then you use their testimony at the grand jury to figure out whether it was fault or not.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So explain to me again -- over here, Mr. Jones.  Explain to me again why the act of sitting down with the prosecutor in his office and telling him a falsehood that leads the prosecutor to convene the grand jury and call you as a witness, why that act of meeting with the prosecutor and stating the false statement is not actionable independently?  Or is it your position that that would be?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, no, no, no.  He sat down, told the prosecutor exactly what he was later going to say in the grand jury.  I rarely called a witness to a grand jury when I was a prosecutor who I hadn't spoken to before.

This is totally contrary to what you're saying, but the language of 346(b) basically answers the question against you with respect to State and local taxes.   Sonia Sotomayor  So the debtor is going to pay, and so when this--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --says -- whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides that no separate taxable estate shall be created in a case concerning a debtor under this title--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Chapter 12 doesn't create a separate taxable estate.

Sonia Sotomayor  This -- this is hard for me to understand, given the last line.  ""The estate shall be liable for any tax imposed on such corporation or partnership, but not for any tax imposed on partners or members.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But I read -- I read Jimenez to say that the court should be reading this alternative ""or"" language in exactly the way the Fifth Circuit did.   Sonia Sotomayor  Jimenez held that it's an either/or.  If you do direct review, you do it from the time that it's final, that it concludes; or if you've foregone direct review, when the time for seeking review expires.   ",10-895X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, are you accepting Justice Scalia's point that the certificate of appealability doesn't have to jurisdictionally describe the substantial constitutional issue?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you agreed with the question he posed to your adversary, that you are saying that this was deficient because both, it didn't indicate the issue, and because it didn't describe the substantial constitutional question?   Sonia Sotomayor  Put that to one side.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I'm a little confused, okay?  And I think it's what Justice Ginsburg was trying to get at, and Justice Breyer, which is: What you are requiring in you're saying the statute requires, if for the district court to always reach the merits of any argument presented in a habeas petition, to figure out whether it's a substantial argument before it dismisses on a procedural ground.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And that seems to be what you're, you're wanting to happen because a judge would have to say: I'm dismissing on a procedural ground and I believe that the claim is more than non-frivolous, that it has a substantial basis.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Doesn't that speed the habeas process in the normal cases?  I mean, in my experience, what district court judges do is find the easiest way to dismiss something.  If the speedy trial ground is the easiest, they go that way.  I'm sorry.  If it's not and it's a procedural bar, they use a procedural bar.  They don't create extra work for themselves.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what do we do then--   Sonia Sotomayor  --What happens if it happens?   Sonia Sotomayor  Does that -- does that make any sense?  Isn't it easier to read it -- the statute the way your adversary suggests, which would protect both the right to direct review and the right to collateral review?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Do you have any idea of how much the jurisdictional question plagues the courts below?  Meaning, is it -- is it so complicated that people below don't really know what district courts are granting COAs on?  Do -- circuit courts don't understand what the issues are somehow by the opinion below?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Circuit judge -- or circuit judge or judge.   Sonia Sotomayor  Yes.   ",10-895X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  So tell me how you define indefinite stays, meaning are you okay with the six months to a year stay for a court to try to get someone back to competence, assuming that there is a claim in which the defendant's information is necessary?   Sonia Sotomayor  So how do you deal with Justice Kagan's earlier question of what difference does it make if the person's still necessary -- or the information, potential information is still necessary, what makes it unnecessary after a year?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But those cases didn't establish a limit on how long states needed to take to adjudicate claims.  They just said a district court should put in conditions that move things along--   Sonia Sotomayor  --that require defendants to press their claims within a reasonable time that required periodic updates, that required monitoring by the court, but it didn't set an artificial end time.  It just said you can't just do an open-ended stay and not give conditions to comply with.  Why should this be treated differently?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But you cap it by saying as long as the discretion is not exercised for more than a year.   Sonia Sotomayor  Would that standard have been met in both of these cases?  Meaning, Carter's claim -- and the one that concerns me the most is why he was excluded from trial, and what if he did or did not do with his attorneys afterwards.  And Gonzales is a slightly different case.  But would your position be that in both cases there was enough?   Sonia Sotomayor  No, no, no.  My question was, on the facts of both of these cases, was there a basis for granting the stay with respect to--   Sonia Sotomayor  --their conditions?   Sonia Sotomayor  Neither Carter or Gonzales?   Sonia Sotomayor  Am I -- am I understanding that your position in response to the question from Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy is that for you, indefinite is any stay whatsoever?  It sounds like what you are proposing, or in response to them, is that no stay for purposes of determining competence, whether it's short or long, is permissible.  Is that your argument?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I could take objection to that characterization, because the clerk of the Court told the Court that neither party was happy with what was happening, and the Court still entered the order.  But let me go back to my question a moment.  Amici say that most competency issues are resolved within months and that many individuals, the vast majority, are restored to competency with proper medication within months.  Are you opposing those kinds of stays?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But under your definition, it's never appropriate, really.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You argue -- you argue two things.  You say, under Pinholster, courts always have to rely on the record.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Even though a doctor says, it can be done, we have to try?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, they can never say, it can be done.  They can say--   Sonia Sotomayor  --we have to try.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's also -- I'm not sure how they can do that until they try.   INTERRUPTING ",10-930X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that is that you're -- that seems like almost a due process argument, that in every single case you have to grant a stay.  You're -- you're parting from the Respondent in Carter, and you are making a broader argument.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No incompetent client, presumably, can help you make those decisions.  So tell me, are you saying that in every single case, the client is entitled to a stay?   Sonia Sotomayor  So why does that situation give you an entitlement if it's not in every single case?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What in the record could plausibly, certainly be seen that would suggest that your defendant has information that could be valuable?  Assume it's not the ABA standard, but the plausibility standard or the certainty standard or something.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that you can see from the record.   Sonia Sotomayor  What would plausibly give rise to a belief that there was some ex parte exchange between the judge and the defendant?  Is there anything to suggest that in the record?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Do you have anything to suggest that there had been an ex parte exchange that would account for that snarling?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, in this case, the district court denied a stay.  If this is an equitable power, how can you be comfortable that the Ninth Circuit as an appellate court overrode the district court's equitable discretion?   Sonia Sotomayor  But you're not claiming that that issue is always in the district court's hands to start with.   Sonia Sotomayor  So please identify for me what -- how we establish or set a standard so that appellate courts are not overriding that at whim?   Sonia Sotomayor  Oh, you're flipping it.  You're saying first you give a stay for competence.  You've determined competency first and not essentiality first?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The million dollar question: Assume we say you have to spend a reasonable time trying to get someone to competency.  And, here, there appears to have been efforts to do so.  And your client is saying, I can't be treated because the drugs make me sick.  So when does all of this end?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that time has passed by now, hasn't it?  That that -- they stopped treating him?   Sonia Sotomayor  No one's continuing to monitor him or trying to treat him?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm a little confused as to--  I think the Ninth Circuit remanded so that treatment could be had.  So why has it stopped?   Sonia Sotomayor  Petitioner says they won't because they can come back with new evidence after habeas is closed.  Why is that inadequate?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm presume -- I presume that the one claim among your many -- yours is the defendant who was excluded from trial, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  So that if he comes back and says, I told my attorneys I would behave, and I wanted to come back earlier, but they never let me back in, this would not be a new claim, this would be part of the old claim that has been adjudicated, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  But without his information.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that you could see from the record.  The question in my mind would be whether he told counsel he would behave and counsel ignored that information, correct?   ",10-930X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Sorry.  Are you suggesting -- three different levels.  Stripping naked: It's okay to stand 5 feet away, but not 2?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So are you -- are you taking the position that it's the purpose of the search--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --that -- that's at issue?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm still unsure.   Sonia Sotomayor  If it's okay to shower--   Sonia Sotomayor  --and have an officer watch you shower naked--   Sonia Sotomayor  --what is the greater intrusion is that you are standing 2 as opposed to 5 feet away?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That is a line that doesn't make much sense to me.   Sonia Sotomayor  Then let's go to the next line, which is -- that's one kind of search.   Sonia Sotomayor  The second is I think what some have called a visual cavity search.   Sonia Sotomayor  Whether you are going to have the individual open or expose private parts.   Sonia Sotomayor  Can you make an argument that that is different than just a visual search?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Could you clarify two points for me?  The first is, was he admitted into the general population at Burlington?   Sonia Sotomayor  The prior charge against your client was the use -- involved the use of a deadly weapon.  Assuming the prison knew this, wouldn't that provide the reasonable suspicion that you argue was missing?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So now you are -- you are feeding into your adversary's argument that what you are asking the police to do on intake, or the corrections facility on intake, is to investigate in that fine detail?  They can't even look at the rap sheet--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --and see use of a deadly weapon and say, ah, this guy could be dangerous?   INTERRUPTING ",10-945X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  So why do we change the policy?  In Bell we found that the policy was successful.  Even though there were searches, contraband still got in.  So virtually every circuit in practice in the Federal system have been following this reasonable suspicion for minor crimes and they have been fairly successful.  So why do we change the constitutional rule to let them do more?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  To invade more.   Sonia Sotomayor  I understand contraband is serious.  But most of the studies point to it not being on intake, but coming in through guards, coming in through contact visits.  The great cause today is that from corrupt correction officials.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, could I ask you something just in terms of your rule.  I think your brief says your rule is you are not entitled constitutionally to any right of privacy in prison.   Sonia Sotomayor  If that's the case, are you saying that if the prisons decide on a manual search, every prisoner who comes in, correction officers can manually check their cavities?   Sonia Sotomayor  So there is some privacy rule there?   Sonia Sotomayor  Can we go back to Justice Alito's question?  Isn't one of the factors that we look at under the Fourth Amendment reasonableness?  And should we be thinking about the fact that many of these people who are now being arrested are being put into general populations or into jails, sometimes not just overnight but for longer periods of time, like this gentleman, for 6 days before he sees a magistrate?  Should we be considering a rule that basically says your right to search someone depends on whether that individual has in fact been arrested for a crime that's going to lead to jail time or not, whether that person's been presented to a magistrate to see whether there is in fact probable cause for the arrest and detention of this individual?  I mean, there is something unsettling about permitting the police to arrest people for things, like kids who are staying out after curfew with no other, based on probably nothing else.   Sonia Sotomayor  But what are we doing with the presumption of innocence?  That's also a constitutional right.  And so shouldn't the degree to which a search is permitted be conditioned in some way on whether or not this person has been presented to a magistrate?   Sonia Sotomayor  Sure.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Phillips--   Sonia Sotomayor  The issue has to be certainly some misdemeanor.  Some people charged with misdemeanor crimes will try to smuggle things in.  The issue is how many of them would not have been found on a reasonable suspicion standard.  I think Justice Breyer said in the San Francisco study it appears only one.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But we don't have 20/20.  We have how many years, 15 years since Bell where prisons have been applying the reasonable suspicion standard.  And the most you could muster under that standard is one example of a case where someone has entered?  At some point empirical evidence has to mean something in terms of us judging the question of reasonableness.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I don't have a question about that today.  I know it's bad to base your judgments on your own personal experiences.  When I was a prosecutor, it took sometimes days to get a rap sheet.  I understand that that's no longer the case today?  That there virtually almost always accessible by computers today?   INTERRUPTING ",10-945X

As I read your brief, standing would only arise at the moment the Government decided to use the information against someone in a pending case.  To me, that--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --would seem to say that the act -- if there were a violation; I'm not suggesting there is -- but that if there was a constitutional violation in the interception, that no one could ever stop it until they were charged with a crime, essentially.   Sonia Sotomayor  General, I don't know that you've answered my question.  Perhaps you have, but I just want to make sure that I'm clear.  Given that lawyers are unlikely to be the targets of an investigation, if their conversations would be intercepted, according to you they'd never have standing.   Sonia Sotomayor  Now we're back at the same circle we started with, which is the one that Justice Breyer started with.  He pointed to one person under -- who has been surveilled continuously, tens of thousands of interceptions.  Can you really say that the government's not going to target him under this greater authority that it sought just for the purpose of ensuring that it casts a broader net?   ",11-1025

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, so what am I to make of your transmittal letter which says, in the offer itself, that -- JA 5556, that Petitioners make clear that the offer of judgment, quote,  ""was not to be construed as an admission that Petitioners are liable in this action or that respondent has suffered any damage? ""  What -- what are we to make of that--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --when you're now claiming that you would have accepted a judgment of liability?

Did you include that amount as well?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I have--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, can I ask a fundamental question under Rule 68?  When I was a district court judge, if parties told me about their settlement discussions I would get quite upset.  But, it says explicitly -- explicitly:  ""Evidence of an unaccepted offer is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs. ""  What authorizes you to use evidence of that offer to argue anything--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --especially when the statute gives the plaintiff an absolute statutory right to refuse it at a specific penalty?  What permits you to use it as evidence of anything, mootness, I don't care what you're using it for, except in cost?   INTERRUPTING ",11-1059
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  I have a question for you, counsel.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, there is -- from the beginning, you never accepted the offer.   Sonia Sotomayor  What you appear to have conceded and -- is that the amount of the offer would settle your personal claim.   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Katyal, I'm a little troubled that you have given up or argue that the ability to enter a forced judgment is permissible under Rule 68.  There is nothing in that rule that gives the court that power, certainly not stated explicitly or even implicitly, because it talks about an entire procedure of accepting the offer or rejecting it, all of it in the hands of the parties, none of it until the entry of the judgment in the hands of the court and only after the plaintiff has accepted the offer in writing.  So I can't see anything but an inherent power.  So, for me, if there is an inherent power, it has to be under a default judgment because the other side is saying, “ I give up ”.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.   Sonia Sotomayor  Let's go from there, at least with me, and that may answer an earlier question about an inquest on damages, because that is a part of the requirements for a default judgment, so that if there is a dispute about damages that can be resolved.  But my point is that liability is admitted.  Now let's deal with the Chief's question and Justice Scalia's question, which is in what ways is this comparable to a shared cost like what motivated our decision in class actions, that the settlement of one existing plaintiff doesn't settle the collective action.  How is this similar to that?   Sonia Sotomayor  --to get the point -- the Court had to evaluate whether the offer actually met your personal damages claim, too.   Sonia Sotomayor  And what you're saying--   Sonia Sotomayor  --in those pages is the Court didn't even do that.   Sonia Sotomayor  But what you're talking about is imputing into this process a fairness hearing, essentially, to see, by the district court, to determine whether this is a quirky case where you entered a judgment and you don't need collective action or whether or not this is a genuine case that requires joining plaintiffs.

Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry--   Sonia Sotomayor  --How could that be--   ",11-1085
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Why don't you answer the question that was asked earlier, if Basic set forth a presumption, and are you disputing that at the class certification stage a defendant can prove that the market is inefficient?   Sonia Sotomayor  So why shouldn't we hold Basic to its position that all of its presumptions can be rebutted as well, not just efficiency?  Why do we set out efficiency as the one issue that can be rebutted?   Sonia Sotomayor  Could we--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Could we get a hypothetical that I actually think could occur, which is not a truth-on-the-market defense, but a known truth to the individual person seeking certification.  So that is, it's immaterial to that person because they were told this information by someone and still trading.  Would that defense be available at certification?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  So does that mean that if the claim in the malpractice action is that the PTO acted unconstitutionally -- assume that set of facts -- how does that change your analysis?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So go back to -- you were going through a list of questions, and I posited, let's assume that the malpractice claim does involve a constitutional question.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Then what other factors--   Sonia Sotomayor  --How about fraud on -- a claim of fraud on -- that the malpractice was fraud on the PTO?  Lawyer loses that.  It's been litigated.  Isn't it res judicata, and won't it affect the patent or might it not affect the patent in a patent action?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I find that somewhat hard to follow.  Let's assume in adjudicating a medical -- a malpractice claim, the State court finds that the attorney suppressed information.  It's a finding of fact.  He has this information in his or her file, and they didn't disclose it.  I'm not quite sure how the PTO ignores that litigation.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Or the district court does, if it gets to review that in a later action.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm only raising this question to address Justice Scalia's point.  You're asking for an absolute rule, and I posited a situation where I think it's not so clear that a State court finding might not have an effect.  So, do we have to go to your absolute rule?   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you answer the one point your adversary raised that gives me pause, a lot of pause.  He says a ruling on patent law of how you should or should not behave in a State malpractice claim will affect all of the lawyers who practice in your State, because each of them will have to do or not do whatever that malpractice ruling was because that's what the State is going to -- State courts will follow in the future.  So it will change those lawyers' behaviors in Federal court.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  They are going to present an expert all of the time when they don't need to.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But you can think of an example where -- not perhaps on the facts of this case, but where a State court's ruling could in fact establish a code of behavior that's not just belts and suspenders, that's something else.

And she says -- you dispute this in your brief -- that it doesn't affect the invalidated patent, that there's no way that a judgment on the malpractice is going to be used in a continuation patent dispute because it's not one of the listed preclusive courts.

Sonia Sotomayor  The problem--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I -- I know, but it didn't do it when it set up the copyright system.   Sonia Sotomayor  In 1790, counsel, there were three States that didn't give copyrights.  There were other States, and you make a big deal in your brief about common law protection, but common law protection, particularly in New York, which you relied on, only extended to unpublished works.  Once a work was published, it was no longer protected under the common law.  That was true of most States.  And some States gave copyright protection to residents of their own State but not to residents from other States.  So it took a whole body of public works and gave them copyright protection the day they decided to pass the copyright law.  So what are you doing telling us that there has never been a historical experience with Congress taking public works out of the public domain?   Sonia Sotomayor  Read those words to me?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You have to have a--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Your reading of that passage is different than mine.  I think it's a -- it's saying whether you have or you haven't.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If we disagree with your proposition, does your argument fail?  If the historical work does not point to what you claim?   Sonia Sotomayor  In 1790.  If Congress did what I believe it did, would your argument fail?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --it started in the place you want Congress to have started now.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It said, moving forward, there is a Federal copyright.  It didn't have to take things out of the public domain.  We are arguing about whether they did or didn't.  But assuming they did.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You don't think that there are some foreign authors who didn't or wouldn't come into the U.S. market because they couldn't protect their works here, and kept their works in other markets that -- in which it was protected?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And it doesn't encourage them to sort of make investments?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why not?  Foreign authors who decided not to exploit their works here wouldn't be induced to think about coming into this market because now they can protect their works?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You're -- you're not answering my question.  You don't think that this law induces those foreign authors to come here and promote their work?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, it might be his incentive to buy it or not, but the question is the author's incentive to sell it here.  Those are two different incentives.  Whether -- you know, he could go anywhere and buy a cheaper book if he chose to take the trip or get on the internet and find it.  He could do that now.  Copyrighted materials here go at a different price than they do elsewhere.  That's not the issue.  The issue is the author's incentive.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, if you can't incentivize them, they are not going to claim their rights.   Sonia Sotomayor  They are not going to come and claim their rights.  Part of this law is that they have to declare that they are interested in protecting their copyright here.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Optional for them; but if they do, that's when they can sue a prior user.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1179

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Liman, I understand your argument, but I have a fundamental difficulty, okay?  Bailey and Exploration Company, with statutes not too dissimilar from this one, who read the discovery rule into a fraud claim, both were a civil litigant and for the government.  The only way that I can tease out a potential difference between Exploration and this case is somehow that the penalty in this case is not for injury but for punishment, as you called it.  Government as enforcer, rather than government as victim.  Some of us would say that the common wheel is injured whenever someone breaks a law, so that that distinction between enforcer and victim makes no sense.  How do you answer that point?   Sonia Sotomayor  It's acting as a sovereign to protect what it thinks is an ordered society.  And if you break that order, you are injuring the society.  That's the best--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Mr. Liman, finishing up a point you were just on previously, what's your position with respect to fraudulent concealment?  Doesn't your theory preclude even the application of that to tolling of the statute?   Sonia Sotomayor  But tell me about--   Sonia Sotomayor  --This is -- it's nice for you to say that.  But tell me, having announced your theory, how the next step is avoidable?  Under what theory would we say you can't have a discovery rule, but you can have a fraudulent concealment rule?   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Liman, I'm a little confused in your answer to Justice Scalia.  You said that the underlying case has a 5-year statute of repose for a civil claim.  It barely applies, however, those claimants who have -- under your theory, who have been directly injured.  The presumption would apply of discovery, if they were claiming a fraud.   Sonia Sotomayor  So are you just arguing that under this statutory scheme there is no application of the discovery?   Sonia Sotomayor  Because of the alternative language of 5 years.   Sonia Sotomayor  Right.   Sonia Sotomayor  That's what I thought those involved.   ",11-1274
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  This a very modern problem, but how about the statute of Elizabeth, which talked about penalties as being a criminal sanction but permitted private individuals, not the government, to seek the penalties and keep it.  So you cite the statute of James and I look at the statute of Elizabeth and try to find the analogy between which one.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Even though private parties could keep the money back then.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could I move you to another issue?  If a party can defeat the government's claim of discovery by showing that the government wasn't reasonably diligent, how does a party ever accomplish that?  Aren't you going to raise the law enforcement privilege, the -- some other privilege to block discovery?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, if they fail there, don't you think that they are going to also fail because they are not going to be able to look at your records to figure out exactly what you knew or didn't know?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Katyal, if you go to equity, why aren't you bound by equity?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, but that's exactly what your bottom line is, which is, you have someone else do the work for you, and you don't pay them.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why does your lien have priority to the attorney's lien that is normally created at the commencement of the litigation?  Why is the attorney bound by the agreement you signed with the beneficiary?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, are you conceding--   Sonia Sotomayor  --the plan doesn't say it?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, the phrase that you just read says that the benefits are the same.  It doesn't say that the reimbursement and subrogation language are the same.  So go back to Justice Ginsburg's question, and point out in the plan what words you're relying upon.  Not the summary, but the plan.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I thought it took most of the litigation for the plan to be provided.   Sonia Sotomayor  In this case, he wrote -- the attorney wrote to you any number of times, and finally said, look, unless you come and tell me what your position is, I'm going to go forward.  So what are attorneys supposed to do in those situations, just drop the lawsuit?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Rejected it because it had nothing to do with the agreement, but it didn't reject them as a factual matter, that you were contacted.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, were they supposed to -- if the insurance limit was $100,000, are you suggesting that that was a bad faith settlement?   Sonia Sotomayor  We--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Or not to enforce it.  Meaning the equity is to enforce it or to stay your hand.  And so the Court could decide not to reach into the pocket of the plan participant to pay back money that the lawyer has.   Sonia Sotomayor  Put on the back of someone else, meaning--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I may or may not agree that in terms of your split with the participant, the contract might control.  But I still am having trouble with understanding how you can bind a third party like a lawyer, who's done the effort to recover that fund -- more along Justice Breyer's question, which is, not only in -- in all equity, lawyers are entitled, whether by contract or by unjust enrichment principles, to a -- to a percentage of their expenses in recovering something.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I'm assuming, because ERISA's in place now, that the many State laws that prohibit this kind of agreement where insurance plans are seeking full reimbursement despite an attorney's efforts, that those are void, that those would be enforceable.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --the only one who can fix this problem now is Congress, if they--   Sonia Sotomayor  --perceive it as a problem.   ",11-1285
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  So what -- what's the difference between the two?  Meaning, I take your argument to be that the Court was right before that freestanding subrogation claims have one set of remedies or rights, and subrogation, by agreement, have another.  So what do you see as the differences between the two?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So was the Court in an exercise of futility in writing what it did in Sereboff?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I understand the argument.  It's a bit unsettling that you've got two kinds of rights, one implied and one express, and there's no difference between the two?  You -- you've got to give them a little bit more body to have a persuasive argument.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Isn't there another line after that, that says something--   ",11-1285
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Do we give credence to how the judge labels what the acquittal is?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But you don't--   Sonia Sotomayor  --How would they do that?  I'd like to go back to Justice Kennedy's question.  It's easy when you have a jury, because what happens is a judge can decide whether at the end of the prosecution's case he's going to dismiss for insufficiency, or he can give it to the jury, and if the jury renders a verdict, set it aside.  Jeopardy attaches only if the judge dismisses the case after the prosecution's judgment, but not if he sets aside the verdict, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  In the latter.  So what can a State do -- some have done something -- to ensure that even if jeopardy has attached, that there can be a valid reversal; the judge is wrong on a legal theory.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So give us an example of what, in a judge trial, a State could do to ensure that a legally wrong judgment is still reversible.   Sonia Sotomayor  In a bench trial.  What could it do?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I thought there were in your briefs some examples -- in someone's brief, there were some examples--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --No, forget about a jury trial.  Let's go to the bench trial.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You're not helping your argument by saying there's nothing a State could ever do.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Do you know something, Counselor?  You're sinking your hole deeper.  You're not helping yourself in this argument, because how does that help the system?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I don't disagree.  You mean no State could ever say to a judge, given -- given -- render a verdict on the prosecution's theory, and then set it aside?  If you think the theory is not legally--   Sonia Sotomayor  --You keep saying “ mid-trial ”.   Sonia Sotomayor  What -- what is not mid-trial?  Some States require a judge to wait.   Sonia Sotomayor  What happens in those States?   Sonia Sotomayor  I keep talking not about jury verdicts, but about bench trials.  I want to focus on the bench trial process.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.  It was charged with the crime of burning down a dwelling, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  Of?   Sonia Sotomayor  And no specific statute was cited?   Sonia Sotomayor  Which one?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The dwelling statute, not the exception to the dwelling.   Sonia Sotomayor  That's what he was charged with?   Sonia Sotomayor  So why did the court dismiss if he was charged with burning down a house?  I thought he was charged with burning down a dwelling, and the argument was he should have been--   Sonia Sotomayor  --charged with burning down a house.   Sonia Sotomayor  My only quibble is, you have no doubt -- the defense attorney had no doubt that he burnt down a house.  That someone burnt down a house, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  Got it.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's a sentencing enhancement, is really what the argument is, the decision was.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That every -- you can be charged with burning down a dwelling and you can only get the enhancement if they prove it's a house.   Sonia Sotomayor  Exactly.   ",11-1327
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  But many states have a different rule.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And many states permit the judge to reserve it till after the jury verdict.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, you gave us earlier the statistics of how many judges grant Rule 29 motions in trial.  I think you said 76 percent.  What's the gross number relative to the number of actual verdict decisions by juries or the judge himself?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Out of what number?   INTERRUPTING ",11-1327
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  What you're saying is the return of the child essentially back to Alabama.   Sonia Sotomayor  And so once the child is back in Alabama, that's the remedy, then the State court would be seized of jurisdiction sufficient then to determine the habitual residence.   Sonia Sotomayor  Whatever the State -- well, presumably the child only comes back if you win.   Sonia Sotomayor  So presuming you win, the child would come back, and the Alabama courts could then seize the custody determination.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Was their reasoning that the child was initially removed properly because there had been an order permitting the mother to go?   Sonia Sotomayor  So it was a lawful removal at that moment.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And what they're saying is, since the case is moot, nothing has vacated the order, but it didn't make her action illegal?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's a stand-still order there.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, there is a judgment against your client, isn't there, for $94,000 or so?   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you break down that figure?   Sonia Sotomayor  So--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, that cost that you have to pay for the mother, even though the case was mooted, that judgment is still outstanding for the moneys you have to pay?   Sonia Sotomayor  If you win on this appeal, is that wiped out?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, what's -- what happens--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Can you tell me what's happening, what is the status?  Given the vacated return custody order -- return order, will the Scottish court ever determine habitual residence?   Sonia Sotomayor  But that order has been vacated, so can they revisit that question is really the -- the issue.   Sonia Sotomayor  And at the Hague, it's what was it then.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could I ask a question?  Does it matter?  Meaning, whether a stay is granted or not, you are, I don't think, taking the position that only if the stay is granted is the court of appeals seized of jurisdiction.  You're saying the case is not moot, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  Now, under the Convention, if the child -- if it goes back to the district court now to fashion a remedy, it could order return, it could decide under the Convention that bringing the child back after 14 months presents a great risk to the child under the Convention and not order the return, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  So we just don't know what the court's going to do, but some form of relief is possible.  That's why you used the word “ possible ”.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But they have the power, if they choose it, but they don't have to choose it; that's the bottom line, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Are you aware of -- I happen to be because I know this area very well -- the English courts have an amici filed with us yesterday, and they are sort of sensibly keeping track of what we're doing and trying to adjust their proceedings accordingly and in the manner they think is most helpful to us.  Whether it is or not, I can't comment on.  Is this common in the custody area?  Is there discussions between courts about what they're doing and the why of it?

Sonia Sotomayor  Where the child was, in fact, returned when--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, there is an amici brief here that says that the Scottish courts will not pay attention to the habitual residence of a child at the time of the removal.  The amici brief that was filed with us yesterday, if I'm reading it correctly, suggests that the court believes that hasn't been settled in English law; is that correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  That that -- so that proposition is not as settled as the amici suggests?   INTERRUPTING ",11-1347
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Why can't they order the mother to come back with the child?  Because the Scottish court stops her?  There is competing orders all the time.   Sonia Sotomayor  Why not?  She was here.  She submitted to the Court's jurisdiction.  Doesn't her -- jurisdiction over her now continue until the end of the case?   Sonia Sotomayor  That doesn't matter.  The question is, isn't she seized -- doesn't the Court have jurisdiction over her until the case ends?  The case doesn't end until there has been an appeal and a judgment and the judgment affirmed or reversed.  That hasn't happened.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You are suggesting that the Convention deprives a party, after the remedy's been ordered and effected, of the right to appeal; not because of mootness, but because the Convention takes away a fundamental right to appeal?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You're not going to suggest all those countries that permit appeals explicitly and stop removals until appeals are finished, that those -- that those those treaty -- contracting treaty parties are breaching the Convention, are you?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, that -- that actually is not accurate.  The Convention is full of conditions for the return: The safety of the child, the support of the parent who is returning -- there is a whole set of conditions that have to be met before the child is returned.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I happen to think that one could argue that returning back to the court that had -- was making the decision after an appeal is raised, that that's an inherent condition of a return order.  But that -- you're arguing against that, but there are plenty of conditions that could be imposed.   Sonia Sotomayor  No.  You can't -- the Court can't order custody issues, but it can set conditions for the nature of the return.

So, given that policy, why are we even in this case?  Meaning whether there was an exaction or no exaction or whatever happened in terms of the denial, you couldn't win on your offer because the policy of the State was clear, and in my mind, unassailable.  We have to preserve wetlands.  Conservation of other wetlands is not enough.  Mitigation means make sure that we get a net gain of wetlands.  So why are we here?

What's the -- I see an enormous flood gate here, and one in which we are sending a signal that perhaps States should be more quiet rather than more engaging.

If the only issue is an obligation to pay money, that that's not a takings claim, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  Right.  There was a second holding, however, which really gets eclipsed by the second, which is a denial of a permit doesn't permit you to raise the Nollan-Dolan case, and it appears to me even if there is an easement situation, so even if there is an actual takings claim at issue.

Let's go to just the loss issue.  If I agree with you that you need to prove the loss, this is a very unusual trust, because the measure of what the trust's res should be is fixed.  It was the amount of the trust plus the fixed interest, essentially.  This is a very unusual trust.  In the norm, the trust just says to the trustee, invest prudently.  And the trustee self-deals by taking the res out, puts the investment in his or her own name and takes the profit.  In that situation, how would you measure the loss?  In the normal self-dealing where the trustee just has to invest prudently and is depriving the trust of that investment value, would you say in that situation that the loss is measured by the lost opportunity?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Because there is a difference between what the trust loses and the gain that the trustee makes, which under normal trust principles the gain has to be disgorged.  Are you separating out those two things and how are you separating them out and how would I -- how would we write, the Court write this opinion to give loss meaning?  What's the -- what's the meaning you want to give it?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So under your theory, the profit to the trustee is never a measurement.   Sonia Sotomayor  Assume that that is distasteful, because for all the reasons the Government argues in its amicus brief, the idea that a trustee could self-deal is the height of a breach of fiduciary duty.  So give me something that -- that would win your case without upsetting the fact that defalcation somehow should, in the norm, include something as egregious as self-dealing.  You don't think your guy did, because he didn't know, but let's assume the worst case.  The guy knew.   ",11-1518
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  What does it matter -- if the money is missing, what does it matter the reason why in terms of recklessness or intent?  You took the money.  Justice Breyer and I both agree you intended to take the money.  So why are you adopting the need for recklessness, unless you're trying to avoid the second component that the other side's talking about, which is that you caused a loss to the trust?  Because that's where you have a problem here, where you have a problem, because there really is no loss to the trust in a traditional sense.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, the problem is that, yes, there was a breach of the trust.  But in terms of the terms of the trust, the trust got every penny that it would have earned if the money had not been taken.  It got the trust plus the fixed 6 percent that the trust was entitled to.  So it suffered no loss in its traditional sense.   Sonia Sotomayor  So are we fighting about the meaning of loss?  That's really the question.   Sonia Sotomayor  Are we fighting about what loss means?   Sonia Sotomayor  But he did.  This is the unusual part of this trust, which is that by the terms of this trust, it was only going to grow at principal plus a fixed interest.  Most trusts are not written this way.  This is the highly unusual trust, where it never -- should have made more money, because, taking the Chief Justice's hypothetical, which is he had invested it and just gotten the interest due, why would there be a defalcation?  What's the loss opportunity or the loss that you would have suffered.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Yes.  But let's assume a different fact scenario, that he didn't make $250,000, that he happened to make just the amount of the interest required, and he paid all of that back just as he did here, what would have been the defalcation under the Chief Justice's hypothetical?   Sonia Sotomayor  I've never heard of a defalcation that didn't result in some monetary loss.  What would have been the monetary loss in the Chief's hypothetical?   Sonia Sotomayor  Would you just repeat what you said?  Your voice turned.   Sonia Sotomayor  That's what I understood.  So you're saying that that is not the case?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But there is two components of the award, the attorney's fees plus the $250,000 profit.  And you're representing to me right now that as a trustee he was entitled to invest that fund for the trust?  And so there was a lost opportunity here as well?   INTERRUPTING ",11-1518

Sonia Sotomayor  I have read a lot of briefs in this case and I don't have any idea what to tell a lower court, how to articulate the tests or how to apply it.   Sonia Sotomayor  Given that you started with saying it's almost impossible to talk about what's jurisdictional and what's an application of jurisdiction.  So articulate the test and tell me what I tell the lower courts.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So that's what the court here did.  It looked at the Communications Act, it said, It has the power--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --to pass regulations with respect to this Act.  There is no clear exception.  I still haven't quite understood, other than in the academic literature, what the difference between Step Zero and Step One is, and so there is an ambiguity and now the agency is given deference.  So where in this conversation is there--   ",11-1545
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  General, let's go back to the question presented and break down your argument.  Is it your position that what the Court asks first is whether Congress has spoken clearly on the agency having authority or not?  Is that subject to de novo review?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  But tell me what gets deference when and what's subject to de novo review.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So deal with the three cases he mentioned.   ",11-1545
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  There was in my memory, and it's been a while, that some States, if not all -- and that's what I was going to ask you, basically deem any child born during the marriage to be a child of the marriage, whether it's a biological child or not, so that if a mother has had a relationship outside of marriage the married parent is still responsible for that child.  That would take care of, I think, a great number, wouldn't it, of the new technology births that occur without perhaps the input of one of -- the biological input of one of the parents?   Sonia Sotomayor  Yes.  My question was, do all States have similar rulings?  And for those that don't, what happens to a child that's been born with, as Justice Roberts said, as the Chief said, with new technology?  What happens to that child in terms of their definition of whether they will be considered a child for Social Security purposes?   Sonia Sotomayor  Rebuttable presumption or irrebuttable?   Sonia Sotomayor  May I ask?  Justice Scalia said that the statute is ambiguous.  Is that your position?  Is it your position that the definition of ""child"" is ambiguous and that we have to give the agency deference, or is it your position that in the context it's unambiguous and even if the Social Security Administration wanted to extend benefits, it couldn't, in the circumstances of this case?

Sonia Sotomayor  As the child who should receive.  So what the purpose of (h)?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So the -- a child who was born during marriage but is not a biological child wouldn't qualify?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Even though they qualify under State law as a child?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what this -- let's assume Ms. Capato remarried but used her deceased husband's sperm to birth two children.  They are the biological children of the Capatos.  Would they qualify for survivor benefits even though she is now remarried?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, you see, a situation like that is what is making me uncomfortable, because I don't see the words ""biological"" in the statute.  I don't see the word ""marriage"" directly when -- within the definition of ""child"".  So where do I draw them from?  Where do I come--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --But that would be true under State intestate law.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I am interested as to what your definition of child is.  Is it just a biological offspring?  Is it limited to a biological offspring born of a particular marriage?  But in what context?  Because we go back to Justice Ginsburg's question of what happens if the -- if the decedent is the mother.  There is no question that she bore this child.  Married or unmarried, does it matter?  Does marriage matter only if it's the father that's the decedent?  What is your -- if you are a sperm donor, does any offspring that sperm donor have qualify?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So the mother who is unmarried who bears a child, this child is not automatically covered.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Oh, so there are situations in which you think those provisions should govern.   Sonia Sotomayor  This is what was not clear to me.  So you are -- you are not arguing that ""child"" has just one natural meaning.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  In whatever meaning you could give it.   Sonia Sotomayor  How -- do you think that Congress thought of either of these situations as real possibilities?  Do you really think that the 1939 Congress, or even the one that passed the later statute, ever thought that a State would disinherit a naturally born -- all naturally born children -- or that children could be born 18 months, 4 years, 50 years later?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  They weren't thinking of either.  So the question becomes, given the language of (h) that says define ""child"" this way throughout the subchapter, why shouldn't we give that directive its plain meaning?  That's really the argument that you have to convince us of.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's because every State law recognized them as such as well.  Correct?   ",11-159X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I understand your arguments.  Your adversary raises a point that concerns me, which is what happens to all other amnesty programs like parking ticket amnesties?  And if you take your logic to an extreme, how about something that doesn't involve money but immigration status amnesty, illegal aliens who can apply for citizenship and be forgiven their illegal entry?  Doesn't the logic of your theory basically mean that there are no circumstances in which the government could treat people differently?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Every time a police officer stops me for a traffic violation, I get angry when he lets somebody else go.  So you are suggesting that there is a difference between that and this case where the government is basically saying, you owe me something and I'm going to forgive you what you owe me?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You see, the problem that I have is that you're trying to lop off half of the project, which is was what was the Barrett project -- without looking at what the new project is.  And that goes to what Justice Breyer's point was.  Moving forward, every old project and every new project is going to pay more money than they did under the Barrett Law, because I think, if I understand correctly, the city is raising a -- essentially not a flat fee, but a fee -- assessing a flat fee across all taxpayers so that these sewer lines can be built.  Am I correct about that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But it -- but it says that new people are going to pay a flat fee.  Old people are going to pay $10 more a month that they didn't have to pay.   Sonia Sotomayor  And so why can't they come in, and why don't they come in and say exactly what Justice Breyer said: You forgave the payments of taxes for hooking up to the sewer system of these new people coming in.  You're treating me differently.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, so everybody else says I want to pay $2,500.  You're still not dealing with the fact that this was one decision tied to others.  It was a package deal.  And so that the rationality of this package deal has to be seen in context.  You want to lop it off and say, all I'm looking at is how much these taxpayers paid for this old system, not what the new system is creating.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That is the park -- parking amnesty example that you have said wasn't the same.  Because if an individual taxpayer has filed late, it's like the parking guy who didn't file his ticket, either.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you really are saying that amnesty programs are out of the question if the risk is imposed equally on everyone.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  It makes no sense to me what you are saying, because under all circumstances the credit bid, unless the property is valued higher than the credit bid amount, but then another bidder could -- could make -- enter that bid.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The maximum value always has to be the value of the credit.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If the -- if the -- if the creditor is willing to put it at risk that way.   Sonia Sotomayor  But that's just not true from what you just said.  Meaning what you just said is that the buyer obviously is paying other things off, and by definition he's deducting that from the purchase price.  No one gives a purchase price for a piece of property and agrees to pay something else and gives the highest price for the property once they've done that.  So what you're asking for is permission for the debtor to use this property to pay other debts, and that's what I thought a secured interest prevented.   Sonia Sotomayor  So why doesn't he get--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Why doesn't he get everything that the buyer is promising to everyone else?  For that indubitably is part of the price, because he is giving out money to others, that's part of the value of this property.  So why isn't the creditor, the secured creditor, entitled to all of the proceeds from the property?   Sonia Sotomayor  Not -- with sales price, but not from all the payments.   Sonia Sotomayor  You still haven't answered my--   Sonia Sotomayor  --You still haven't answered my question.  If the buyer had money that he's willing to give up to others, why isn't he putting it in the purchase price?  Why isn't that part of the price?   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you explain what the reasoning is for requiring a credit bid if property is sold during the plan, but not permitting it when it's sold at the plan's--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Doesn't that delay the bankruptcy in every situation?  I can't actually understand what benefit other than delay of the bankruptcy process that would occasion.   Sonia Sotomayor  Uh-hmm.   Sonia Sotomayor  They don't have that right now?   Sonia Sotomayor  The vast majority of bankruptcy courts have permitted credit bidding in these situations.  So if the vast majority of bankruptcies have stalking horses, then the norm is working without us having to rule in your favor.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And stalking horses still come in.  So it's not as if the 363(k) procedure is failing in maximizing prices.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I'm a person who believes that in the business world the greatest security is just knowledge of what courts will do.  And what the two courts who have agreed with you have done is contrary to what the majority of courts have done for the longest time.  What's the value for us upsetting the norm?   Sonia Sotomayor  What's the business value for upsetting the norm?   Sonia Sotomayor  That it means, because people didn't think they could do it in plan sales.  So why should we upset the expectation?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  They could have gone under (i) and given the secured lender what he's entitled to, which is a future stream of payment.

But am I to understand that under the State's position in this action, the only time that the inquiry about the status of an individual rises is after they've had probable cause to arrest that individual for some other crime?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Can I -- can I--   Sonia Sotomayor  --just stop you there just one moment?  That's what I thought.  So presumably, I think your argument is, that under any circumstance, a police officer would have the discretion to make that call.  Seems to me that the issue is not about whether you make the call or not, although the Government is arguing that it might be, but on how long you detain the individual, meaning -- as I understand it, when individuals are arrested and held for other crimes, often there's an immigration check that most States do without this law.  And to the extent that the government wants to remove that individual, they put in a warrant of detainer.  This process is different.  How is it different?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, I understand that's their argument.  I can question them about that.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But I want to get to how -- assuming your position, that doing it on a -- there's nothing wrong with doing it as it's been done in the past.  Whenever anyone is detained, a call could be made.  What I see as critical is the issue of how long, and under -- and when is the officer going to exercise discretion to release the person?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What happens if -- this is the following call -- the call to the -- to the Federal Government.  Yes, he's an illegal alien.  No, we don't want to detain him.  What does the law say, the Arizona law say, with respect to releasing that individual?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm putting all of this outside of--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I want to make sure that I get a clear representation from you.  If on a call to the Federal agency, the agency says, we don't want to detain this alien, that alien will be released or -- unless it's under 6, is what you're telling me.  Or under 6, 3, or some -- one other of Arizona's immigration clauses.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.

It seems odd to think that the Federal government is deciding on employment sanctions and has unconsciously decided not to punish employees.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Can I ask you something?   Sonia Sotomayor  You're inviting -- you're inviting the very sort of conflict that he's talking about.  Because what's going to happen now is that if there is no statement by the Federal agency of legality, the person is arrested, and now we're going to have Federal resources spent on trying to figure out whether they have an asylum application, whether they have this, whether they have that, whether they are exempted under this reason, whether the failure to carry was accidental or not -- I mean, you are involving the Federal Government in your prosecution.

Every person that's suspected of being an alien who's arrested for another crime -- that's what Mr. Clement says the statute means -- the officer has to pick up the phone and call -- and call the agency to find out if it's an illegal alien or not.  He tells me that unless there's another reason to arrest the person -- and that's 3 and 6, or any of the other provisions -- but putting those aside, we're going to stay just in 2(B), if the government says, we don't want to detain the person, they have to be released for being simply an illegal alien, what's wrong with that?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counselor, can I back you up a minute to join the two questions that my colleague posed to you?  Let's assume there's a merits-based decision on the CSRA and one on the discrimination.  In the normal course, assuming you are not barred by being untimely, you could go to the district court, and the district court presumably would have jurisdiction, if one is a discrimination-based decision, to decide both questions.  What's the standard of review that a court would apply to each of those claims independently or together?  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --that that's--   Sonia Sotomayor  --We can then fight about whether the factual issue regarding the timeliness and exhaustion should be subject to one or the other standard of review, but what are the standards of review?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You argued that you were exceeding the dismissals on the basis of jurisdiction should go to the Federal circuit, but that you were only invoking the exception that procedural dismissals should be permitted to go to the district court or authorized to go.  Are you still standing by that distinction?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Yes, but when you argued it below you argued the exception, you didn't argue the jurisdictional rule.  Are you abandoning that distinction?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But it's not the view of the circuit courts, even the courts--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Even the courts whose exception you--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Every circuit court unanimously holds that jurisdictional rule dismissals should go only to the Federal circuit.

Sonia Sotomayor  So you are prepared on behalf of the Government to say that if we rule that procedural dismissals can go to the district court, then you -- then the Government will concede that jurisdictional dismissal should as well?   Sonia Sotomayor  Under 7512.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  We don't have to reach that question in this case, but your brief seemed to make the argument that there was no basis for the distinction between procedural and jurisdictional.   Sonia Sotomayor  Can I ask you a couple questions?   Sonia Sotomayor  When the Federal Circuit was created, this language preexisted its creation, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  So could you tell me how when Congress was writing 7702 it was creating the system that you are advocating when it had no idea that it would ever create the Federal Circuit?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That still doesn't answer my question, which is: Assuming there is no Federal Circuit, I have to read the language that exists in 7702 and 7703, and I see judicial review, appealable judicial review, used not in the manner that you're describing.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You don't have a quarrel with your opposing counsel's position that once the Board decides the CSRA claim and the discrimination claim, the district court reviews both?   Sonia Sotomayor  Justice Alito was questioning that, but you don't quarrel with that.   Sonia Sotomayor  So the lack of uniformity is inherent in this structure.  You just want to carve out one piece of it that--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --that you say deserves more uniformity.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I have a problem, because to accept your reading is to say that judicially reviewable action differs between 770 -- differs between 7702 and the escape hatch, because the only way the escape hatch can work, it, too, cross-references 7702 in the same way that the provisions you are relying on do.  Under your reading both should be given identical meaning, because they both cross-reference 7702; and yet your brief says, no, we shouldn't have that absurd result.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It seems to me that if you concede that there is an absurd result in applying your interpretation to the escape hatch, by definition, your meaning can't be ascribable to that phrase.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Under your view, is there any situation today where the Tucker Act would be applied to a statute?  Because if we start with the statute, which always seems to be where you're pointing us to, and we're only looking for a clear waiver of sovereign immunity, then there will never be another Tucker Act action in the future.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What would they look like to be able to get around our clear statement rule?   Sonia Sotomayor  So basically -- I'm not sure why we're even addressing the issue of Tucker Act jurisdiction.  We should have really just been briefing the issue of whether the statute at issue here waives sovereign immunity--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --because that becomes, to you, the operative question.   Sonia Sotomayor  Could I ask you--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I was going to ask -- following up on my question--   Sonia Sotomayor  --many courts have held that the FLSA has an express waiver of sovereign immunity.  And many of them have recognized, if not all, a Tucker Act remedy.  Under your new approach, that holding is incorrect, I presume--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --because the FLSA has its own remedial scheme?   Sonia Sotomayor  But then the Federal circuit has no jurisdiction over those claims, according to you, because the waiver is in the FLSA, it has its own judicial remedy.  They are not authorized, then, to go to--   Sonia Sotomayor  --It has the same language as here, in -- you can bring your suit in any Federal or state court of competent jurisdiction.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I don't know -- I don't see the difference between--   Sonia Sotomayor  --That's exactly what I started with.  That's what I started with: Is there anything left to the Tucker Act?   Sonia Sotomayor  So the new rule is if a statute is written to impose obligations only on the government, then the Tucker Act is implicated immediately.  If the rule says the government and any party who contracts with it -- a Medicaid provider -- must do X, Y, and Z, and the government and the Medicaid provider have the burdens of accomplishing Y, unless there is an express waiver of sovereign immunity, the Tucker Act doesn't come into play.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's your position.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, you are not going to suggest that if the scheme I just described says X, Y, and Z, have to do all these things, and someone to whom they owe that obligation can sue the Medicaid provider, for example, for breach of that obligation, presumably -- I'm putting in a lot of hypotheticals given our case law -- but you're saying they can't sue the government under the Tucker Act--   Sonia Sotomayor  --unless there is an express waiver.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, this sort of begs the question--   Sonia Sotomayor  --the statute awards damages for breach of the obligation, so it's money mandating.  The issue is not whether it's money mandating; the question is who is it mandating.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But there is not an issue of whether it contemplates the payment of damages.  It expressly awards--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I -- it is -- there is some difficulty with your argument, which is, going back to my simplified hypothetical, government and Medicaid -- X providers have to do X, Y, and Z; if those persons, being defined as government and providers, doesn't do what they have to do, they have to pay these damages.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I mean, that's pretty clear.   ",11-192X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  So are you happy with the circuit's suggestion that the specific does govern the general insofar as it will adopt whatever FCRA's limitations are?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And into its own processes?   Sonia Sotomayor  Your position is that's perfectly okay.   Sonia Sotomayor  One of the purposes of the Tucker Act was to provide a remedy, where none existed, to get rid of the private bills.  What's wrong with the government's basic proposition which is where you have a remedy you have to pursue that remedy.  And I think that, at bottom, that's their argument.  What's wrong with that scheme?  Instead of permitting two remedies with potentially conflicting commands, whether it's on the amount of damages or the nature of the recovery or the statute of limitations, why isn't their vision of what the Tucker Act -- the role the Tucker Act should play one that should be given voice?  One that should be followed?   Sonia Sotomayor  The FSLA as well.   Sonia Sotomayor  The FSLA as well.   ",11-192X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Could you tell me what the error actually was?  I see -- and you can add another -- three potential things about these calls or three potential errors: One, that they proved as a matter of fact that she was biased.  But, as the majority points out, she already said she was before the tapes were played.  So whatever error may have been occasioned by the jury using the tapes as for the truth, it really was cumulative to an already admitted bias.  The second is some sort of ambiguous statement by her that all of them were in trouble, meaning all the defendants, and a similar statement by the Petitioner's lawyer.  So what was it that was error that affected or influenced the jury among these three choices?   Sonia Sotomayor  It was never referenced in the summations, however, or in the reply.   Sonia Sotomayor  So that's the error that you think--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --influenced this trial?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  Now, tell me what in this record reflects that influence.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The fact that they asked for her testimony, well, she was your client's entire defense.  So what does the asking for her testimony show that they were interested in that particular part of the transcript?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Which transcript?  The transcript of her testimony?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Can we get a little more practical here?  I think I understood your basic argument, which is: My defense was by this one woman, the wife of one of the codefendants.  She tells a story and if the jury had believed her story they would have acquitted your client.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So I am assuming what you're saying -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong -- which is if we believe that the error committed affected her credibility in a meaningful way, that that deprived you of a defense.  Is that what you're saying?   Sonia Sotomayor  Of the potential of convincing the jury.   Sonia Sotomayor  Now, assuming that's your argument, I go back to my question, okay.   Sonia Sotomayor  Because what you said to me earlier, it wasn't about believing her or not; it was about believing the defense attorney when -- whether the defense attorney thought the defendant was guilty or not.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Let's -- let's--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Are you taking the position in this case that a reviewing court under no circumstance could conclude that this error was harmless?  Or are you taking the position in this case that the court here, the Seventh Circuit, I think, committed review error and we should send it back for them to do it the right way?   ",11-199X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  I don't know how to separate out an admitted error situation.  And let me explain why, okay?  Let's assume the facts of this case, but instead of this tape recording the improperly admitted evidence was a confession by the defendant.  Would you be prepared to say that in a circumstantial case of guilt -- now, we've already said that confessions are one of the most powerful pieces of harmful error -- that in this, in a confession, that somehow this was still harmful -- harmless?   Sonia Sotomayor  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's a different standard.  Let's, let's talk about it under the Kehoda standard.  Let's talk about the standard we are assessing.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, no, no.  He testifies, but he testifies to everything Marina said.  Meaning, he -- when I used the word ""confession"", I'm sorry, I misspoke.  He takes the stand.  He -- or doesn't take the stand.  He says everything he said to the police.  And that confession that he was there--   Sonia Sotomayor  --She called him, etcetera.   Sonia Sotomayor  It was improperly admitted, without Miranda warning.   Sonia Sotomayor  Not the tapes, just the story.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.   Sonia Sotomayor  My hypothetical is not working for this reason, and I understand what you are saying.  It's hard to identify a comparable mistake.  But my point is that -- doesn't the harmfulness of the error sort of vary with the strength of the government's case.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If he had not run away, and the tapes were admitted--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Exactly.  And what the defense said was -- there is only one defense here, and it's the wife's defense that he was there by accident, not intentionally.  There was a lot of countervailing evidence to disprove that, but the question is could a reasonable jury have -- might have or could have credited that defense?   Sonia Sotomayor  Sure.  You look at how the case was tried.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I just don't see how you can do it without the error.  I keep going back to this point.  How about if the prosecutor had done in summation the following: Ladies and Gentlemen, whatever the wife told you disbelieve because the lawyer said he was guilty.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The lawyer -- the prosecutor got up at the end of trial and said: Disbelieve everything the wife told you, because the lawyer said the defendant was guilty.  All right?  I'll go through all the other evidence I have that might prove that she was not telling the truth, but the central, most important piece of evidence in this case about his guilt is that the lawyer said he's guilty.  Can you say that this jury was uninfluenced by that error?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Because under your formulation--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --A rational jury would have convicted absent the lawyer saying that.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The dissent pointed out that she admitted that before the tapes were played.   Sonia Sotomayor  That she was testifying in the hopes of getting a lesser sentence for her husband.  So she -- the tapes weren't necessary for that.

Your brief to the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit suggested that a sale is a -- is a transaction, a transfer of some sort, or at least a promise to purchase.  But your brief here holds IT a much more rigid test, that there has to be a transfer of title.  And he pointed to the language of 3(x) -- 3(k), that says ""consignment for sale"", which doesn't have a transfer of the title.  So what is the government's position?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  General, may I pose a hypothetical?  During the Vietnam War, a protester holds up a sign that says,  ""I won a Purple Heart -- for killing babies. ""  Knowing statement.  He didn't win the Purple Heart.  As a reader, I can't be sure whether he did and is a combat veteran who opposes the war, or whether he's a citizen protesting the war.  Is that person, if he's not a veteran, having received the medal, is he liable under this act?   Sonia Sotomayor  Somewhat dangerous, isn't it, to subject speech to the absolute rule of no protection?  Which is what you're advocating, I understand, that there are no circumstances in which this speech has value.  I believe that's your bottom line.   Sonia Sotomayor  Harms -- General, I spent a lot of time going through the multiple cases that you cited in your brief defining the various statutes that basically impose penalties for impersonation of some sort or another.  And virtually in every one of them, except perhaps one, there was either an economic interest that was harmed by the impersonation, either by the -- by the very face of the statute or by the nature of the claim, a dilution of a trademark, by taking on someone else's valuable property rights.  And so I went back reading our cases, and Justice Story many, many years ago said, look, falsehoods have no value as such, but the ""breathing space"" concept is defined by those falsehoods which cause injury to rights that people possess, to -- to pecuniary interests that they have, or to the reputation of others.  And almost every statute where we have approved a harm concept as being permissible for recovery has affected one of those three things.  So please tell me what's wrong with Justice Story's view, number one; and, number two, how does the definition of harm fit in that?  What's the harm here that fits within that descriptor.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I didn't mention -- neither did Justice Story.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  He said if you want to regulate a falsehood, it has to cause a harm in this way.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Not really.  They are intended to protect the right of the government to secure truthful information.   Sonia Sotomayor  The government has a right to subpoena you at trial, subject you to oath, and force you to tell the truth.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So if you -- that's a right.  That fits within Story's definition.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  General, but I have a problem, which is it's not as narrow as it could get.  Wouldn't take much to do exactly what Congress said it was doing, which was to protect against fraudulent claims of receiving a medal, and the example it used was someone who used a fraudulent claim of receiving a medal to get money.  What I'm trying to get to is, what harm are we protecting here?  I thought that the core of the First Amendment was to protect even against offensive speech.  We have a legion of cases that said your emotional reaction to offensive speech is not enough.  If that is the core of our First Amendment, what I hear, and that's what I think the court below said, is you can't really believe that a war veteran thinks less of the medal that he or she receives because someone's claiming fraudulently that they got one.  They don't think less of the medal.  We're reacting to the fact that we're offended by the thought that someone's claiming an honor they didn't receive.  So outside of the emotional reaction, where's the harm?  And I'm not minimizing it.  I too take offense when people make these kinds of claims, but I take offense when someone I'm dating makes a claim that's not true.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Or I'm not going to do this because the medal has been debased.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But the reality here is that this gentleman was publicized, deriled for what he did.  His public position was compromised, as is the case with almost everyone who's caught at lying.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, it seems to me that you're asking us to value the speech in context.  We're not talking about the effect of the speech and whether you can regulate that.  You're asking us to say, you know, the guy who says he's a college graduate in a political campaign, that could chill political speech.  So in that lie in that context, you can't sanction.  But you can sanction that lie in a different context.  On a date.  I don't know, because on a date, it doesn't chill political speech, and it will induce a young woman to date someone who she thinks is more of a professional, because that harms the parents, it harms the family.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counselor, it might--   Sonia Sotomayor  --May I -- if I understood your argument, you're saying historically we have not protected false statements that cause harm.  I think that's your argument.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  Assuming -- so it's -- we do protect false statements presumptively, but the historical exceptions, like defamation, are those that cause harm.  So I go back to Justice Alito's question, because you really haven't answered his question.  You've dealt with the government process cases, although we could argue about whether that's protecting a process or protecting a government right to truthful information.  That's a different issue.  But the question is how do you deal with the intentional infliction of emotional distress?  Because damage, we require injury, and it's defined under law what kind of injury.  So tell me how you define harm in the nongovernmental situation, number one, and then tell me why that -- this situation doesn't fit that definition.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Could you tell me who you think would have a valid and timely APA action to challenge what the Secretary has allegedly done here, which is to take lands into trust in violation of the statute per our -- I know that the U.S. is challenging that assumption, but let's assume the reality of the allegation.  Who would -- who would be able to challenge it, and in what mechanism?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That, I understand.  That's why I said timely filed.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Let's assume a situation where you first promise the land to one tribe, and then, in the midst of negotiations, another tribe lays claim.  The United States says, I change my mind; I'm going to give the land to the other tribe.  Does the tribe that you have denied the land to have any standing or any rights with respect to challenging that determination?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm a little confused.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, you're assuming that the statute was passed against a backdrop of complete sovereign immunity; but, if you look at Larson and Malone, it appears as if prior to the enactment of the QTA people could bring suits to say that an officer had acted beyond his or her statutory authority.

From where do we draw the conclusion that the intent was to eliminate every other claim that could be brought under something like the APA or an officer suit?   INTERRUPTING ",11-246X

How is your claim, the one that you ultimately made, any different than what you would have done if you had filed within the 30 days?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Same claim, right.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  Tell me what relief you're seeking that's different than -- are you -- what relief are you seeking?  Aren't you seeking to shed the United States of its title?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Just the -- what's the -- don't tell me what your cause of action is.  What relief at the end of the day do you want?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, is there any limit to who can bring an APA action under your theory?  It seems to me that what you're saying is that anyone other than a landowner because of the Quiet Title Act can within 6 years attempt to unravel any decision the government has made to take land, because we're not limited now to trust lands.  We're limited -- under your theory, whenever the government takes any kind of land, anyone's entitled to come in and challenge that action under the APA for 6 years and to seek an injunction because it isn't a quiet title action.  It's merely a challenge to the decision to take land.  Is there any limit to your theory as to who can bring that kind of action and--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --In which way?  You're saying anyone who is affected, your niece, your farm owner's niece who comes to visit twice a year or visits the land and walks through it, could presumably say: I'm negatively affected by the government's taking of this land, Indian or not, within the 6 years, and the government improperly took the land; undo it.   Sonia Sotomayor  No, but my question -- counsel, my question was different.  Under your theory, you could bring this suit after the land has been taken.  NEPA assumes before the land was taken.  I'm talking about under your theory of law, once land has been taken by the U.S., if anyone has a viable legal claim that the land was taken improperly, whether it's Indian trust land or anyone else's land for any other purpose, that person within 6 years can still bring a suit under the APA.   Sonia Sotomayor  Government land is always taken by administrative action.   Sonia Sotomayor  Forget about the trust.   Sonia Sotomayor  Because under your theory of what -- what the APA permits you to do, anytime the government takes land, whether into trust or for any other purpose, the APA permits someone within six years, with whatever definition of prudential standing you want to give it, to come in after the taking and challenge that it was ultra vires, that it was done improperly.  That's your theory.  So going back to Justice Breyer's question, why isn't that within the quiet title action prohibition--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --once it's in the government's hands.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Was that the -- I thought part of it was agricultural land, and that another part was a business.  I mean, I think -- I thought -- well, the government can correct me.   Sonia Sotomayor  Right.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Is that because you don't have a theory as to why once the government takes it it's not a quiet title action?   Sonia Sotomayor  So answer my question, or the one that Justice Breyer has said.  Then it doesn't -- and the one Justice Kagan repeated yet again -- okay?  What difference does it make that the government has taken title?  Whether the government has title or doesn't, under your theory, since this is not a quiet action -- title action, anyone who is unhappy with the way the government took title could challenge it within 6 years.  Isn't that the bottom line of your theory?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Absent laches.  You say the only defense is laches.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But the bottom line is, under your theory, as long as no landowner, the person most directly affected by the taking, as long as that person can't sue, but anybody who is an indirect person can sue within 6 years, anybody who says, I don't want the land, I just don't want the U.S. to have the land.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But they can't undo the transfer.  They can only get money.   ",11-246X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, that -- that's exactly what Justice Breyer is saying.  Okay?  Which is, as I understand it, there is some literature that talks about should we be treating misdemeanor arrests different than felony arrests, because there is less discretion that an officer would have with respect to arresting someone for a felony than for misdemeanors or criminal fines, because like jaywalking, policemen don't arrest you for jaywalking unless they are either on a ticket binge or because there's something about you that they don't like.   Sonia Sotomayor  So if that something about you they don't like is that you are wearing an antiwar armband, are we going to let that plaintiff not recover, because somehow we need to protect police officers so much, in the discretionary use of this vast power they have to arrest that we are going to permit them to trample the First Amendment, essentially?  Or are we going to say, in the normal situation there is a First Amendment claim, even with probable cause, if you can prove that it's the motivating factor for the arrest; but we treat Secret Service differently?  And I think that was the point Justice Breyer's getting to, and the one I'm most interested in.   Sonia Sotomayor  If you are jaywalking, there is probable cause.   Sonia Sotomayor  But -- but -- what does it have to do with violating the First Amendment, meaning if police officers have discretion and they would not otherwise arrest you except for their dislike of your speech, that's a violation of your right to free speech, isn't it?   Sonia Sotomayor  We can go to that question later.   Sonia Sotomayor  Do you have a sense of how many of these First Amendment retaliatory claims in those jurisdictions that permit them -- I know they are more limited -- how many of these cases arise?

Sonia Sotomayor  So I know collective knowledge is a theory in a lot of cases, but let's deal with the facts of this case.  What's -- what's the animus?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So could you tell me what a critical mass was?  I'm looking at the number of blacks in the University of Texas system.  Pre-Grutter, when the State was indisputably still segregating, it was 4 percent.  Today, under the post-Grutter system, it's 6 percent.  The 2 percent increase is enough for you, even though the State population is at 12 percent?  Somehow, they've reached a critical mass with just the 2 percent increase?   Sonia Sotomayor  No -- putting aside -- I don't -- I'm not going to quarrel with you that if demographics alone were being used, I would be somewhat concerned.  But you can't seriously suggest that demographics aren't a factor to be looked at in combination with how isolated or not isolated your student body is actually reporting itself to feel?   Sonia Sotomayor  It might be -- it might be insulting to some to be thrown into a pot.   Sonia Sotomayor  So what are you telling us is the standard of critical mass?  At what point does a district court or a university know that it doesn't have to do any more to equalize the desegregation that has happened in that particular State over decades, that it's now going to be stuck at a fixed number and it has to change its rules.  What's that fixed number?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, they told -- they told the district court.  They took a study of students.  They analyzed the composition of their classes, and they determined in their educational judgment that greater diversity, just as we said in Grutter, is a goal of their educational program, and one that includes diversifying classes.  So what more proof do you require?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, but given it was in the evidence, what more do you think they needed?  I think I hear all you saying in your brief is the number's fixed now, they got enough, no more is necessary.   Sonia Sotomayor  That's enough now.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's what you're saying.   Sonia Sotomayor  Tell me -- tell me what about their use of race did not fit the narrow tailoring, not the necessity prong as you've defined it, but the narrow tailoring that Grutter required?  How is race used by them in a way that violated the terms of Grutter?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Assuming that the need is there.  I know you're challenging the need.   Sonia Sotomayor  So you have to set a quota for critical mass?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So we won't call it a quota; we'll call it a goal, something Grutter said you shouldn't have.   Sonia Sotomayor  Boy, it sounds awfully like a quota to me that Grutter said you should not be doing, that you shouldn't be setting goals, that you shouldn't be setting quotas; you should be setting an individualized assessment of the applicants.  Tell me how this system doesn't do that.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So now we're going to tell the universities how to run and how to weigh qualifications, too?   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you tell me again how race and their use of race overwhelms those other factors in their system as it's created?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, you are the one who in your brief has assumed that they are valuing different races differently.  But Asian numbers have gone up, under however they have structured this PAI.  And as I understand their position, race is balanced against other issues like socioeconomics, the strength of the classes people took.  It's never a stand alone.  So even a white student, I presume, who goes to an entirely black or an entirely Latino school, who becomes class president would get some points because he has or she has proven that they foster or can deal in a diverse environment.  That's how I understood their plan; that it's not just giving you a plus because of race, it's combining that with other factors.   Sonia Sotomayor  Is your complaint limited to injunctive relief and the return of the $100?  As written, is that what it's limited to?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  In Arizonans and Alvarez we said any all -- any and other -- all damages is too speculative.  Is what you actually see what I said: injunctive relief and the return of the $100.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  In--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --In Arizonans and Alvarez we said you can't manufacture standing after the fact.  Did you ask only for injunctive relief and the $100, specifically?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  For what, nominal damages?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And then how do you get around Arizonans?   Sonia Sotomayor  She was going to get a better job because she went to a different university?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  In the holistic way that Grutter permits?   Sonia Sotomayor  No, it's just that every one of their students who happens to be a minority is going to end up in that program.  You don't think the university could consider that it needs a different diversity in its other departments?

That's the bottom line of this case.  And you're saying, and I think rightly because of our cases, that you can't set a quota, because that's what our cases say you can't do.  So if we're not going to set a quota, what do you think is the standard we apply to make a judgment?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr.--   Sonia Sotomayor  General, I think, as I take your answer, is that the supposition of Justice Alito's question is truly impossible under this system.  There are not two identical candidates because there are not identical mechanical factors that -- except the 10 percent plan.

A facial challenge goes to the district court and a constitutional as-applied challenge goes to the commission?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could you tell me how -- how -- how this is any different than the administrative system and review system that was reviewed in Thunder Basin and Illinois Long-Term Care?  In both those statutes, the agencies weren't permitted to consider facial challenges, constitutional challenges; and we said that's okay, they can't, but the reviewing court can.  So how's that any different from the situation you're proposing here?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But please deal with the language of both cases.  Both cases said even if the agency can't review a constitutional challenge, there is still review within the Federal Circuit, within the court -- within the circuit courts and that's okay.   Sonia Sotomayor  So why isn't that okay here?  I think that was Justice Scalia's question to you.  I know that you say well, the Federal Circuit won't have a record.  But the government says if it wants a record, it can remand and ask the agency to develop it.  So what's wrong with that procedure?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Isn't one of the challenges here by one of the Petitioners that he was constructively discharged?  Isn't that an issue that the board is better suited to determine in the first instance, whether there was at all a constructive discharge?   ",11-45XX

Sonia Sotomayor  Please finish with your answer.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  To go back to your interesting suggestion that the board should decide the constitutional issue, I've just been spending a little bit of time going through the act, and you're certainly -- it doesn't appear that there's anything in the act that precludes them from granting any appropriate relief with respect to an unlawful discharge.  Am I correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Is there any rule of the board that stops a litigant from making a proffer -- an offer of proof?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Wouldn't that be the proper way of doing it, if you're going to go up on a constitutional claim?  Make your offer of proof and then the Federal Circuit can decide if it needs more evidence or not.   ",11-45XX
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  So why don't we just remand and let it sort it out under the right understanding of the legal rule?  Which is basically what the Government is saying, with an added twist because it thinks there is another legal question that I think the Ninth Circuit has answered, but we could go back and forth on it.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Everybody agrees.   Sonia Sotomayor  So this was a regulatory void?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  A regulatory void that these -- that there was no requirement previously that you monitor the outfalls?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So how do you envision this permit was -- by the way, just one side question and then to this one.  I thought the Ninth Circuit basically endorsed your view that under the permit you're not -- you're only responsible for your own pollution.   Sonia Sotomayor  So it has resolved this issue.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So that's why I ask why remand and why you're saying why remand.   Sonia Sotomayor  But putting that aside, how do you think the system was supposed to work before?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Did you have any obligation, once you saw the excess pollutants, to start the reiteration process to try to figure out who was the cause of this?   Sonia Sotomayor  You mean the Respondents could have done that here?   Sonia Sotomayor  You just said there were polluters upstream.  Are those industrial polluters upstream--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --or industrial facilities, are they within your MS4?   Sonia Sotomayor  But what you're saying is that there are outfalls from different people into the same river.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So we don't know whether the outfall is from your MS4 or from some other source?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, tell me why remand?  I thought -- and correct me at whatever step I'm wrong, okay -- that the district court rejected Respondents' argument that the mere monitoring excesses created liability.  What it said is you have to follow the terms of the permit and make the permittee responsible only for their excess discharges, and you haven't shown us any evidence that does that.  The Ninth Circuit agreed that the permittee is only liable for its own discharges.  It held the permittee liable because it believed that the discharges were within their source, within their outflow.  So what are we remanding for?  The legal question of whether the -- the -- the monitoring stations automatically create liability has been answered in the negative by both courts.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How would it--   Sonia Sotomayor  --what could it do differently?   Sonia Sotomayor  How does that change the answer to the legal question that the permittee -- both courts have said the permittee is only liable for their own discharges.  And unless this proves that they discharged, they themselves discharged, which it can't because it's in the river and not within the source--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --how can that alone establish liability?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  What happens when there is a challenge to the admission of evidence on a state law ground on a Confrontation Clause ground, and all the state court does is grapple with the evidentiary rule, but it's self evident that the Confrontation Clause is based on a different theory?  Are we to assume, in the light of that kind of decision, that the court actually grappled with the Confrontation Clause?   Sonia Sotomayor  Am I to make that assumption when, before our line of cases in this area, state courts generally had held that if hearsay was admissible under their evidentiary rules, that that was the end of their Confrontation Clause challenge?  Is a Federal court supposed to continue with that presumption in light of an undisputed state's statement that their rules are consonant with the Confrontation Clause.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, let's assume it's not after our -- we render our decision.   Sonia Sotomayor  If one--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Irrebuttably?   Sonia Sotomayor  I see exceptions to that already.  There are cases where the state court reaches one prong of the Strickland standard, has no need to go to the second.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you really can't say in that situation that you can assume they reached the second, can you?   Sonia Sotomayor  All of the circuit courts basically have a rule close to the one announced by Justice Alito, don't they?   Sonia Sotomayor  All of them have essentially a presumption that's rebutted by some form of evidence, except for perhaps the Eleventh and this circuit that have a clear, almost irrebuttable presumption.  I'm sorry.  Not the Ninth, but the Eleventh.   Sonia Sotomayor  But it's not as absolute as the Eleventh.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I have a -- you know, I mean, for every rule you're going to find an exception that abuses it.  It's the nature of human nature.  Do you know what the total number of habeas petitions there are and what the percentage that are actually granted?   Sonia Sotomayor  Would you be willing to accept that it's -- in relationship to the total granted, it's very, very small?   Sonia Sotomayor  So whatever the abuse of the system is, it hasn't halted justice.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That the person is not guilty is a bias?   Sonia Sotomayor  That -- that's -- that may be your strongest point, but most of what he said was basically this is a murder case, and the evidence has to be beyond a reasonable doubt, and I think it has to be clear enough for me to be convinced.  Is that a biased juror?   Sonia Sotomayor  I must say that, like Justice Kennedy, I'm deeply troubled when trial judges intrude in the deliberative processes of juries.  Most of the time when we're assessing bias, we're assessing it on the grounds of extraneous evidence, a juror who has said one thing in voir dire and is now either a convicted felon or introduced extraneous circumstance.  But the degree of being convinced is the very essence of jury deliberations.  This case is troublesome.   ",11-465X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm not sure how you can say that.  I mean, I think the simplest statement of the State rule is that the State believes that if you remove a juror for actual bias, that that is okay under the Sixth Amendment.  They said it in Cleveland.  They were presented with the argument in this case by the briefing that the juror was not biased and hence the Sixth Amendment was violated.  And they ruled to say he was biased, and I see as a natural, clear inference that they were saying the Sixth Amendment wasn't violated because he was biased.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's a different question.  That question is whether the California Supreme Court's Cleveland decision, its assumption that a biased juror violates -- doesn't violate -- the removal of a biased juror doesn't violate the Sixth Amendment, is that an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent, not circuit court precedent?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What Supreme Court precedent commands that result?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Is this -- is this a holding that the Sixth Amendment requires you to keep a biased juror as long as the juror says, I have doubts about the sufficiency of the evidence?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Now, answer my question.  Does the Sixth Amendment require you to keep a biased juror?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So, if the Sixth Amendment doesn't require you to keep a biased juror, then why is it that the state court's finding that this juror was biased a Sixth Amendment holding, that it wasn't violated because the juror was biased?  The logic is almost inescapable to me.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Did the California court find the juror was biased?   INTERRUPTING ",11-465X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Excuse me, but could the Secretary have done anything else?   Sonia Sotomayor  Could the Secretary have done anything else?  There's an allegation that the Secretary in fact pays some contractors more than their pro rata share, that it pays some nothing--   Sonia Sotomayor  --so that it's in effect acting -- I don't want to use the word ""arbitrarily"" -- but acting in whatever its best interest is.  So what protects the contracting party from that -- from that conduct, assuming it were to be correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  Says it has a policy.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The allegation is, is that it's not following it, that it's choosing to pay people some more than others.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, how -- what was our reference and acceptance of the Ferris doctrine?  And the Ferris doctrine was almost identical to this situation, where Congress allotted a certain amount to the building of a particular dam, and the same -- we applied the Ferris principle and said even though they gave it to one type of contract, the dam, they were paying 1 percent less than others.   Sonia Sotomayor  Where they had an allotment adequate enough to cover that individual.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I know what the Federal Circuit said.  I don't think the Federal Circuit's right.  If you read Ferris, there was an appropriation for the dam.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So do the tribes have the right to stop providing the services--   Sonia Sotomayor  --that they've contracted to?   Sonia Sotomayor  How do they know that until they know what they're getting?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Meaning they don't know what they're getting.   Sonia Sotomayor  They signed a contract that says you're going to pay them for their services to their members and for their administrative costs.  They incur that cost, and then at the end of the year, the government now says to them you've honored your part, but we're not going to honor ours.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What does the system do to the 50-odd contracts that Arctic Slope, in its amici brief, points to that are similar to these?  Does this now mean that moving forward, that every government contractor who has a ""subject to appropriations"" language takes the risk that at some point in the middle of the contract, the government is going to dishonor its obligation and pay it less than it said it would?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So how do -- how do we differentiate those 50 other contracts?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why don't we let Congress fix it?  Because there are so many ways that Congress could fix this problem directly.  By doing a line item allocation, it could take away the obligation to enter into these contracts and fully fund.  It could be much more direct--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --than it's being, given the interpretation that you're advancing.   Sonia Sotomayor  It was trying -- it was trying to tell the tribes, we are honoring our obligation by paying you the costs, but we are really not going to do it because we are going to let the government give you less?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I have to assume Congress intends what it says.  It intends to obligate you to enter into contracts that -- that give -- make you commit to paying their costs, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that's true of every contract.  That's where I'm getting stuck on what your theory is.  The Anti-Deficiency Act says you can't spend more than you're given.   Sonia Sotomayor  So every single contractor, under your logic, should know that when they sign a contract, the government can break it because if it doesn't have enough funds, it can't pay.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But -- so there's no real logic to your argument, other than to say we can't -- we're -- if the contract says ""subject to appropriations"", let's do away with Ferris, let's do away with Cherokee Nation and--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --it just means that we pay you what we can.   Sonia Sotomayor  But what you're saying is you make two promises on the ISDA.  We're going to pay you your support costs, your administrative costs, in full, and we're going to retain the right to break that promise.  That's really what you're saying the ISDA says.   Sonia Sotomayor  So you ignore all the language where it says we're going to pay you X amount, all the law that says you have to be reimbursed -- the tribes have to be reimbursed for all their costs; all of that is going to be ignored?   Sonia Sotomayor  Do you dispute Mr. Phillips' statement that the tribes don't know how much they're getting until some point further into the performance cycle?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The system that's in place does not--   ",11-551X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Could you give me that cite again.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Phillips, this is an unusual situation with the tribes because in the normal ""not to exceed"" appropriation by Congress, the government rightly says we have the power to not contract.  And in military contracts and others, we have a for convenience cancellation.  We have all sorts of things that protect us from the deficiency.  But this is a unique situation because the government, on the one hand, despite their protestations to the contrary, are forced to accept these contracts.   Sonia Sotomayor  And on the other hand, Congress is saying, don't pay more on them.  We are telling you to accept more payment than we are going to give you.   Sonia Sotomayor  Should we create a special rule for this -- why shouldn't we create a special rule for this unique situation?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Phillips, how does Congress do this without upsetting the entire scheme?  Knowing that these contracts are not all signed on one day, that there are 12 regions, that the negotiations go over time, how could Congress achieve the scheme that the government wants now?  How would it write this contract?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  You keep saying that, but I thought in your earlier answer you said that the contracts are generally signed by the time of the appropriation.   Sonia Sotomayor  Where is that in the cycle of performance?  Is that at the beginning of performance?   Sonia Sotomayor  So the tribes -- even when the appropriation comes out, they don't know how much the Department has contracted with other tribes.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, may I interrupt a moment on--   Sonia Sotomayor  --following up on an issue raised in part by the Chief and by Justice Ginsburg.  Assuming that Davis was a direct supervisor, would there be an affirmative defense available to the employer?   Sonia Sotomayor  That would be your position?   Sonia Sotomayor  That this could not be grounds that someone who directs an employee's day-to-day activity should be treated like someone who hasn't actually undertaken the threat because the situations are different.   Sonia Sotomayor  Is that what this fight is about?  What if we were to say that the EEOC's test governed or the Second Circuit test governed, but because of the nature of the difference between formal supervisors who take tangible work activities and informal supervisors who the employer would have less control over and less knowledge about their activities, that we would require an employee to complain.  Would that be a crazy rule, and why?   Sonia Sotomayor  Would require, would permit the affirmative defense to be raised by an employer.   Sonia Sotomayor  No, but there is a difference between those supervisors who take direct activity, tangible direct actions, who are in power to do that, and supervisors who don't have that power, because supervisors who don't have that power are supervised -- their actions are supervised in a way that non-tangible employment supervisors are not.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, it's whether, whether or not this whole fight is over that issue.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, because it's also about the burden of proof.   Sonia Sotomayor  So if we keep the burden of proof with respect to the employer raising the affirmative defense, does that solve half your problem?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Would you tell me what you see as the major difference between the EEOC and the Second Circuit rule, and why one is compelled over the other?  It's the regulatory agency charged with oversight of -- of the implementation of the statute.  Why shouldn't we give deference to it on--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --the standard it sets forth?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Do we have a developed record enough to do that in this case?   Sri Srinivasan  --I'm sorry?  I didn't hear you.   Sonia Sotomayor  Do -- do we have a developed record enough?  Petitioner's counsel says we don't, that the Seventh Circuit test didn't permit them to develop the record sufficiently to clarify all of these issues.  We certainly have snippets or -- or lack snippets, as the case may be.  But is the record sufficiently developed for the Court to even pronounce -- make pronouncements of that nature?   Sri Srinivasan  I think -- I think the real question, Justice Sotomayor, is whether the parties had a sufficient opportunity to develop the record.  Because if you take the record in the case as a given, we think that the record would support the grant of summary judgment for Ball State University, because there isn't a sufficient showing in the record if you take it as a given that the relevant supervisory -- the relevant putative supervisory employee, Davis, has control over day-to-day work activities.  The question that remains is whether the record should be allowed to be expanded.   Sonia Sotomayor  I think Justice Breyer's question was what's not in the record?   Sonia Sotomayor  Do you have something that's not in the record that will materially add to this discourse?   ",11-556X

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, all of our cases in this temporary versus permanent, as I read the cases and I read what the multiple facts that each are relying on, it seems to me that our cases have been attempting, in the term “ temporary ”, to encompass a lot of different concepts.  Both intentionality, because an accidental issue is not a taking; causation: Did this -- and that's part of Sanguinetti's holding -- did what the government do actually and directly cause the injury at issue?  And foreseeability: Is what you intended something whose consequences you could have seen?  And they are using that in a multifaceted test, one that the Solicitor General is not trying to endorse here, but one that I think is more consistent with our general jurisprudence in this area.  So there is never a simple answer on the question of permanent damage, because you can have permanent damage that's not a taking if all of the other factors I've just mentioned are not in your favor.  Is that correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  I guess the problem with this case, and it's part of what's interwoven in your adversary's arguments, is that with flooding it's going to occur naturally anyway.  The Government generally builds dams to control that flooding to the benefit of all of the interests along its affected route.  And at some point, either the Government is going to -- is going to make a decision that's going to help someone and potentially hurt someone.  And the question is, is in all of those situations going to be subject to litigation.  The Government's rule -- I call it the Government's rule, but it's -- is basically simple.  It can't.  Because, if the deviation is temporary -- and that's what the circuit below said -- it's just exercise.  It's either a nuisance or temporary trespass, and we're not going to hold the Government responsible for that loss.  Assuming it's going to occur in part because flooding is always going to occur, the question is perhaps when.  But in any place you have a dam, it's there because flooding was happening.  Isn't that the basic argument?  And I don't know that you've actually announced the rule that addresses the essence of the policy considerations that are driving the government decision.

You seem to be suggesting a difference between the two things, and I'm not sure where you get the latter, indefinitely moored, from, and how that ties to the concept of purpose.  Does it -- does the permanent status or indefinite mooring of a vessel not make it -- of a structure not make it a vessel, and/or does purpose get layered on top of mooring?

It happened not to because they would empty it, I understand, before they moved it, but it could have.  So if it was practically capable of floating, whether it was semi-tied to land or not, it was released from land on somewhat of a regular basis.

Sonia Sotomayor  I guess the problem is the list of absurdities that they point to, not the least of which is a dry dock, which you talk about whether it's permanently moored or not, but most dry docks are held in place by, you know, heavy ropes but you can cut them and you can stick something on them and they can float away.

Would that be okay?   Sonia Sotomayor  So there's no problem here with the representation.  Your problem is with the fair share?   Sonia Sotomayor  But what stops the non -- the people who oppose the union policy from sending a letter, asking a meeting, expressing their disapproval in any forum they want and in any way they want to whatever policy a union is advocating?  Is there anything that stops them from doing that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So where's the First Amendment abridgement?  They can do whatever they want.  They can speak however they want in support of or in opposition to absolutely anything the union is doing.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How about here for your employees?  They negotiate health insurance.  Do they -- they don't negotiate termination because that's up to the individual--   Sonia Sotomayor  --parties.  So there's no grievance committee.  Do they negotiate the tasks that will be reimbursed?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So you're being asked to have a fair share of how much you're getting from the State for your services and health insurance.  What else is negotiated that you're being asked to pay for?   Sonia Sotomayor  Why would anybody join the union under those circumstances or pay enough to support the union efforts?   INTERRUPTING ",11-681X

From your adversary's statement, it appears as if there's a belief that the Federal Government sets a fixed amount and that's what the State has to pay.  Whether the Federal Government pays you a certain amount, however, you seem to be saying the State can go above that amount if it chooses.  That's the cooperative nature of this.   ",11-681X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Rosenkranz, can I ask you, just -- it is a practical question, but I think it has theoretical impact.  A manufacturer can choose to contract or a copyright holder choose to contract with someone here to manufacture their goods.  They could contract with someone abroad, anywhere in the world, directly.  They can choose to license their trademark and permit a distributor abroad to manufacture under their U.S. copyright; or they can permit the licensee to register the copyright abroad and distribute.  In your definition of “ lawfully made under this title ”, does “ lawfully made under this title ” apply to all of those situations, i.e.--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I think clearly to the manufacturer who manufactures abroad--   Sonia Sotomayor  --clearly to the manufacturer who licensed a distributor to do it for it.  But does it also apply to the -- to the copyright owner who basically gives the copyright to a foreign distributor and lets the foreign distributor register it abroad?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That is -- that is broader than I thought.  And I'm not quite sure why you don't mean if this title applied.  Because if the--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --the manufacturer who is manufacturing under the English copyright, because the distributor has an English copyright, is not manufacturing under the U.S. copyright, they are manufacturing under the English copyright.

Sonia Sotomayor  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, do you suggest that the immigration judges don't know that, and that they wouldn't weigh that desire heavily in a case in which a -- the convicted individual is proven to have sold the larger amount?

If -- if Congress's intent was to bar discretion, then I'm not quite sure how you get to your alternative to get out of your--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --overinclusiveness argument.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, counselor.  I -- the Government can do it very easily.  If you have less than an ounce of marijuana and nothing else from which you can infer an intent to sell or distribute, and you have no proof that this individual's engaged in drug trafficking, what more does a defendant have to show?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How does it raise his burden of proof?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And I guess my point is that one, which is don't the facts that the Government have either show it or not show it in virtually every instance?   Sonia Sotomayor  It would be less than an ounce.   Sonia Sotomayor  Can I go back to your substantive argument?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  This is a -- you are right; it's an unusually crafted statute, and really what the issue is, generally what you have with lesser included offenses is you have a base offense and then an enhancement that goes up.  You commit the base offense--   Sonia Sotomayor  --of burglary, but if you did it with an explosive or you did it with a dangerous weapon, it goes up.   Sonia Sotomayor  And applying the categorical approach is relatively easy there because either the State offense includes the addition or it doesn't.  This is sort of in reverse.  You've got a statute with the same elements that can be either a misdemeanor or a felony, and you're saying it can be either under the CSA, but we have to assume it's the greater.  Because--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --of Apprendi, because of -- of--   Sonia Sotomayor  --But that's under Apprendi.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's a--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Didn't we -- didn't we talk about the categorical approach in footnote 3 of our case in Carachuri?   Sonia Sotomayor  Where we said that in talking about the generic Federal offense, whether it's a felony or not, that we can't look at just strictly the elements of the crime, but we have to also look at the sentencing factors, because when we're talking about what constitutes a misdemeanor or a felony under Federal law we have to look at both.   Sonia Sotomayor  But the same elements would go to the misdemeanor.  Really the issue for me is it could be one or both and when do we tell the immigration judge that he can, should, or should not--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --choose between the two?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  However you do it, the misdemeanor still has the same three elements.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So how do we choose between it being a misdemeanor or a felony?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, under the -- under the -- do you have the same answer as Mr. Goldstein, that the modified categorical approach wouldn't permit the immigration judge to look at the plea allocution to determine the amount?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So that in -- in many of these cases that we're talking about, it is possible that the plea allocution itself would set out the amounts that the alien sold or show that he sold something--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --and that would take care of this issue of how many people are escaping automatic removal.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Clement, section 5 says you can't draw new maps unless they have been precleared.  You can't put them into effect.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So the only thing that exists is old maps until you get the preclearance.  I don't see how we can give deference to an enacted new map, if section 5 says don't give it effect until its been precleared.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But you are asking for more than for guidance.  You are asking for deference.  You are saying they have to start with the new map even though that map hasn't been approved.   Sonia Sotomayor  Instead of starting, as the court below did, with the old map which had been approved.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Doesn't that turn section 5 on its head?   Sonia Sotomayor  What district is that?   Sonia Sotomayor  What district is that?   Sonia Sotomayor  But what's was the problem?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  That's incomplete.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I'm not sure how I understand that, okay?  As I looked at one of the El Paso maps, the enacted map created a antler-type district, a head and two unconnected antlers on top, nothing tying them together.  The district court went back to the benchmark and said: This is the benchmark district, now I'm going to draw the districts around it that fall naturally, trying to stay within neutral principles of not dividing up the city more than I have to, and it came out with another district.  I don't understand what principle, what legal principle, the district court was violating that makes what it did with that particular county wrong.  You're saying they should have given deference to an oddly-shaped district that changed a prior benchmark that's been challenged as having been created specifically to minimize the Latino vote.  All of the challenges that relate to El Paso are very significant.  The district court has already denied summary judgment on that.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, the two tests, yours seem to be the immediate vicinity test, and the Second Circuit is as soon as practical test.  Your adversaries point out that the Second Circuit test actually focuses on the police officer's conduct, which should be the focus of reasonableness or unreasonableness.  Your test just creates an artificial line that is subject to as much play as the other.  Why isn't the focus on police conduct the right focus?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, can I come back to the facts that my colleagues have raised and break it down implicating the Terry question?  Here, the officers had a report of something in the house, and they saw the defendant -- two people leaving.  I know Terry hasn't been decided, but why do you think -- just the stop, not the detention, not the bringing them back to the house, why do you think that just stopping them was wrong?   Sonia Sotomayor  Under Terry.   Sonia Sotomayor  But the court below did.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it goes back to if a police officer saw an individual leaving the house and was concerned about them tipping someone off, et cetera, what would be the problem with the officer stopping the person around the corner, holding them, making sure people got in and then letting them go.   Sonia Sotomayor  I thought your better answer was the risk of somebody coming back to a house exists whether the person just left it or left it an hour after or before or 2 hours or 24.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  When the police walk in, they always have to guard against reentry.   INTERRUPTING ",11-770X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Wall, would you answer -- direct your first response to that last issue because, as I read your brief, you seem not to be accepting the Second Circuit's rule at all.  You seem to be proposing what appears to me to be a much broader rule that says -- at one point in your brief you state that it is the occupant's observed connection to a home subject to a valid warrant, not his physical location at the time that he is detained, that makes him subject to detention.  Now, I know police when they're executing warrants often have an advance team that has been surveilling a home, sometimes for days.  And they've got one officer sitting there, and they see who they think is the occupant leave, and the team doesn't arrive till 12 hours later.  Is it your position that in that circumstance the officers are authorized to go to wherever the defend -- wherever the occupant is, the office, the -- wherever he might be, his mother's home, and effect an arrest there?   Sonia Sotomayor  You're missing the point, which is that's going to happen regardless, meaning that risk exists whether the person left the minute you got there or a minute before or an hour before or two hours before.  That's the whole point, which is the risk is extant no matter what.   Sonia Sotomayor  But you didn't know -- you don't know that in any search, meaning any time you do a search you have no idea when the -- whether the occupant -- sometimes you know whether the occupant is inside.  You'll hear the TV or something else.  But often you don't, and you don't know if someone will come back and when.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why is seeing someone leaving increasing that risk?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Can you tell me what constitutional right entitles you to stop someone from, using the word, “ fleeing ”?  You certainly are entitled to stop someone with whom you have reasonable suspicion.  But what constitutional right entitles you to stop a person who's just leaving in the normal act, without reasonable suspicion?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, the problem with absolute rules like we did in Summers is that they're an exception, and they're absolute.  Go back to the question you were asked by one of my colleagues earlier, why wouldn't Terry give you all of the rights that you're seeking on the absolute rule, but subject your police conduct to the question of reasonableness, which is the normal standard of the Fourth Amendment?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm -- I'm litigating for you.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So I could very easily imagine that what the fight's going to be like below is, we stopped them because we saw them coming out of the house, and all we want to do is make sure that they don't return.  So we're just going to hold them in place.  We don't have to drag them in a car back to a place they just left.  We're just going to stop them in place to get a phone call that everything's all clear.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, we don't know, but why don't we let that develop.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, my -- I remain with my question, which is, we have a circumstance-driven power of Terry.  Your power is really going much more broadly, because you're basically saying if that -- if probable cause exists to search a premise, it exists without being tied to an individual because anybody who leaves the house, whether or not they have been tied to a crime in that house in the past or not, is now subject to being detained.  So we have evidence that only a husband is involved in a fraud, and his wife is leaving for work.  Because she was observed leaving the house, she can now be stopped a mile away.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So your -- your view is that Summers gave you -- entitled you to hold people merely for purposes of investigation--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --without any reasonable suspicion?  That's really what your rule is saying.   ",11-770X

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Can I break down your arguments into two components, if you might?  Whether or not the market participant exception exists at all; and if it does, how far does it go?  So, let's get to the first question in my mind.  Seems almost impossible for me to believe that the States couldn't require someone to put a little placard like you get at the -- at almost any building that you go into to park your car.  They ask you to put a little placard in the front of your window so they know who you are and where you're going in the Port, okay?  Why is the placard requirement here any different than that requirement generally?  Because if you enter property, you have -- most people tell you put a placard in the window to tell us you got permission to come in.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But even if that, if we didn't have a market participant, why couldn't the State say: When you come into the terminal, you just got to put a little placard in so we know that you're not parking here overnight when you've already been unloaded or something else?   Sonia Sotomayor  Could the terminal say, we have a pollution problem and only modern trucks can come and unload here?   Sonia Sotomayor  So they have to take trucks that are too heavy for this crane to lift?   Sonia Sotomayor  Except in Boston Harbor, we said that there was a presumption in favor of it unless Congress explicitly indicated to the contrary.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Do we need to get into the market exception if we find that this is -- has the force or effect of law rather than being a private contract?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's one or the other -- or both, but we could choose.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Do you think the city could pass a regulation like as Justice Breyer suggested, that says, stay off residential streets?   Sonia Sotomayor  So you -- do you think that a statute that says if you're trucking company operator and you have three violations of X safety regulations, you just can't use our highways because we don't trust you, is that okay?   Sonia Sotomayor  Why?  Why isn't it a standard fact that States and cities use to stop people from repetitive violations to tell them, if you keep doing this and don't remedy what you've done, we're just not going to let you do X, Y, and Z?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I just wanted to make sure.  What you're saying is if trucks park anywhere else, then the operator's in violation of the agreement.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  With respect to the placard, as I read the provision it says you have to have the placard coming in and going out.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Garre--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I thought all of these training facilities were private entities that contracted with police departments.   Sonia Sotomayor  Could I go back to Justice Ginsburg's question?  There's no -- what I hear -- read the Florida court saying is there's no national standard for certification.  That's correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  There's no national standard that defines what's adequate training, correct.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So -- let me just finish my question.  So assuming there's no national standards, then how do you expect a judge, without asking questions about the content of the certification process, the content of the training process, and what the results were and how they were measured, how do you expect a judge to decide whether the certification and the training are sufficiently adequate.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But you still have to ask what that training was, and the judge still has to determine whether the judge believes it was adequate, correct?  That's what the totality of circumstances requires.   Sonia Sotomayor  So what does a judge do, just say, the police department says this is adequate, so I have to accept it's adequate.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Garre, I -- I have no problem that this record -- with this record.  My problem is how do we rule.  Because it seems the me that I'm not quite understanding what -- how -- the legal rule you're asking us to announce.  I think the legal rule, you're saying, if the dog has been tested for proficiency by a police department's determination of what's adequate for proficiency, that establishes probable cause.  That's what I think the rule you want us to -- to do.  I don't know what the role of the judge is in that--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --with that rule.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No certification, no questioning of the handler and the handler's training?  The judge can't do any of that and shouldn't do any of that, is what you're saying.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So it's not enough for you to win by us saying that a court can't insist on performance in the field records, that it has to look at the totality of the circumstances.  What other case have -- have we announced, under a totality of the circumstance test, a absolute flat rule like the one you're proposing?  Where else have we said that one thing alone establishes probable cause--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --that one factor alone.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I'm somewhat troubled by all of the studies that have been presented to the Court, particularly the Australian one where, under a controlled setting, one dog alerted correctly only 12 percent of the time.  How and when and who determines when a dog's reliability in alerting has reached a critical failure number?  And what is -- what do you suggest that number is, and how does a judge determine that that's being monitored?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I'm deeply troubled by a dog that alerts only 12 percent of the time.  That whatever -- whether we have a fixed number or an unfixed number, that seems like less than probability for me.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That doesn't answer what happens to the dogs who have -- dogs grow old.  They are taken out of service for a reason.  So how -- how is a court supposed to monitor whether or not a dog has fallen out of--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, I have two separate questions for you.  Tying the earlier case a little bit to this one, I am assuming that your position is -- and you'll tell me what the legal standard is -- that a well-trained dog, if he alerts, or walks by a row of apartments, a row of houses, and alerts the drugs, that that simple alert is probable cause for the police to get a search warrant.   Sonia Sotomayor  So that, without any other information about -- unlike the earlier case or this one, where the police officer saw the individual being nervous, et cetera, et cetera -- that all -- all it takes is a dog alert, despite the fact that there is no study that says the dogs reliably alert 100 percent of the time?   Sonia Sotomayor  No, I -- I understand.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So -- so shouldn't we be addressing the question whether a -- an alert, especially outside a home in particular, should be, standing by itself, enough?

What -- why wouldn't the training records here be adequate in that circumstance?   Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I guess what I'm asking you is, as a matter of law you want us to hold that training records are inadequate unless what?  Unless -- you're going to specify now a list of things they have to include?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, how is that any different than a police officer who comes to a car and smells marijuana?  He's never going to know whether there is any more in the car or not.  It could have been smoked up an hour before.  I don't know how long marijuana lingers for, but -- I'm not sure why residual odor affects the reliability of the dog, which was Justice Scalia's point.

And isn't that at bottom line a judgment that it's reliable and probative?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you are not disagreeing with your adversary on a legal standard.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So explain to me, other than your reliance on Ice, some sort of tradition, which, you know, we can debate whether you can draw any conclusion from tradition in any of these areas, whether it's imprisonment or fines.  Tell me on the logic of Apprendi, not using Ice, why fines are different, without relying on history which to me is -- I view it as ambiguous, okay?

Sonia Sotomayor  You know, this language is very reminiscent in what's in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20, the joinder rule.

As I look at the captions of the cases, there appear to be two different partnerships: One partnership known as Raisin -- doing business as Raisin Valley Farms -- has Mr. Horne and his wife as the partners.  Lassen Valley, the producer -- not the producer, the handler -- has four other: The Hornes plus two other people.  So who owns the raisins?  Isn't that the first partnership of the husband and wife?  And isn't the handler a second partnership that does the business of handling?   Sonia Sotomayor  But the estates have been substituted.   Sonia Sotomayor  So isn't it two legal entities, one who owns and one who handles?  One partnership produces, one partnership handles?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I don't care if they did or they didn't.  I mean, we should know.  Are they two separate legal entities?  One who produces--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Well, that's -- you know, in the cat -- you get some limited liability by creating separate entities, so the creature who owns is one partnership, and the -- and the entity that produces, that handles, is a second one.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it does to my mind, because what is the claim, assuming that the producer owns -- the producer entity owns the raisins.  What exactly is being taken from the handlers?  Is it the percentage -- it can't be the raisins because they don't own them.   Sonia Sotomayor  What -- what do they own?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What is it that's being taken from the handler entity?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So go back.  What is the -- what was taken from them -- you're saying it's just the fine, that the fine is a taking or -- what was the interest that they're claiming was taken by the government?  They didn't own the raisins, so they get paid a fee for handling.   Sonia Sotomayor  But the problem is that they weren't entitled to that money, meaning they had to pay it over to the producer.  The producer was going to pay them a handling fee, but that money didn't belong to them.  It belonged to the producers who supplied them with the raisins and expected payment for them--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --if they were sold in the ordinary course.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  In the Horne model, the handlers buy, buy the free raisins and then pay the producers, is that what it--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Oh.  So that's the difference in this model; they don't take title to the raisins is what you're saying?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  Let me -- let me--   Sonia Sotomayor  --What is -- what is the value in permitting a party who doesn't own property to raise a taking claim on behalf of other people?  Meaning, doesn't the system have an interest in ensuring that people comply with their legal obligations, and to the extent that you choose to violate the law the way they have here, that the fine is punitive and not compensatory.  Meaning you don't own the raisins, but you were obligated to put raisins aside for someone else.  You were their agent and you failed to meet a Government obligation that was independently on you.   Sonia Sotomayor  So I go back to my question: What was the taking?  Since you didn't own the raisins, the taking is the fine is what you want to call the taking.   Sonia Sotomayor  But they're not your raisins.   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. McConnell, in -- in -- if the producers had decided to challenge this as a Tucker Act violation, they would have had to hand over the raisins?  Or could they have just held on to the raisins and said, I'm not handing it over until I get just compensation?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.

It's not the sort of situation where as reasonable -- as due diligence will do, which is to override even an actually innocent person.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What he says is it -- it really puts into question the validity of your claim.   Sonia Sotomayor  Where does that leave us?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Let's assume--   Sonia Sotomayor  --It's sort of an advisory opinion in your judgment.   Sonia Sotomayor  Sure, it would be, because you're telling us that there is no proof of actual innocence.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why don't we just say that?   Sonia Sotomayor  It might be its holding, but, as Justice Alito just proved, there's no basis for it because they didn't grant a COA on the substantive merits question.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  With respect to successive petitions.   Sonia Sotomayor  You don't see a difference--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I'm sorry.  I don't understand.  I mean, there is a presumption that's been longstanding that at least with respect to the filing of your first petition, that it is a statute of limitations subject to exceptions, including the manifest injustice one.  If -- it would seem to me that if they intended not to have that apply, they would have done what they did with the successive petition, but they chose not to.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm not talking about that presumption.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm talking about--   Sonia Sotomayor  --our cause and effect and manifest injustice.   Sonia Sotomayor  Do you have any idea how many actual-innocence claims win on the underlying constitutional issue?   Sonia Sotomayor  How many wins on the attempt?

So do we write it by saying there's no diligence requirement, but there is a sort of common law laches, although that's a hard argument to make because it was based on 9(A) until recently.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Why not?   Sonia Sotomayor  What would happen, under the reasoning of this case, what would happen to the decisions of recess-appointed judges?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Of which there's been quite a few.   Sonia Sotomayor  Is that 3 days?   Sonia Sotomayor  But why?  You're making an assumption, which is that the Senate has to take a recess.  But the Senate could choose, if it wanted to, and I think there might be some citizens that would encourage it to, to never recess.   Sonia Sotomayor  And -- and to work every day, which--   Sonia Sotomayor  --lots of people do.   Sonia Sotomayor  So--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --If it means the same thing, then you are tying the two together, which actually might have some validity.  But wouldn't that require the definition of a recess to be a period in which both houses have chosen to consent to an adjournment?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Can you have an adjournment without a suspension of business?  Aren't the two the same?   Sonia Sotomayor  But I'm talking about tying the two together.   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Estrada--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Mr. Estrada, in your earlier example, you said that if the Senate decides to recess and the House doesn't approve, that the president can then do it.  Is it your belief that a recess is only something that both Houses have agreed to?  A break in business that both Houses have agreed to?     I don't think so.  It is usually the case, Justice Sotomayor, but not necessarily.  The example I would give--   Sonia Sotomayor  So what do you need -- why does the president have to adjourn the House in your example?     --No, I don't--   Sonia Sotomayor  If the Senate votes tomorrow to recess--     --Yes.   Sonia Sotomayor  --can the president appoint, at least in your view, any vacancy that occurs during that recess?     If the Senate has been recessed without days so that the session of the Senate is over, even if the president, under Article II, chooses to leave the House in session--   Sonia Sotomayor  Why do you need a date?  What -- what -- in what rule makes a recess defined as something without date?     --This takes us back to the first argument, and I think the contemplation was that the recess would be the period of time that intervened between the ending of a session of the Congress and the beginning of the next.  Here--   Sonia Sotomayor  It always had a date, because we knew January 3rd was a new session.     --Well, that wasn't true until the 20th Amendment.  You know, the date was a much different date in the original Constitution.  But to answer your earlier question, it is usually the case that a recess is going to be longer than 3 days, but it needn't be.  If the Senate finished all of its legislative business, for example, in this year on December 30, 2011, and then voted to adjourn sine die, and did not again meet until the beginning of the second session of the Congress on January 3rd, that would be an intra-session recess even though it would not be one that would require consent of the House.  But in the usual case in which a recess is taken for an extended period of time, it would be the type of break that the Framers contemplated would need the consent of the House.  And the reason for that should be obvious.  We have a system of a bicameral legislation.  The houses two are supposed to work together to accomplish the business of the people.  If the House is working on something and the Senate wants to go away, or visa-versa, they need the consent of each other because they may need each other to frame out ongoing legislative projects.  And if the House in its own judgment thinks that the Senate is sufficiently available to the House in our bicameral system so that it -- so that has been is full compliance with the Adjournments Clause, it is very difficult to see how in the agreement of both houses of Congress that the Senate is in fact effectively available, that is there with its full power of unanimous consent every third day.  If the House thinks that that is adequate for the discharge of its constitutional functions and the constitutional functions of the Senate, it's very difficult to see how the president gets to second-guess that.  One final point that has to do with the Solicitor General's insistence on the no-business language.  Rules 5.1 of the Senate -- may I finish?   ",12-1281

Sonia Sotomayor  Could you -- could you tell -- let's go back to this.  What's your definition of a recess?  When the Senate actually says we're taking a recess--   Sonia Sotomayor  --whether it got the consent of the House or not?   Sonia Sotomayor  Does it have to do that?

And by that, I mean you have -- this is the government's position, and maybe I'm arguing for it.  The government says you might be entitled to payment for the use of your copyright because it belongs to you and there shouldn't be some adverse possession right that the other side gets.  But in terms of injunctive relief, given their reliance on your failure to act for 18 years, they shouldn't be put out of business and told that they can't continue in their business.  And so that's the kind of policy I'm talking about, which is break down the remedies and tell me -- I'm more moved by the fact that someone could take over your copyright then I am by your injunctive relief argument.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Then you're after -- I've looked at that, not myself, but my law clerk, looked at all of the cases and they are absolutely right that in every case we've applied laches, it's only where there's not been an underlying statute of limitations.  And in every case in which there's an underlying statute of limitations, we have said no laches.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  They lost there.   Sonia Sotomayor  They didn't apply laches there.   Sonia Sotomayor  But the facts didn't support that, meaning that they didn't grant such.   Sonia Sotomayor  It is true, however, that your -- while your -- all of your investment in this is going to be offset against your profits, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What's so bad about that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why should you -- you've gotten a lot of profits in those 18 years and, in fact, at one point when she did reach out to you, you told her,  ""Why sue? ""  ""You're not going to get any money. ""  ""We're not making any. ""   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, if it has not, then we're back to the point I made.  Are you disagreeing with the Government's position that the Court has equitable power in injunctive relief to decide how much you paid forward?   Sonia Sotomayor  I don't understand.  Why didn't you just go in and get a declaratory judgment when you first heard from her?   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, she was going to get this copyright when her father died.  Under no circumstance, even if she had sued in '92, could she have brought a claim in the 1960s.  She didn't have a copyright then.   Sonia Sotomayor  Your complaint is not against the witness dying.  Your complaint is about what Congress does, which is to give a person the right to keep a copyright or renew it when the individual with whom you probably dealt with is dead.

And -- but here there is no dispute about that because you are right, your adversary submitted this question to arbitration.  And that's what I'm hearing you respond.  He did, there's no question, he said the arbitrator has to decide this issue.  Justice Breyer raised the second question: Assuming he could, is there any remaining power in the Court to overturn his decision?  And Justice Breyer said, If the standard is manifest disregard of fact and law, why would you still win?  Because your adversary is saying: The law is clear you have to find some hook in the agreement to agree to class action -- arbitration.  And he says there is none.

Sonia Sotomayor  Johnson relied on a number of things, but the two were the use of felony and the use of the word ‶ violent force ″, which is not what this statute does.

They proposed the ballot initiative because it was their individual views, not necessarily that of the State.  So--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Justice Scalia proffered the question of the Attorney General.  The Attorney General has no personal interest.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  You're creating a sui generis structural error analysis.  You're basically -- because even with respect to constitutional violations that we have found structural error in, we've created the plain error rule that still requires a proof of prejudice.  So you're asking us to create something that's really sui generis in saying it's always a structural error.   Sonia Sotomayor  Assume I accept that argument.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You're -- you're saying this is a structural error always.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Yablon, I agree with you totally.  I'm not as much convinced in the delay in pleading because defendants often think about it and I can imagine a hypothetical where the lawyer comes in and says: I told him to plead guilty and he said to me: I don't want to, but the judge told me to.  So I don't think the time limit -- we don't know if that happened.  But what did happen is that the defendant made a motion to withdraw his plea and he directly said:  ""I entered the plea because I strategically decided that the government would eventually have to come forward and vacate the charges against me. ""  He said it himself with no pressure by a lawyer, because he was making the motion.  How do you get past that statement?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that is the whole point, which is this may be IAC, but I don't know how -- how you prove that what the magistrate judge said to him led to his decision.

And here the arrest was in April and the results didn't come up until August.   Sonia Sotomayor  And yet, he was detained anyway, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  And -- and there might be a case where someone's gotten out, but it would be the rare case.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You don't use it routinely for the bail determination.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it doesn't include the time to collect the sample, send it to you or the time to do the match.  It's just to do the genome rapid, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So now, I see two lines of cases, okay?  The Fourth Amendment, which says you can't do a search without a warrant and probable cause.  And Samson.  And most of your brief argument was based on Samson.  As I read Samson, it was the special relationship between the parolee or the probationary person, that line of cases, and the assumption being that they're out in the world, I think, by the largesse of the State.  So a State has a right to search their home just as it would their cell essentially.  Why is that true for an arrestee?  What about -- what creates this special relationship that permits you to intrude, search their home, search their car, search their person, to solve other cases?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Because you're going to have to tell me why searching their person is different than searching their home or car.   Sonia Sotomayor  There's no other case but Samson in that line that permits searches on this balancing.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what I want to know is what's the legal theory now?  How far do we let the State go each time it has some form of custody over you in schools, in workplaces, wherever else the State has control over your person?   Sonia Sotomayor  That doesn't explain why you can't go into his home.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I mean, you know, if the whole issue is how dangerous is he, you should be able to go into his home, into his car, to any place he has visited, to just sort of run rampant in his life to make sure that he is not a bail risk.

But I understand the Government to be conceding that this statute of limitations is not jurisdictional.  It's just a claim processing item.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm totally confused.  Are you suggesting that the record shouldn't be filed in that case or that the record supports the conclusion that it was untimely?  Or neither?   Sonia Sotomayor  Excuse me.  Could you -- could you -- there seems to be a confusion in this consequence conversation.  You seem to be assuming that the attorneys' fee award on good faith basis has to do with the ultimate merits, did the vaccine cause this injury.  I would have assumed that the award of attorneys' fees has to do with whether the petition was brought in good faith; i.e., was there a reasonable basis to believe that the petition was timely.  And on that issue, before the Court can adjudicate the timeliness question, it has to know all of the facts that made the petitioner believe it was timely.  And so I'm a little bit confused as to what additional factfinding the Court has to do.  It has to be told by a lawyer, your cases say because reasonable basis has to be in fact and law.  The law says first symptom.  She experienced X, Y, and Z, and we thought the latter was the starting point of the statute, not the former.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Fisher, my -- I have a number of problems.  The first is your rule would be seen to be giving noncustodial defendants more rights than those defendants in custody, because you're arguing that -- I think -- that a greater degree of expression other than silence would be needed to show the invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Or are you trying to equate the rights that a defendant has to custodial and noncustodial with respect to invocation?   Sonia Sotomayor  The problem -- I have an easier problem understanding this argument with respect -- and I'm going to ask your adversaries -- with respect to the situation in which someone is approached by the police and said, come in and talk to us.  I have a hard time understanding how the refusal to come talk to them could be held against them.  There I understand it.  But here, your defendant went in and talked.  So once he chose to do that, why does he get more rights than Berghuis did, who remained silent for 2-1/2 hours?  The Court wasn't willing to find that that was an invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination.  Why would it find the refusal to ask one -- answer one question indicative of the privilege against silence -- or the privilege for silence?   Sonia Sotomayor  How would you deal with another comment situation where a defendant meets up with the police, gives a story, and then later changes the story.  And the question is asked at trial, you never volunteered that story to the police when they questioned you.  Would that be silence, to you?  Would that be an invocation of his right not to incriminate himself, or would you -- would the prosecutor be barred from arguing to the jury, as often is done, he chose to say this but not that, so this is a made-up story.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Though sometimes they come back and later do a different confession.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I'm assuming, now that I'm thinking about your argument, you would argue that even in a custodial setting a prosecutor couldn't say, I asked him did he shoot his wife, and the prosecutor can't argue that because he refused to answer that makes him guilty.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, in fact, at most trials, district court judges tell juries the evidence is not the unanswered question, it's the question plus the answer.   Sonia Sotomayor  I guess, as I understand your rule -- I'm sorry.  I'll ask it on rebuttal.   ",12-246X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  But why, counsel?  I mean, really what you're saying is, merely because I asked you the question and you choose not to answer it makes you guilty.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It -- no problem.  Here you're asking about the crime of investigation.  But you could have asked him, did you kill Joe Blow on another street, and if he had remained silent you would be arguing that proves he is guilty, I could introduce that at trial.  And you would be arguing it would be sufficient to convict him; that you merely asked the question and he remained silent about it shows his guilty.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's a little scary to me that an unanswered question is evidence of guilt.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  He is not arguing that the physical response is not admissible.  He is just arguing that the mere asking of a question and a failure to answer it, you can't argue as a prosecutor that that shows someone is guilty.   Sonia Sotomayor  Your -- my hypothetical that I posed earlier, if the police call you and say come in for questioning and you ignore them, is that an invocation of the right to silence or not?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why could you argue that that's--   Sonia Sotomayor  --They -- they're arguing what the legal theory of guilt is in that situation.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So why is it -- would it be admissible that someone decides -- someone comes in and they say, police say to him or her we are investigating this crime, help us.  They start asking questions and it's clear from the first question -- there is a waiver of Miranda and from the first question, the first question is, did you kill this person?  The guy remains silent, they ask a whole bunch of other questions and he remains silent.  Has he invoked his right?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So a prosecutor could go into the jury and say he waived his Miranda rights and he is guilty because he refused to answer our questions?   Sonia Sotomayor  Where does the compulsion line come in?  Your adversary points out that under this scenario, the police could ask you questions and say to you, you know, if you stay quiet in this question, I'm going to use it against you at trial.  That police will actually to that.  That they'll actually come in and tell defendants who are telling the story, you know, either answer or it'll be used against you.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why can't you say that a call from a police officer to someone who says come in and talk, that that can't be used against them at trial as -- you gave me a different answer.  You said it wasn't probative.  But you didn't say Griffin would protect that.   Sonia Sotomayor  That is such a radical position, that silence is an admission of guilty.  That's really what the argument is.  I certainly understand that speaking can implicate you, and if you choose to speak, clearly whatever you say can be used against you unless you're in custody and unless you've invoke the right before.  But this is radically different.  We are -- we are -- you're trying to say acts of commission and omission are the same, but statements are different than silence, because then you're making the person who is asking the question your -- your admission.  You are saying you're adopting their statement as true.   ",12-246X

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, then, why shouldn't -- why shouldn't taxpayers have a right to come in?  And we say they don't.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Can you tell me where the authorization is here?  I know that there is a statute that gives the Senate specifically authorization to intervene and that there was consideration of extending that right to the House.  But the appointment of BLAG is strange to me, because it's not in a statute, it's in a House rule.  So where -- how does that constitute anything other than a private agreement among some Senators, the House leadership?  And where -- from where do they derive the right, the statutory right, to take on the power of representing the House in items outside of the House?  I know they control the procedures within the House, but that's a very different step from saying that they can decide who or to create standing in some way, prudential or otherwise, Article III or otherwise.   Sonia Sotomayor  What other House Rule creates the power of the majority leaders to represent the House outside of the functions of the House?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  This would be, I think, sort of unheard of, that--   Sonia Sotomayor  --We don't even have a vote here.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But only if the State recognizes it.   Sonia Sotomayor  And so there is a common law, Federal common law definition?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I thought it was reverse, that if the State law recognized common law marriages, the Federal law--   Sonia Sotomayor  --But that's begging the question, because you are treating the married couples differently.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You are saying that New York's married couples are different than Nebraska's.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I picked that out of a hat.  But the point is that there is a difference.   Sonia Sotomayor  But what gives the Federal Government the right to be concerned at all at what the definition of marriage is?  Sort of going in a circle.  You're saying -- you're saying, we can create this special category -- men and women -- because the States have an interest in traditional marriage that they're trying to protect.  How do you get the Federal Government to have the right to create categories of that type based on an interest that's not there, but based on an interest that belongs to the States?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So they can create a class they don't like -- here, homosexuals -- or a class that they consider is suspect in the marriage category, and they can create that class and decide benefits on that basis when they themselves have no interest in the actual institution of marriage as marriage.  The State's control that.

You think, I think from your brief yesterday and today, that on some level sexual orientation should be looked on an intermediate standard of scrutiny?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right, heightened in some way.  Going back to the Chief's question about a law that was passed recognizing common law heterosexual -- homosexual marriages.  I think even under your theory that might be suspect because -- that law might be suspect under equal protection, because once we say sexual orientation is suspect, it would be suspect whether it's homosexual or heterosexual.  The law favors homosexuals; it would be suspect because it's based on sexual orientation.   Sonia Sotomayor  Exactly.  And so when we decided race was a suspect class, people who are not blacks have received--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --strict scrutiny on whether the use of race as a class, whether they are white or a black, is justified by a compelling interest.   Sonia Sotomayor  General, your bottom line is, it's an equal protection violation for the Federal Government, and all States as well?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Is there any argument you can make to limit this to this case, vis-à-vis the Federal Government and not the States?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Now, the -- the discriminations are not the sexual orientation, but on a class of marriage; is that what you're--   Sonia Sotomayor  --So I pose the same question I posed to the General to you.

The isolation itself is not valuable; it's the use you put the isolation to.  That's the answer, isn't it?   Sonia Sotomayor  And so, that is the answer, which is in isolation it has no value.  It's just nature sitting there.   Sonia Sotomayor  That's a failure of the patent law.  It doesn't patent ideas.   Sonia Sotomayor  Can we go to -- can we go to cDNA a moment?   Sonia Sotomayor  That is artificially created in the laboratory, so it's not bound in nature.  It's not taking a gene and snipping something that's in nature.  And yet you claim that can't be patented.  The introns are taken out, the exons are left in, and they're sequenced together.  Give me your brief argument on that.  I read your brief, but it is not a product of nature; it's a product of human invention.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that goes to obviousness.  That does not in my mind go to the issue of whether it's patent eligible.  You may have a very strong argument on obviousness, but why does it not -- it's creating something that's not found in nature at all.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's a separate question--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --about whether this claim is too expansive because it's claiming every 15 nucleotides and nature produces 15 randomly.  But assuming the claim was for the entire mutated gene and not the small snippet that they want to capture the whole gene with, that's -- that whole gene without the introns is just not found in nature.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Are we fighting over nothing?  Are you fighting over nothing?  If -- if they can patent this cDNA in the way they have, what does it matter, since it appears as if research has to rely on the cDNA to be effective?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --I actually think that -- I think we're -- we're fighting about something of importance.  That question gets right to it.  I want to answer the question directly, Your Honor.  I'd like to make a prefatory point before doing so.  The claim that isolated DNA is a human invention rests entirely on the fact that it is no longer connected at the molecular level to what surrounded it in the body.  But allowing a patent on that basis would effectively preempt anyone else from using the gene itself for any medical or scientific purpose.  That is not true about a patent on cDNA.  A patent on cDNA leaves the isolated DNA available for other scientists and other -- and others in the medical profession to try to generate new uses.   Sonia Sotomayor  I understand--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I understand why you are saying cDNA is patentable as a subject matter.  I am looking at the way the claim is phrased, however, and it says that it's patenting a DNA segment 15 nucleotides long or longer.  The reality is that 15 nucleotides doesn't necessarily bridge a sequence that goes between exons.  It -- it can -- one exon can be 15 or more sequences long.  So are you arguing that this claim as written is sustainable?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --Your Honor, as a -- I am going to invoke my privilege as an amicus in this situation.  I think that's a fight between the parties.  The point that we wanted to make is that as a conceptual matter cDNA is patent eligible.   Sonia Sotomayor  So you are not taking the position that this claim as written is patentable?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  That's right, Your Honor.  We're just saying as a conceptual matter that we think cDNA is a creation of the lab, it's an artificial creation; it's as a general matter patent eligible.   Sonia Sotomayor  Because as I understand it, 15 nucleotides long exists naturally in nature.  They get reproduced in that sequence of 15.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  That -- that may well be right, Your Honor.  As I said, we're not taking a position on the particulars.  But if I -- just to return to the point that Justice Alito made, the Court really was faced with a similar situation in Mayo.  On the one side you had the -- the industry coming in and saying: Look, we have got a lot of reliance issue, PTO has issued more than 150,000 patents here.  You are going to really disrupt those reliance issues.  On the other side you had the American Medical Association, as you have here, coming in and saying: Actually, these patents inhibit much more innovation than they incent.  And what the Court said is that -- as Justice Kennedy alluded to earlier, that the Court's not in a position to resolve that dispute conclusively.  It doesn't have the institutional wherewithal to do it.  But what the Court is in a position to do is to apply the general principles of law as they were articulated in Mayo, and then if there needs to be a particular different set of rules for the biotech industry, Congress can provide that different set of rules.   Sonia Sotomayor  Is there some value to us striking down isolated DNA and upholding the cDNA?  If we were to do what the Government is proposing in this case, what's the consequences?   Sonia Sotomayor  Now, how do you understand Judge Bryson's dissent with respect to cDNA?  I think he's saying that a gene created from -- into cDNA as a whole is okay, but that he had a problem with the description of that claim because it included 15 nucleotide long segments or fragments which he says reoccur in nature.   Sonia Sotomayor  Now, I'm making your job harder.  How could they write it to do what he thinks would be patentable?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So assuming we believe that there is some human invention in this process; whether it's obvious or not, separate question.  But he's not creating -- the cDNA is not in nature naturally.  So make that assumption.  Make the assumption that they can make a claim for it.  How do we avoid his problem?

The State can come and take the child away from an unfit mother or father if they're the ones with custody, and that responsible parent who only has visiting rights has no protections under (d), (e), or (f)?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm not asking about State law--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --I'm asking about Federal law.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, (d) doesn't talk about custodial rights.  I do agree that (f) talks about continued--   Sonia Sotomayor  --custody.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, you don't think that a parent with custody -- well, you do think a parent with custody is the only definition of family, but why wouldn't a noncustodial parent with visitation rights be considered a family with that child?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm not going to State law--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Well, there is a support obligation on that unwed father.   Sonia Sotomayor  Why isn't that a parental right?  It's one of the parental rights the States enforce whether or not you want to provide support or not.   Sonia Sotomayor  So what do you do with the States that do give unwed fathers that don't support their children and who don't have an ongoing relationship the right to be considered first for adoption?  Why should we follow the definitions of South Carolina or those other States?  Why shouldn't we just give it a Federal meaning?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  As--   Sonia Sotomayor  --What's the difference with a sperm donor?  I mean, I know that you raise that in your brief.  But, going back to Justice Scalia's point, if the choice is between a mother, a biological father, or a stranger, and if the father's fit, why do you think that the Federal statute requires that it be given to a stranger rather than to the biological father when the statute defines “ parent ” as the biological father?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, this Act, in terms of voluntary surrender of Indian children by parents, says that it's not final for an adoptive parent until the court does the adoption decree.  It gives the mother the right -- or father -- to rescind the voluntary adoption till the very last minute.  Has that stopped voluntary adoptions?   ",12-399X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  What do you do with the lower court's determination that one of the factors of the best interest calculus was the Federal policy to ensure that Indian children, children of biological Indian parents, at least one, should be raised with their parents?  Because the lower court said it thought it was in the best interest of this child to stay with its birth father in light of the Federal policy.  So I disagree with your colleague that there wasn't a best interest--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --What do I do with the lower court's finding that this father, despite not being married to his prior lover, had children, was attentive of those children, had the resources to raise the child?  What do we with -- why are you--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --But they looked at something else that everybody's ignoring--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Mr. Clement, can I go back to that best interest calculus.  There's two timeframes in my mind to look at: In January, when he asserted his parental rights and 2 years later when the trial was heard.  If there's serious emotional harm, I think the court below said: We're not looking at what happens at the time we're deciding the custody issue, because otherwise, we're going to give custody by estoppel.  We're going to encourage people to hold on to kids and create the serious physical harm.  In January, when he asserted his rights, that's what we're looking at.  What was in the best interests of the child at the time the issue was raised, and that was 4 or 5 months after the birth of the child.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So we're going to freeze it at that point or are we going to freeze it today, after the child's been with his -- with her father for 2 years?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I don't want to be that judge, by the way.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Tell me why you are fighting Justice Breyer?  He said: I see -- and your -- Mr. Clement said the same thing -- that “ good cause ” under 1958 is a variant of best interests of the child or factors that are considered.  I see (f) as doing the same thing, allotting however a burden of proof that may or may not be higher than other States.  I mean, in -- in -- some States may have clear and convincing evidence, some States may have preponderance.  Some States -- I don't know if any have beyond a reasonable doubt.  But it's an allocation of burden.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You might just have to take--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Counsel, there are two forms of the EIFD doctrine, the existing Indian family doctrine.  One applies directly to this case; what's the status of an unwed father, and they seem, under that doctrine, to apply the definition that a parent who hasn't been involved in the care during pregnancy is not a father.  But the other side of the doctrine is the one that addresses, I think, the Chief's concern, which is you don't only have Indian blood, but you've been a father who's actually been a member of an Indian tribe, an active member.  We don't have to reach that separate issue here, that EIFD -- that part of the EIFD doctrine.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I don't disagree.   INTERRUPTING ",12-399X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Stewart, can we go back to Justice Breyer's question, initial question.  It's rare that we find a per se antitrust violation.  Most situations we put it into rule of reason.  You seem to be arguing that this is price fixing, a reverse payment like price fixing so that it has to fall into something greater than the rule of reason.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But why is the rule of reason so bad?  As an -- and that's really my bottom line, because you're creating all -- I think that's what Justice Breyer was saying.  I mean, for -- for example, I have difficulty understanding why the mere existence of a reverse payment is presumptively gives -- changes the burden from the Plaintiff.  It would seem to me that you have to bear the burden -- the burden of proving that the payment for services or the value given was too high.  I don't know why it has to shift to the other side.   Sonia Sotomayor  So answer the more fundamental question: Why is the rule of reason so bad?   INTERRUPTING ",12-416X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Why isn't this then?  Meaning there is no presumption of infringement.  There's no presumption that the item that someone else is going to sell necessarily infringes.   Sonia Sotomayor  So what you're arguing is that in fact a settlement of an infringement action is now creating that presumption.   Sonia Sotomayor  I don't know, but I don't know why we would be required to accept that there has or would be infringement by the product that has voluntarily decided not to pursue its rights.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But there, you'd know that they're not sharing the profits.   Sonia Sotomayor  Meaning there you know that a -- a product's been licensed and the -- that's normal.  The infringer is now paying the other side money to sell that product.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  A reverse payment suggests something different, that they're sharing profits.  I don't know what else you can conclude.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But not many for reverse payments.   Sonia Sotomayor  Is that in all cases or just Hatch-Waxman cases?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Because it does skew the dynamics a lot.   Sonia Sotomayor  You know, the Second Circuit recognized, even though it accepted your scope of the patent, that there was a troubling dynamic in what you're arguing, which is that the less sound the patent, the more you're going to hurt consumers, because those are the cases where the payoff, the sharing of profits is the greatest inducement for the patentholder.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  For whom?  And -- and -- you know, the government is basically saying, we really don't want reverse payments, period.  We want people to settle this the way they should settle it, which is on the strength of the patent.  And that means settling it simply by either paying a royalty for use or settling as most cases do, on an early entry alone, so there's no sharing of -- of -- of profits.  What's so bad about that?  I mean, it doesn't deprive either side of the ability to finish the litigation if they want to.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, in the normal course, if the patent's really strong, if you get a year or two earlier entry, that has an inherent value, and that's what you'll pay for is what the government is saying.  That will be the determination the two parties will make, which is at what point is earlier entry worth it--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --for the very strong patentholder.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, they pointed to most settlements and say that is the vast majority.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, we do know that these reverse payments, except for recent times when people figured out they were so valuable, were the exception, not the rule.   Sonia Sotomayor  They have been increasing in number, not decreasing.   Sonia Sotomayor  I see that as an argument that there is an economic reality in Hatch-Waxman that would require us not to apply any rule we choose or accept here to other situations; only here.  That's the argument that you're creating for me, that there's a different economic reality here that requires a different rule.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Oh, but it does, because in Hatch-Waxman Congress decided that there was a benefit for generics entering without suffering a potential loss to enter the market more quickly.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And any settlement in these cases deprives consumers of the potential of having the benefit of an earlier entry.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Exactly, and what you are doing with permitting settlements of this kind is not permitting the process to go to conclusion.   Sonia Sotomayor  It's encouraging infringement suits.   ",12-416X

How -- for any Federal conviction, whether it's related to sex offense or anything else, Congress could impose any kind of registration requirement?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what -- what is the limit?  Is it just safety?  It can't be just safety of the public, because you just said that it doesn't apply to recidivist Federal offenders, generally.   Sonia Sotomayor  I don't understand.  I just posited a civil registration for Federal offenders of any kind.  That's not ex post facto under your theory, so--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --Well, I don't know if I agree with that, but accept -- accepting that hypothetical.

Outside of protecting the public from a recidivist, what's the interest?  Because that wasn't enough in Comstock.  We made it very clear that wasn't enough.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Going back to -- to a prior question, are you challenging -- you didn't on appeal, but it seems as if you're accepting that the Federal Government has the power to impose this requirement as part of a Federal sentence.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  Are you -- if it's not part of a Federal sentence but part of release, it's not announced at the sentence but it's announced at the time the prisoner is put into supervised release or release from jail, do you think the Government has the power to impose it then?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, SORNA today becomes part of the supervised relief terms.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm not talking about SORNA today.

Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I don't know of that power, but do you have a statutory--   Sonia Sotomayor  --All right.  So that power -- I guess then what the Government is saying, as I understand their argument, if you have the power to do it at that point, why can't you have the power to do it later?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Are the same factors that compel permission for the Government to do it then?   Sonia Sotomayor  How would you write this opinion if you wanted to protect against what Justice Breyer was concerned about, constricting the Commerce Clause, which has been since Madison more broadly defined than he did, or Justice Alito's example of ensuring that you're not closing off other things that can be done after someone leaves, that might be related to, like punishing a crime that you find out about afterwards.  How would you write this opinion?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it wasn't really helpful, because it -- it doesn't give us a limiting principle like -- I don't know if it's possible -- that if you're relying on just recidivism, Congress has to have an independent basis, a power for the imposition of -- of criminal or civil sanctions on someone.

His allegation is that the only reason you terminated with a contract was because you wanted to get rid of these high flyers in your merger negotiations with the other airline.

In balancing the government's desire for restraint and the fundamental right to hire a lawyer of choice, it's not strong enough in this situation with what I've been presented to continue restraining the money.  I don't see it as a legal determination that no probable cause.  I see it as defining the word “ may ” in the statute.  If the judge has discretion, that discretion has to be informed by something.

If we're to say that this was not compelled speech, presumably there'd be no reason the government couldn't use this report, whether or not the defendant put his or her mental state at issue, because if it's not compelled, you could use it as affirmative evidence, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  Seems a somewhat--   Sonia Sotomayor  --If I may finish?   Sonia Sotomayor  Assuming that I'm troubled by that holding, then what's the line we draw with respect to the question Justice Kennedy asked you as to when it is permissible.  You're saying let's just rule on the base.  When the defendant puts on an expert, we can rebut with an expert.  But the broader question of if he puts his mental state at issue without an expert, could you do it?  Could you still put on his examination?  I'm not sure you've really answered that question--   Sonia Sotomayor  --which is how broadly do we hold.  There's a waiver whenever you put in your mental state at issue or is it a waiver only when you use an expert and then the government is free to respond with a compelled statement.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I'm presuming that if a defendant takes the stand and says something completely contrary to what he tells a government psychiatrist, that you would rely on the Brown line of cases, that you could cross-examine him on the contrary statement to the psychiatrist.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that would be a different issue.  I'm just talking about whatever statements he made.  But don't -- the light is on.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm not quite sure I understand why we shouldn't follow the Simmons analogy because, as I understand it, we haven't ruled on the last question of whether you can use the compelled statements as impeachment.  But if we assume that to be the case, most circuits who have addressed the issue, and I think it may be all of them, have said you can because there's a waiver of your Fourth Amendment right when you take the stand to impeachment.  Why couldn't we follow a similar reasoning here, which is, you're compelled to -- I'm sorry.  Forget it.  I can answer my own question.   ",12-609X

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, there's a -- there's the disconnect for me.  Yes, I do accept that the district courts have to consider the guidelines, but how do you tie that to the requirement that the punishment has to be tied to the guidelines?

[Laughter]   Sonia Sotomayor  Can you tell me the narrow rule that you would propose--   Sonia Sotomayor  --getting back to Justice Scalia--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --which is procedures change risks.  Having a victim testify at sentences -- at a sentence is likely, if you examined it statistically, to increase -- increase the sentence.  So assume that's the set of hypotheticals.  You change it, now victims can.  Why is that not or is it an ex post facto change?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why is this not procedural?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Give me the rule where I can draw a line between those changes that are permissible and those that are not, not the general statement you're making, because both increase the risk of a higher sentence.

I posed exactly the question that Justice Scalia--   Sonia Sotomayor  --I said the sentencing -- the assumptions I made were the sentencing law changes, victims must testify, judges must consider what they say, and after 5 years it's proven that when victims speak the sentences are higher.  Is that a substantive or a procedural law?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm asking you to draw it.  So tell me what's the rule?

Sonia Sotomayor  You don't think that the proponents of affirmative action are attempting to do the same thing?  One of the bill sponsors here said that this constitutional amendment will bring back desegregation in Michigan, and it appears to have done just that.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I thought that in Grutter, all of the social scientists had pointed out to the fact that all of those efforts had failed.  That's one of the reasons why the -- I think it was a law school claim in Michigan was upheld.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's always wonderful for minorities that they finally get in, they finally have children and now you're going to do away for that preference for them.  It seems that the game posts keeps changing every few years for minorities.   Sonia Sotomayor  I don't see the distinction.  Bussing could be viewed, and was viewed, to benefit only one group.  It was a preference for blacks to get into better schools.  That's the way the case was pitched, that was its justification, and to integrate the society.  Affirmative action has the same gain.  We've said that in Fisher; it should be to diversify the population, so it favors diversity as opposed to desegregation.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But I don't see how the argument would be any different here.  One of the main sponsors of this bill said it was intended to segregate again.  The voters in Seattle were not all filled with animus; some of them just cared about their children not leaving -- not having outsiders come in.  I mean, there's always voters who have good intent.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  In Seattle as well.  So it wasn't the issue of animus that drove Seattle.   Sonia Sotomayor  So what do we do with the statistics from California?  An amici from California, their attorney general, has shown, another State with a similar proposition, has shown the dramatic drop.   Sonia Sotomayor  So why is it okay to have taken away -- not okay to have taken away the decision to have bussing from the local school boards, the people on the ground, but it's okay to take that power away from the people on the ground here, the board of regents, who are also elected like the school board was in Seattle?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The general population has feelings about many things, but the only decision that they're -- educational decision that they are taking away from the board of regents is this one: affirmative action.  Everything else they leave within the elected board of regents.   Sonia Sotomayor  You've done something much more.  You are basically saying, because Fisher and Grutter -- we've always applied strict scrutiny--   Sonia Sotomayor  --all right.  So it's essentially a last resort, within some reason.  But what you are saying, if all those other measures fail, you're by Constitution saying you can't go to the remedy that might work.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, but you're -- but this amendment is stopping the political process.  It's saying the board of regents can do everything else in the field of education except this one.   Sonia Sotomayor  Diversity does, but when you take away a tool for diversity that's what Seattle is saying is wrong.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You can't take the tool away simply because it may include race as a factor, simply because you are changing the playing field.   ",12-682X

I thought the line was a very simple one, which is if the normal academic decision-making is in the dean, the faculty, at whatever level, as long as the normal right to control is being exercised, then that person could change the decision.  So if they delegate most admissions decisions, as I understand from the record, to the faculty, but they still regularly, besides race, veto some of those decisions, and race is now one of them, then the Board of Regents can do that normally.  So could the president, if that's the way it's normally done.

Sonia Sotomayor  I have a -- I have a hugely great difficulty, which is, the NVRA says that people can mail in this form.   Sonia Sotomayor  I don't know how your rejection of the mail-in, how you're accepting and using it when you're refusing to register someone when they do exactly what the Federal law permits them to do: Mail it in.

One of the concurring judges below said that he found the statute ambiguous, but that with the -- the legislative history there just could be no conclusion but that Congress rejected your reading.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And that direct infringement question would still be open before the court below?

Sonia Sotomayor  Right.  Exactly.     The Federal Circuit has said principal agent right now.  That rule makes sense.  I think everyone agrees that that rule, at least, is correct.  If the Court wanted to broaden that out, it would have to consider, I think, the significant concern about expanding liability too far so that you have parties who don't know about the patent, who don't know exactly what steps they need to perform or avoid performing in order to avoid liability.   Sonia Sotomayor  Could I -- I have one last question.  In your brief, and I think your adversary -- your -- Mr. Panner mentioned it, too.

It must transfer to those venues.  If we accept 1404 as applying, then we're disfavoring commercial parties from picking Federal courts because they're going to have to accept that a non-selected venue will have the power to make the decision whether to transfer or not.

I mean, without looking at the individual facts of the case, the 30 percent is going to be underinclusive in some circumstances, overinclusive in others.  So how do you deal with our holding that you are not entitled to the overinclusive portion?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Life is never certain, and so I don't even go to that issue.  I go just simply to the question, how can you, ex ante, predict -- particularly with a statute that wasn't based on any empirical data -- that 30 percent normally is the right amount?  You just picked it out of the air?  You could pick 40, 50, 60.  How do we draw the line?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Now, how does it have the right to announce that in a FELA case or in a Jones Act case where those injured parties, they have a property right in their protection but this statute applies to that recovery as well?   Sonia Sotomayor  So they can deny a litigant a property right in that recovery?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I don't know how you can go in and ask for something you don't own.  I don't know how the plaintiff can go in and litigate a case if they don't have a property interest that they can then assign to someone else.  I've never heard of such a thing, how they would have standing to sue on your behalf if they have no property interest in the recovery.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How do you sue for something you have no property interest in?   Sonia Sotomayor  So go back to Justice Scalia's question.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  There has to be some interest in the 30 percent by the plaintiff.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could I just clarify one point?  Does this rule preclude parties, as we said in Ahlborn, from stipulating to a settlement at all?   Sonia Sotomayor  Your brief is not clear on that.  They can still stipulate.  It's only if after the stipulation, it hasn't been allocated that you can recover?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what you're basically now saying is that there can never be a stipulation.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You're saying that the parties cannot enter into a stipulation.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I didn't hear Justice Ginsburg's question.   Sonia Sotomayor  Basically you are saying the judge would be required to give you your one-third regardless of what the jury said.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So all those States that have jury verdicts, special verdicts that require a certain amount, they could avoid that by just simply passing this law and avoid the anti-lien statute that way?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  16 States already have something close to a presumption of a percentage.  Do you have any evidence that in those 16 States where it's only a presumption and not a fixed amount, that they are falling apart because of it?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  In the absence of this statute, what did your State do beforehand?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Am I correct that what you believe and what the courts have been doing in your State, the lower courts, is that they won't approve a settlement that doesn't have the one-third, and they won't enter a judgment that doesn't have the one-third?  Is that correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So I'm right.  They just won't accept the private stipulation that doesn't do that, and they won't enter into a judgment that doesn't do that, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Just answer my question.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  Going back to Justice Alito's.  The jury says it's less or more or whatever of -- of the settlement as medical expenses, it doesn't matter what they say, the court can't enter a judgment for that amount, they have to enter a judgment for either the one-third or the full medical expenses.   Sonia Sotomayor  And that's what they have been doing.   Sonia Sotomayor  I know that was argued before.  But I read Ahlborn very carefully, and I don't see it.  I read the amici briefs that reference different procedures, and not one of them referenced the North Carolina procedure.  So, I know that was argued before.  You didn't argue it in your brief here, and I assume you didn't because you did what I did, which was to read Ahlborn carefully and read what it cited, and I don't see it cited.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I don't see the North Carolina procedure referenced in Ahlborn as something that States could do.  It wasn't referenced directly in the -- in the opinion, and it wasn't referenced indirectly by the amici.  The amici were talking about substantially different procedures.   Sonia Sotomayor  But my point is, Justice Kennedy's question was that somehow in that opinion, we approved the North Carolina system.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Oh, well, I agree with you.  But I'm trying to find something analogous and there isn't.

You then put in a set of interrogatories that demands to know what the EEOC -- who the EEOC contacted, how they measured their damages, and a bunch of other stuff, still not waiving confidentiality.  This new thing of yours that says if you challenge it when I make a motion, then I can disclose it.  I think what Justice Breyer's getting to is, you know whether someone conciliated or not.  You can say exactly what the EEOC did or didn't do or failed to do.  But instead, you want a whole discovery process attached to this.  And that's my problem here--   Sonia Sotomayor  --which it's very simple for you to come in and say, we called, we asked to meet, they wouldn't meet with us.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, no, no, no.  I don't want to know what you want.  I want to know what happens because that's the only way I can judge whether there was good faith.

How do they get a court to review that under your theory of the case?  Because you say the only thing the court can review is whether conciliation was offered and whether it ended.

Now, some people may think alcohol is a controlled substance, but it's not on the 802 list.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, right now even your brief admits that the BIA is applying a different standard to possession and distribution offenses.  It's applying the 802 specification.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And it's trying to draw a difference.  I don't -- I still don't understand how it does it, but my point is that you're proving it's -- you're living by the 802 distinction with distribution and possession.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Yeah, what you're hoping for is that they will change that one, too.  But let's answer what's happened up until now.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Because they have discretion.  If they're not automatically removable and they look at the underlying papers and decide it's a more serious crime than -- than the -- than the strict removability statute, they let the person they remove this person anyway.

When Congress intended to say -- and I can point to at least three provisions -- when it wanted to say any controlled substance without reference to -- to 802, it said, any controlled substance.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  What changes what is an interpretative rule?  What you're suggesting -- an interpretative rule to me is an interpretative rule.  Is there a statute or a regulation that you're looking at, and you're saying a statute or a regulation, I think it applies this way.  You don't talk about a court amending a statute or a regulation when it changes its interpretation.  So even if I agree with you that it's an amendment to an interpretation, how does that make it anything else but an interpretation?   Sonia Sotomayor  But there is a safe harbor in this particular statute and they're trying to comply with the meaning of the safe harbor.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, you keep calling it a law.  It worked a substantial change in the interpretation.   ",13-1041
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm -- I'm sorry. I'm -- I don't even understand why we're talking about based-upon. As Justice Ginsburg said, there's no dispute here that whether the based-upon is the ticket sale or the operation of the train, both of them are commercial activities. Isn't the work in substantial contact with the United States? Isn't that what we should be looking at instead? Was this commercial activity substantial enough? The operation of the train and the ticket sale here, did it have a substantial contact with the United States?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So we did that in the context of deciding when something was a sovereign act as opposed to a commercial act.  We know this is a commercial act. So -- and we -- I'm just confused.  Why isn't the work -- why shouldn't the work be done by substantial contact with the U.S.?   Sonia Sotomayor  Whether it's --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- commercial or sovereign.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Even if they had looked at the conduct, it's commercial.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So is it the based-upon language or the substantial-context language?   Edwin S. Kneedler  It's both.  It's both and in the -- in the United States, which is an important point I want to make.  The -- one of the reasons it's very different from just due process is because this -- the FSIA governs subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction to be sure, but based -- based upon a determination of immunity of a foreign state.  And it does that by drawing, as was mentioned before, a strict territorial line that runs throughout all the exceptions.  For example, the intentional -- the tort exception applies only to torts in the United States. And the property exception concerns property in the United States.  And the focus of the commercial activity exception is also, at least under clause one -- well, all of them -- but clause one is commercial activity in the United States that also has a substantial connection, but the action has to be based upon, as Justice Scalia pointed out.   Sonia Sotomayor  If this was a private company --   Edwin S. Kneedler  -- an airline.   Sonia Sotomayor  -- would there be jurisdiction here?   Edwin S. Kneedler  I'm sorry?   Sonia Sotomayor  If this were a private company, not the state, would there be jurisdiction here?   Edwin S. Kneedler  I think probably not, but I -- but I think it's -- I think it would be a good idea for the Court not to address the due process and just focus on the -- on the statutory terms here, because the question -- question of virtual presence by purchasing a ticket on the Internet can arise in all sorts of ways for due process purposes in private cases.  And -- and here, we have a statute to focus on.   ",13-1067

Sonia Sotomayor  If it's collateral estoppel, it could be until a third party.  But I think that that third party would be entitled to a stay of his or her action pending the adjudication of the main action.   Sonia Sotomayor  Except that the -- there's still a right to ask the court of appeals for a COA, and so there is an appellate process of sorts.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Right.  Answer -- answer Judge -- Judge Easterbrook's point, that there is no way to revive a subsequently filed case that was dismissed because of a third strike.  Judge Easterbrook, and I think there's some force to his logic, says with this -- this three-strike situation, when the next case comes to the court of -- to a district court, district court never files the complaint.  There was nothing dismissed that can be revived.  There was no judgment entered.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  You're saying -- contrary to one citation, your Ashley -- Ashby v. White -- that it isn't a right that Congress has given you? I --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I mean, most of the common law rights, like property rights, are -- are given to you by statute.  They're not given to you by the common law.  Most people are coming in to sue on the basis of a statute.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So if I have a dozen or more cases that didn't involve property rights, where we didn't require economic harm, those would mean nothing to you?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Those legal rights, we just decided through the centuries, all those cases wrong?   Sonia Sotomayor  Isn't that --   Sonia Sotomayor  Isn't that, though, a question of the application of the statute?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It doesn't invalidate the injury here because this is the quintessential violation of the statute. He's saying they don't have reasonable procedures to check their accuracy.  We know from the purpose section of the statute that that's what Congress wanted, reasonable procedures.  He's going to have to prove that. Number two, he says, the information about me is false.  I'm going to assume, for purposes of this argument, because we have to, that -- and so does the court below with respect to standing -- that much of that information is inaccurate. I will tell you that I know plenty of single people who look at whether someone who's proposed to date is married or not.  So if you're not married and there's a report out there saying you are, that's a potential injury. Now, I know the court below said it was speculative, but that's what Congress was worried about: both creditworthiness, and -- and your stature as a person, your privacy, your sense of self; that I can identify myself with some -- others can identify me with some accuracy.   Sonia Sotomayor  So I guess my question is, we've now taken a word, ""concreteness,"" that the Court in recent years has applied to injuries by citizens and when they can bring actions or not.  A generalized grievance, we said, of a taxpayer is not concrete enough. We've taken this doctrine, and you're trying to superimpose the word ""concrete"" into legally-created rights.  But for -- for two decades -- on, I mean, two centuries, we've always said in our case law that injury in fact is the breach of a legally-recognized right. Where do we have a right? I think that's Justice Kagan's question.   Sonia Sotomayor  It's a requirement.   Sonia Sotomayor  ""Any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed upon this subjecter with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer."" So it's not the whole world; it's the consumer that you dealt with --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- or that the agency -- that the agency dealt with.

I think the breach of any legal right you're given is -- gives Article III jurisdiction. There is a difference between that and whether you're within the zone of interest of a statute. And so what you're saying -- I -- I guess that's why the circuits below have said you have to be able to allege some falsity in the credit report to get recovery under the statute because those are the people the statute was targeted to.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  You know, your -- your brief confused me, and it took me a while to pull it apart.  All right. I don't know that there's a dispute -- or at least there's a dispute in the application.  But really, the deference here was given to the harmless error finding or purported to have been given.  So there's no -- there's no dispute that the court below committed an error, meaning that the court below didn't apply the right standards, a factual question.  The issue, I think, that you're trying to arrive at is under the circumstances of this case, that the Court also reached the performance prod of Strickland, and that's really where the dispute is, isn't it?   Sonia Sotomayor  I -- if we were to find that it wasn't a reasonable finding, then we would have to reach the first decision.   Sonia Sotomayor  So assume that it was unreasonable.  Let's go back to the first issue.  Yes, in Williams and Harrington, we have said that if there are multiple claims and the State court just says everything's denied, you assume that means Federal and State.  If the State claim is the same as the Federal claim, we say, they -- they -- they -- we assume they meant the Federal claim as well.  But this is sort of an interesting case because the -- they said there was constitutional error under State law, but they studiously avoided Federal saying there was one or not under Federal law.  And they dismissed the Federal claim just on the harmlessness prong. And what the Ninth Circuit said, as I understand, they didn't reach it.  Constitutional avoidance made them decide that it was easier for them to just say there was State error. Why do we reach a different conclusion?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  Why not? If the State court didn't reach the Federal constitutional error, you're asking us to assume it did when you've admitted it didn't?   Sonia Sotomayor  So why do we bother saying in Williams that there are circumstances -- I happen to think this one of them -- where -- and you do, too -- where a State court hasn't reached an issue, that we don't give it deference.  Under your judgment, we made a mistake when we said that in Williams.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why do we apply AEDPA at all? Meaning -- I think we've said repeatedly that Brecht's actual prejudice standard is higher than the -- the AEDPA standard.  So why are we applying it at all?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, you've -- you've already admitted there's sort of an illogic when the State court says there was a Federal violation but no harmlessness and we say, ""Yes, there was harm.""   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So we don't give it deference that there was a Federal error.  We don't say it was a reasonable mistake but they found error and we accept the error.   Sonia Sotomayor  We didn't do that in Wiggins, Rompilla, or Porter, did we?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So we would have to overturn those cases to accept your proposition.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That the State had not addressed?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Identical to this case. The State had not addressed one prong, and we said de novo review.   Sonia Sotomayor  I have a bit of a hard time with the -- this -- assume I accept your proposition that it's actual prejudice. In a process claim, generally, we don't talk about what the outcome was going to be.  We talk about what the process was and whether there was an opportunity for you to make arguments you couldn't have made.  All right? That's our normal jurisprudence in a due process claim.  And we basically say you get a do-over because you weren't permitted to have the process you were entitled to.  So you're saying we've got to treat this differently under Brecht; this person wasn't permitted to be there.  I think there's some very convincing arguments, potentially, on at least one juror, Olanders.  There, the comparison was not speculative.  It was based on the answers provided by jurors who had both questionnaires and voir dire that was available. And the briefs point out -- and so does the Ninth Circuit, very convincingly -- all the excuses given by the prosecutor are rebutted by either identical answers by one juror, Ana L. -- Ana or Ana L., or other jurors who did exactly the same thing and were permitted to sit on the jury. So why are we doing anything different with this actual prejudice standard?   Sonia Sotomayor  But don't -- don't -- don't talk to me generally.  Ana L. said more equivocal things about the death penalty than Olanders D., so did another juror, and they still went on.   Sonia Sotomayor  That's what Olanders D. said, essentially.   Sonia Sotomayor  So did she.   Sonia Sotomayor  He thought -- ""I thought about it and realized I -- I could.""   Sonia Sotomayor  That -- you see the two of them substantially different? One said, ""I thought. I've listened to what the law is.  I've done"" -- it's hard for me to imagine how they're substantively different.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And do you think that defense counsel wouldn't have been able to point that out to the judge? And, you know, there were a lot of people questioned in this. How many days of voir dire was there?   Sonia Sotomayor  Three weeks of voir dire.  Do you suspect that the judge, or think that the judge had clearly in mind every set of questions, and their responses.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's clear he was.  I'm not doubting that.  But my point is simply, do you think that pointing this out to the judge could not have had a substantial influence on his decision? Because all three prongs, he could have pointed to almost identical comments by other jurors.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How can you be confident? I mean, the whole purpose of an adversarial system is so that the other side of an argument is presented to the judge.  Was he playing defense attorney too? Is that -- and defense attorney with the same purpose?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Then I -- why don't we just have a trial ex parte? Presumably that's what you're arguing.   Sonia Sotomayor  We should have the entire trial ex parte, because the judge can do that.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I guess my question is, the Ninth Circuit, at least with this juror -- I'm not talking about the other things, I'm talking about this juror -- as I pointed out earlier, pointed out two situations that were almost identical to the one that the op -- the prosecutor pointed to with this juror. Anna L. also said something that was totally nonresponsive to a question; it was like, ""that's correct,"" rather than answering the question. So you can say with complete confidence that that would never have made a difference to the judge? If he had had a real adversary able to point all of these things out, you're confident the judge would not have made up his mind.  That's what you're saying.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, there -- there's a real problem here, you do understand.  We're only pointing to the things for which there is a record. There is another component to this, which is that all the other questionnaires and the entire transcript wasn't available.   INTERRUPTING ",13-1428

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, would you repeat that?   Sonia Sotomayor  I think Justice Alito's question is basically why would the district court have equitable power to turn down any named buyer so long as it is an actual buyer.

You have to assume first that there's a candidate who is going to react by initiating an action, you have to assume further that a panel is going to render the same decision, and you have to assume even further that a Federal prosecutor -- that the prosecutor is going to agree and actually bring the case.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, let me ask you something going back in part to Justice Kagan.  Basically, as a bottom line, you think there's nothing that could be salvaged from this process.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Is your claim limited to sensitive materials like contraceptives or does it include items like blood transfusion, vaccines?  For some religions, products made of pork?  Is any claim under your theory that has a religious basis, could an employer preclude the use of those items as well?   Sonia Sotomayor  How does a corporation exercise religion?  I mean, I know how it speaks and we have, according to our jurisprudence, 200 years of corporations speaking in its own interests.  But where are the cases that show that a corporation exercises religion?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, but they were really arguing about things that affected their membership, not them as a corporate entity.   Sonia Sotomayor  So the dissent in this case, in the Tenth Circuit case, said how do we determine when a corporation has that belief?  Who says it?  The majority of shareholders?  The corporate officers?  The -- is it 51 percent?  What happens to the minority?  And how much of the business has to be dedicated to religion?  5 percent?  10 percent?  90 percent?  Just assume not a business like yours -- you picked great plaintiffs, but let's assume ----  [Laughter]  Let's assume just a business that sells 5 percent of religious books, doesn't play Christmas music, doesn't give off -- works on Sunday, you know, does nothing else religiously.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's the most dangerous piece.  That's the one we've resisted in all our exercise jurisprudence, to measure the depth of someone's religious beliefs.   Sonia Sotomayor  I thought more importantly was whether a burden was substantial or not.  That we've never acceded to the person claiming a religious exemption, a belief in how substantial the burden might be.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Is there -- is there a different way of looking at it, the leeway?  In U.S. v. Lee, we said,  ""When followers of a particular sect enter into a commercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity. ""  So isn't that really the answer, that we've never considered a for-profit corporation as exercising religion?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's an interesting question, because the briefs on both sides here are written as if the penalty for not having a health insurance policy that covers contraceptives is at issue.  But isn't there another choice nobody talks about, which is paying the tax, which is a lot less than a penalty and a lot less than -- than the cost of health insurance at all?  These employers could choose not to give health insurance and pay not that high a penalty -- not that high a tax.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, if they want to do that, they can just pay a greater salary and let the employees go in on the exchange.   Sonia Sotomayor  It's not called a penalty.  It's called a tax.  And it's calibrated -- and it's calibrated--   Sonia Sotomayor  --May I just put a footnote on this.  I thought the average price of providing insurance for a single person is $4,000, and it's $12,000 for a family -- for a family.  So the 2,000 tax -- that's what it's called -- is to help the government provide subsidies to people on the exchange that don't have employer insurance.  So it's a tax because it's -- it is to do exactly what your client wants, to get the government to supply the contraceptives, not the insurance companies.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, your attorney -- one of the attorneys below on behalf of your clients admitted that the grandfathered policies weren't going to be around very long because any change to an existing policy -- and he said these changes happen on a yearly basis.  And we already know from the government's statistics that it's up to 40 percent now have grandfathered out.  Your own client changed its policy, and that's why it's not grandfathered.  And he changed it to drop contraceptives it was covering.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And so my point is, since when does a transitioned grandfathered exemption and one that everybody knows will have to change, because premiums by definition will change or co-pays will change, something is going to change -- it's a very short transition period.  Since when does that prove that the need is not compelling?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm not sure that -- that squares with Lee.  The -- the statute created the right to Social Security, and there the Court said you can't deprive employees of a statutory right because of your religious beliefs.  So Lee is contrary to the point you're making.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Those are alternatives that you're asking the government to incur or the person to incur.  There isn't an alternative that doesn't put a cost on someone else.   Sonia Sotomayor  So we go back to the start of my question, that would be essentially the same for vaccines, blood transfusions, non-pork products, the government has to pay for all of the medical needs that an employer thinks or claims it has a religious exemption to?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Because those things are more important?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's really the amount of money--   Sonia Sotomayor  --Well, but they--   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  --they make exemptions for vaccines, presumably, to some people on some basis, but we have a tax code that applies to everybody, but we have a million exemptions.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Now, is there a difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision from a provision creating a cause of action? Let's do the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which authorizes suit in any Federal district court of competent jurisdiction. How do you deal with the fact that the ADA generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal courts?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, there, I'm presuming they mean personal jurisdiction.  So in context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as personal jurisdiction.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's arguably to keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else.   Sonia Sotomayor  I've done -- or had -- my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been able to identify, eight other statutes that use the ""incompetent jurisdiction"" language. Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B, are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie Mae is?   Ann O'Connell Adams  I -- I am aware of those statutes.  I have on my list seven that just have the sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving this entity.   Sonia Sotomayor  We are off by one.   Ann O'Connell Adams  Right.   Sonia Sotomayor  But tell me what you mean.   Ann O'Connell Adams  So, no, I am not troubled by this.  In fact, I think this is the reason, two of the -- of the entities are Federal agencies, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Sonia Sotomayor  So a Federal question would be --   Ann O'Connell Adams  No, the Federal agencies have the power to bring a suit in Federal court.  They also have the power to remove a case from Federal court. But if the Court interpret's Fannie's charter to mean that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be brought in Federal court against the agency, and they can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is a party. I'll give you an example that HUD has given to me over time.  HUD often likes to litigate these cases in State court.  These are mortgage foreclosure cases.  They are quintessential State court questions. There can be a case -- and this happens frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in State court.  HUD may also be named as a defendant if HUD has an interest in the mortgage.  HUD may want to leave that case in the State court where the State courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all the time.  They are all State law causes of action, just as in this case. If the Court were to say that the language which is also in HUD's charter, that it can sue or be sued in any State or Federal court of competent jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter over that suit, then the private party can now remove the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit. HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction over any case involving HUD.   Sonia Sotomayor  So those are five statutes that don't -- is not -- are -- don't involve Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the two --   Ann O'Connell Adams  Yes.  They are Federal corporations, federally chartered corporations.   Sonia Sotomayor  Have all of them read the statute in the same way you have?   Ann O'Connell Adams  I know that the Seventh Circuit has interpreted the V.A.'s sue-and-be-sued clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction.  I think there is a split in the district courts after Red Cross about the Federal Home Loan Bank's sue-and-be-sued clause. I don't -- the -- we are definitely advocating for the approach that -- in all of those, as in Fannie Mae's charter, that Federal subject-matter jurisdiction is not created by the sue-and-be-sued clause, that you have to --   Sonia Sotomayor  What happens to all the judgments that have been entered, reading this the way the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split jurisdiction with district courts going other ways? What happens to those old judgments where there wasn't Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?   Ann O'Connell Adams  I would think that if --   Sonia Sotomayor  If we read things the way you want us to read them.   Ann O'Connell Adams  I would think if those cases are already finished that res judicata would -- you know, their -- those cases would still stand on their own.  But I think going forward, if the Court were to say there is no subject-matter jurisdiction, those cases could no longer be -- be brought in Federal court or removed to Federal court.

Sonia Sotomayor  But it is more than sufficient, if not the only theory they could have convicted on, was that they -- that he had encouraged others to exceed their authority.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  My problem is that I don't know that it's rational to say that a jury in -- that sufficiency of the evidence has to do with what was charged as -- what was charged to the jury as opposed to what was laid out in the statute and/or in the indictment. If it's sufficient under both, what you're trying to say now is it may be sufficient under both. You're conceding it is.  You're conceding it is a possibility the jury found what was charged in the indictment, but the government now has added an element to the crime.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Do you have any case where we've held that or anything close to it?   Sonia Sotomayor  Have you had any case discussing sufficiency of the evidence where we look to the jury instruction as opposed to the statute and the indictment?

I --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'd like to get to the substance of your argument, but as I understand your argument, this wasn't a waiver which the court found below.  You're arguing it's a forfeiture.   Sonia Sotomayor  Forfeiture because it was unintentionally done.   Sonia Sotomayor  And so you are going under plain error.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you're saying when there is plain error, when there isn't an intentional -- you don't disagree with the government that there are intentional waivers that you can't raise on appeal of the statute of limitations.

Sonia Sotomayor  I'm -- I'm a little concerned with how you envision this provision working. You're saying that the HHS Exchange can't be for the State so that it's established by the choice of the State. The choice the State had was establish your own Exchange or let the Federal government establish it for you.  That was the choice.  If we read it the way you're saying, then we're going to read a statute as intruding on the Federal-State relationship, because then the States are going to be coerced into establishing their own Exchanges.  And you say, oh, no, they can't be coerced, but let's go back to what Justice Breyer was talking about. In those States that don't -- their citizens don't receive subsidies, we're going to have the death spiral that this system was created to avoid.  States are obligated, insurers are obligated to make sure that in their States, whether they're part of this program or not, that they have guaranteed coverage, that 26 -- that children are covered till they're 26, and that they base their costs on community ratings.  So if they have to do that, then costs are going to rise on every insurance -- every insurance plan offered in the country in those 34 States, 3 or 6 of -- or 9 of your States will have tightened their Medicaid eligibility requirements in contravention of the Act, so they're taking money by breaking their compacts.  They would have to lose all of their Medicaid money. Tell me how that is not coercive in an unconstitutional way? And if it is coercive in an unconstitutional way, in Bond just -- I think it was last term, we said that that is a primary statutory command; that we read a statute in a way where we don't impinge on the basic Federal-State relationship.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Oh, we did it -- we said it last year.   Sonia Sotomayor  There are many --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why create 1326 at all?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  So you're claiming a right not merely to use the hovercraft in the nonpublic lands.  You're claiming that there's no residual right to control navigable waters in the Federal lands area?   Sonia Sotomayor  So what do you do about the ANILCA provision that says that boating and other water activities within public lands, within Federal public lands can be regulated?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's not what it says. It says any waters in the jurisdiction of the United States.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it could apply to both, is what I'm saying.  What says it excludes navigable waters?   Sonia Sotomayor  Your reading on a practical basis with respect to the navigable waters makes almost no sense to me. I'm looking at a map attached to the petition of the State of Alaska.  It's attached to the end of the brief.  And it seems like these national parks are spread along the coast of Alaska in a haphazard way, meaning the national parks have jurisdiction over a small strip along the coast of Alaska. Presumably you're not arguing that this agreement controls the U.S. servitude of navigable waters around those strips.   Sonia Sotomayor  So you're saying that the U.S. can't control the navigable servitude in any part of that coast.   Sonia Sotomayor  Can.   Sonia Sotomayor  And so what do you take the words in -- in 103(c) to mean, the boating exception, when it says ""in the jurisdiction of the United States""? ""Waters in the jurisdiction""? You don't think navigable waters are within the jurisdiction of the United States in Federal lands?   Sonia Sotomayor  Repeat what you said.  I didn't quite hear it or understand it.  I'm sorry.  Say it again.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you're not -- I'm sorry.  You're not saying that the Coast Guard couldn't come in and say no hovercrafts around the Alaskan coast.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How? Read the statute --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- and -- and -- and tell me how --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- in the statute --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- you can read it more broadly.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm going -- I'm in the definition section.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm with you so far. That gets you to regulating the waters in Federal -- in -- in -- in Federal units, because the U.S. under ANILCA only controls lands within the conservation units that are public lands.   Sonia Sotomayor  In the United States.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So -- and does the no-hovercraft rule apply to the nonpublic lands? Is that the position you're taking, that you have the right to regulate that as well?   Sonia Sotomayor  Why? You're -- you're conceding that the waters are outside of that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Can you tell me whether that statute violates this statute?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Some might argue that your proposed regulations on oil contravene the intent of this provision. So assuming we do, how do you deal with that? Assuming some people do.  I don't -- I don't know that --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, the specific would overcome the general.  So if Congress passed a new statute, it could limit or expand 103 as it chose, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  No.  That's you winning. (Laughter.) I think Justice Alito has been asking you this question from the beginning.   Sonia Sotomayor  What do you think the Ninth Circuit meant? And do you agree with its interpretation? As he pointed out --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- you spent 49 pages of your brief arguing other things --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- putting you to the test.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Tell me what was objectively reasonable about it.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I mean, the police officer admits that the person he saw coming out of the house in question wasn't doing anything.  He didn't know that he lived there, he didn't know what he had done, if anything.  He didn't even really know that there was drug dealing going on in the house.  He was trying to figure that out.  So what was objectively reasonable about stopping this man?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It would be interesting if he waited to see whether this was also a short-stay visitor.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I don't see how this is any different than stopping the first person you see.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What's going to stop police officers -- if we announce your rule, and your rule seems to be, once we have your name, if there's a warrant out on you, that's an attenuating circumstance under every circumstance.  What stops us from becoming a police state and just having the police stand on the corner down here and stop every person, ask them for identification, put it through, and if a warrant comes up, searching them?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If you have a town like Ferguson, where 80 percent of the residents have minor traffic warrants out, there may be a very good incentive for just standing on the street corner in Ferguson and asking every citizen, give me your ID; let me see your name.  And let me hope, because I have an 80 percent chance that you're going to have a warrant.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Don't you think it's enough of a deterrent to say to a police officer in this situation, you should have reasonable suspicion? You know the Fourth Amendment requires it.  So before you do an intrusive act demanding identification, you do what you're permitted to do, which is just to ask the person whether they'll talk to you.  Don't you think that that would improve the relationship between the public and the police? Wouldn't that be the appropriate encouragement we would give, if we don't let police do these things in questionable situations?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  We're begrudging them now from doing that.  We're saying if you have questionable probable cause, go ahead and do it because we're not going to make you take that extra step of just merely stopping someone and saying, will you talk to me, please.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So isn't flagrancy --   Sonia Sotomayor  This is a non sequitur. When you talk about an intervening circumstances as we've looked at it in the case law, it's always been something different than the actual stop.  Another police officer comes by and says, oh, I've been searching for that guy.  I know he has -- I -- I have a -- an arrest warrant for him.  A witness walks by on another crime and says, he just robbed me down the block. Those are intervening circumstances because they are something outside of the stop.  This location of evidence was a direct product of the stop.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It would never have happened except for the stop.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. -- you know something? Finding the baggie of cocaine gives the officer reasonable -- probable cause to arrest, but we don't let that cocaine come into evidence merely because it was a ground for the arrest.  We look at how the evidence was secured before deciding whether it's suppressible or not. And I don't see how this is any different than not letting someone be arrested -- or suppressing DNA evidence, fingerprint evidence that leads to other crimes.  We've suppressed those things because they've been the product of an illegal stop.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  I don't understand why.  If there's an arrest warrant for someone, for whatever reason, you can arrest them.  What you can't do is stop them illegally to effect an arrest. So it's not as if they're going to get away from whatever the underlying crime was.  There's an arrest warrant, they're going to go back and serve their time on whatever circumstance existed warranting that arrest, why are they getting away with anything?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Of another crime that the police would never have found.  But we do that --   Sonia Sotomayor  But that's true of all evidence we suppress.  Now you're attacking our suppression jurisprudence. We understand there's a cost to suppressing evidence.  But we believe, as we've been taught by our precedents, that there is value in ensuring that the Fourth Amendment is respected.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what's our rule now? Now you don't need reasonable suspicion to stop someone. You only need questionable reasonable suspicion to stop someone. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And now -- so we've now lessened the standard -- the Terry stop standard, which is fairly intrusive to stop someone. I -- I suspect, and I don't know whose brief it was, yours or your -- or Petitioner's, but someone said the public will stop this if they don't like police stopping you with no cause.  I think the public may end up stopping things but in a way the police are not going to like.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No.  But -- but we're not saying --   Sonia Sotomayor  Now, we've gotten to the point where we no longer have reasonable suspicion at all, because you keep defending this stop.  And I keep going to back to he has an anonymous call; he does see a certain number of short-stay visits, but he stops someone who he doesn't know has been a short-stay visit, has not seen there before, knows nothing about this person, and is doing a complete intrusive stop -- not just a hey, will-you-talk-to-me stop, but a formal investigatory stop -- on nothing else.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Why wouldn't it? Why wouldn't it? Now, look at our case, Rodriguez case.  We assumed that the check there was to ensure the safety of the officer.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.   Sonia Sotomayor  If the stop here is purely investigatory, isn't that different? Can you have an investigatory stop based on no suspicion? You were right when you said he stopped to check for the warrant.  The question is Justice Kennedy's question, which is: Is that legitimate?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Yes.   Sonia Sotomayor  Without.   Sonia Sotomayor  In order to run the warrant --   Sonia Sotomayor  You're --   Sonia Sotomayor  There was no suspicion here.  He was -- your client wasn't frisked.   Sonia Sotomayor  No.  There was no activity that the officer is alleged to have seen that would put the officer in fear of any -- that this gentleman was violent or was going to turn on him or do anything else.   Sonia Sotomayor  Correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  So the purpose, as I understand what you're trying to say is, he is now routinely checking every single person that he stops, whether with or without reasonable suspicion.  There can't be any other reason other than he wants to find the warrant or not.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So part of the stop may be to investigate, but the other part of the stop is he's doing this routinely, with no reasonable suspicion, with no articulable fear of his -- for his own safety. He's demanding peoples' names, and he's running a warrant to do what? You're saying to find the warrant.   Sonia Sotomayor  Exactly.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, all he did was go from the house to a convenience store, not in a car but walking.   Sonia Sotomayor  He walks to a convenience store, he's stopped in the parking garage but without a car.  And I go back to this is not coming up to a parked automobile and getting shot, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm very surprised that Justice Alito doesn't know that most of these warrants are automatic.

But what they didn't say was that it was credible, or that the judge found it credible.  Those are two different findings.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No.  All the judge had to say was, I'm not sure he's credible. And what takes me over the line is this motivation, this theory that I have.   Sonia Sotomayor  This is quite interesting.  You can draw an inference about a defendant based on no evidence.  No one said he was a drug dealer, I presume.  Did he have any convictions for drug dealing?   Sonia Sotomayor  He did not.  So the judge could just make this up out of whole cloth.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And that's not extraneous evidence.   Sonia Sotomayor  That's a new theory.  I didn't read that in your brief, that somehow, the judge was right.  He can -- he can assume that Owens knew that the defendant was a drug dealer.   ",14-1516

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  There's no patent on that particular component?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You keep saying ""substantially all."" Mr. Phillips argued that ""substantially all"" has to mean just that: Almost all. You, instead, in your brief, want us to keep that vaguer, but I'm assuming that there is a minimum that wouldn't constitute an infringement.   Zachary D. Tripp  Well, I think --   Sonia Sotomayor  20 percent? 30 percent? 40? How -- how --   Zachary D. Tripp  Well, so I think the -- the -- the one bright line that we -- that we are drawing here is -- on the face of the statute is that one is never enough.  We think that's clear when you look at (f)(1) and (f)(2) together the way this Court read them in Microsoft the first time. Beyond that, the numbers are very important under our test, but they are not the whole ball game. We're -- we say this on page 26 of our brief.  You could also -- you would look not only at the numbers of the components that were supplied and not supplied, but you would also look at the relative time, money, and effort that you would need to obtain the remaining components. So if I could give --   Sonia Sotomayor  To the expert testimony here that out of the five, three were significant, so let's assume they supplied the three significant components and not the two less insignificant.  What -- what would your answer be then?   Zachary D. Tripp  I think that would be a much closer case to supplying something that is tantamount to supplying all of them under our test.  I think the -- the record here isn't -- isn't fully set out in terms of what it is that -- that -- that makes them main or major. What we are trying to get at -- and -- and the key point to us, whether exactly how you articulate this test I think doesn't matter all that much to us, but what we really do care about is the idea that this needs to be a comparative inquiry looking at how much work there is left to be done to obtain the rest of the components so that --   Sonia Sotomayor  I don't know enough patent law to have the answer to this.  When a -- a claim is made, what -- how is the determination made of what the elements are? Do the elements' determinations sort out the common from the uncommon in a patent claim?   Zachary D. Tripp  Not as I understand it, no.  It would just be -- it would just be sorting out what the elements are, and -- and the way we approach the components of the invention, this is on page 27 of our brief, is we think, as in Microsoft, that they -- they -- they are -- they need to be capable of combination, and they are derived from the elements of the claim. So we think in -- in most cases it actually won't be that difficult.  And also, as it -- you know, as I was saying, I -- I think under our approach, it also, frankly, wouldn't matter that way.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Now, I've -- I've forgotten, but is there a circuit split on that third -- on the sua sponte review?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I'm -- I'm a little concerned because we do have to, on some levels, address the question of whether a sua -- sua sponte decision not to -- not to reopen is -- is reviewable. I -- I think as a general matter, one could say that given the vast discretion that the BIA gets in denying, that one should basically defer to their decisions in sua sponte reopenings.  But occasionally, they do it not as an exercise of discretion, but as an erroneous interpretation of law.  And there's plenty of standards to correcting that.  And so even for me, in sua sponte openings -- and I do understand I'm probably on a losing slope -- and I think that's what the -- the board is basically saying.  It's a matter of -- of deciding whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel, and we have a right and this is the standard we're going to set.  Lozada sets the standard that we're going to look at, and for that reason, there is equitable tolling. That's basically all they're saying, in my judgment.   William R. Peterson  Your Honor, we disagree that Lozada sets the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel.  We believe that Lozada sets the standard for how an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be raised.   Sonia Sotomayor  You're right.  How it -- but here, they basically said it -- you didn't have due diligence, I believe, and so you failed the prerequisites.   William R. Peterson  Your Honor, we would disagree that in this case, the board actually construed Petitioner as asking for equitable tolling.  And there's a reason for that, which is that Petitioner did not ask for equitable tolling before the Board of Immigration Appeals.  His initial motion to reopen does not acknowledge its untimeliness.  It says nothing about untimeliness at all.  He mentions, in his reply in support of the motion to reopen, that it is not untimely if there are exceptional circumstances.  You will not find the phrase ""equitable tolling"" in any of the papers the Petitioner filed with the Board of Immigration --   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  I'm totally confused.  I -- I think what the agency is saying, at least in this situation, is there is no explicit command in the statute about equitable tolling.  There is a time limit in the statute.  But can it be tolled or not? There's no explicit command in the statute it can't. And so as a matter of procedure, which generally we give a huge amount of deference to the agency, it has, albeit in unpublished opinions, followed a practice of considering it in motions to reopen.  And from that practice, they're telling us, there is, because the agency has determined that, with respect to IAC claims, that they will do it. I don't actually see that much problem with the problem, but I do agree with Justice Breyer that we don't need to get to that question here, because we really don't know whether that's the view of the Fifth Circuit or not.  And if they find it or if they say it doesn't exist, I want to consider their reasons.  That's what we usually do. But they haven't really given us reasons, other than to say the statute requires it, but I don't see why.   William R. Peterson  Justice Sotomayor, with respect to the Fifth Circuit, I believe, I would hope, that we've supplied the reasonings -- reasoning for why the Fifth Circuit's decision on equitable tolling is correct. With respect to the agency determinations, the Board of Immigration Appeals, with rare exceptions -- and there's no suggestion that this case is one -- will follow the authority of the circuit in which it sits.  So you can certainly find numerous unpublished Board of Immigration Appeals decisions applying equitable tolling to the statutory deadline, but they do so primarily because they are following the circuit authority. Now, the government agrees with us that the Board of Immigration Appeals has not independently interpreted the statute in a way that would receive Chevron deference to require equitable tolling.  So right now, I don't believe the board has taken an official position, except for in the government's brief, that equitable tolling of the statutory deadline is available.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I guess I'm -- I understand what you're going to say because I read your brief.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I respect that, and -- but -- but you agreed that these particular funds were untainted.  I'm told by your adversary --   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Dreeben, you're taking Monsanto out of context, because 853, by its nature, was limited to tainted funds.  This is the first statute if -- that I know of that permits the government to come in and take untainted funds.  The incidence of the tainted funds concept was, you can't spend another person's money.  You stole this money somehow, and you can't spend that money because it belongs to someone else.  It really doesn't belong to you.

We are not applying the rule -- or are we or should we apply the Rule 14 standard?   Sonia Sotomayor  Can you tell me why we should apply the Zafiro standard, which was joint trials, but this is joint sentencing where there is a different -- why there should be exactly the same standard applied?

Sonia Sotomayor  -- has to be considered?   Rachel P. Kovner  Yes, Your Honor.  We agree that sentencings may involve special considerations.  What we think Zafiro establishes is that generally when more relevant information is placed before a jury, that's not prejudice to a defendant, that's not unfair, and that juries with more information are likely to make more accurate decisions, and we think that's equally true at sentencing. And, similarly, that juries with more -- who are confronted with two defendants together can avoid the unwarranted disparities that may occur when juries reach different results -- two different juries considering the same facts reach different results on those facts.  And that's equally true at sentencing.   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. McAllister, I am sorry, but even if we do this and say that the sentencings didn't need to be severed, didn't the Kansas court hold on another ground that they were entitled to a new trial?   Sonia Sotomayor  So why can't we presume it's required by the State law, not the Constitution? I mean, as I'm reading the decision below, the court is saying that the principles of the Eighth Amendment give voice to or support for the use of this burden and Kansas is commanding it.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that can't be. Already we know and the Kansas court knew the dissent pointed out that a burden for mitigating circumstances of a preponderance of the evidence is okay, so they can't believe that no burden is required by the Constitution.  They know that there is no requirement because the cases mentioned by you and Justice Scalia say that.  So it has to be their view of State law.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What is this Court supposed to do when it's told its own lower courts three times before this case, or two, you must give this instruction? What -- what -- what's the Court supposed to do?   Sonia Sotomayor  Yes.  Whether the Constitution requires it or not, it has said the better practice is to give this instruction. What's a court supposed to do? Say, willy-nilly, my lower courts can disagree with me and not do it?   Sonia Sotomayor  Didn't the Kansas Court say, yes, we have that, but the only burden of proof in any of the instructions was in aggravating circumstances and that the State bore that burden? And it pointed to the fact that aggravating and mitigating were mentioned in the same clause 5 or 6 times with no explanation of what the burden was for mitigating.  The Kansas Court thought that the jurors could be confused or would be confused by what burden of proof was needed.   Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I think what they're saying is that some jurors would be confused. And certainly, there have been jury -- jury studies to indicate that jurors are often confused, generally, about burdens of proof.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, the jury instructions don't have to be devised necessarily for the Court.  They should be understandable to jurors. And I doubt very much that any juror has heard of that maxim. But putting that aside, the Kansas Court, which has much more experience than we do with trial court decisions, has determined that confusion exists or can exist.  Why isn't that enough for us?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, the prosecutor in Carr did tell the jury, I'm going to create reasonable doubt as to the defendants' mitigating evidence.  So that prosecutor didn't do what you said.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What a -- what a wonderful system we've created.  We give -- even when a State court is wrong in convicting somebody, so long as they're reasonably wrong, we uphold them.  And when they're wrong on a legal conclusion applying our test, we jump in and reverse them, right?   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Katyal, Kansas has already answered this question, hasn't it? Its requirement is that a jury be instructed both that mitigation need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and, second, that the jury be told it has no -- that there is no burden of proof.     Exactly.  And just like in Maryland v. Mills where this Court, under the Eighth Amendment, looked to that, here it's significant that not even Kansas is defending the rule that these jury instructions left the jury with the impression of.  I mean, indeed, I'm not aware of a single State that does so.  There's no amici on the State's side saying that this is going to impose any sort of harm to them.  This is the most modest fix in the world.

Sonia Sotomayor  Well, let's talk about the American Pipe tolling.  It would seem to me, as has happened in a number of litigations, that at the time that the complaint is filed, it doesn't mean that every member of the class has to have exhausted, because if that's what it means, then there can never be a class action.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So that issue is still open under the law, because it would seem to me, and I could be wrong, that if you still have time on the clock when the complaint is filed, that you can -- before you receive any remedy under the class action suit, you can present -- exhaust then, and recover, if you've done it during the period that -- the six-year period plus tolling.  That's what some courts have done.  They've defined the class as people who have exhausted, or who still have time to exhaust.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, this is a slightly different argument.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  Nobody is taking that away from anybody.  Every single individual in this society chooses, if they can, their sexual orientation or who to marry or not marry.  I suspect even with us giving gays rights to marry that there's some gay people who will choose not to.  Just as there's some heterosexual couples who choose not to marry.  So we're not taking anybody's liberty away.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You don't do that.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's the problem.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Marriage doesn't do that on any level.  How many married couples do fathers with the benefits or the requirements of marriage walk away from their children?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So it's not that the institution alone does it and that without it that father is going to stay in the marriage.  He made a choice.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I would say that it could -- I could -- it should be gender-neutral.  Some mothers do the same thing. But my point is that I'm not sure how I get to the point that Justice Breyer is making: How does withholding marriage from one group, same -- same-sex couples, increase the value to the other group?   Sonia Sotomayor  But the problem is that even under a rational-basis standard, do we accept a feeling? I mean, why is -- why as -- and I think Justice Kagan put the argument quite clearly, with something as fundamental as marriage, why would that feeling, which doesn't make any logical sense, control our decision-making?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  My problem is that I think people who get into marriage think that, heterosexual couples.   Sonia Sotomayor  Everybody has their own vision of what marriage is, but what the State confers is certain obligations --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- and they are willing to accept those.  Whether or not that couple stays together, they are bound to that child.  They have to support the child, they have to care for him or her. Some people choose voluntarily, meaning they just choose because they don't want to, but that happens in -- whether it's same-sex or heterosexual couples.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, I -- I think they should be bound to their parent, because there's a lot of adopted children and they are not thinking of biological moms and dads.   Sonia Sotomayor  You know, well --   Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I -- you know, the problem is that I don't actually accept your starting premise.  The right to marriage is, I think, embedded in our constitutional law.  It is a fundamental right. We've said it in a number of cases. The issue is you can't narrow it down to say, but is gay marriage fundamental? Has black-and-white marriage been treated fundamentally? The issue was starting from the proposition of, is the right to marry fundamental? And then is it compelling for a State to exclude a group of people?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And that, for me, is as -- as simple as the question gets.   Sonia Sotomayor  But that wasn't changed because of the recent gay marriages.   Sonia Sotomayor  In Massachusetts, we've got data that it's -- the rates have remained constant since they changed their laws.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, what -- what did that have to do with prisoners? If the States' interest is in fostering procreation between natural parents, the -- it seems to me that the prison who -- at issue did that.  It said you can get married if there's a child on the way.  And that would foster the -- or -- or promote the interest. We, instead, said, that's not enough.  The fundamental right to marry does bestow an important -- an important connection that we can't deprive the prisoner of, even if the prisoner at least at the moment and presumably those serving life sentences, have no chance of procreation.   Sonia Sotomayor  Now, could I -- could I -- because I don't -- if you want to finish answering Justice Scalia's --     I was going to say that -- that plural relationships raise all manner of questions that are not addressed by this State's current marriage laws.   Sonia Sotomayor  Sir, how about the co-sanguinity situation? Virtually all states would recognize cousins through marriage getting married, but there's at least one State that doesn't; right?     Well, I --   Sonia Sotomayor  Are you saying that that State is --     I think that the -- that the constitutional test is the one that the Court set forth in the Zablocki, which is does the State have a sufficiently important interest not to recognize it? And certainly in the case of incest, the State does have a sufficiently important interest.   Sonia Sotomayor  This is not incest. They're not biologically tied.     Well, the States that I'm aware of that have the rules against cousin marriage do so under their incest statutes, and they simply define incest in a broad way that would encompass cousins to marry. At some point, certainly the familial relationship is too extenuated that I don't think the State would have a sufficiently important justification.   Sonia Sotomayor  I thought your --     -- to marriages that use --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- your argument --     -- assisted reproduction.   Sonia Sotomayor  -- would be different. I thought that the States had never categorically passed a law declaring that a particular kind of marriage was against public policy.     That -- that is certainly another way in which --   Sonia Sotomayor  No one of the four States had ever done that?     They -- they have never done that.  They've never --   Sonia Sotomayor  Until the DOMA issue came up.     That -- that -- these laws are -- are out of character, unprecedented in the language of Romer in many respects.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, they --   Sonia Sotomayor  So you don't see --   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  You don't see a fundamental difference between creating a marriage and recognizing a marriage? You don't think there's any difference in terms of the rights of people? If States regularly don't say that the prerequisites to marriage in our State are not necessarily against public policy -- and they have said it for age differences, they have said it for a lot of things, why -- why would the gay marriage issue be so fundamental that that can lead them to exclude a whole category of people from recognition?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You think marriage --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- decrees are closer to laws?   Sonia Sotomayor  You think marriage decrees are closer to laws than they are to judgments?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I mean, you need to get a judgment to divorce.  And I think that, in my mind, that makes the decree much closer to a judgment than it does to a law.   Sonia Sotomayor  So what is an order under the Constitution, or --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- an act under the Constitution that's not a judgment?   Sonia Sotomayor  How do you separate out the terms that Justice Scalia gave you? They're not all judgments.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Three different terms were used, or four different terms were used.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Acts --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- records --   Sonia Sotomayor  That happens already. People who are not permitted to be married in a lot of States go and do that, and they come back to their home States, and the home States follow the rule of marriage celebration.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, they have --   Sonia Sotomayor  The prerequisites are always a State's judgment about marriage, about what should be a recognized marriage.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  They make exceptions.   Sonia Sotomayor  Oh, but you do that for adoptions.  What's -- what's the problem?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  This -- this is a really big deal?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Do you think that a State can fail to recognize the birth certificate of a particular -- another State?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Just that.  Do you think the word ""records"" in the Constitution includes birth certificates?   Sonia Sotomayor  So California without any reason, no suspicion of fraud, no anything, could it refuse to recognize another State's birth certificate?   Sonia Sotomayor  Records to me has to have a meaning.   Sonia Sotomayor  I recognize that that's an issue.   Sonia Sotomayor  But if a birth certificate were to be a record, don't you think a marriage certificate -- it's an official act of a State.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  As a record.   ",14-556X

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  Why is anybody --   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm having a problem with trying to understand why we're talking about a difference between any of the Amendments, the Fourth, the Fourteenth, or the Eighth.  The cruel and unusual punishment, I thought, was generally -- generally applicable to the sentence a prisoner receives. That's very different than to the application of -- of force separate from the -- from the sentence.  We're talking about whether and under what circumstances a prison guard or a prison is liable for using unnecessary force on another person. I don't think that taking any prisoner and for no reason -- arbitrary reason banging his head on the wall because you think that'll send the message to other prisoners would be acceptable, do you, under any of the Amendments?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So I -- I just don't quite understand the difference.  I think the issue is one, how -- how you instruct the jury.  And the government is saying you instruct the jury by saying you have a subjective intent to punish the prisoner -- you just want to beat him up; or you're inflicting harm that's not necessary or reasonable for a legitimate penological reason, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  Do you have a different standard than the government?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  Then yours is broader.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And explain why.  Why is the government standard not good enough?   Sonia Sotomayor  That I -- I understand. I'm just talking about the standard now.   Sonia Sotomayor  I still go back to my question: Why is there a difference at all? What you seem to be suggesting is that gratuitous violence, unnecessary violence, can be directed to pretrial and post-trial detainees.  Isn't your objection that unreasonable, unnecessary force is not permissible? Why are we giving a license to prison guards to use unreasonable or unnecessary force --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- against anybody?   Sonia Sotomayor  But they can't be punished corporally.  They can be denied good credit -- good time credit.  Do you think we could put them -- you can knock them against the wall as punishment?   Sonia Sotomayor  Not -- not in terms of discipline.  It may be that some matter, immediate need justifies that action, but are you suggesting that as punishment they could do it for unnecessary force? Unnecessary, not punishment -- or even punishment. They -- they looked -- they -- they said the -- a bad word to the prison officer.   Sonia Sotomayor  Can I --   Sonia Sotomayor  Can I -- I'm still struggling because we're trying to create boxes in a way that makes no sense to me.  There are all sorts of reasons for doing things, and the Eighth Amendment cases that we have, have to do with punishment qua not bringing control, not responding to a prison outbreak, or a fight, or anything else, but the types of conditions that are imposed on prisoners as punishment, i.e., you've broken an administrative rule, and now we're going to put you in shackles in the dark dungeon. We've already said in one case you can't do that.  You may subjectively and legitimately think that that will keep you constrained, but that's too far. It's not -- it's unwanted and unnecessarily cruel and unusual.  All right?   Sonia Sotomayor  But that's very different than this situation.  Whether it's a pretrial detainee or post-trial detainee, I don't think the Constitution gives you a free pass to punish a prisoner by inflicting unwanted corporal punishment.  I'm not talking about the conditions of -- of punishment; i.e., good time credit, solitary confinement, segregation of some sort, deprivation of a prison job you have.  That, clearly, you need an Eighth Amendment, sort of subjective intent element. I'm talking about the use of force for purposes of restoring discipline.  That's what this was about, wasn't it?   Sonia Sotomayor  So I keep saying why are we thinking about the necessity to impose subjective standards or any other standards or that they have to be different?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm even not sure why that's right.  Why -- you get a free -- the Constitution permits you to get a free kick in?   John F. Bash  That -- that's -- that is certainly --   Sonia Sotomayor  So if you walk by a prisoner and, you know, I want to establish discipline so I can freely kick them any time I want?   John F. Bash  That's certainly not what we're saying.  What we are saying is that the prohibition on what officers can do to convicted prisoners is they cannot punish them cruelly and unusually.  And it makes sense that this Court has upped the subjective intent standard with respect to convicted prisoners because it reflects that the constitutional prohibition is only cruel and unusual punishment.

The -- the defendant says, I wasn't resisting, I wasn't spreading my arms apart, I was just laying there, and they came and Tased me.  All right. The officers say instead he was pulling his arms and resisting it so we couldn't get the handcuffs open.  So assuming a jury credits the Petitioner, what would that do under -- how would that be evaluated under your test?   Sonia Sotomayor  Let's go back to -- that's why I keep trying to go back to what is the -- what are the -- under what circumstances and how does your test get to the gratuitous use of violence or the excessive use of violence where it's unnecessary?   Sonia Sotomayor  But that instruction is going to be given anyway.   Sonia Sotomayor  Under -- under the Bell v. Wolfish case, that presumption was given anyhow.   Sonia Sotomayor  But you're giving -- you're -- you're loading the deck completely, because you're instructing the jury first to give the police officers deference, and then you're now giving them an instruction that assumes that whatever they do is okay.

Sonia Sotomayor  Could you tell me how this is different than Arizona? I mean, in terms of the system, just like in the Arizona case, there had been precedent by this Court that Arizona law had been constitutional.  Unlike Arizona, every Florida -- every court that has looked -- every judge who's looked at it, not one of them has said that they believe personally it's constitutional.  Even the courts affirming -- affirm on the basis of the prior precedent, and you have a little less than half the Court directly saying it violates Ring.

Which makes them eligible for the death penalty?   Sonia Sotomayor  But you do agree that that -- it doesn't require unanimous jury?   Sonia Sotomayor  And a simple majority is all you need?   Sonia Sotomayor  So we don't have --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- an unanimous jury, even a functionally equivalent unanimous jury, finding those aggravators.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Could you -- the way I've thought of this -- and I know that in your brief you think de novo review goes to everything.  If I disagree with you, if I think that I have to give deference to the district court's factual finding on how this drug works, the -- how do you call it -- the --   Sonia Sotomayor  Midazolam, but that it's a legal question of whether how that drug works creates a risk of harm that's constitutionally intolerable.  Is that how you divide up the legal end?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So the facts are now. Now let's go to my real question, okay? That a judge ignores evidence is not necessarily an abuse of discretion or a clear error.  But -- so what are the clear errors in terms of the reasoning that the district court used?   Sonia Sotomayor  Do you even have to go that far? The State here doesn't even propose that their doctor was right on this point.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  They're not defending it, they don't say it's true.  They -- I -- conceded, as I read their brief, that it does not work the way the doctor said it worked, that it does not paralyze the brain, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  So it's clear error. Now we've got an admission that the expert was plainly wrong.  So how -- what else, I guess -- there was nothing else that the district court could have based its conclusion on, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, the one proof we do have is the Wood execution, not the one that was botched, but Mr. Wood was given 750 milligrams, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  And he laid writhing in pain for 20 minutes? 25 minutes? I don't remember how long.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, 2 hours.

But the little bit of research I've done has shown that the reason people don't use the other methods it's because it offends them to look at them.  Like you could use gas, that renders people not even knowing that they're going to sleep to die.  And people probably don't want to use that protocol because of what happened during World War II.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  What -- what's the --   Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I have a real problem with whatever you're reading, because I'm going to have to go back to that article.  I am substantially disturbed that in your brief you made factual statements that were not supported by the cited -- of those sources and in fact directly contradicted. I'm going to give you just three small examples among many I found.  So nothing you say or read to me am I going to believe, frankly, until I see it with my own eyes the context, okay? I'll give you a -- the three examples.  On pages 4 and 5 of your brief you cite, ""This drug's FDA approved label as holding that"" -- ""that this drug can get you to mild sedation and to deep levels of sedation virtually equivalent to the state of general anesthesia where the patient may require external support for vital functions."" But this quote was not on general use.  This quote came from the section of the FDA label where it was saying that this drug's effects, when taken with other drugs that suppress the central nervous system, this can happen.  That to me is -- really there is no other central nervous system drug at play in this protocol. On page 6, you cite the --   Sonia Sotomayor  No, sir.  Go --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But you didn't -- you quoted this for the proposition that it could cause a fatality because of the depression of -- or it could produce general anesthesia.   Sonia Sotomayor  Sure, but he said it's in old people. I'm -- you know, there have been 80 deaths from therapeutic doses of this drug.  It's -- this is almost like you saying because 80 people have died from the use of one aspirin, that means that if I give people 100 aspirins, they're going to die.  It's just not logical.  Obviously, people die from anything that you give them, that's why there are hospital fatalities in every procedure and why there's -- that -- but 80 among the millions that are given this drug don't die. So my point is, what -- the FDA is saying the general anesthesia effect is only going to happen when you have a central nervous drug -- central nervous system drug.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, they put it in that section.   Sonia Sotomayor  Exactly.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  Let me give you a second example: The Melvin study.  The Melvin study says this is how it happened.  It gave this drug in doses of .02 to .06, and what it showed was that at .06 dose, there was less effect than at .02. And he said, this suggests that there is a ceiling effect to this drug and that it is less potent as you go in higher doses. Now, you quoted for saying -- and you took out the eclipse -- there may be a ceiling -- you quote it by saying that, ""The Melvin study for the position that studies on humans have found that the anesthetic effect of midazolam increased linearly with dosage and estimate that 2milligrams is enough for full surgical anesthetic."" But what Melvin actually said, after pointing out that the ceiling effect is shown by his study, he says, ""But presuming there were no ceiling effect, extrapolation of our data suggests that such a dose would be sufficient."" You took out that --   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, we're back.  Well, we're back to is their a ceiling effect? The judge here said, does it matter?   Sonia Sotomayor  But --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that's the clear error here.  It starts right there.  Because the reason Evans thought that it worked -- paralyzed the brain is because he thought this worked on the spinal cord.  And nobody argues it works on the spinal cord, number one. And, number two, this is not a central nervous system drug.  That's the barbiturates.  This is -- works very differently than barbiturates.   Sonia Sotomayor  Depressant, but it's not a --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Exactly.  It has no pain-relieving qualities.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You're right, it -- it -- but it's still -- I don't know where you're getting -- Justice -- Justice Breyer said, the proof of that.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You're unconscious, but that doesn't tell me that you're not feeling pain, or that a noxious stimulant like being burned alive won't cause pain. Look at what happens with the intubations. They paralyze your throat, they give you this drug, but they're paralyzing your throat, and that has its own anesthetic effect and pain relief. So what you're arguing is very different from what's happening here.  They're putting a chemical inside of you that's burning you to death.  That is the most noxious stimuli I can think of.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, they paralyze them also with the throat local anesthetic.  I mean, I read it.   Sonia Sotomayor  Sure, it's a first line in a lot of things --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But it doesn't keep you in an anesthetic state forever.  It doesn't keep you during the procedure --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- during surgeries.   Sonia Sotomayor  In some.

Do you believe that's an appropriate rule? Are you suggesting a different approach to the question?   INTERRUPTING ",14-8349
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Well, the problem is I don't think this is discretionary review.  The Eleventh Circuit found it's not under Georgia law.  Read its opinion.  It seems pretty grounded in the stated law of Georgia.   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you give me the -- the Reed v. -- what?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  I'm so confused I can't even -- (Laughter.)   Sonia Sotomayor  The State habeas process is different than the regular appeal process.   Sonia Sotomayor  On the regular appeal process, they look at each case -- each case with discretion.   Sonia Sotomayor  Okay.  In State habeas they have a rule, an internal rule that says, we'll take every habeas case unless it's -- has no arguable merit, right?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  In the positive.   Sonia Sotomayor  So what would lend us to believe that they didn't look at the merits and say there was no arguable merit? That they just said, we're too busy.  We don't care if there is arguable merit. Do you believe they did that?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  What?   Sonia Sotomayor  So that is a decision on the merits.  There is no arguable merits.   Sonia Sotomayor  Okay.   Sonia Sotomayor  Now it's clear.   Sonia Sotomayor  Why?   Sonia Sotomayor  Were we told that the only three people who did the investigation on Batson were the two prosecutors on the case and Mr. Lundy? So if Mr. Lundy says I didn't make that list, it has to be one of the two prosecutors.   Sonia Sotomayor  Didn't the habeas court --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- provide an excuse and say -- I'm sorry.   Sonia Sotomayor  Didn't the habeas court accept that he didn't know at the time of trial, but he just knew that Lundy didn't want her?   Sonia Sotomayor  But that was his explanation for why the prosecutor didn't know about the prior arrest, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  That Mr. Lundy didn't want her.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That Mr. Lundy didn't want her.  He never credited or never said that he knew this -- that he knew about the arrest.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Lundy did, but the prosecutor didn't.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What did they do with the failure to ask Ms. Garrett any questions about the issues that troubled the -- troubled, for example, her cousin's arrest.  There's an assumption that she has a relationship with this cousin.  I have cousins who I know have been arrested, but I have no idea where they're in jail.  I hardly -- I don't know them.  So -- but he didn't ask any questions.  Doesn't that show pretext? I don't -- I'm not going to inquire because she might get off the hook on that.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, stealing hubcaps, in my mind, is decidedly different than murdering people or attacking them the way this case was -- this case was about.  I -- I can imagine a -- why can't you imagine a father saying, it was stealing hubcaps --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- he should have been punished?

So I don't see how this could be -- putting aside the class action, putting aside the attorneys' fees, those appear to me to be fairly critical liability determinations that were not made by the court below.   Sonia Sotomayor  Why can't it -- why can't it do that in the context of a summary judgment motion? I mean, why does it have to moot the case? Wouldn't the appropriate vehicle be a summary judgment motion in which you admit the facts that make you liable, or you concede the facts that make you liable? And then you fight about the legal questions?   Sonia Sotomayor  But I -- but what's an Article III determination is whether he or it or she is entitled to the relief that they asked for.

In the common law, I can't find any situation in which a court accepted a offer that wasn't accepted by the party.  In the railroad cases, what they found was that an offer was made and the other side, by taking money, accepted the offer.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Have you found any case in the common law that -- where there was an offer that was unaccepted, was entered by the Court?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Garre, the only way that I see a Court entering judgment in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is a Rule 56 judgment. Someone moves and says, you got everything you're entitled to.  The other side comes back and says, no, I'm entitled to attorneys' fees, I'm entitled to whatever.  And the Court says, no, you're not, this is a full satisfaction, I enter judgment. I don't know why we have to make a merits determination based solely on an unaccepted offer of judgment.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Garre, I am so confused by your argument.  You get to say on your own, unilaterally, I offered you complete relief.  Even though, right or wrong, the plaintiff is asking for a particular injunction and a particular attorney's fee. You, without any judicial interpretation, intervention, get to moot the case on your terms.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What happens if you hadn't done that? Let's assume that he was entitled to attorneys' fees.  Who's -- when does that decision get made and by whom?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That a complete offer has been made?

Burns made it very clear that we were deferring to the State because it had a legitimate reason for its need. And -- but Burns was in the 1960s, when we picked total population as a perfectly legitimate way because there's a representational need at issue as well.  Not just voting.

If you have a corrupted legal process where what the independent adjudicator is looking at is not true because it's based on false information, have you received legal process -- proper legal process?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor   And so I thought you've never received it, then doesn't your time to accrue for the improper detention occur when you're no longer detained?  Here, it was the not guilty; correct?   Sonia Sotomayor   So it's not a of whether -- when it starts.  The question is:  When does the illegal detention finish?   Sonia Sotomayor   And because you have there's been no intermediate force, no intermediary stepping in and breaking the chain of causation; correct?   Sonia Sotomayor   Am I understanding argument correctly?   Sonia Sotomayor   No, but I'm -- I -- I the only way I could think of it was thinking of it in this way, because you're not claiming malicious prosecution or not.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor   So detention probable --   Sonia Sotomayor   What happens to person who's let out on bail?  Are they out of luck under your theory?   Sonia Sotomayor   Are you defining ""detention"" as broadly as Justice Ginsburg was?   Sonia Sotomayor   Without legal.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor   You're saying improper legal process.   Sonia Sotomayor   Is it a detention you've described this in various ways.  Is it a detention without constitutional probable cause?  Is it a detention with -- with no proper legal process?  Where exactly is the Fourth Amendment violation?  Because in false arrest and false imprisonment claims, according to Wallace, as soon as you get legal process, there's been an intervening end to the false imprisonment because someone else has imprisoned you. So what remains in this case?  How do we define the constitutional violation so --   Sonia Sotomayor   All right.  So stop.  I understand you so far. The question presented was, I think -- I don't have it -- I do have it here. ""So whether an individual's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure continues beyond legal process so as to allow a malicious prosecution claim based upon the Fourth Amendment."" The Chief Justice was right.  The question presented is, does the Fourth Amendment consonance house a malicious prosecution claim, which is something very different than what you're describing as a Fourth Amendment seizure and detention without legal process.   Ilana Eisenstein   That's correct, Your Because in our view, the constitutional inquiry is step one, but step two is to determine the elements and accrual date and other prerequisites to suit under our Section 1983 tort.  And in that instance, the accrual may be governed by the closest common law analogy. When the challenge at its core is arguing that the wrongful prosecution and the wrongful institutional process led to the detention without probable cause, in our view, the closest analogy is a malicious prosecution suit, and that that --   Sonia Sotomayor   But are you we have to take every element of the -- whatever the elements are?  Because from what I understand from the briefing, malicious prosecution is defined differently from State to State. So if that's the case, what are the elements that you see for a 1983 claim?  Does it include malice?   Ilana Eisenstein   Your Honor, we do not that a constitutional tort under 1983 simply adopts common law or State tort elements of malicious prosecution.  Only the accrual rule is -- as based on this Court's decision in Heck and Wallace are taken up by the common law analogy. In terms of malice, no, Your Honor, we don't think malice, as it's known in common law or most State courts, is an element of this kind of claim.  We do advocate that this Court treat a probable cause determination underlying a criminal charge the same way it treats a probable cause determination underlying a search warrant, which includes the Franks standard.  We don't think of that as a malice standard of common law, but rather, an extension of the Franks doctrine.   Sonia Sotomayor   In a State court proceeding, the State analogue, what would be the rule of accrual ending?  You get convicted; you don't find out about the false testimony until habeas, State or Federal. When, in that situation, would accrual occur?   Ilana Eisenstein   In our view, when the was dismissed or overturned, Your Honor.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor   You know, it's not as if most States don't receive that kind of notice in these situations.  The defendants are just not believed in most, until some independent evidence is discovered long after the conviction.  In my experience -- and you can point to one that's different -- I've never come across any of these cases where any defendant falsely accused of a crime hasn't vigorously announced his or her innocence and vigorously tried to tell the authorities this police officer is corrupt.

We're talking about total fabrication.  You have so many other ways out of liability, qualified immunity, Franks. There are so many other protections against the State and individual officers for -- for errors. But why should we worry about you not receiving notice?   ",14-9496

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, no, no, no.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I know you're saying they don't need to do it.  I said put it aside and answer Justice Ginsburg's question.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If they had to use race, how are they using it improperly?   Sonia Sotomayor  My God, that sounds like it's using race more rather than less than this plan does.   Sonia Sotomayor  How does that --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You still haven't answered why this is worse than Bakke.  I mean --   Sonia Sotomayor  How is race given --   Sonia Sotomayor  How is race given a plus? I -- I thought that what they're looking for is leaders in diversity, not just of race, but of experiences generally.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So how --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I think your brief admitted that this isn't in favor of any particular race, that white people in some situations can show leadership, as -- as well as black or Hispanic or Asian or Native American.  Any race could benefit from this plus factor.  So how is this --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- worse than Bakke?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  I thought that the study they did showed that in 1996, they had more participation in these smaller classes.  I don't know if they're really small when they're somewhere between eight and 25 people.  That was a -- but there were more of those classes in 1996 than in 2003 or '2 when they were looking at that study. It would seem to me that that suggests that there's less -- what they took from it, that there's less exchange of ideas in a classroom rather than more, based on this race-neutral policy.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What's wrong -- since you have to infer these things, you can't use a quota.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You're saying we can't -- they can't use demographics.  So they use a study that shows there's less classes.  There's less people in classes.  They talk to administrators, faculty, and students.  They're having racial incidents on campus where students of color are complaining that they feel isolated, that stereotyping is going on, on campus. What more do they need?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could I --   Sonia Sotomayor  May I ask --   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  I thought you said --   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  I'm not sure where you get that number.  As I look at it, between 2004 and 2006 -- '7, it nearly doubled from 3.6 of the holistic class to 6.8.  For Hispanic students -- that's for blacks -- it went from 11.6 to 16.9.  I don't think that's -- that small a change. In 2008, two -- 20 percent of all black students and 15 percent of all Hispanic students were offered admission through holistic review.  Black and Hispanic admission and enrollment rates have increased since 2005.  This is on -- on holistic review.  The only exception was 2008, and that was because 92 percent of the class came in under the 10 percent plan.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  When your number --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- that's not small.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, wait a minute.  I don't understand how that can be.  If the 2004 number was that much lower than the 2007 number, race has to have some input in that fact -- in that --   Sonia Sotomayor  Could I ask you a different question now? I fear something.  I know there is an educational debate on the benefits and costs of a 10 percent plan.  I don't want to get into that debate, but I do have a worry, which is: If you're reading proof of a compelling need, or proof of a compelling need, will any holistic review ever survive? Because as I'm reading your answer, to narrowly tailor, schools have to use nonracial means of doing it.  And if the 10 percent plan is the only thing that achieves a greater number in minorities, won't every school have to use a 10 percent plan?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So your answer is yes. If there's no other --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- way of doing it, then the only other race-neutral way -- if offering scholarships, which this university did, increasing outreach to minority neighborhoods, they did and continue to do -- there's a list of about six or eight other things they did that didn't increase the admission of minorities.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Do you think -- do you think that change has to happen overnight? And do you think it's --   Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I -- I -- what you're saying, basically, is, is this is what the Fifth Circuit concluded and which the school basically agrees, okay? If you don't consider race, then holistic percentage, whatever it is, is going to be virtually all white.   Sonia Sotomayor  All white.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  No.  I -- I think Justice Ginsburg's question is, the original divorce decree here said Petitioner's entitled to and is awarded as her sole and separate property 50 percent of Respondent's military retirement.  If it had read Petitioner's entitled to $250 a month, period, full stop, to ensure that that is received by her, she'll get $250 a month from his Military Retirement Pay.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So could she go back to court now and ask for a dollar figure instead?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  She can't go back into court -- I thought in divorce courts you can go back and change circumstances and seek a modification of the monetary awards.  Why can't she do that?   Sonia Sotomayor  So is -- is --   Sonia Sotomayor  So how could he take any action that impinges on what's her money or her property right?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I think that's the U.S.'s position and your adversary's, which is, if, as a result of the original settlement divorce decree, it became her property, what right did he have any -- to take any action that would remove that property or take it away from her?   Sonia Sotomayor  The problem is, really, that when people are getting divorced and they already know they can't divide up the disability pay, that the courts have a full picture and can then determine alimony and child custody with those factors in mind. And we presume that, at the time of their divorce, this woman was relying on a certain amount of income that would be fixed for the rest of her life, and she planned her life around that income.  And he has now taken an act independent of her and not just reducing her income, but with her reduction of income, he's also getting a tax benefit.  So he's getting, you know, whatever, 20 percent, a third more than she is by this unilateral act. In terms of policy, that is a substantially different impact --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- and one that, you know, the government is taking the position that if you're doing this post-divorce, you're changing the nature of the policy.   Sonia Sotomayor  No.  But what I'm saying to you, as a matter of policy, is that right?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I don't -- I mean, I don't know the answer legally, but is -- there is a difference in terms of what Congress might have expected or not expected.

Does that mean that the FDA can't announce its intent to approve on year 12 plus 1 earlier than year 12, or -- I'm not quite sure I understand. How long does it take for the FDA to approve the biosimilar? Assuming you go through Phase I, and there is -- and Phase II has been finished.  How long -- those run independent of the FDA approval, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  So how long -- I want you to go back to Justice Kennedy, but I just want to get a sense of timing.  How long does it generally take for the FDA to say, this is okay effective 12 plus 1?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, no.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm trying to get the process down.   Sonia Sotomayor  It takes them 10 months.   Sonia Sotomayor  Let's assume you put in an application in year 4.  Do they have to wait until when to announce that it's okay?   Sonia Sotomayor  When do they tell you that they will?   Sonia Sotomayor  Can I go back to the beginning of Justice Breyer's question.  He made an assumption that until the approval of the product, that the other side won't know exactly what it is that's going to be approved, particularly in a situation like this, where you -- you've kept your application from them so they don't have it. Take -- address that issue.  In your brief you say they can get it.  They can get it from the industry, from the SEC filings, from -- from FDA talk, all of that stuff.  But that won't tell them exactly what it is that you're intending to market. So -- or the other side -- how -- how would you know? If you start a declaratory-judgment action, as you're entitled to do, wouldn't you know then? Couldn't you get it in discovery?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could it -- could the company with the product file a declaratory-judgment action when they don't know what you're going to do? Do they have a good-faith basis for believing you're going to infringe if they don't have the application to look at until they get discovery?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Tell me how.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  If the biosimilar files a notice of intent to file the application and a copy of the application, if it complies with all of the steps in Phase 1, does it estop the bio -- the -- the licensed product holder from seeking a declaratory-judgment action?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's assuming good faith.  And that's the next question, which is if you -- if the biosimilar doesn't comply, you're saying the other side can sue.  But what happens if you do comply? Can the other side -- and the other side fails to, they -- they don't give you the notice that they're required to.  They don't do something that's required on their part in that exchange process.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What is your biosimilars remedy in that case?   Sonia Sotomayor  All incentives have a way of failing.  Just look at our society.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So -- (Laughter.)   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Yang, do --   Anthony A. Yang  -- about a statute.  And the statute --   Sonia Sotomayor  Do we have your assurances that this is the FDA's position?   Anthony A. Yang  It is the FDA's position.  It is the PTO's position.  We have --   Sonia Sotomayor  Has it been a consistent position in other situations? I don't know if it gets --   Anthony A. Yang  Yeah.   Sonia Sotomayor  -- opinion letters or -- or --   Anthony A. Yang  Well, they've not issued opinions on how this works, so I don't know of anything that's inconsistent.  I believe --   Sonia Sotomayor  In any litigation, have they taken a different position?   Anthony A. Yang  No, not that I know of.   Sonia Sotomayor  So you're asking us, assuming, just an assumption for the sake of argument, that we rule in your favor and say, as you've asked us to say, that a declaratory judgment is the -- that -- the only remedy available, and there is no Federal injunction that's possible here, do we vacate and remand for the court below to decide whether State law provides --   Anthony A. Yang  No, I think the best -- the best way for the Court to decide is what's required under the statute.  The cause of action, if you do that, you'd leave open questions of State law and preemption.  The cleanest way is just to resolve what the statute requires in the --   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, so I say the statute says -- we say the statute says that.   Anthony A. Yang  If the statute --   Sonia Sotomayor  What are we doing? We're saying the State law is moot?   Anthony A. Yang  No, because there's no State law claim.  If you're complying with the Federal statute, there is no State law claim.  The State law would piggyback on the Federal law. I also want to address the question that the Court had earlier about no -- you know, you have to know what's licensed in order to -- to identify your claims. That's --   Sonia Sotomayor  If it's not preempted, how would it be mooted?   Anthony A. Yang  It would just fail, just like on (l)(2), the Federal Circuit said, you're complying with Federal law, therefore, you have no State law claim, because your State law claim is predicated on violating the Federal law.  It would be the same for both. So the reason --   Sonia Sotomayor  But that begs the question on the question we're not looking at, but it begs the question on point 2 -- on the first point which is, is it a requirement that the biosimilar applicant give over the application.  It is certainly a requirement of the statute, the remedy may be file a declaratory-judgment action.   Anthony A. Yang  And the exclusive remedy, and which would answer -- that would --   Sonia Sotomayor  That goes back to preemption.   Anthony A. Yang  Well, no, I think that would answer.  You would say that this is the -- your complying with the statute is a mandatory condition precedent to continue on the path to take all of these steps, but if you don't, and the statute provides an off-ramp, you're not violating the statute.  Congress contemplated that path. Now, on the question of licensure, remember, you have to identify at the very beginning what all the patents are at the (l)(3) stage.  One of the consequences is, if the sponsor fails to identify the patents on the list, the sponsor can never bring an infringement action.  Period.  This is 271(e)(2) -- (e)(6)(A) and (B)  And so the -- the consequence is that if you get at the end and you're like, oh, something is new, something I didn't think about, you're -- you have no artificial infringement action, because the list has been established before.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  How -- I'll phrase a -- I'll --   Sonia Sotomayor  I'll put a question before you, okay? As I understand -- I got your position, which is that they have to give notice after the FDA approval, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Wouldn't that stop Phase 2 litigation from starting immediately? By your definition, they could go the biosimilar and the license --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- product could go all through round 1.  They've now narrowed their dispute.  I thought round 2 involved disputes about other patents, not the ones that they narrowed.  And so wouldn't your reading always force round 2 into the post-license 12-year period? I thought the whole purpose of the statute was to get round 1 and round 2 done and done before the 12-year period was finished.   Sonia Sotomayor  No, no, no.  You still haven't answered my question.   Sonia Sotomayor  You're assuming -- you're assuming commercial launch has to be 12 years plus 6.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm assuming that commercial launch should be 12 plus 1 --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- because you only have an exclusive license for 12 years.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That strengthens my argument.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Because if the FDA is taking that position, then it's basically kicking off the possibility of round 2 pretty early.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That -- that's -- no. It's not quite that.  ""Shall"" is if you want to invoke this Federal process, this is what you have to do.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right? So if you don't invoke the Federal process, what remains? That's not a remedy.  That's a different Federal process, the declaratory-judgment process.  That's what (C) says. Under your reading, (B) and (C) become superfluous, because if you can get a State law information-exchange provision under (C) or -- or under State law, why give the remedy of starting a declaratory-judgment action at all?   Sonia Sotomayor  But that --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- that -- really, the State law would end up, under your theory, forcing a biosimilar to invoke Phase I.  Because at every stage, you -- where they choose to opt out, they -- you will just run to court and say, my State law remedy is force them to take the next step.  Give me the application, then identify, then do this.  You're going to -- there's no longer a choice.   Sonia Sotomayor  You're -- you're just -- all you're saying to me is that there's built-in incentives --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- for the applicant to invoke and participate in phase 1.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What you're not telling me is, it's no longer a choice --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- because State law can force them --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- through you seeking injunctions to participate unwillingly.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Can I ask you a question? And that is -- meaning -- the only claims that are exempted under the Act are Bivens claims, which are constitutional violations.  Why is it that an employee who has committed a constitutional violation is now immune from suit merely because the plaintiff's lawyer made a mistake and didn't file a Bivens claim first?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I don't blame you for that, but you didn't litigate multiple times here.  The exemption applied immediately, and the case was over.

There was no explicit statement.  What the Court did was look at the statute, the endangered species statute, look at its words, and decide that ""any person"" meant any person and decided it did away with the zone of interests. Here, we have a Congress in 1988 taking the word ""aggrieved,"" which was in the -- in Title VII and many other statutes but undefined.  And what it did was take the definition looked at by prior regulations, examined by this Court in its three cases establishing Article III standing, and put in a definition of ""aggrieved"" that is very different from the normal definition.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why is that --   Sonia Sotomayor  So --   Sonia Sotomayor  So what do we do with all of the statements in Havens? I'm quoting.  ""There is little significance in the difference between direct and indirect injuries for purposes of filing suit under the FHA.  Trafficante.  While members of minority groups were damaged the most from discrimination, the proponents of the legislation emphasize that those who were not the direct objects of discrimination had an interest in ensuring fair housing.""   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I mean --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- we have repeatedly said --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- the difference between direct and indirect, it has no meaning in the statute.  The foreseeability always has meaning.   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Gannon, how do -- how do we write it? Let's take the corner grocer who had a running account with that home or the gardener who every week cleaned the property.  I doubt someone who is in foreclosure can afford a gardener, but let's assume that possibility.  Why -- how do we write that the City has standing and its injuries are proximately caused, but those people don't?   Curtis E. Gannon  I think --   Sonia Sotomayor  The company shareholder. What's -- how do we say it?   Curtis E. Gannon  The link that we see is -- is to property value, and that's the injury that the Court already recognized in Gladstone. This is a question of congressional intent. When you're -- when you're construing proximate cause, you're trying to figure out what Congress intended. This Court had already recognized that a city was directly injured by decreased property value.  The same thing it said was true of the neighbors in Gladstone. The neighbors that had their property values diminished were able to recover. I would say that the corner store, to the extent that it has its property values diminished, is situated just like one of those neighbors.  To the extent that it's talking about something else like lost profits or the utility company is complaining they lost a customer, those things, we think, are further afield and not so closely connected.  And proximate cause has traditionally done that type of --   Sonia Sotomayor  So your answer --   Sonia Sotomayor  Your answer, I think, to the question is that it's limited to those cognizable suits contemplated by the statute, and you see contemplated by the statute as having to do with the possession or value of the property?   Curtis E. Gannon  We think that the -- the harms that flow directly from changes in property value were ones that Congress contemplated, both in 1968, and certainly in 1988, after this Court had already -- had already enumerated that as a particular type of harm that was at issue here. And we don't think that the City should have to establish that there's been a change in racial composition of the neighborhood in order to bring a suit, because the Fair Housing Act is intended to cover -- is intended to prohibit discriminatory housing practices throughout the United States, and that includes segregated communities that aren't changing if there is discrimination.

Guess-estimate, I use it in its colloquial sense of you're -- you're looking at what happened and you're cutting broadly at the lines because you can never set the line precisely. But as Justice -- as the Chief Justice said on the Heat Rise test, there was one expert that was questioned, but would have been questioned in a totally different way if the proper tests had been disclosed. Why was that causal decision by the district court wrong?   Sonia Sotomayor  No, but they -- they -- the district court asked you to tell them what you thought wasn't caused, assuming that you accepted the district court's findings.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Am I to understand the question presented -- as presented was whether there is a direct causation standard applicable to an award under a court's inherent powers.  And you're now saying we wanted a but-for incremental cost analysis to define direct cause.  Then ask your adversary how he would define it if it was going to be applied. But you're also asking us to actually apply it in your case.  And to review the district court's findings de novo or on abuse of discretion?   Sonia Sotomayor  When you gave this figure to the district court you said, in your submission, ""Goodyear reviewed plaintiffs' billing entries and created a category of cost."" I'm quoting you.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  I thought the Johnson, two features at issue were the fact that we were asking courts to imagine what the ordinary crime was, and there was no way to even think about what that was. Your adversary points out, with burglary, if the ordinary crime is during the day, there's one level of risk.  If it's at night, there's a different level of risk.  The nature of the entry is at question, whether it's forcible or merely walking through an open door uninvited.  It may be easier with burglary for lots of reasons, but there -- the level of what -- or what constitutes an ordinary crime was somewhat at the center of Johnson.  Why isn't it at the center here?   Sonia Sotomayor  I remember the government arguing in Johnson that most people who are found with sawed-off shotguns are committing crimes. Why isn't that a substantial risk of force being used?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If statistically -- if statistically -- and I don't remember the statistics now, but they were very clear then that a huge amount -- number of the crimes of possession of a shotgun were -- led to criminal activity.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, the use of force is not necessary for the use of -- for burglary if you walk in and there's nobody there.  You take what you find.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So we're now going back to gut instinct.   Sonia Sotomayor  That observation was at a time before the draconian effects of removal and deportation came into effect.  We now have lifetime bars, which were rarely or on very limited circumstances imposed previously.  We have many more criminal sanctions with harsher sentences now.  I think more than anything we have often said that vagueness depends on the gravity of what is at stake.  Today what's at stake is a lot more than what was at stake decades ago.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And there is always the fail safe that the Attorney General in his or her discretion can deny -- can deny anyone the right to stay here.  But if we're going to ask immigration judges to impose the consequences that they do today, don't we need something that's not arbitrary?   Sonia Sotomayor  That's if you concentrate on us, but I did read those portions of Respondent's brief and the amici brief, and it does seem like we are going to have a redux Sykes and a redux James and a redux many of the issues.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  There were some --   Sonia Sotomayor  There were some who argued in the drunken driving test that the minute you get behind the car, you -- drunk, you're using a lethal weapon, a car, to inflict injury on others.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Didn't win here, but that argument was still being made in the courts below and some courts below bought it.   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Kneedler, does that permit arbitrary removal? Can the immigration officials walk down the street and say I just don't like the way you look; out?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But -- but let me get to that.  So whether the distinction is criminal or civil, the issue for us, as I understand it under Johnson, is, is it arbitrary? Is it so arbitrary that under any standard, criminal or civil, this is vague? Now, I know you're saying it's not arbitrary for a bunch of different reasons. But please explain to me on the two grounds that Johnson used, ordinary case and type of risk, how this is not equally arbitrary.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I thought it was only two.  The other things it mentioned were --   Sonia Sotomayor  So how do those two things change the definition of what an ordinary case is in burglary? The only time that I understand that burglars actually go into an occupied home is very little.  It's probably less than 10 percent in which they confront someone, probably smaller amount when they actually use force against that person. Lots of burglaries are done with open doors or with jimmying without injuring a lock. How does any of those two things you've mentioned -- how do they change what constitutes an ordinary case for burglary and what the substantial risk of use of physical force or injury is?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Justice Scalia did exactly that in Johnson and said the ordinary case and the risk of force or injury is something that you're leaving to the judge's intuition.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it wasn't part of the residual clause anyway.   Sonia Sotomayor  But Kneedler -- Mr. Kneedler, the crime of moral turpitude is always applied to the facts of the case.  So Johnson pointed out that, when you have a statute that uses approximations like substantial or significant or severe, that what gives it life is its application to actual facts. The difference between these two approaches is that this one is asking judges to hypothesize the facts and has nothing to do with the reality of the crime.   Sonia Sotomayor  How about statutory rape?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  To start with, they know -- the courts below --   Sonia Sotomayor  Is that the ordinary case? I thought that most of the pornography cases that we're seeing are children not being physically forced into sex but being tricked into it by caretakers or -- or talked into it, et cetera?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  One may have personal views about whether an adult can ever not be using improper --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So it doesn't surprise you --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It doesn't surprise you that the courts below are split on this question, just the way they were under   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I get that you don't want to answer the question. (Laughter.)   Sonia Sotomayor  But I'm really -- I'm very interested in the answer, which is Justice Gorsuch is -- is asking how you -- where do you draw the line? So acceptable civil vagueness and non-acceptable civil vagueness?     Well, Your Honor --   Sonia Sotomayor  Or vagueness generally.     Hoffman Estates says that it varies.  So what we're talking about is the line between the severest penalties and those penalties that are less severe. The answer is, if it is on a par with a criminal punishment such that someone would trade one for the other, this Court answered that question in Lee. In Lee, this Court said, as Justice Gorsuch said earlier today, most people would happily take a little bit extra time in prison in order to avoid the consequence of deportation.

Ann O'Connell Adams  We don't think the Court should reach the question in this case.  We've briefed both tribal sovereign immunity and official immunity, so the Court has the whole scope of how immunity defenses should operate in a case like this.  And we certainly wanted the Court to be aware of our views on official immunity.  We wouldn't want the Court to write anything in its opinion about tribal sovereign immunity that would preclude a defense of official immunity from being raised in this case or by other tribal employees sued in the future. But the Connecticut supreme court decided this question as a matter of tribal sovereign immunity, and that's the question before the Court.  So we think it's appropriate for the Court to decide the tribal sovereign immunity question and remand to the Connecticut supreme court, which could address official immunity to the extent --   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  What would we write that you think would affect official immunity? As I was reading your brief, I was trying to figure that out.   Ann O'Connell Adams  Well --   Sonia Sotomayor  Because you're basically announcing a rule that in individual-capacity suits, sovereign immunity is not implicated unless the remedy sought implicates the tribe directly. What else could we write that would preclude official immunity?   Ann O'Connell Adams  Well, I think, Justice Sotomayor, these -- as you can tell from the Connecticut supreme court's decision in this case and the cases cited therein, these two concepts often confused or conflated with one another in lower courts.  And so we just wanted to be absolutely clear what we think the United States' view is on each of those separate questions so that the Court -- you know, so that the Court wouldn't write anything in a tribal sovereign immunity opinion that would affect official immunity.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, Mr. Clarke is arguing that if you're going to go back to the common law official immunity doctrine, that covered, as our Westfall case indicated, even nondiscretionary acts; that it covered every act.  What's your position on that?   Ann O'Connell Adams  Westfall said the opposite. So the -- the case they're looking to is Barr v. Mateo.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  I confused the cases.   Ann O'Connell Adams  But in Westfall, the Court said that view of what the Federal common law provided was a mistaken reading of Barr v. Mateo.  And it's this Court that tells us what the Federal common law is.  In Westfall, the Court describes that as an immunity only for discretionary decisionmaking functions on behalf of sovereign employees, but not for anything else.   ",15-1500

I do think, as I'm reading all of the briefs in this case, that the issue is how much weight should we be giving to the State boundary lines, the State property lines. You say as a denominator on the takings claim, there -- it's fixed.  You used the word ""presumption"" in your brief, but you haven't explained to me what overcomes the State boundary line -- property lines, so I don't think the word ""presumption"" has any meaning in your brief. Others, like St. Croix and -- and the government, and embedded in Justice Breyer's question, thinks the denominator should be a more nuanced calculation, although St. Croix, Wisconsin, and the Solicitor General seem to have a different weight to that. So let's start with, is yours a fixed presumption? Does anything ever overcome it?   Sonia Sotomayor  Or is it, under every circumstance, the denominator?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What over --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- comes that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What overcomes that?   Sonia Sotomayor  So what's the difference between that and the factors that the other parties are using that says look at how the property's been used over time. Here, the family has a house on one parcel, a volleyball court and a barbecue storage area on another.  They use the other parcel -- house on one side, the other parcel has access to the beach.  The house has not had an economic value to the children.  It was there.  They're using it.

I've had a problem with the appraisal figures, and it may be a step I'm missing. Why would anybody pay $400,000 for a lot they can't build on?   Richard J. Lazarus  Because --   Sonia Sotomayor  The two values -- your example said the two lots put together are less valuable, or more valuable?   Richard J. Lazarus  Just a little less valuable.   Sonia Sotomayor  Yeah.  I know there's only a ten percent difference.  But as I understood the appraisal figures, and are now using estimates, each lot was worth about 350 and 400,000 separately, for a value of 750.  Together they were valued at 680.  So they weren't -- you didn't double the price --   Richard J. Lazarus  No.  But what you do -- if -- you didn't lose very much.  By not being able to build a second home, the value doesn't sort of halve.  Instead, the value goes only by -- down by nine percent.  And the reason is that the combined lot is this luxury lot. This is a high-end area --   Sonia Sotomayor  I understand why the combination, but why would anybody buy the lot you can't develop on?   Richard J. Lazarus  Well, the question is not the -- what the value of Lot E as a unit that you can't develop or -- or build on.  The question is what the value of Lot E is to the Murrs, who also own Lot F, because that's how you define what the burden is to them.  And the burden to them -- if -- if someone only owned Lot E, then the hardship exemption would apply and they could build.  That's exactly the distinction that the ordinance draws between the two.   Sonia Sotomayor  The problem I have with your test, which has the -- the three components, is I don't actually see anywhere in there any weight given to the State property lines.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  Well --   Sonia Sotomayor  You don't explicitly list it among those three items.  You don't tell us how you're weighing it or not weighing it, what presumptions you're giving it or not.  So where does it fit in to your -- your -- your three factors?   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  We think that it frequently goes to the functional considerations because it shapes expectations about how land can properly be used, whether it's an entirely separate and distinct issue. So we do think that there's a role for State law to play.  And here we think, actually, that's one of the --   Sonia Sotomayor  If we think there should be more of a role, where would you put it? St. Croix puts it on the second prong.  Where would you end up putting it, and why do you disagree with how they use it?   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  I think it's very important not to adopt any kind of presumption or bright line rule for the relevant parcel.  And so I also would put it on the second prong of conducting the Penn Central analysis. But the reason for that is because the relevant parcel that the threshold definitional question is going to provide the touchstone that contextualizes the whole rest of the takings inquiry.  And if the Court were to artificially narrow it and look only at lot lines, or to presumptive weight to those lot lines, then that's going to be the focal point for measuring economic impact for looking at investment-backed expectations.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I actually think they did it -- the parents did it after the ordinance's, from my timeline, creation.  The ordinance was passed in 1976.  And in 1982, the parents took the property under common ownership from the Atlantic Plumbing Company.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  That's correct.  So that there --   Sonia Sotomayor  So neither the parents or the children, if they had been paying attention to the regulatory scheme, had a reasonable expectation that the ordinance wouldn't affect them.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  That's exactly correct.  We think that the timing here of the relevant transfers of property reinforces the idea that it's proper to view these two parcels together as an integrated whole. And the other facts that I would add to that are the spatial ones, the fact that these are contiguous commonly owned tracts with possibilities for linked development and linked uses that creates that direct shared value that is borne out by the valuation evidence in this case.  Because it is significant here that if you view these lots together as an effectively merged parcel, as they are under State law, then the value is only 10 percent less than the value of two separate lots with two separate building sites.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Is there any compact with those other Territories that precludes them from using their Territorial power to reorganize their debts?   Sonia Sotomayor  I know that Guam and the Virgin Islands have Federal courts.   Sonia Sotomayor  And they have Federal judges.  Are they subject to constitutional provisions? Is it an open question of whether they are subject to the Contract Clause as well? To the contract provision limitation, I should say?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's the open issue that --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- has to go on remand.   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Landau, I'm not sure I understand that argument, so you're going to have to back up a minute.   Sonia Sotomayor  It's, I think, critical to your point, which is, Justice Kagan asked a direct question: Why couldn't Congress have said much more directly, under 101, the term ""State"" includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico except for Chapter 9?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If Puerto Rico is not a State for Chapter 9, then it couldn't have authorized its municipality to file under 109.  It would have reached the same end, but more clearly saying that Puerto Rico is not a State.   Sonia Sotomayor  But in all those provisions, debtor, creditor, State play active roles in implementing the provisions of those chapters.   Sonia Sotomayor  So in all the other 40 places, the State is involved --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- by -- inherent in the definition of what a debtor and what a creditoror is, the State has rights and responsibilities under those provisions.   Sonia Sotomayor  What you -- what I'm understanding you to say is, Puerto Rico has been kicked out of Chapter 9 altogether.  It doesn't even get into the gateway.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And so to read it as being involved as a State, the only other place that's used is here.   Sonia Sotomayor  In 903, you have to be part of it in some way.   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Landau, this is not very different from what we did in -- last year in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. the EPA.  We had one general definition of a statutory term, and then we looked at it and its play within other sections, and we said can't be given the same meaning, because the definition applies to one generalized feature of the Act, and the use here is in a more specialized way.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But you didn't cite Utility Air.  Is there a reason you didn't?   Sonia Sotomayor  Why not treat it like -- why not treat it like every other Territory?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's the mouse in -- that's the mouse in -- in the hole --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- which is if you're going to treat it differently, wouldn't you expect them to say that? We're going to treat it not like a State and not like a Territory.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Have you given up the Government Development Bank's position and that of some of the amici that the provision of 903(1) applies to States only when a debtor is in a Chapter 9 proceeding because of that provision's use of creditor?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Are you rejecting the argument?   ",15-233X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Well, no State has possessed the power to impair contract rights under the Constitution.  Nothing about the Bankruptcy Code changes the application of the Contract Clause.  They have to go into Chapter 9 to impair contracts --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- in a meaningful way, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So what makes you think that Congress intended to let Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia have free rein in whatever they wanted to do? Wouldn't they be subject, in your judgment -- I'm sure you'd be arguing they're subject to the Contract -- Impairment Clause.   Sonia Sotomayor  Exactly.   Sonia Sotomayor  So you think Congress intended to stop Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia from passing emergency legislation that said don't shut off the lights tonight; that -- that Congress intended that that kind of temporary provision could only be subject to Congress, who may be on recess, who might be wherever it is, that it could not do that?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it decided to overrule it by giving States the opportunity to go into bankruptcy, and that would be a temporary state to start with.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And it never gave --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And it never gave the Territories that.  So the Territories can pass a law that stops the lights from going out today until Congress comes into effect, because it can't do a permanent impairment of the contract.   Sonia Sotomayor  Doesn't the definitional section of the Code tell you who qualifies as a debtor, who qualifies as a creditor, who can go into what chapter or not? It tells you if you're this kind of creditor, you go into that chapter.  If you're that kind of creditor, you go -- I'm sorry.  If you're this kind of debtor, you go to -- individual goes here, business goes there, this one goes here.  You have options. Isn't it what he describes as a gateway that tells you where you're a part or what you're a part of?   Sonia Sotomayor  Oh, but it is, because it tells you what kind of debtors can make use of what kind of provision.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It is always.  That's what the purpose of a gateway is.   Sonia Sotomayor  So if the -- if the definitional section defines ""State"" to include Puerto Rico, and you say even though it's not a part of Chapter 9 by definition in 109, it still remains a State for purposes of this reservation of State powers? Why aren't we using ""creditor"" in 903 as it's used in the Bankruptcy Code?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If you're going to be literal as to ""State,"" why aren't you literal as to ""creditor""?   Sonia Sotomayor  But let's go back.  If you're going to take the literal meaning of ""State"" definitionally, why aren't you taking the literal meaning of ""creditor""?   Sonia Sotomayor  So how do I read into the statute?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, you actually can't do that, meaning you can't do that according to our prior precedent.  It is inherent in State sovereignty that States have to have some method, their own method, of controlling their municipalities. You can have uniform bankruptcy laws, but if you don't make them available to a municipality because the State hasn't approved it, can you rob a State under State sovereignty of all power to regulate its municipality and to save it from -- from bankruptcy?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Actually, so why do so many major commentators, bankruptcy writers, district and circuit courts, the Sixth Circuit included, have said that that's impossible; that you can't rob a State of the power to regulate its municipalities if you're offering it nothing in return?   Sonia Sotomayor  And then we said in Faitoute that you can't force States --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- to go into bankruptcy.   Sonia Sotomayor  So you believe that the States that don't permit their municipality to become debtors are limited in what they can do by 903? In other words, their -- their municipalities are not debtors? Their sovereign powers have been cut off? They cannot reorganize the debt except through Chapter 9? Then we're talking about a coercive provision.  We're saying you can't do anything about the composition of your debt.  If 98 percent of the creditors want to reorganize their debt with you and those 2 percent vultures are saying no, and a Court would say it's not an impairment of a contract to redo this debt because of the need, everything else that we've said in the past, you're saying States can't do it if -- if -- they can only do it under Chapter 9?   Sonia Sotomayor  Assume -- I assume it doesn't.  Assuming.  You're saying 903 intended to preclude States, solvent States and solvent municipalities, it -- it intended to stop States from doing any reorganization of any debt, even if it doesn't impair the contract clause, it can't do it until every creditor approves, whether or not their municipality is in Chapter 9 or not?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  And what's not coercive about that? What's the choice for States that Congress is giving?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's like the Tenth Amendment right of States to deal with their municipalities consistent with the Constitution.  Where does that leave -- you can make uniform-bankruptcy laws, but nothing about that permits you to impair the rights of States so drastically?   INTERRUPTING ",15-233X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Can I walk through the burden a moment? There's two types of early abortion at -- at play here.  The medical abortion, that doesn't involve any hospital procedure.  A doctor prescribes two pills, and the women take the pills at home, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  What? She has to come back two separate days to take them?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So now, from when she could take it at home, it's -- now she has to travel 200 miles or pay for a hotel to get those two days of treatment?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  Let me ask you something about that two-day wait, okay, or -- or that travel time.  How many other States and how many other recognized medical people have testified or shown that there is any benefit from taking pills at the facility as opposed to taking the pills at home, as was the case?   Sonia Sotomayor  If the Chief may permit me to finish my two-part question?   Sonia Sotomayor  The second is the D&C, the dilation and -- what's it called? Dilation and --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- curettage.  What is the risk factor for a D&C related to abortion and a non-abortion D&C? D&Cs are performed in offices for lots of other conditions besides abortion. Is there any evidence in the record that shows that there is any medical difference in the two -- in the -- in the procedures that would necessitate an abortion being in an ASC or not, or are abortions more risky than the regular D&C?   Sonia Sotomayor  So your point, I'm taking, is that the two main health reasons show that this law was targeted at abortion only?   Sonia Sotomayor  Is there any other --   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry. Is there any other medical condition by taking the pills that are required to be done in hospital, not as a prelude to a procedure in hospital, but an independent, you know -- I know there are cancer treatments by pills now.  How many of those are required to be done in front of a doctor?   Sonia Sotomayor  Can you tell me why Planned Parenthood left the western area? The General says that Planned Parenthood -- that ASC and the -- and the admitting privileges had nothing to do with the closures in the western area of Texas.   ",15-274X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  It includes --   Sonia Sotomayor  When there's a need. Meaning, where are you taking an account in the undue-burden analysis the value of the need being -- of being imposed? Meaning, even if I grant you that in some circumstances travel time is necessary because you just can't get any kind of abortion clinic to go into a particular area, so you might have to impose a burden that might be undue in other circumstances.  Where do we evaluate the benefit of this burden? What -- what's the need? You -- you seem -- your brief seemed to be telling us that there's no role for the Court to judge whether there's really a health benefit to what you're doing.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm not talking about the doctrine.  I'm talking about the question I asked, which is, according to you, the slightest health improvement is enough to impose on hundreds of thousands of women -- even assuming I accept your argument, which I don't, necessarily, because it's being challenged -- but the slightest benefit is enough to burden the lives of a million women.  That's your point?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's interesting.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, wait a minute --   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, do you think -- would you put --   Sonia Sotomayor  By hospitals? Underreported -- most of the complications you're talking about were reported at hospitals, correct? Yes, there is some evidence of not reporting other things outside the hospital, but you know the number of -- hospitals are accurately reporting.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Complications within their clinic?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What's the percentage of 210 from 70,000? My math is pretty horrible.  It's pretty small.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I don't mean to -- to negate that one should try to avoid injury to anyone, and -- and don't take my question as that, but there are people who die from complications from aspirin.  May be unusual, but there's a certain percentage that do that. Yet, we don't require that people take aspirins in ASC centers or in hospitals.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  There has to be some tie between the benefit and the burden, doesn't there?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, don't you think that you can read that from the fact that there are so many other medical treatments whose complication rates are so disproportionately higher, and the legislature is only targeting abortion when there is nothing about the figures before it that show a risk so unusual that it needs greater attention?   Sonia Sotomayor  Can I ask: Were they opened as a result of the law, or were they planned to be opened before the law went into effect? Because I think that makes a difference to me that they were planned to be opened.  It takes quite a while to dig up the money, get the investors, buy the land, do the building.  It seems to me that they must have been planned for a while.  And if they were, it was because there was a need independent of the number of abortions.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  In other words, it's fortuitous that they've come into existence, but it was in -- their need was not there -- was independent of the reduced number of facilities elsewhere.   Sonia Sotomayor  Most of them don't choose to provide abortions.   Sonia Sotomayor  So what you don't know is what -- do you have enough resources to open up an ASC if you're going to do abortions? Are you going to get enough developers to -- to invest in your work?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Can I ask about McAllen? There was testimony in the record that at least four doctors had -- from that spot had asked for admitting privileges.  Well, the Fifth Circuit's remedy only provided for one doctor, Dr. Lynn, who's past retirement age, to be the only doctor performing abortions in that clinic. Now, if the clinic had -- I don't know how many it had, but it had at least four people before -- it seems rather callous to say as a remedy that we're going to make that one doctor do the work of four, or maybe more doctors who didn't get admitting privileges. Why is even the Fifth Circuit's remedy reasonable?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that -- but -- if -- yes.  As applied, the A -- ASC law is affecting this clinic because it can't get its doctors certified.  So why does it require a named plaintiff to relieve that clinic of the obligation of going without admitting privileges?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But you just lift the requirement because you know that it's the only clinic in the area.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So if any doctor who's licensed appropriately can get admitting privileges, they should be permitted to work in that clinic. Why does Dr. Lynn have to become an indentured slave to ensure that women in her area are provided with their fundamental right to choose?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But she wants to leave --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  Counsel --   Sonia Sotomayor  But, I'm sorry --   Sonia Sotomayor  It's valid only if it's taking care of a real problem.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, no, no, no.  A real problem, meaning, Gosnell, the governor of Pennsylvania, said was a regulatory failure.  And only in that, not -- this clinic had not been inspected for 15 years.  He -- the doctor was fabricating his reports. That could happen almost in any setting.  Anyone who intends to break the law is going to break the law, whatever the regulatory rules are. You're going to have doctors, as happened pre our laws, who were performing abortions without permission in their offices or without licenses.  And I don't want to suggest that we should presume that's going to happen, but it will happen.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, but -- yeah, but -- but you have to see, as Justice Breyer asked you earlier, why are the problems? Isn't this a self-created problem? What happened in Texas independent of Gosnell that raised the Gosnell-like situation in Texas that made --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- the legislature so concerned after so many years about taking care of this greater risk in abortions, as opposed to all the other procedures that are performed in non-ASC facilities?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But there's complications in colonoscopies, and colonoscopies are, what, 15 times --   Sonia Sotomayor  28.  Justice Breyer just corrected me. (Laughter.)   Sonia Sotomayor  28 percent higher.  I mean --   Sonia Sotomayor  Why isn't that self-evident in any area that's --   Sonia Sotomayor  This area of western Texas, it's as big as California.  No? Bigger?   Sonia Sotomayor  Huge area.   Sonia Sotomayor  Why isn't it self-evident if you have a law that says you can only be an ACS provider, and who's going to come in and say, I can't be an ACS provider, but it's an undue burden on me, or it's an undue burden that's self-evident on the women in that area?   Sonia Sotomayor  Exactly.  So why don't we take this lawsuit as those women saying just that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You can't have a law that has marginal, if any, medical benefit be applied to this procedure anywhere where there's an undue burden on people -- on women.   ",15-274X

But assuming we disagree with you that this should be appealable, what's the narrowest way to right this that the government would like?   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Stewart, in regular litigation, there is an inducement, potentially, for one or other party to appeal to delay the resolution of the case. In this situation, I don't see that inducement as existing, meaning I doubt very much that landowners are -- who wanted to use their property for a particular purpose are going to appeal just for the -- just to delay the government's adjudication of an issue that's going to either permit them or not permit them to go forward.

Sonia Sotomayor  They don't apply to English courts --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- and other foreign courts.   Sonia Sotomayor  And there are plenty of foreign courts, like England for a time -- I think it's changing it now -- where they would convict people after a magisterial inquisition where the defendant didn't have counsel.  You're not saying that process violates the Constitution?   Sonia Sotomayor  You're saying simply because we're using that conviction, we now violated. Why? Nichols, as I understand it, had two rationales: One that says using a prior constitutional conviction, one that doesn't violate the Constitution, is not enhancing a sentence, is not changing that earlier conviction.  It's not enhancing a sentence for that earlier conviction, so you can use it, because it's just setting the platform for the current punishment, for the conduct now. How does your argument -- why does your argument change that rationale?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, we -- Nichols itself said enhancement statutes, whether in the nature of criminal history provisions, such as those contained in the Sentencing Guidelines, or recidivist statutes that are commonplace in State criminal law, those recidivist statutes make prior convictions an element, do not change the penalty imposed for an earlier conviction.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Does that mean --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- that there's no -- I mean, I personally don't like absolutes.

Sonia Sotomayor  And I don't -- actually haven't done research on this, so I may be answering -- asking a question that's already been answered by our case law, but let's assume an attorney sanction, something of that nature. If I don't buy an absolute, how do I articulate it?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You dismiss with prejudice all your claims, are all appeals are waived, or all appeals but?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Katyal, my problem is I have problems with his rules; I have problems with yours. (Laughter.)   Sonia Sotomayor  So you've got to -- and -- and I think it's some of what the government is saying. Putting aside the questioning here, which troubles me in its adequacy, okay, it's not uncommon -- it was perhaps uncommon in this case for families to be crying outside of courtrooms, for families to be talking to each other and visibly expressing either their pleasure or displeasure at what a jury did.  Not uncommon for court correction officers in the State of New York to get very close to juries -- when they used to sequester them, but even today -- and a corrections officer saying something like, good job, guys, at the end of the verdict, okay, when the jury's discharged. There is expressions in the courtroom.  If we do a prejudice test, how are we going to ensure that that concept of a fair trial is wholesome enough to not permit what I consider some -- could be potentially great contamination of the jury and of their emotional state? I mean, there are juries all of the time who have the night to think about a case who change their mind.     INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And the next day, they're reaching out to the court or they're reaching out to one of the party's attorneys and wanting to undo the verdict. But what's the rule that takes care of all of those things? Is -- is it the boundless ability to recall juries? What are the circumstances a court should look at? What's your rule? Give me a rule that --     INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I know, but you're making that up.   Sonia Sotomayor  And it doesn't take care of the things I talked about.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it depends on the courthouse.  In most courthouses, certainly the Federal system and a lot of State systems, the jury doesn't get to go out and mix with the public.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Do you think --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- but you're not --   Sonia Sotomayor  Suppose we tell -- I mean, look at the totality of the circumstances is a great test, but it doesn't give much guidance to courts below.  Tell me what the guidance is that we give.  I'm thinking of something like, if they've been exposed to any extraneous reactions, words, information, conversation -- I can go on with a list of verbs -- but you can't recall it? Are there any limits to this power?   Sonia Sotomayor  It's certainly not going to help courts if we adopt a Federal rule.  I'm looking for a principle that would apply for where this problem occurs the most often, which is State court.

And so I'm -- I'm -- what does it mean to be a prosecutor, if you're not taking responsibility personally, as he claimed during the election, for the decision to execute someone, whether by policy or by individual review? And there was clearly individual review here. At -- at what point do we give meaning to the constitutional command that you can't be prosecutor and judge? I know there's so many different kinds of recusals.  This is the ideal case for someone to make a due process claim, because the judge here actually signed his name to his review of the facts and his decision to seek the death penalty.

That's really wonderful.  And how about if they got it wrong?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Meaning -- it doesn't mean that if a whole court looks at something, it's got it right.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  But the government starts again.   Sonia Sotomayor  The judgment that was entered here would be nullified.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So then I do have one fundamental, factual question.   Sonia Sotomayor  As I'm reading the record below, the circuit, the Fifth Circuit, took the position that the only disclosure that would violate the seal requirement is the disclosure of the existence of the lawsuit.  It basically said that disclosing the underlying facts is not a violation of the sealing requirement.  So how did the mere disclosure of the lawsuit hurt you as opposed to what I think hurts reputation is the nature of the allegations? If the allegations were going to come out no matter what, how and why and when was there an actual disclosure of the existence of the lawsuit as opposed to just sharing with others what I understood to be the evidentiary affidavit which just sets forth allegations?   Sonia Sotomayor  So -- well, let's get to that, okay, because do we look at the situation as it existed at the time of the violation and the risk it created? Or do we look at it ex post facto and decide it didn't, in fact, happen, so there is no harm? Shouldn't the severity be determined at the time it occurred? Giving a complaint to a news media is probably the best way to tip off a defendant.  It's actually more likely to do it than failing to serve the government on time for which many circuits automatically dismiss the complaint, even though that could be considered harmless if the government is served late and comes in and asks for an extension.   John F. Bash  Well, let me take --   Sonia Sotomayor  There is a disparity on how courts are treating those situations, but that's not necessarily at issue here. But what is at issue is, what do we measure the appropriate sanction to be and based on what evaluation?   John F. Bash  Well, let me take the general question and bring it to the facts here, and then talk about that question of the disparity about how courts are treating the different kinds of violations. The answer on the general question is they are both relevant.  Under the standard articulated below and the standard we've advocated, you look at both the actual harm to the government, just like often attempt crimes are not punished as strongly as crimes that actually result in harm, but you also look at the severity of the violation, and we think there's a direct correlation between the severity and the potential harm. If you actually give the complaint to the defendant, the harm -- the potential harm is enormous.  If you tell one person who is not affiliated with the defendant, the potential harm is less.  So it's relevant in that way. And, of course, there is intent and bad faith. And we don't discount that other factors could be relevant in idiosyncratic cases.  We think in the mine run cases, those are the key factors.  Let me just take it to the facts here. It's true --   ",15-513X

Sonia Sotomayor  Well, there is a tradition.  There are 39 States with constitutional amendments like the one Missouri has.  That's a history that's even longer than the Locke history.  And the essence of that history is, basically, we don't want to, as a country -- well, the vast majority of States, to fund houses of worship.  One would think that if there's play in the joints, that that would include the concept that States are free to say we don't want to spend money from the public FIs on houses of worship. Now, you say this affects free exercise.  We seem to be confusing money with religious practice.  I don't think the two are tied.  This church is not going to close its religious practices or its doors because its playground doesn't have these tires.  So I'm not sure how this is a free-exercise question, because there is no effect on the religious beliefs.  No one is asking the church to change its beliefs.  In fact, no one is asking the church as a condition of saying don't use what we give you for religious purposes; they're not even doing that.

You're taking the money by -- or the possessory interest by deception. And you're saying that by using the disjunctive, the ""or,"" the jury could have convicted merely for deceiving the bank, but didn't find that they deceived ""and"" deprived the bank of a possessory interest, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  Now, Justice Breyer has asked the operative question.   Sonia Sotomayor  And -- and it's what confused me throughout, both in the discussions below and here. At first, I thought this case was only about reading your brief about whether the deprivation had to be of something the bank owned.   Sonia Sotomayor  As opposed to had a possessory interest in.  And Justice Kagan rightly says you seem to have backed off from that claim.  You seem to be saying ""owned"" can mean merely a possessory interest.  Is that correct, now?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So if we disagree with you, if we were to say that this subsection 1 means that you are targeting property that -- depriving any bank of property in which it has a possessory interest --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- and we say you don't have to prove the bank is going to lose anything of value, that it's going to be reimbursed by insurance or that ultimately the customer is going to receive -- bear the loss, so long as you have defrauded the bank, some deception to the bank, and deprived it of some possessory interest, whether it bears the loss or not, if that's how we rule, do you lose this case?

Do I have to go further, and why, meaning, isn't the issue here what we left off -- open in Descamps? Iowa calls this a means, but if I read the instrument, it seems like an element. So what does a judge do? Give me the steps of interpretive principles that a judge would do with a case like this.   Sonia Sotomayor  The State law dispositive, that's number -- first, let's start there.   Sonia Sotomayor  So that's your entire case, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Let's assume Iowa was silent.  That was the question that Justice Breyer --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- was coming to.  If I look at this, it seems -- it doesn't say, enter a storage area or a structure as a -- a structure or a boat.  It says just enter a storage shed.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Yes, the problem --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- with Descamps there is that ""feloniously entered"" had two potential meanings: You broke and you entered, or you remained unlawfully and committed a crime.  And what we said in Descamps was, reading felonious entry, you don't know which of the two it is because it -- it's not an element.  You just have to do one or -- it's not an element.  It's a means.  We didn't know which one, but this is sort of different.  This is the indictment saying the structure you broke into is this particular one.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Do you see a difference between -- he had to do one or the other here.  He had to break into a house or break into a vehicle.  But in Descamps, he could have done one of two things.  He could have broken and entered, or he could have stayed unlawfully.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Exactly.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  He wasn't pleading guilty to one or the other.  He way saying, I did unlawfully what the indictment said, feloniously entered.  But I -- he did not have to and did not admit exactly which of the two ways he did it.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Go back to my ultimate question.  Tell me the steps.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Don't you think that his brother's statement -- when he was asked about trading by Maher, the younger brother, he said, I owe somebody money.  Isn't that most naturally read to be either give me the money to pay this person back or give me information that lets me pay him back? Isn't that always the quid pro quo of a gift, that you believe that if you give someone a gift, it's going to cost you one way or another? You're going to give them something of value, or you're going to substitute money for the gift, or you're going to do something that saves you money by giving the tip.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's true, but then comes the government's suggestion that the disclosure has to be for a personal benefit or a personal purpose, that there has to be a reason you're doing it, not accidentally, not -- not unknowingly, but something you're doing because you want to receive some benefit from it.   Sonia Sotomayor  Wait a minute.  First of all, that's no longer true.  There's regulations that stop that, talking to analysts. But talk about the culpability question. Why is it any less culpable to give your close relative, who you've been supporting every month for your entire life, so instead of giving him, one month or two months, that regular one hundred dollar bill, you choose to give him corporate information.  That's Justice Kagan's example. Why is that person more culpable than the person who just -- a relative comes and says, it would be nice; I need some money.  And you give him a tip instead of the cash.   Sonia Sotomayor  But Congress doesn't define what's deceptive or manipulative or -- what's the third word? -- what defrauds.  It has general words. Don't devise a scheme that does these things.  The law has for ages said that the failure to -- to speak when you're obligated to; i.e., an insider who doesn't disclose that he's using your information is an omission that's been, classically, a fraud. So I don't understand why you keep saying that the law doesn't define this.   Sonia Sotomayor  Except your defining limit? It has to be tangible?   Sonia Sotomayor  If we disagree with you because of the gift language of Dirks, how else could you suggest to limit liability?

I mean, in this very case, there were three reasons for breaching the rule of confidentiality.  The first, to -- for Maher to become more knowledgeable of the health care industry.  Under your reading, if he had no knowledge his brother would trade, that was not actionable; correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No.  I'm talking about that there are three examples of breaching confidentiality. The first was to -- for him to become more knowledgeable of the health industry. The second was to help the father with his medical care. And the third, the one you charged, was the giving of information, knowing that his brother was going to trade on it. How do you draw the line among those three? All three were for personal reasons.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you have --   Sonia Sotomayor  So if all he did it for was to get information for his father, had no idea that his brother was trading, he would not be liable and his brother wouldn't be liable.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why do you want to put knowledge of the -- knowledge that it will be used for trading as part of the breach of fiduciary duty? If you do that, then you have to prove that the tippee knew that the tipper thought it would be traded.   Sonia Sotomayor  Why can't you put it in the intent to defraud?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why -- why make it part of the breach --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Dreeben, I think you're taking this way out of existing law.  Are you going to suggest that tippees aren't routinely prosecuted when tippers don't know that they are going to trade? I think they are, and most often it's because you claim that they should have known it was confidential information.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  There's plenty -- there's a legion of cases I read for this -- preparing for this argument where the government has said --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you're going to let go of the guy that Justice Alito -- the guy on the street who looks dejected is not my friend or a close relative, but I give him a tip and say, go trade on this.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Why don't we --   Sonia Sotomayor  Why did we make Bailey retroactive? Congress could have made mere possession. I think it subsequently did, in some form.  It could have changed the law and fixed the problem.  How is that different than here? It could make certain class of crimes -- this defendant's particular crime, if it chose, it could take the elements of this crime and say, these are violent crimes.  So how are they different? We made Bailey retroactive.   Helgi C. Walker  They're different in two ways. Yes, you did, Justice Sotomayor. First, Bailey was a statutory construction case.  And what Bousley explained is that when this Court construes Federal criminal statutes in such a way as to definitely exclude particular conduct, they're in mere possession of a firearm --   Sonia Sotomayor  But we have excluded particular conduct.  We've said the residual clause can't define a violent crime.   Helgi C. Walker  With all respect, that is not how we read Johnson.  Johnson said the statute is indeterminant.  We can't say that particular conduct is definitively outside the scope of the statute, which is what the Court did in Begay and Chambers and cases like Bailey.  And there, we know that the defendants are innocent of anything that Congress meant by criminal case acts.   Sonia Sotomayor  Whether it's Bailey or here, Congress has to redefine the crime.   Helgi C. Walker  That is --   Sonia Sotomayor  It has to step in and pass a new statute.  So why is it substantive in one respect but not another? Same two things have to be done.  The law has to be changed.   Helgi C. Walker  Because we have to ask why the law has to be changed.  In Bailey, the law had to be changed because this Court said the statute didn't reach particular conduct.  And so the defendants would be innocent of anything that Congress ever meant to criminalize. In Johnson, though, the Court didn't say we know that all defendants sentenced under the residual clause have been sentenced on the basis of a crime that Congress never meant to cover.  In fact, the Court said quite the opposite.  They said we can't tell.   Sonia Sotomayor  You said when you started that Congress could change the statute to make nonuse criminal, just possession.   Helgi C. Walker  Yes, and that showed --   Sonia Sotomayor  And so Congress could change the statute and make this conduct criminal.  I don't see the difference.   Helgi C. Walker  So what --   Sonia Sotomayor  I don't see -- you still need a congressional act --   Helgi C. Walker  Right.   Sonia Sotomayor  -- to --   Helgi C. Walker  And the fact that you needed a congressional act both in Bailey and here just shows our ultimate point, which is that Johnson didn't deprive Congress of the power to legislate in this area.  It simply said you have to do a better job. The Court didn't strike down the residual clause because Congress had exceeded its powers under Article 1, or regulated something that didn't affect interstate commerce, or regulated something, some conduct, some private, primary conduct, that is entirely and categorically off limits.  The Court just said you need to do a better job.   Sonia Sotomayor  What would be your rule on -- on this issue I posited to Mr. -- to the Assistant Solicitor General.

Do you see a difference between the question presented that talked about the absolute priority rule as it relates to settlement proceeds and the ""structured dismissal"" here.   Sarah E. Harrington  I don't think so.  I think the -- the change in wording was meant to sort of give -- give the particular context that -- that the question arises in this case.  And if any -- if there is any difference, it's just a narrower sort of set of what the law --   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I -- I -- it goes to a more fundamental question, which is, is there a difference or in our ruling whether we say no settlement proceeds can be distributed in violation of the absolute priority rule from a statement that no dismissal, structured dismissal, can be entered in violation of the absolute priority rule.   Sarah E. Harrington  I think the --   Sonia Sotomayor  I do think there is a difference.   Sarah E. Harrington  Well, I think the -- your first formulation is a little bit broader than the second formulation.  And then, like I said, we think the rule would apply also to preplanned -- preplanned dispositions of estate assets. If you wanted to limit your holding just to sort of the resolution of a case in a way that is kind of a substitute for a plan, then I think you could just say a structured dismissal can't authorize the distribution of estate assets. But I'd like to, again, sort of distinguish the settlement of the claim from the distribution of estate assets.  The two things were put together in this case, and they are put together throughout Respondents' brief.  But they are really separate things.  There's nothing in the Code that would authorize a debtor or some subset of creditors to distribute estate assets. They don't get -- they don't have any say in how estate assets are distributed.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I mean, every structured settlement of this kind is trying to exclude one set of creditors.

They're happy to exclude anybody they can --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- or anybody who will concede to doing it.   Sonia Sotomayor  So how do you protect the excluded creditor from being preyed on by one of the other creditors? We already know the junior creditors have a self-interest.   Sonia Sotomayor  The senior creditors have --   Sonia Sotomayor  It happens to be one of the biggest senior creditors here is the one who was insisting upon excluding the junior creditor.

I believe that your basic argument, everyone is in agreement, that the test is an article of manufacture for purposes of sale. But I am like Justice Kennedy, which is, how do we announce the right test for that? Because the phone could be seen by a public -- a purchasing consumer as being just that rounded edge, slim outer shell.  That might be what drives the sale.  I don't know. Certainly your expert didn't tell me how to figure out the component part.  I don't know where in the record you would have enough to survive your argument.   Sonia Sotomayor  Now, I look at this record, and they were claiming the profits on the whole phone.  If you read the Federal Circuit's decision, they were saying people buy -- bought this product mostly -- this was their argument to the jury and it sold the Federal Circuit -- because of the look of this phone, that, you know, all smartphones basically function the same.  People don't really put much value on the unit. This is what they were arguing, and they put on an expert that gave total profits.  If the jury credited them, could you -- and you were properly -- it was a properly instructed jury, could you overturn that finding?   Sonia Sotomayor  I accept that, Miss Sullivan.  I'm asking you --   Sonia Sotomayor  And you're answering ""no"" to my question.  You're saying a properly instructed jury on the evidence presented in this case could not have found for Apple.

Sonia Sotomayor  So let's assume, because it makes logical sense to me, it may not to anybody else, okay, that the Volkswagen body, not the innards, are the article of manufacture. Now, the government would say, go to the second test, which takes in some of the things that you were talking about, to figure out how much of the profits that VW makes from the Bug are attributable to the shape of the car. Now, as Justice Alito said, some people don't care a wit about the shape of the car.  They want just a small car.  They want the car that has a certain trunk.  People buy cars for a multitude of reasons. Experts would come in and say, but it's 90 percent of the profits.

Sonia Sotomayor  Go ahead, and then I'll --   Sonia Sotomayor  May I note that, as a footnote only, you can continue, that in Ex parte Sosa, the CCA sent back a case directing the lower court to apply the Briseno factors, even though that court had analyzed the case under the clinical standards.  It appears to be acting as if those Briseno factors are the clinical factors and are controlling, even though there are stereotypes built into them.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, the DMA and all the other clinicians recognized that some mentally disabled people can have some adaptive functioning. Idiot savants, for example.  Is it your position that if someone can calculate math in their head they can't be intellectually disabled?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How about if that same person has a job in NASA calculating the air space shuttle launches? Is that person not intellectually disabled simply because they can use that particular skill in a way that gains them employment?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. General, going -- just -- is it your view that what Texas is trying to do is determine who is truly on the clinical borderline as opposed to trying to determine the type of mentally disabled people that it thinks should be executed --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- on the latter?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So is it fair to say that in Texas, a mildly disabled person is unlikely to be considered disabled by the CCA under the Briseno factors?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But you -- according to one of the cases that you've cited to me where someone was clinically diagnosed as mildly disabled, and the CCA said under the Briseno factors that they should not be executed.  A lot of the cases that you provided me with, there was clinical evidence of moderate -- and mostly severe -- but moderate to severe disability.  But there -- was there anyone with mild disability that the Briseno factors would find sufficiently disabled?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Did they find him mildly disabled?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why did it go through so much trouble in saying that it wasn't going to use current standards, that it was only going to use the older standards and the Briseno factors?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, if we believe that its definition of relatedness has no support anywhere, would that have been a valid reason for discounting the current clinical standards?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I'm not sure how I can accept your characterization of the CCA decision when basically it's saying his poor intellectual functioning on IQ tests, which happened when he was younger, were not related to his intellectual abilities; they were related to his poverty, his -- his morbidity factors. If they are saying that, how are you saying they weren't finding that he wasn't intellectually disabled because of those other factors?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's how I read their decision.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, wait a minute. The testimony of Compton was, having looked at all of the IQ tests, was: I'm not sure.  It's probable that he's intellectually disabled by IQ, but he wouldn't qualify in my judgment because of his adaptive skills. But even the State's own expert said that it was probable that he was intellectually disabled.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that happened in Atkins, too.  Regrettably, until we decided that mental disability was a ground to excuse execution, many mentally disabled defendants were represented by counsel who thought that arguing differently was a better strategy.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, the problem is that, as I read the CCA opinion, it's looking at adaptive strengths only and not at adaptive deficits and looking at the depth of them or how they form the intellectual disability component.  Even Dr. Compton, the State's expert, testified that Mr. Moore could not, from memory, recreate a clock. Now, she says, I don't quite believe that, but she doesn't quite believe that of a person who, at 13's, father threw him out because he was dumb and illiterate: Couldn't tell the days of the week; couldn't tell the months of the year; couldn't tell time; couldn't do anything that one would consider within an average, or even a low average, of intellectual functioning, who is eating out of garbage cans repeatedly and getting sick after each time he did it, but not learning from his mistakes. The -- the State's opinion does very little except say those are products of his poor environment; they're not products of his intellectual disability.   Sonia Sotomayor  The problem with Lennie, who the Briseno factors were -- were fashioned after -- Lennie was working on a farm.  How is that different from mowing a lawn? And -- and the State had no problem in saying that Lennie, even though he could work, earn a living, plan his trying to hide the death of the rabbit he killed, that he could do all of those things, and yet he was not just mildly, but severely disabled. Why is the fact that he could mow lawns and play pool indicative of a strength that overcomes all the other deficits?   Sonia Sotomayor  But it informed its view of how to judge the lack or strength of adaptive functions.  It used the Lennie standard.   ",15-797X

Are you satisfied if we say they used the wrong standard for denying the COA, or will you only be satisfied if we say you win?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  Now let's start with the COA issue.  With respect to the COA issue, I read your adversaries who are -- to say Martinez, Trevino could never constitute an exceptional circumstance to -- to justify the issuance of a COA.

And aren't you making Martinez and -- and Trevino retroactive if we recognize it as an exceptional reason to forgive a procedural default. And then second, there's a circuit split on this question, and you recognize it in your brief.  You have the Third Circuit using a three-part test that says Martinez and Trevino, under certain circumstances, can be a reason to find exceptional circumstance. The Ninth Circuit has a six- or seven- or eight-part test.  They never make it simple.  And the Fifth says never. Where do you stand on all these tests?

Why is it okay or not okay for the prosecutor to introduce the greater likelihood of a person being dangerous on the basis of race alone? Not okay for the prosecutor, but it's less bad for the defense attorney to do it?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, during the time the guidelines were mandatory, but afterwards, many, many court of appeals basically told district courts you can't impose a sentence simply because you disagree with the guideline.  You can impose it for independent reasons to ensure a just result, but you can't impose it merely because you don't like the guideline.  And they monitored that pretty well. That's basically what -- this district court didn't say it didn't like the mandatory minimum.  It said instead that it thought a fair sentence was, and that -- that would have been one day, if it could have done it, given that the rest of the sentence, 30 years, was even further beyond what the judge thought was adequate for punishment, deterrence, and all the other factors under 3553, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  So it's not negating Congress's purpose if a district court gives one day; correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  And one day is a day of punishment, isn't it?

So there is a little bit of twisting of a judge by saying you have to somehow put yourself in the position of punishing this person without knowing that he's going to be punished for the gun anyway for 30 years, and think of what the punishment should be without that punishment.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Yang --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- I mean, the lack of beauty of the guidelines is they're so artificial on so many levels; all right? What differentiates a normal theft from a robbery is the use of force.  And the guidelines, in defining the guidelines range for a theft, starts at a much, much lower base level.  Starts at a seven, okay? For a robbery, it starts at a base level of 20. Once you start with that huge difference between the use of force and the nonuse of force, obviously, the robbery guideline is always going to include the use of force.  The fact that it might be with a gun as opposed to a knife as opposed to a threat of violence or whatever else you want to define it, the use of force is inherent already in the guideline calculation because, otherwise, that -- there's no reason.  They could have just had one table and said, if you rob someone, if it was a pure calculation, as you suggest it, without thinking about the gun, it would have been $20,000 is taken, we're all going to start at a offense level of five years and build up from there. That's not what the guidelines do. So when you're taking discretion away from a judge, I think that's one of the reasons we often require specificity, because the guidelines are artificial in so many different ways.  And there are gyrations that we go through as judges to comply with dictates that are not very often very clear.   ",15-9260

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Does your argument still stand?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, we permit the police to seize items in plain view in a home.  They get a search warrant for the home. They see an item that they have probable cause to believe is incriminating evidence.  They can seize it. Justice Breyer said exigent circumstances permit the police to seize items. I think the assumption -- or not the assumption -- the premise of all of those cases is that the police are there legitimately.  If you have a warrant, you are permitted to be there. In Jardines, you could -- couldn't seize the incriminating evidence wafting from the house because you didn't have a right to be in the curtilage. And so isn't there a difference when you are in the street, as these police officers were, they have a right to be on the street, they have a right to look at whatever is visible, and they could see the motorcycle from there? So is this a plain view case? Is this a exigent circumstance case? I -- that's why I thought that Justice Breyer was asking whether the search of the tarp was part of this because was this in plain view, in essence? As -- as I understood it, they weren't sure it was the same motorcycle.

Sonia Sotomayor  Let's assume the statute read, without the parenthetical, when it said a portion of the judgment shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees awarded against the defendant. Would that mean 25 percent absent that 25 percent?   Sonia Sotomayor  Absent the parenthetical.   Sonia Sotomayor  No, it says a portion of the judgment.  So it doesn't say all of the judgment.  It -- it doesn't say the judgment shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees. If all it said is ""a portion of the judgment shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees against the defendant,"" do you think in that, standing alone, the district court would have discretion to give a dollar?   Sonia Sotomayor  It's a -- no? It's a portion of the judgment.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why? A portion is a portion.  It's not all of it.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It doesn't say all of the judgment; it says a portion.   Sonia Sotomayor  So why didn't Congress say a portion of the judgment, 25 percent, instead of not to exceed 25 percent?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why doesn't it just say a portion of the judgment, 25 percent, shall be applied to satisfy the amount?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, no.  That's -- I'm asking you --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- what's the difference between the two things?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  Is your view -- let's assume, it's highly unlikely, but it can happen, the -- the attorney's fees are less than 25 percent of the judgment.  Who pays under your reading of the statute as written?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And the defendant pays nothing?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So what is the difference by Congress saying a portion of the judgment, not to exceed 25 percent -- why didn't it just say: a portion of the judgment (25 percent) shall be applied? Under your reading, the two mean exactly the same thing.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Then you're doing away with the ""shall apply."" No one ever speaks of that ""shall apply"" as meaning that you give more than 25 percent.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You don't award him attorney's fees of 25 percent of the judgment.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, the non -- the non-incarcerated plaintiffs are under 1988.  They get all of their fees.  If they wanted to equalize them, they would have left them alone.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But it didn't say civil tort plaintiffs.  He said non-incarcerated plaintiffs.  He didn't say tort plaintiffs.   ",16-1067
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Can I ask you --   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, he did refuse to sell --   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, didn't he refuse to sell cupcakes that he sells regularly to the public to some same-sex couples who intended to marry?   Sonia Sotomayor  But I thought -- I'm a little bit surprised by what you're saying because your brief seemed to suggest differently -- that the couple was looking at his already pre-designed cakes that he appears to sell without any customization, and they sat down with him, and he said I don't supply cakes of any kind to gay couples. So I thought this cake was about his refusal to supply a cake for any wedding ceremony.   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you tell me how far --   Sonia Sotomayor  So that begs the question, when have we ever given protection to a food? The primary purpose of a food of any kind is to be eaten. Now, some people might love the aesthetic appeal of a special dessert, and look at it for a very long time, but in the end its only purpose is to be eaten. And the same with many of the things that you've mentioned.  A hairdo is to show off the person, not the artist.  When people at a wedding look at a wedding cake and they see words, as one of the amici here, the pastry chef said, there was a gentleman who had upset his wife and written some words that said ""I'm sorry for what I did,"" something comparable, and the chef was asked -- the cake maker was asked, was that affiliated with you? And she said no.  It's affiliated with the person who shows the cake at their wedding. It's what they wish to show. So how is this your client's expression, and how can we find something whose predominant purpose is virtually always to be eaten? Call it a medium for expressive expression.  Mind you, I can see if they've -- create a cake and put it in a museum as an example of some work of art, that might be different because the circumstances would show that they want this to be affiliated with themselves. But explain how that becomes expressive speech, that medium becomes expressive speech.   Sonia Sotomayor  You know, the other night I had some people over and one of them brought a box of cupcakes and one of the cupcakes was smashed against the box.  That was the only cupcake not eaten. Now, I suspect that one of the reasons is the others were so much more attractive whole.  There is creation in serving food, in creating any type of edible product. People -- there are sandwich artists now.  There are people who create beauty in what they make, but we still don't call it expressive and entitled to First Amendment protection.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.   Sonia Sotomayor  Would you stop -- would that belief that expresses speech trump public accommodation laws against discrimination or protecting customers from race? Yes or no.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Oh, it didn't in Newman versus Piggie?   Sonia Sotomayor  There was a -- he claimed that he was religious, that he opposed serving blacks because it mixed the races, and we basically refused both his free expression and his free exercise clauses.  So are you saying that your rule now would trump protection against race discrimination?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'll read Newman myself.   Sonia Sotomayor  Answer my question.   Sonia Sotomayor  It's your theory -- is your theory that you -- that you -- public accommodation laws cannot trump free speech or free-exercise claims in protecting against race discrimination?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So how about disability; I'm not going to serve cakes to two disabled people because God makes perfect creations, and there are some religions who believe that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So how about there?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, your client was saying that providing a cake to a same-sex couple was against his free-expression rights because -- and his free-exercise rights, because he cannot celebrate that kind of marriage.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, sometimes it's not just dignity.  A couple of the briefs -- one of the amici briefs pointed out that most military bases are in isolated areas far from cities and that they're in areas where the general population, service population, is of one religion or close to one religious belief.   Sonia Sotomayor  So where there might be two cake bakers.  They name a couple of military bases like that.  Or two florists or one photographer.  Very small number of resources.   Sonia Sotomayor  And in those situations, they posit, and I don't think probably wrongly, that it may come to pass where the two cake bakers will claim the same abstention here.  So how do we protect the military men and women who are of the same sex who want to get married in that town because that's where all their friends are, because the base is there?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right? How do we protect those people?   Sonia Sotomayor  So -- but isn't that -- isn't that the same for everybody? Meaning, look, we live in a society with competing beliefs, and all of our cases have always said where LGBT people have been -- you know, they've been humiliated, disrespected, treated uncivilly.  The briefs are filled with situations that --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- the gay couple who was left on the side of the highway on a rainy night, people who have been denied medical treatment or whose children have been denied medical treatment because the doctor didn't believe in same-sex parenthood, et cetera.   Sonia Sotomayor  We've always said in our public accommodations law we can't change your private beliefs, we can't compel you to like these people, we can't compel you to bring them into your home, but if you want to be a part of our community, of our civic community, there's certain behavior, conduct --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- you can't engage in.  And that includes not selling products that you sell to everyone else to people simply because of their either race, religion, national origin, gender, and in this case sexual orientation. So we can't legislate civility and rudeness, but we can and have permitted it as a compelling state interest legislating behavior.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why is not selling or selling to one group as opposed to another not behavior?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That was a private parade.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm not going to --   Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I -- I was a little confused --   Sonia Sotomayor  Ms. Waggoner, here the seller of the cakes is not Mr. Phillips, it's Masterpiece Corporation.  Does it -- in your arguments, who controls the expression here, the corporation or its shareholders? I always thought corporations were separate entities.  And how do we impute to this corporation, which is just a bakery, it doesn't purport to sell just religious items, it's a public place, how do we -- and how do we make this decision with respect to the rights of individuals in a corporation that don't have objections? So can the chef at the Hilton -- and I don't mean to demean the Hilton or anybody else, I'm using it as an example -- can he say I don't believe in same-sex marriage and I won't create a cake and can he be fired?     INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But who makes a decision for the corporation? In -- in most situations -- it may be easier in a closely-held corporation, it may be the shareholders.  I don't know if it's the corporate board or it's the shareholders. Who -- who decides?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It can't be the employee --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- speaking for the corporation.  The employee can be made an agent of the corporation and speak on its behalf, but the employee can't choose it on behalf of the corporation.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's him and his wife, right?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, the problem is that America's reaction to mixed marriages and to race didn't change on its own. It changed because we had public accommodation laws that forced people to do things that many claimed were against their expressive rights and against their religious rights. It's not denigrating someone by saying, as I mentioned earlier, to say: If you choose to participate in our community in a public way, your choice, you can choose to sell cakes or not.  You can choose to sell cupcakes or not, whatever it is you choose to sell, you have to sell it to everyone who knocks on your door, if you open your door to everyone.   Sonia Sotomayor  Then don't participate in weddings, or create a cake that is neutral, but you don't have to take and offer goods to the public and then choose not to sell to some because of a protected characteristic.  That's what the public anti-discrimination laws require.   ",16-111X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  How many commissioners are there?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How many commissioners are there?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'd like you to answer Justice Kennedy's question.  How many commissioners are there?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  If one -- if there was a belief, not yours -- stop fighting the belief; accept the hypothetical -- that this person was improperly biased, what happens then? I think that's what Justice Kennedy is asking you.   Sonia Sotomayor  One of the commissioners is improperly biased.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counselor, in that case --   Sonia Sotomayor  Could you answer --   Sonia Sotomayor  Would you answer that question?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, could you answer the question asked? Let's assume this couple did come in and wanted the rainbow cake.   Sonia Sotomayor  And this gentleman says one of two things: If you're same-sex, I'm not going to provide you with a rainbow cake or I don't create rainbow cakes for weddings because I don't believe in same-sex marriage.  I'm not going to sell it to you. I'm not going to sell it to a same -- a heterosexual couple.  I just don't want to be affiliated with that concept of rainbowness at a wedding, any kind of wedding.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what are the difference in treatment?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How do you deal under your hypothetical with hotels associated with weddings?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Can we separate --   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, can you please explain to me what the difference is between the licensed and unlicensed in terms of the services?   Sonia Sotomayor  And then I have a question based on that.  But you seem to be basing your argument on the point that at least the unlicensed people are not providing procedures, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, they are advertising themselves.  I looked at one -- a few of them.  An exemplary of this is the Fallbrook Pregnancy Resource Center website. And it's -- I'm fairly sophisticated -- there is a woman on the home page with a uniform that looks like a nurse's uniform in front of an ultrasound machine.  It shows an exam room. The text of the page titled ""Abortion"" says Fallbrook will educate clients about different abortion methods available, and describe in medical terms different abortion procedures. The website also says clients will be evaluated by nurses and that they follow all HIPAA regulations, which if they're not a medical provider, they don't have to follow If a reasonable person could look at this website and think that you're giving medical advice, would the unlicensed notice be wrong?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But they do provide medical advice?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So let me ask you, how's that different from what a doctor does? When you go in for a pregnancy, you see the doctor, and the doctor will describe, hopefully, the benefits of a pregnancy and perhaps its risk because, depending -- not all pregnancies are without complications. So this is consulting about a medical condition.  How is that any different than Casey? You come in to talk to an -- a doctor about abortion.  The state says you have to tell the person the alternatives.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So if you're going to choose to talk to people about -- if you're an unlicensed facility, about pregnancy, why shouldn't you tell people that you're not a doctor?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So is it okay for -- is it wrong for a state to tell agencies who give advice on immigration rights -- there's a couple of states like this -- who say if you are going to give advice on immigration matters, you better tell people you're not a lawyer.  Those are unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Now you're redefining medicine.   Sonia Sotomayor  Medicine is defined by the state.  You need a license to practice medicine.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So if you're giving people advice about pregnancy when you are not a licensed facility, please explain to me what is both misleading, incorrect, or suggestive in any way that a person has to do something like go to this doc -- to a doctor, how is it doing anything other than telling people that, despite how the picture looks on the website, this is not a medical facility?   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Farris --   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, but isn't the --   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Wall, how is that different than Casey? In Casey, we require doctors to hand out state-created materials telling the women about what services the state and others provided, adoption centers, fathers had to pay things. Now I think your distinction, and you keep repeating it, is these centers, I'm assuming both the licensed and unlicensed ones, are not doing procedures.  But I don't know what an ultrasound is if not a procedure.  I don't know what a pregnancy test is if not a procedure.  I don't know how counseling on the pregnancy state is not part of medical advice in the same way a doctor gives it when he's considering an abortion procedure.  I don't understand the difference.   Jeffrey B. Wall  So --   Sonia Sotomayor  Both of them are doing medical-related procedures, and both are being asked -- the Chief said there's a distinction in not advertising someone else's services, but in Casey, we permitted it. So please explain to me again why there's a difference here.   Jeffrey B. Wall  So, Justice Sotomayor, I agree with everything you said in the back half there.  And if California were coming in and saying, before you, licensed clinic, perform an ultrasound, you've got to provide certain information to make sure that's an informed choice by that woman to get the ultrasound in the face of risks and alternatives, then it's like Casey, and the question is just how much disclosure do you have to provide.  And Casey, I think, gives us important guidance on that. California's notice isn't doing that, at least on the licensed side.  On the licensed side, it's not helping the women who come into the clinic make an informed choice to opt into one of the medical procedures.  And I'm not disputing that ultrasounds and the rest are procedures that could trigger those kinds of disclosure requirements.  It's saying we have a generalized interest in having them know that we provide some low- and free-cost services. And if that's their generalized interest, that's tailor-made to an obvious alternative, which is let the state do what pregnancy centers do --   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry --   ",16-1140
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Klein, can we go back to the question Justice Kennedy asked the other side, which was for you to affirm or disaffirm that if one of these facilities wrote an ad that just said pro-life and put their name, it appears as if the law would require them to have the statement ""This is not a medical facility"" in 48-point font?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Klein, can we go back to my question? I have read the law with respect to facility, and it requires a facility to do one of -- two of four things before it qualifies under the law. So abortion -- you appear right that they have to, one, offer ultrasounds, obstetrics, sonograms, or prenatal care, pregnancy -- or pregnancy testing or diagnosis or, three, prenatal monogram tests or pregnancy and, four, collect health data.  But they have to do two or more of those things. But let's go back to the question Justice Kennedy asked.  One of these medical care facilities says ""pro-life"" and their name. Is that -- are they required to post a notice? And you started by answering the question, and I don't think you finished.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  My problem is that I have -- a second question.   Sonia Sotomayor  I have a lot of hypotheticals under your definition of what this section means that wouldn't be covered. So how about if an individual knows that the IRS is in the presence of -- press -- in the process of assessing his taxes and he in some way obstructs that process, or an agent -- the agent in 2004 called the defendant and said: You know, I'm deciding whether to open an investigation.  I haven't, but I'm just thinking about it.  I understand you have this business, and I don't see any tax returns. And your client answered the way he first did: I make less than $1,000.  I don't have to file.  And the agent closes the investigation -- closes the file and says: I'm not going to investigate this. Under your theory, that direct obstruction would not be actionable?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, wait a minute, yes, it can do that sometimes.   Sonia Sotomayor  It doesn't other times.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So is this one of those other times?   Sonia Sotomayor  Do you think the word ""administration"" -- ""due administration of this title,"" does any work in the interpretation? It seems to me that one could say that the example I gave is an actual affirmative act by the agency.  It is -- the agent is calling and doing his work under the Act but that what you do outside of interacting directly with the agency is more omission, which is not the administration of the Act. Could that line be drawn?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's not the line the government's offering --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- but yours is -- your broadness is sweeping up a lot of conduct that I think could be perceived as active obstruction of the work of -- the direct work of the agency.  An agent calls you and you mislead them.   Sonia Sotomayor  There -- there is something to be done about the context that this was drafted in.  As I look at the first half of this statute --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- ""Whoever corruptly or by force or threats of force (including any threatening letter or communication) endeavors to intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the U.S. acting in an official capacity"" --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- ""... or in any way corruptly or by force or threat of force, (including any threatening letter or communication) obstructs or impedes, or endeavors to obstruct or impede, the due administration of this title."" All of that seems to be geared towards some affirmative act aimed at an agent or the agency. That's where I got my earlier --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- differentiation between --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- a affirmative act and an omission act because that doesn't have the flavor of force or threat of force or threatening, all of the sort of active, violent or active, obstructive --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- behavior that the examples set forth.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I have difficulty getting to what you have --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- because you haven't, as Justice Kagan pointed out, given us anything in the language to anchor this in.  At least --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- Justice -- it appears Justice Gorsuch and I are trying to look at the language.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  A win is a win is a win.

Let's assume the following, which is closer to Pink. Okay? There is a statement by the highest court in Timbuktu, okay, not to denigrate by using that, but in another country, a sworn statement either by the Minister of Justice, who says this is a translation of the Supreme Court decision, our court is the supreme -- comparable to your court.  It's the supreme court of our nation.  And it addresses this issue.

Sonia Sotomayor  It needs to be severed under state law.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Now that's the question.  Can you agree to give something up because you're going to be damaged if you don't? If you -- I mean, why are you conditioning a defendant's right to separate trials on him giving up the prejudice argument of a joint trial?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  He's entitled to a separate trial.  Why does he need to give it up?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's not a --   Sonia Sotomayor  It's not a benefit; it's a right.   Sonia Sotomayor  So there's no right to an appeal, but we have said -- no constitutional right to an appeal, you're entitled to it statutorily, but we've said it's unfair, a Hobbesian choice, to force a defendant to give up his right to appeal to retain his double jeopardy rights.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why is it not a Hobson's choice to be forced to give up the prejudice of a joint trial in order to retain the double jeopardy rights?   Sonia Sotomayor  Uh-huh.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, you've already been -- you've already been tried.   Sonia Sotomayor  The state -- the state has made a different determination.  The state has said that presumptively these charges are prejudicial if they're tried together, and presumptively we won't permit it.   Sonia Sotomayor  No, but that's not true, because it gives not just the defendant but the state the right.  The defendant can't do it by himself or herself.  The state has to agree to it as well.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it went -- it didn't ask for one.  What it said to the defendant was: We have to sever.  Do you agree? And the defendant said: Yeah, we have to.   Sonia Sotomayor  How about if he had stood up and simply said: Do you agree? You say: Judge, that's what the law says.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.

They ask for your license and your registration.  You give them your license and a rental agreement that doesn't list you. How are they supposed to know the owner gave you permission?   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Rakas --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- our decision in -- I'm sorry, counselor -- our decision in Rakas was premised on a number of things, most importantly that the defendant didn't claim any possession or privacy interest in the goods searched or in the things in the glove compartment, et cetera. Why -- what's happened here? Meaning, is your client -- how did the information that he was given permission to store things in the trunk come before the Court?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So I'm having -- I'm having a problem with this case, which is why are we here? Meaning, once he admitted that the -- that the goods in the trunk were his, I don't know why that doesn't give him automatic standing to challenge the search. I thought in Rakas it was the fact that the defendants had repeated three or four or five different times that the defendants claimed no proprietary interest in the goods searched.  That's different than this case, isn't it?   Sonia Sotomayor  So why are we here on this legal issue at all?   Sonia Sotomayor  Even if you don't have an expectation of privacy in the trunk, you've claimed an expectation of privacy in the property.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And absent probable cause, there's no right to search.  So why are we here?   Sonia Sotomayor  But I'm not -- she's absolutely right, counselor, but I'm asking why are you pitching this case on the automobile exception.  Why don't you just argue the straightforward point that the whole -- this whole discussion is about who has the right to challenge a search, and without probable cause.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right? If you're claiming an interest in the property at issue, he's claimed it, he testified, he has a right.  So now we go to a suppression hearing.   INTERRUPTING ",16-1371
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Let's assume he wasn't a criminal.  Let's assume it was the renter's son, not the wife because there is an exception for spouse in the contract. Is that son in the same position as Mr. Reed?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I don't disagree with you, but I'm asking a question, which is: Police can search a car when they have probable cause, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  And they're free to do that of any car driven even by a licensed driver, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  Or a licensed co-driver on a rental agreement.  So really the issue here before us is when are the police permitted to search without a warrant, without probable cause? And that's what I see the issue as, because if we rule that someone without permission can -- has no expectation of privacy even when the renter has given it to them, then what we're authorizing is the police to stop every rental car and search every rental car, without probable cause, that might be on the road.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, the police here said we stopped him because he was driving a rental car.  He was doing something totally illegal.  Every driving school teaches you to put your hands at a 10 to 2 angle, and they found that suspicious. (Laughter.)   Sonia Sotomayor  And they waited until he made a turn that was not authorized by the traffic laws. So to say that there isn't a practice is a little bit disingenuous, Mr. Feigin.  But the question I really have is should we be creating exceptions to the most basic of Fourth Amendment rights, that of probable cause, before police intrude in searching at all? And we're doing it under the guise, not of was this search legal under the Fourth Amendment, but whether someone has standing to even question that. Because this is a standing case, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Their own effect. Well, we know that he was told that he could use the trunk and put things in it, whether he's a passenger or a driver.  Once he says that and the owner of -- and the renter of the car agrees with him, I'm still not sure what's missing.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why that claim of an interest is inadequate.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So every criminal defendant where their suitcase has been searched would have to say, I'm more than just the owner of the suitcase?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm the owner of the drugs? Let's assume he came in and said, I was the owner of the suitcase.   Sonia Sotomayor  I thought he made claims to the -- to the trunk, that he said I was given permission to store my things in the trunk, and that's what I did.   Sonia Sotomayor  But where have -- where else --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  We have never incorporated private rights into the Fourth Amendment.  We've said that we either look to property or tort law to define private rights. If the issue was what the owner versus a authorized user's rights are, we don't do that.  We don't look in searches of homes to what the owner of the apartment would say.  I would suspect that every owner of the apartment would say: My tenants don't have a right to engage in illegal activity.  And there may well be contracts that say, my tenants, you can't do illegal activity here. But we have recognized the rights of tenants to privacy in their home --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- because they possess it.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Oh, no.  But we've recognized overnight guests, we've recognized co-inhabitants that are not licensed in the lease.  There are 55-and-older communities in certain parts of the country where children under the age of 55 and grandchildren routinely stay.  And I doubt very much that we would ever say they don't have that legitimate expectation. So the question that I go is this will be our very, very first time where we're saying a private contract that doesn't speak about criminal liability but speaks only about insurance consequences with respect to unauthorized drivers is creating a Fourth Amendment protection.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  For the police, rather than for the person involved.   Sonia Sotomayor  But they -- they also say that --   Sonia Sotomayor  Oh, yes, we do --   Sonia Sotomayor  How about when they --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- came and got the -- became an authorized driver by lying, I don't have a criminal conviction, and he's listed, what happens then? Is that a violation of the contract sufficient enough to invalidate his expectation of privacy?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So we've now --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- criminalized a contract --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- and a contract breach.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I know you don't, but I -- I -- (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So, Mr. Feigin, the rule you want us to write in this opinion is, if you are an unauthorized driver of a rental car, even if you have permission of the authorized driver, the police can search the trunk without any probable cause?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Yeah, but the bottom line is the one I announced.   Sonia Sotomayor  Does the son of a father who owns the car but is not an authorized driver on insurance and, as a result, is not listed on the registration or the insurance card, does that son -- now we're out of the renter situation, we're in the ownership situation -- does that son have an expectation of privacy?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But why? He's breaking the law.  He doesn't have the child listed on the insurance.  He hasn't listed the child on the registration.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. --   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm having trouble with just one component of your argument, many, but one that for the moment, which is the one that led the -- the one court who's against --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- on this this issue was the courier who receives 50 dollars a week or 50 dollars a trip to deliver drugs.   Sonia Sotomayor  Under your theory that courier who on everyone facts doesn't see more than 50 dollars of whatever the profit is of this drug enterprise, that courier is responsible for a million dollars, 2 million dollars, 3 million dollars criminal conspiracy because he took an undisputedly small part. Now, assume what logic in -- in rem theory would ever make a person who's never obtaining that money, those proceeds responsible for the larger sum?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why should the drug dealer, who in fact got all of the money, minus 50 dollars, why should he be off-the-hook for even a penny less than what he put in his pocket because the courier happened to have a hundred dollars saved?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well --   Sonia Sotomayor  That's generally what a courier is responsible for that -- the drug deals he or she is involved in.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I know he could -- the divorce decree could say yes or no.  What other ways could the insured --   Sonia Sotomayor  No, let's assume he doesn't want to.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How does the insurance company know that there has been a divorce so that they receive the letter and sort of go: Why is he doing this? We already have that beneficiary.   Sonia Sotomayor  So we have a Supreme Court case because there was an ineffective attorney?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  My problem with the police power argument you're making is that I don't think it stands alone, meaning you can think that the state has a greater interest in certain areas like divorce or others, regulated fields like mineral, et cetera, but I don't think that state police power gives unbounded discretion to the state. To some extent, it's intermixed with what's the state's purpose and is it a legitimate thing it's doing.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that goes back to Justice Gorsuch's question, could the state say, upon divorce, I'm giving the money to the state or I'm giving it to a charity, et cetera?

So I'm not sure what the difference is.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If the law is compelling it or the law is permitting it, then it's the judge as well as the law.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, it takes away an express term of the contract.  It does away with the contract.  You fail to record, you get no protection.

That's a lot better than having your rights revoked completely.   Sonia Sotomayor  But that goes back to Justice Gorsuch's point, which is we look at the nature of the impairment, how difficult is it to do whatever is being changed.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Or that it was free speech that should not be stifled, correct? Are you changing your mind on that now?   Sonia Sotomayor  So there's always line-drawing.  Whether you call it intimidating speech or not, someone's going to have to draw a line. So going back to Justice Kennedy's point, why, if this is not a public forum, why can't the state reasonably draw the line at saying political speech of any kind can be potentially intimidating in a voting place and we won't permit it?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Isn't that the essence of competition, to have somebody working against you? I mean, I always thought that that was the essence of competition, that someone will come in and -- and offer the people involved in the transaction something better.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Better or that they may not know they want but that they may want. I -- I have to say if I go to a cash register and the merchant says to me, I'll give you a 1 percent discount today if you don't use Amex, I sit there and think to myself, do I need the airplane rewards or the train rewards, or do I want the 1 percent? And I do it -- and I choose differently each time depending on the nature of the transaction. But you -- this anti-steering removes that competition.   Sonia Sotomayor  You haven't told me why it doesn't remove competition.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But I don't care about the brands.  I care about my price. That's what price competition is about.   Sonia Sotomayor  I care about whether today I want to pay the 1 percent more or not.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And this vertical restraint is stopping horizontal competition.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I don't really care.  All I know is that the merchant is offering me this at $90 or $100, and I have a choice between paying $100 or $99. At this moment, I'm paying a higher price to use American Express than I want to pay.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No.  Only if I'm going to use the rewards.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, because if I'm not going to use the rewards, the $99 is still more valuable to me.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You're making my choice for me.  You're not giving me the choice.  And that's what price competition is about, my choice, not your choice about what's more valuable to me.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Some people, it's hard to believe, but there are credit card users who will never use their reward points. Your system depends on that.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, the -- the advertising mechanism failed completely. Discover tried it and said I'm just leaving money on the table because the restrictions are not just don't tell them the price difference, but don't steer them away from American Express by giving them a better deal in some other way. So you're not talking about a restriction just on what you tell them, but it's a restriction on what you do.  And so that anticompetitive effect is broader than just don't talk.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I mean, Discover couldn't tell them to -- or as they tried, very hard, to have the merchant agree to try to pass off the price saving to the customer.  They couldn't do it under American Express's conditions.   Sonia Sotomayor  Ah, but we don't know --   Sonia Sotomayor  But we don't know that because we don't know -- and American Express is the only one who does know.  We do know that the entire price increase is not passed on to consumers.  So there is a profit margin in there that can be distributed or one profit margin lowered to the benefit of the customers or -- or not, but that's what competition is about. Every competitor will decide what mix of profit, what mix will go to the consumer, won't go to the consumer, and the consumer -- finding of fact by the seven-week trial judge -- will benefit with lower prices.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, isn't that what the rule of reason does by putting this at step 2? The government's never going to know that.  It doesn't know your business model.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If you want to argue procompetitive effects, you show it. It's not up to the government to show on a -- in a different market that there's a benefit that outweighs the price stifling in the main market.  I mean, I've never heard of such a thing.  If you think there's procompetitive effects, you prove it.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I thought we had two ways of proving market power, direct and indirect.  You need to show a certain control of the market in indirect, but I think case after case have said if you can control prices, you have market power.   Sonia Sotomayor  But every competitor raised their price to match American Express's merchant price.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So this vertical restraint had a complete horizontal effect, so it has market power to control the merchant market.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, that's step 2.   Sonia Sotomayor  But we've had two-sided markets --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- we've had two-sided markets that we've looked at in antitrust law.  Justice Breyer just mentioned one.

So, if we can permit the government as employer to have a compelling interest to do something as dramatic as firing someone, why can't that interest in having workplace peace, workplace routine in which issues are decided in a -- in a collective way, why isn't that a compelling interest comparable to the others?

Sonia Sotomayor  So, if an employee is disciplined by the state for some malfeasance, that's an employment-related issue not entitled to First Amendment protection?   Sonia Sotomayor  Oftentimes.  If employees come to the union -- come to the state and want greater training, employment issue, correct?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's not going to change whether the union asks for it or the employees come -- what you're now saying is if the employees came into an auditorium at a business site of the state and every one of them got up and said, I want higher wages, the scale of that demand makes it protected by the First Amendment? It's still a work-related demand.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, let's -- let's not -- don't put in facts.  They have permission to be in the auditorium.  They walk in as a group.  Every one of them gets up and says, I want higher wages. Is that an employment issue, or does that now become public policy because, something that every employee wants, they've now articulated?

There's no anything like the grand jury.  So it can't be -- it's an imperfect substitute at best.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm -- I'm sorry, can we --   Sonia Sotomayor  Can we step back a second? Your brief notes that the Respondent did not file a motion to suppress his statements or object at the probable cause hearing to their admission. Isn't that a waiver?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, you've seen the record.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So --   Sonia Sotomayor  And wouldn't a ruling by us against you just mean that defendants -- whether it's within 48 hours at a hearing that's being held or a probable cause hearing, et cetera, wouldn't we be putting the onus on defendants to raise a valid objection if they have one then?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's a matter of -- of -- of law.  If you don't object to the admission of a statement, you've waived that objection.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, if you -- if you don't win at the probable cause hearing, that ends the case.  So it has a consequence with respect to his innocence or -- or not his innocence, but his being proven guilty or not.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  That's --   Sonia Sotomayor  Because it ends the case.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  That's true --   Sonia Sotomayor  It can end it.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  -- Justice Sotomayor, but I think what the Self-Incrimination Clause focuses on are -- is what the defendant's exposure is.  And there's no chance that at the end of that hearing that a magistrate could enter a judgment of conviction and criminal punishment could ensue.   Sonia Sotomayor  But it increases the possibility of his being found guilty and punishment imposed?   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  I think that that can't be the test because it would be inconsistent with this Court's decision in Estelle versus Smith.  The Court there recognized that there would be no self-incrimination problem with using a defendant's compelled statement to adjudicate his competence to stand trial --   Sonia Sotomayor  Only if it's raised.  Only if it's raised.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  Well, Justice Sotomayor, I think that that shows that there are complicated questions about what a defendant would then have to do to preserve an argument. And -- and this Court has earlier -- in earlier cases observed that a lot of times at the outset of a case the suppression question might be complicated and fact-intensive.  A defendant might not realize that he has a valid claim. And so to put the onus on him to --   Sonia Sotomayor  There's a lot of jurisdictions who already give defendants those rights to do it right at the beginning of the case.  Some exercise it.  Some don't.  A lot don't, because there's a lot of reasons why a defendant doesn't want to do it early on.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  Well, there's certainly a lot of variants in how state jurisdictions handle this issue, but I think the -- the problem --   Sonia Sotomayor  Very few of them seem gummed up in the way that you're anticipating this will create a problem.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  Well, that's, I think, because, as -- as we read the criminal cases, that this issue hasn't largely arisen, and there hasn't been a requirement that courts adjudicate suppression questions in the sequencing of preliminary proceedings before they resolve other issues in the case. If this Court were to instead adopt a broader rule and find that any use in any proceeding in a criminal case could violate the Fifth Amendment, then I expect that it would require substantial changes to the criminal process.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, just so we're clear, the -- I think the concurring opinion in this case did a very good job of pointing out that all of the questions that are being asked, both by Justice Alito and by Justice Breyer, there is a substantial question about whether any of these statements were compelled.   Sonia Sotomayor  There is a substantial question about whether there was an objection or not.  There are lots of questions that the concurrent said still had to be decided, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could I just go back?   Sonia Sotomayor  There is a circuit split on this.  There's three circuits on one side, three circuits on the other -- four now on the other side. Among those four are now the Tenth, the Ninth, the Seventh, and the Second who support your position.   Sonia Sotomayor  Do you know whether the works have been gummed up in those circuits?   Sonia Sotomayor  How do you distinguish Estelle?   Sonia Sotomayor  This is such an odd case because I'm not quite sure that there was a compelled statement at all, if the facts as I've read them -- and I know they're not in the record and I know what the Chief says -- but, first of all, no employer -- his employer didn't compel these statements.  He went to his employer because he wanted a different job.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  On the second statement, he went to his chief and said: I'm resigning.

Tripp  I guess our basic take is that the answer to that doesn't really matter because we've picked one of the two interpretations and it's really up to Respondent to show that our interpretation is not even reasonable.  And we think that there's just no way that they can do that.  Our interpretation, we think, is just a better interpretation, if you were choosing among the two.   Sonia Sotomayor  So why is the agency better than a court suited to define its own jurisdiction?   Zachary D. Tripp  Right.  And so that's what I was wanting to get at and explain how these regulations work.  And I -- so I think the key point that I want to emphasize here is that in the preemption provision, the crucial language is, is what is the nature and extent of the benefits and benefit payments available under one of the plans? And that is tied to something OPM is already administering under a different provision of the statute.  8902(d) says that each contract shall include such benefits and limitations and other definitions of benefits as it considers necessary or desirable. So those two things go hand in hand.  In the regulations, they work the same way.  In Section B(1) of the regulations, it says that subrogation imposes a condition of and a limitation on benefits and benefit payments and that makes good sense.  It's a clawback provision.

Putting that aside, it doesn't necessarily follow that an investigation by a company always precedes the prosecution.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The typical way is the government prosecutes -- investigates.   Sonia Sotomayor  So what do I do with the fact that statutes of restitution passed at an identical time to this statute used your words, used the words: The victim's entitled to the damages proximately caused by the offense.  Yet Congress here, instead of using those very simple and direct words that would cover everything that's happened here, decided to break it up into four categories and very specifically told courts what those categories encompass. There's a recent proposal that's being considered now, I think it's by either the Sentencing Commission or some congressional committee, that's saying should we change this statute and all the others to simply say ""make the victim whole.""

Sonia Sotomayor  And so I think they have stopped being a member of the public as might be understood with respect to access.  I think one thinks of members of the public as anyone who might be interested, but not compelled to be in attendance.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So I think what Presley said, if I'm not mistaken, is that you can't keep out interested people just because of overcrowding.   Sonia Sotomayor  Could -- could I ask you, though, there is a big difference between the absence of an attorney at trial or a conflict of interest.  In both those situations, there's not a possibility of waiver or forfeiture -- the -- knowing waiver or forfeiture because a conflicted counsel has failed to tell someone a truth that they're conflicted and gotten themselves off the case.  Absence of counsel is the very essence of the violation.   Sonia Sotomayor  The defendant doesn't know enough to object.  But here there are serious questions about waiver and forfeiture.  It's -- why wouldn't it be in the best interest of every attorney to say, I didn't know that a closure was a constitutional violation, the way this gentleman did? Isn't that --   Sonia Sotomayor  No.  In every circumstance.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  In -- in virtually every circumstance, the lawyer knows there's been a closure. There's been plain error in his failure -- his or her failure to object.  So how does the judge determine whether that waiver or forfeiture should or should not be held against the defendant?   Sonia Sotomayor  It's available.  The question is, wouldn't the judge be doing exactly what's happening here? Wouldn't the judge, under the fourth prong, look at what actually happens, whether the closure was complete, part of the trial, was there a transcript of the voir dire --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- so that they could measure the possible effects or not, and end up saying that the substantial integrity of the proceedings haven't been violated? Do you think that, as a matter of law, we could overrule a finding of that nature, if it was in direct review under plain error?

Your -- your adversaries are taking the position, logically so, that, if a union wants to enter arbitration, we've already heard the Court speak on this issue, the union can substitute arbitration for a judicial forum because then the collective body of workers has acted together and contracted together on an equal footing with the employer for that term. Now, the problem that I have with this bilateral issue is you seem to be thinking that somehow the NLRB can't invalidate a contractual term, just as state law concepts like fraud, duress, the normal contract terms that invalidate contracts, Section 7 and Section 8 of the NLRB basically declare a contract -- a contract illegal if it does a certain thing. And that is if it stops an individual from concerted activities.  So what that starts with is this contract's no longer valid. There's nothing to take to the courthouse --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, this issue wasn't raised there.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Is this contract --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Wall, we didn't have in those cases a third -- or raised a third statutory provision that protects a particular action, in any type of action in mutual aid or concerted activity like the NLRB or the Norris-LaGuardia Act. But putting that aside, I'm not sure that the FAA is now a rule of statutory construction.  Basically, what you're saying is the FAA trumps the NLRB's concerted activity statement and its broadness, that somehow it stops, you say, at the courtroom door.  So does your colleague.  I don't know how you do that when at least one of these agreements, if not all three, have confidentiality agreements that prohibit the employers from talking to other employers, from combining with other employers. If it does that and it stops them from going to the courtroom door, is that an unfair labor act?   Sonia Sotomayor  Only when it's been a fight between whether that statute and the cause of action it provided overrode the FAA.  This is more as to the making of a contract, which is like a state law defense, a common state law defense like fraud or duress, except it's federal law here saying you can't do this.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it was clear in saying that concerted activity cannot be interfered with.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's the point with this.  What is stopping the concerted activity is not that -- which forum they choose, whether it's court or arbitration. Where you're stopping the concerted activity is in the very act of saying this can only be an individual arbitration, an individual court action. What your adversaries have stipulated to in resolving this question is, if they can have collective activity in arbitration, according to their argument, it's harder for them to win.  But this particular provision is illegal because it is removing collective activity from both forums, from any forum whatsoever.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's assuming that test applies in this situation --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- where a contract has been invalidated by statute.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But I don't know whether --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  There's always --   Sonia Sotomayor  There's always -- there's always a set of degrees.  I mean, whether or not we talk about this rational person would have accepted, how much of a defense and how viable is the defense? Would 1 percent defense versus 20 percent defense, 30 percent defense? At some point the district court is going to draw a rationality line that they think is reasonable, correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So if -- if there -- if there's a defense that has a 1 percent chance, is that okay, versus one that has a 20 percent chance? Or how do you even measure how rational a potential defense may be --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- if the inquiry is how much do we know he would or would not have taken this plea?   Sonia Sotomayor  There's no question --   Sonia Sotomayor  I think the district court said here that this defendant would have gone to trial.

But putting that aside, you're not entitled to a plea.  You're not entitled to a lesser sentence.  You're entitled to go to jail if you want to.  Isn't that what we said in Dominguez Benitez in a Rule 11 Strickland evaluation? We said that a court should, quote, ""Not second guess a defendant's actual decision if it is reasonably probable he would have gone to trial absent the error, it is no matter that the choice may have been foolish."" Now, that's Strickland under Rule 11, and it's the same inquiry.  Would he have pled guilty if he had known this information? And we explicitly said your decision can be foolish.   Sonia Sotomayor  It's not an analogy.  It talks about Strickland in the Rule 11 context.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So here we have a defense attorney who says: I didn't know the law.  I told him he wouldn't be deported.  And if I had known the law, I would have told him to go to trial.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So this is both prejudice in the advice and prejudice in the decision to go -- move forward.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Or not move forward.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And if he has that right, aren't we depriving him of that right and the right to a trial, both of them guaranteed by the Constitution -- as I keep saying, a plea is not -- to have his attorney try everything that is legally permissible to try? None of these attempts -- and your adversary went on for pages of the variety of different ways for him to have achieved a nondeportation plea as a possibility.  Doesn't he have a right to have someone try that for him?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Feigin, you know, we're talking about cases like this, the circuits are split.  The vast majority of them do the reasonable probability test and don't seem to have the problems you're talking about. Do you know how many of these motions there are?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  There's not a whole --   Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I mean, there's not a whole lot of them.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  There's a handful of them.  The vast majority, the motion for relief are denied by the lower courts, not on the Sixth Circuit rule, but on the totality of the circumstances.  It -- it doesn't appear as if we're overwhelmed with these.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How many of them are being granted?   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Feigin -- Mr. Feigin, routinely papers come in from a Petitioner who says, my lawyer didn't do X.  Most commonly, the lawyer comes in and says I did do X.  And most commonly, the district court says the lawyer told me I did X, and at the pea -- plea colloquy I asked that question and the defendant said yes, I understood that consequence, and the court doesn't have a hearing. A ruling in our case wouldn't change those cases.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It wouldn't change the cases where the defendant comes in and says I would have pled guilty, but the lawyer comes in and says he insisted he was innocent.  I kept telling him the evidence was overwhelming, that he should take the plea, but he kept telling me I'm innocent.  It doesn't require a hearing for a judge to say that defendant would not have pled guilty because he was claiming his innocence. Those cases wouldn't change either. Those are a good majority of the cases that come before district and circuit courts.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I still go back to -- to my earlier point, which is the difference between nine years and five and ten years is very big. For nine months and sure banishment? What's so irrational about going to trial?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what do we do -- what do we do with all those defendants who reject pleas with full knowledge and say a rational person must have wanted -- should have taken this case.

Would this general principle be preempted by the FFA -- by the FAA?   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. --   Sonia Sotomayor  Following up on Justice Alito's question, and I know Ping is not before us, but applying your arguments to Ping, because the author of Ping dissented in these two cases, do you think Ping is closer to the neutral application of a contract interpretation?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  I'm having a great deal of difficulty with this business model. Completely.  You buy old, old debts that you know for certainty are not within any statute of limitations. You buy them and you call up creditors and you say to them, you don't have to pay me.  But out of the goodness of your heart, you should? Or do you just call them up and say, you owe me money, and you hope that they'll pay you. And is it the same thing in bankruptcy court? You filed a claim and you hope the trustee doesn't see that it's out of time? And apparently, you collect on millions of dollars of these debts.  So is that what you do?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Did you have a good-faith basis in this case to believe that the debt was not time-barred --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- when you filed this claim? Forget about some of the others.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Did you have a good-faith basis to believe the statute of limitations was not applicable?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, no.  Not what they did; what they said.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I agree with you.  But if -- if that is true that you investigated and you had a good-faith basis for believing that it wasn't time-barred, you wouldn't be liable either under the bankruptcy rules or under these debtor rules.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Contingent, unmatured, these are all words that suggest an entitlement to payment.  Where in the definition any use of word -- of words talk about a claim that's unenforceable? A contingent claim may not be enforceable today, but it might be in the future.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  What do you do with the language of Pennsylvania Public Welfare v. Davenport where we explicitly said that a claim is a right to payment and enforceable obligation? What do you do with that language?   Sonia Sotomayor  So it's a breach of the trustee's duties if he or she lets the claim go through without objecting?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  You know, I have a -- it is a very moving statement, and one that I totally agree with, but we're not asking the police officers to make that choice.  When they feel in danger, they are going to take the step that's important to them, and I think that's absolutely right. The issue is who's going to suffer that loss? Who's going to take the financial penalty of that loss, not that that's the -- the death of the officer. And so the question to me is not that one.  The question is when does the police officer pay the victim who is suffering for that loss if the victim had nothing to do with causing the loss?   Sonia Sotomayor  Or -- or was justified in whatever he or she did to protect themselves. So let's take the situation, which I think you concede in your brief, that of the police officer who, in the dead of night, in -- dressed in casual clothes, breaks a window in someone's home and walks into their home. And we have given them the Second Amendment right to victims, people who own homes, to possess firearms to protect themselves.  And the victim sees a stranger breaking in who doesn't announce themselves, doesn't have a uniform, and is standing there breaking in.  The victim shoots that police officer, or points a gun at that police officer, and the police officer takes a gun and shoots them and injures them or kills them. Now who bears the financial loss in that situation? The homeowner, who has a right to defend him or herself and say it's my life or yours, or the police officer who has taken unreasonable action in breaking into a home in the middle of the night without announcing him or herself? That's the question for me.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, let's -- let's break that down, because I see two scenarios in this for which a victim could -- could recover. One is an unconstitutional violation that proximately causes an injury.  Okay? That's the theory you come to.  And the second is, if there was an unreasonable use of force by the police officer.  You're taking out of the equation the second way of -- of recovering?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's where I have -- '   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.   Sonia Sotomayor  So, why is it that every Graham case we look at, all the car chase cases, every single one of them, we -- when we're talking about the situation facing the officer, we look at everything the officer and the victim did that led up to the moment of confrontation.  Because all of the facts that you point to as the police officer's knowledge of the victim are facts that usually are intertwined with what led up to the incident. So if you look at a car chase, you're looking at a person who, over an extended period of time has driven a car crazily, has put other people at risk, has swerved and missed other cars, done a series of things that the officer is aware of because he participated in the chase, and at the moment that he is looking at what the victim -- what the defendant is doing, he's saying he drove the car and almost hit another car, he's pointing the car at me, he's going to hit me. And -- but you're looking at both sides of that equation.  You're not ratcheting it up on one side.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Well, you're right that you're looking at all of the facts and circumstances, but those that bear on whether the use of force is reasonable. And just to give an example, in Plumhoff, which is one of the car chase cases that the Court addressed, the district court in that case said well, the police officer was chasing him, so the police officer helped create the dangerous situation, and this Court in footnote 3 of its opinion said: No.  Police, by doing their jobs, don't -- aren't responsible for creating the dangerous situation and don't forfeit the ability to defend themselves --   Sonia Sotomayor  But why isn't --   Nicole A. Saharsky  -- from the public.   Sonia Sotomayor  -- how they do their job, because they have to know -- they have to know what reasonable people will do.  I mean, if -- if a 1983 claim is a tort claim, and if they jump in front of a car, of a total stranger on the street, and the person is coming at them, should that person behind the wheel bear the brunt of an injury because the police officer says the car was coming towards me, so to save myself, I pulled the gun and shot them, even though this is Joe Blow who's never been arrested, doesn't own a gun, never knew the officer had jumped into the street? If a normal person did that, they'd pay for that victim's injury.  Why does a police officer get a pass on that?   Nicole A. Saharsky  Well, as a general matter, Section 1983 is about courts setting clearly established constitutional rules for the police that the police have to follow.  It's not a question of asking whether the police just behaved reasonably in the abstract, but in terms of each thing that the police officer did and whether it followed the established rule, the established rule --   Sonia Sotomayor  So is it --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- for a police officer to pull a gun and shoot a driver that has no guilt associated with him or her? Not an armed felon, just a normal person to stumble into the street and say, I'm a police officer, I'm going to seize that person and stop myself by being injured by shooting that person?   Nicole A. Saharsky  Well, I think you would ask in that question what -- whether there really was a threat that the officer was responding to, and I think you're positing a situation where there really wasn't a threat there.  But I think in this circumstance, everyone recognized that there was a threat facing these officers who are going about doing their police business in good faith, and they see a person pointing what appeared to be a gun at them.  And what the Ninth Circuit said is: We're going to second-guess everything else that you did that day, and even though this use of force was reasonable under Graham, we're going to hold you liable for it.

You're assuming it's unconstitutional.  No one's addressed it, and I don't think the Court did below, whether that entry had an exception for unconstitutionality.  Was it an exigent circumstance or not? You're assuming that they didn't have a legal motive for entry.  I'm willing to start with that assumption, but let's assume that a court below could say that the entry was lawful because it was pursuant to exigent circumstances. What would happen to your argument then?   Sonia Sotomayor  So we're assuming that the entry was unlawful.  There were no exceptions to it in this case.   Sonia Sotomayor  Let's go to that superseding cause document.  Earlier you said to Justice Alito that if a police officer unlawfully enters your home, announces him or herself, shows you a badge, and you pull out a gun and point it at him or her, that that officer would not be liable for shooting you because, presumably, that person, knowing that you're a police officer, if they pull a gun on you, they are responsible for the consequences, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So what's the difference between that scenario and this one? Why aren't -- why isn't Mr. Mendez's -- I don't think there's a dispute that he was moving the gun not because he heard the police officers, but he just wanted to get it out of the way -- that there was no intent on his part?

A class action motion is filed. The court dismisses it saying, wrong venue.  This should have been in California instead of New York.  Under your theory, because a new complaint is filed in California, that statute of limitations or that statute of repose starts to run from the filing of the new complaint, not the old one?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  There is a rule that says if you're in the wrong venue, there's an automatic tolling.  But you're saying that that rule would not apply in that circumstance.   Sonia Sotomayor  But so could the judge.   Sonia Sotomayor  You could -- you can ask for it, but it's still within the judge's discretion whether to transfer or dismiss and let you file anew.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So answer my question.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Under your theory -- under your theory, action means new complaint, new complaint number?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Even though it's asking for the same relief?   Sonia Sotomayor  By the same party?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So that means motions to intervene won't help --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- if the class is ultimately denied.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what happens when the complaint is denied?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, which -- in which way are you talking about? What rule?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But Justice Ginsburg is not asking you about 24 hours or anything else.  She's asking you about a tower dump.  A crime happens at a bank, the teller says or doesn't say that the robber -- she saw the robber on the phone at some point. Could the police just get a tower dump of the cell site to see who was in that area at that time?   Sonia Sotomayor  So what's the difference between a tower dump and targeting a particular individual? Let's say an anonymous call came in that said John X or John Doe was at a particular -- was the robber. Could the police then say to the telephone company let me see the records of John Doe for that hour or for that day or whatever the -- the duration of the crime was?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  So differentiate that situation.   Sonia Sotomayor  But isn't that the same concern here? And that's why I -- I'm differentiating between incident-related searches and basically dragnet searches when you're looking at what a person is doing over 127, 30, 40, even 24 hours, which is it's not related to any legitimate police need to invade the privacy of a person over a 24-hour period, unless there's a suggestion that the crime occurred during that entire 24-hour period. So that's why I asked you is there a difference between saying if police have cause to believe a crime has been committed, can they ask for records related to that individual crime, even if it happened on one day, a second day, a fourth day, a 10th day, so long as they're limiting their search as related to a criminal activity, as opposed to a dragnet sweep of everybody's intimate details? Because right now we're only talking about the cell sites records, but as I understand it, a cell phone can be pinged in your bedroom.  It can be pinged at your doctor's office.  It can ping you in the most intimate details of your life.  Presumably at some point even in a dressing room as you're undressing. So I am not beyond the belief that someday a provider could turn on my cell phone and listen to my conversations. So I'm not sure where your 24-hour rule comes from.  Shouldn't your rule be based on incident-related rather than the essence of your complaint, which is that we're permitting police to do a dragnet search of your life?   Sonia Sotomayor  Are we -- are we radically extending them? From the very beginning, Smith, for example, basically said the disclosure at issue doesn't disclose the content of the conversation.  As the dissent pointed out, the provider had access to the -- to the content of the conversation. Yet, we drew a line in saying cell phone numbers -- telephone numbers are disclosable because everybody knows that the telephone company is keeping track of those numbers.  You get it in your phone bill at the end of each month. But we said people don't know or even if they realize that the phone company can listen in to their conversation, that there's a reasonable expectation that the phone company won't, absent some urgent circumstance, a death threat, almost a special needs circumstance. That suggests, as you started to say earlier, that it never was an absolute rule, the third-party doctrine.  We limited it when -- in Bond and Ferguson when we said police can't get your medical records without your consent, even though you've disclosed your medical records to doctors at a hospital. They can't touch your bag to feel what's in your bag because an individual may disclose his or her bag to the public.  I think one of my colleagues here said you can -- why shouldn't people expect others to touch their bag as well? Well, and the Court said no because you expose what your bag looks like, but you don't have an expectation that people are going to touch your bag. So is it really that far off to say, yes, I can believe that my location at one moment or other moments might be searched by police, but I don't expect them to track me down for 24 hours over 127 days?

Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Dreeben, why is it not okay, in the way we said about beepers, to plant a beeper in somebody's bedroom, but it's okay to get the cell phone records of someone who I -- I don't, but I know that most young people have the phones in the bed with them. (Laughter.)   Sonia Sotomayor  All right? I know people who take phones into public restrooms. They take them with them everywhere.  It's an appendage now for some people. If it's not okay to put a beeper into someone's bedroom, why is it okay to use the signals that phone is using from that person's bedroom, made accessible to law enforcement without probable cause?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's today, Mr. Dreeben, but we need to look at this with respect to how the technology is developing.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You -- we can beep phones in a bedroom now.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, this is no different than a telephone company having access to your telephone conversations.  But we protected those --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- in Smith.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Yeah, but -- but an -- in an envelope, you seal the envelope. You can -- you can yourself control the public disclosure. But with telephones, the telephone company could have plugged in and listened to your conversation just as easily as these telecommunications companies can read your e-mails if they choose.  Yet, we've said we would protect e-mail content.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Dreeben, what do you do with the survey mentioned by your opposing colleague that says that most Americans, I still think, want to avoid Big Brother.  They want to avoid the concept that government will be able to see and locate you anywhere you are at any point in time. Is it -- do you really believe that people expect that the government will be able to do that without probable cause and a warrant?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The -- the Constitution protects the rights of people to be secure.  Isn't it a fundamental concept, don't you think, that that would include the government searching for information about your location every second of the day --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- for months and months at a time?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, the question is, was it -- the fact that Congress recognized how sensitive this information is, is quite laudatory, but did it understand the measure of the constitutional requirement of what protections should be given to that? I mean, I -- I can defer to Congress's understanding of the privacy needs, but does that create an obligation for me to defer to their judgment of what protections the Constitution requires? The Constitution has always said government can't intrude, except in some carefully defined situation, special needs being foremost among them -- can't intrude on those privacy interests without a warrant. We're not saying they can't ever.  They've just got to have articulable facts based on reliable information, sworn to in an affidavit, that can provide probable cause to believe that this individual is involved in criminal activity. That's not a new standard.  That's an old standard.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But we have --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- we have said -- you know, we have made exceptions all the time, Ferguson, Bond, even in creating Smith and Miller, we created an exception.  People disclose the content of telephone calls to third parties.  But we said the government can't intrude without a warrant in that situation.   Sonia Sotomayor  Could the government say to telecommunications providers, you cannot use this kind of information, you can't keep it?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what's the difference between that and saying, if you want to create this information, you are taking this information from customers and it's the customer's information? You can't disclose it without the customer saying yea or nay.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Isn't what that Congress did?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, but then we -- then you're begging the question, which is Justice Gorsuch's question, which is: What's the -- what does the law, the Fourth Amendment, require in those circumstances?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You're -- you're saying Congress can set the level of what the Constitution requires, but I don't know that that's true.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that's --   Sonia Sotomayor  But that's begging the question.  Is it the third-party's information when Congress says it's customer information?

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  Didn't it register in Montana?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  To do business, doesn't it -- isn't it required to register?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Now, I thought the --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- Court below didn't reach that question, but does the registration in Montana change this discussion?   Sonia Sotomayor  Then if I, as an individual, establish residency in multiple places, I can be sued for all of my activities there, correct? So why can't a corporation?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So if you treat a corporation like a person, which we seem to be doing, why isn't their registration of an agent for purposes of accepting service enough?   Sonia Sotomayor  What does that do in the hypothetical 50/50? Let's say a State has a headquarters in Delaware.  It sells 51 percent of its goods in New York and 51 percent -- and 49 percent in California.  Almost equal number of employees, a difference of 10 percent, let's say.  Same amount of property, whatever.  And I'm assuming this railroad could fit that description in a number of States. Why isn't it at home where a substantial amount of its business is going on?   Nicole A. Saharsky  Well, because that would make the railroad at home in so many places for purposes of general jurisdiction.  And the Court said that where the focus should be going forward, and we think that this makes sense, is in specific jurisdiction. In the situation that you posited where there are these two States where a lot of things are happening, that's where you would expect a lot of causes of action to arise.  And so there would be personal jurisdiction over the defendant there.  It would just be on a specific jurisdiction. The Court conceived of general jurisdiction as a fallback, a place where you couldn't just subject the defendant to suit there for a claim arising out of a related-to its contacts with the State --   Sonia Sotomayor  What's the logic of --   Nicole A. Saharsky  -- just any type of claim.   Sonia Sotomayor  What's the logic of -- what's the logic of that?   Nicole A. Saharsky  It's --   Sonia Sotomayor  What's -- what's -- other than we said it.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Sure.   Sonia Sotomayor  It certainly was very different than what International Shoe ever considered. What's -- what's the unfairness? We go back a little bit to the question that -- to the predecessor case.  If you're present in both States in an almost equal amount, and you are doing the bulk of your business equally, why shouldn't you feel that you're going to be hauled into both places?   Nicole A. Saharsky  Well, the difference between being hauled into court for claims that arise out of or are related to the context with the State, as opposed to claims that are just any kind of possible claims.  And I think the reason that the Court talked about you being at home is because it's the equivalent of like domicile for a person.  It said what's the equivalent of a corporation? A place where it voluntarily chooses to go to do its business.  It gets the benefits of that State's law, and then it means that it also has to have the burdens.  And the burdens are not just that you would be subject to any claim -- or to the claims that are related to the State, but to any kind of claim. So in somewhere where there is that kind of relationship that the corporation has in terms of incorporation or principal place of business, it's fair for the corporation, like a person, where they're domiciled, to have to answer for any type of claim.  But if we're talking about somewhere that you -- that the corporation is just doing business where it's not considered at home, it's fair, the Court said, for the corporation in that circumstance to have to answer for claims that are related to the forum.  But here, we have these claims that have just no relationship to the forum at all.  We don't have the plaintiffs from the forum, we don't have any injury in the forum, the defendants are not at home or incorporated in the forum. So we do think it makes sense for general jurisdiction, as the Court conceived of it in Goodyear and Daimler, to be this kind of safety valve going forward, and that where the bulk of the action would be is in the specific jurisdiction context.  Because after all, those are the places where things happened that are related to the litigation.  There's people there; there's evidence there.  Those States have an interest in having those claims adjudicated, spending their juries and their resources on claims that were related to and happened in the State. If the Court has no further questions, we'd urge that the judgment of the court below be reversed. Thank you.   ",16-405X

So --   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Feigin, all you're saying is how much power you have and how much power to coerce you have. The other side is simply saying if a defendant wants to accept your power, let him do so expressly.  You can worry about what courts are doing separately, but that shouldn't bind him or her to the whim of whether you will let them plead guilty based on an appeal waiver that's so broad that they can't challenge anything that's a constitutional violation.   Sonia Sotomayor  And In some jurisdictions, the Judges use that to deny an acceptance of responsibility.   Sonia Sotomayor  And ""may"" -- ""may"" doesn't ""should."" And ""may"" is discretionary, because the sentencing reduction is discretionary.  And I know of many prosecutors' offices who routinely tell Judges if a defendant seeks to preserve an appeal right, they have not accepted responsibility. And many Judges, just like many Judges won't accept the appeal waiver for that reason, don't give the acceptance of responsibility.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  In -- in -- in a bunch of different cases, Bailey being one of them, the government relied in many where we found things retroactive, the government has relied on plea waivers.  And most circuits have thrown out those cases by a defendant.   Sonia Sotomayor  You -- you have. I have examples of them.  There are cases in which you've done that across -- maybe not you personally, but I'm talking about U.S. -- U.S. Attorneys across the country have.

But since it has no home State in the United States, that means that in that situation, there's no place for plaintiffs to come together and sue that person; correct?   Rachel P. Kovner  I think that it might not be in the United States.  There will not be a general jurisdiction location for international defendants --   Sonia Sotomayor  Products are sold here across the United States.  All the marketing, everything is the same.  The theory is the same.  But because it's a foreign State, there's no one jurisdiction -- a foreign company, there's no one jurisdiction in the United States now under your theory.   Rachel P.

Sonia Sotomayor  There is an amicus brief here that talked about all of the criminal laws that would be subject to questioning under your theory of -- of constitutional due process. What is your response to them? Is it the same as Mr. Katyal's? We'll face that when we get to it?   Rachel P. Kovner  No.  I don't think that the -- this Court has applied its civil personal jurisdiction cases in the same way in a criminal context.  The United States has a strong sovereign interest in regulating certain conduct when it occurs overseas --   Sonia Sotomayor  If due process says that you can't hail someone into a court with which they've had no contacts, how do you justify the many criminal statutes we have -- RICO, CERCLA, there's a whole bunch of them -- that permit the joinder of all of these defendants in one indictment?   Rachel P.

Rachel P. Kovner  Yes.  And with respect to the civil component, I mean, courts have looked to personal jurisdiction considerations.  We think if it's a Federal statute, the relevant question would be a Fifth Amendment analysis.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I have three ways of looking at this case or of the issues here. The first way is to say that this is a repeal, which it seems you're arguing, and you're saying to us does or does not this statute permit a repeal? And if I say it permits repeals of all kinds, partial or complete -- partial or not partial, we avoid the constitutional question because then you could do whatever kind of repeal you want. The second way to look at this is that the statute does not prevent repeals at all. That's what you're arguing right now.  That would make this statute unconstitutional. And the third approach is basically what the government is arguing here, which is it prevents -- it permits complete repeals but not partial repeals because partial repeals of the nature taken here are actually authorizations that are prohibited by the law. So those are the three approaches.  Am I missing something in what the -- those approaches are?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's the second --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- that's the second.  Or is this a fourth way of looking at it?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's my second way.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's my second way.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Olson, I do have a question following up on what the Chief asked earlier.  The Respondent says the New Jersey legislature is doing exactly what he thinks they shouldn't do or wouldn't do, which is that they are considering legislation that would fully repeal the sports betting prohibitions. I understand it's being considered by both houses.  Where does that consideration stand right now?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, but you argued to us that no state legislature would do that. But here we have --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- two have -- two bills introduced that would do just that.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why?   Sonia Sotomayor  Let -- let me ask you, what's so crazy about Congress perceiving that states would never want 12-year-olds to go into gambling houses and that the states would find some way of prohibiting that or living with rules of some sort of creating laws, regulations, conduct that would prohibit that sort of thing?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's your selective -- your selective prosecution theory, that they're permitting fantasy teams?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Wall --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Can you go back to the basic question, and it was raised, I think, by the dissent, Judge Fuentes, who said you start this discussion from the fact that a law exists, if it's a partial or full repeal, the law doesn't exist.  Period, end of story.  And that's the baseline. So why is a partial repeal unconstitutional -- or in violation of the preemption clause? Because if the law didn't exist, the fact that they've carved out a certain section of the -- of the population for whom the law will stay in existence, that's not actually authorizing.  That's just merely repealing.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, but that's the issue that the court below avoided.  I haven't looked at the licensing laws below -- in -- in New Jersey because they weren't provided to us, and it was further afield than the question presented, but the court below said that it was not -- passing on that question because it found a different answer. But you might be right if the licenses that those two facilities hold really are -- are general and say, you're authorized to do any gambling permitted by law.  Then you might have an argument.

Why are you less worried about the international -- the impact on international relations?   Brian H. Fletcher  Because --   Sonia Sotomayor  Your adversaries are telling us that we should be worried.   Brian H. Fletcher  They are right, and I think they are absolutely correct that ATS litigation in recent decades has raised international friction, indeed as this case has raised international friction.  But in our view, the way to deal with that friction is with a doctrine that speaks directly to the international entanglement, extraterritoriality, as this Court did in Kiobel and as it can further do as those -- as those questions arise. But I think one way to illustrate that point is to ask whether this case would produce less international friction if it had been brought against the high-ranking officers and employees of the bank rather than against the bank itself.  And I think the answer is you would still have some degree of international friction if you had suits against corporate officers and employees. And what that tells you is that the way to deal with international friction is by carefully defining, as this Court had begun to do already in Kiobel, the types of violations that are remediable, but I think once you have a remediable violation, that's really the way we view the question here, that however --   Sonia Sotomayor  I don't think that the -- the Congress would have been worried about an alien defendant if it had been a pirate.

So I need assistance in determining that, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  In what other area do we permit the State or a court to appoint -- to not fund an expert once there is viable evidence of a potential defense?   Sonia Sotomayor  In the -- in any area.   Sonia Sotomayor  Now, I'm not sure that you've answered Justice Kennedy's question.  He started with the observation that there is an argument.  I know -- we know you don't accept it, you don't have to keep saying that -- that Ake was ambiguous. If it was, what happens to your case? How do you win?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Counselor, before the 1970s -- and you haven't shown me anything to the contrary -- forfeiture was an in rem proceeding where the property was attached; the money, the bank account, a piece of property, a home, whatever, but it was not a personal action against an individual.  So how do we get from that traditional understanding which governed this statute to your meaning today? Because there is a vast difference between in rem and in personam actions.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  A fine has -- I mean, forfeit -- disgorgement is an equitable remedy on getting back money that doesn't belong to you.  A fine is a payment in addition to the conduct that you committed.  So there is a difference there.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That begs the question.   Sonia Sotomayor  Can we go back to the authority? 78u, which is the only authority I can imagine, says, ""A court may grant any equitable relief that may be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors."" If they are not doing -- if they're not doing restitution, how could that be the basis of disgorgement?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I'll let your adversary tell me what the source of their power is, but I -- I -- it is unusual.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Would you tell me why you think this is punitive?   Sonia Sotomayor  What are your best arguments? I've read your brief, but the government responded to some of them in -- in, well, somewhat persuasive ways.  So what do you think remains as your strongest argument as to why it's punitive and not restorative?   Sonia Sotomayor  But that's every -- restitution is that way, and you don't think of restitution as punitive.   Sonia Sotomayor  It's a question I'm going to ask your adversary, but what do you see as the difference between -- besides the statute of limitations, what's the difference between restitution and disgorgement?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What's the name of that case?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I don't know why that proves anything.  If I commit a crime and take my proceeds and give half of it to Justice Breyer -- (Laughter.)   Sonia Sotomayor  I don't know what I was buying, but I bought something.  I got the benefit just because I was able to direct it.  So I don't know that that moves me.   Sonia Sotomayor  It gets more complicated than that, because the money goes to the court --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- according to the government, and it's the court that decides how the money will be paid out, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  And then the question becomes what you answered earlier, which is, if it's being paid to the victim, is it really restitution as opposed to disgorgement.  And if it's restitution, is it compensatory damages subject to the existing statute of limitations.

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So if this is the houseboat, why don't we call this restitution?   Sonia Sotomayor  Now, in forfeiture, you're tracing in some metaphysical way a pot that has been wrongfully taken.   Sonia Sotomayor  And you are in traditional forfeiture saying, give back that pot. In this situation, we're not asking for that pot.  We don't care where the money comes from.  We're saying you're liable for a fixed money judgment that you're going to give up.  So how is that not the same as a penalty? Because a penalty is saying to someone, you've committed a wrong.  We don't care what you did with that pot that you got.  We're not asking you in a traditional forfeiture sense to turn that pot over. We're asking you to give money from whatever sources you may have, other sources, and pay for the wrong that you did. So isn't it analytically more like a penalty than it is like making someone whole?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I think making someone whole is a forfeiture.  Give up the illegal gains you got.   Sonia Sotomayor  Doesn't matter.  The question --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- is --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- if it looks like a forfeiture, why don't we treat it like a forfeiture?   ",16-529X

But it used something very different here. Rather, it says that property is, quote, ""subject to attachment as provided in this section."" Those are two very distinct formulations.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  I thought that the University of Chicago had raised an interesting argument, that the definition of foreign state in the statute includes, by definition, an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state, so that the reference to foreign state that you're relying upon does include the concept of piercing the corporate veil in its very definition.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that -- not quite, because what -- I mean, this provision deals directly in aid of the plaintiffs in the Bancec case and in the others that had found against plaintiffs. There are at least three cases where a class of plaintiffs were found not to be in a sufficiently tied relationship to the foreign state and the plaintiffs there couldn't recover, so there was a real issue this was addressing, the fact that there were subsidiaries and agencies of foreign state who had commercial property, and it wasn't being made available to plaintiffs.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why? It gave them what those three cases denied them.  It gives other plaintiffs with similar claims a lot -- access to a lot of -- of property that they wouldn't have had under Bancec.

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr Katyal, I am totally confused with the permissive and -- or automatic.  If it's okay to do all of this with permissive intervenors and all of the discovery and other burdens that you're talking about, why isn't it okay to do it with automatic intervenors who are limited to only the claims of relief that the plaintiff has asked for?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why -- why is there some sort of added burden with respect to automatic that doesn't exist with respect to permissive?   Sonia Sotomayor  Why did they bother?   Sarah E. Harrington  Why did they --   Sonia Sotomayor  I -- if -- if the only issue is standing, totally different language was used by the rule drafters.  And I don't think they track very well, because to require standing, you need immediacy of effect.  And in a lot of these intervenor cases, it's very clear that part of the interest in the property is a contingent one.  If the person loses the property, my interest will be destroyed.  That's very contingent and not likely to permit standing in a lot of situations.   Sarah E. Harrington  So there are sort of two parts to your question.  The first, on the text, that it's true that the text doesn't track the modern parlance of standing, but this rule was drafted -- was -- was adopted in 1966, which is before this Court's cases in like Sierra Club and Defenders of Wildlife --   Sonia Sotomayor  But there's --   Sarah E. Harrington  -- and has that incentive.   Sonia Sotomayor  -- that step that you keep referring to which doesn't make any sense under Article III, which is the one about whether the existing party is adequately protecting your interests.   Sarah E. Harrington  That's right.  The rule --   Sonia Sotomayor  I -- let's assume they've hired the best lawyer in the world, and they've made every conceivable argument, but you're still a contract vendor or -- with the kind of potential injury that the others assume would give you standing.  Why is it that we then read Article III into Rule 24?   Sarah E. Harrington  Well, tell me if I'm not getting your question right. In our view, Rule 24(a)(2) requires a showing of Article III standing.  And in addition, you have to show timeliness and inadequate representation. And so in those two ways, it's a higher hurdle than Article III is. But that's -- that's appropriate because it is a person trying to come in and sort of intrude on an existing lawsuit.  And there you need to show that -- you really need to be able to come in, because, otherwise, your interests are going to be impaired by the lawsuit. So we think the ultimate question under Article III is really the same as the ultimate question under Rule 24(a)(2)  And under Article III, if you're asking whether a person can initiate a lawsuit or can appeal, what you're asking is, do they have a substantial enough interest in the outcome of this actual dispute? And it's really the same inquiry under Rule 24(a)(2)  Do they have an interest that's -- that's -- this Court has said it has to be an interest that's legally cognizable, that's a significantly protectable interest.  That's the same language that the Court has used under Article III.   ",16-605X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  We've said it with respect to union members who we've permitted to intervene, even though the union has all of the claimed contract rights.   Sonia Sotomayor  Yes.   Sonia Sotomayor  Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that -- because I think, as I read the district court's opinion here, they assumed you were asking for judgment in your name, because they were treating you as a contract vendor or vendee, and they were saying, you don't have the right to have a judgment in your name. Would that holding have been wrong, absent your current concession that -- that you are not seeking money in your own name, but just a payment of money?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I have asked a different hypothetical.  I don't know that the court below understood your claim that way.  So when it ruled, it ruled understanding that you were following your complaint and seeking a -- money in your name.  You disavow that in the Second Circuit.  They accepted that disavowal, and they've ruled a slightly different way. I'm saying, if you hadn't, would this be the same case?

1,"Sonia Sotomayor  But I have --   Sonia Sotomayor  May I ask you, when do you believe that counsel below objected? And your brief seems to assume he did, but as I read the transcript, I can't find where he objected clearly. Assuming he didn't object clearly, can you say under any circumstance that appellate counsel was ineffective for choosing the route he did?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Given plain error review, if there was no objection, wasn't the sufficiency of the evidence the best way to approach a forfeited error?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  He objected to the sequence of what the judge was saying.  He didn't argue any transferred intent in the way that the Court later found in Roberts.  I think it's Roberts, if I'm --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- if my memory is correct.   Sonia Sotomayor  He didn't -- I don't see any discussion of the Roberts transferred intent.  All he argued was, give the original instruction over again, and then give this new one.   Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, you're not dealing with the question asked.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right? The question asked has to do with the burden on the courts.  Both Justice Kennedy and Justice Roberts are saying, if we recognize this right, the courts are going to be inundated with these kinds of claims because in every State, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel isn't -- can't be, by definition, raised in direct review.  It all has to be channelled to collateral review.  So in every State, every defendant will be able to raise this claim and it will inundate the -- the system.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And you haven't articulated the reasons you don't think so.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I could start with how many post-conviction ineffective assistance of appellate counsel cases, the 31 percent that Justice Kennedy was pointing to, in how many of those is relief granted?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Infinitesimally small.   ",16-6219
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  Ah, but does that -- does that mean that we don't remedy that? Assuming -- because, I agree -- Justice Breyer pointed out, and others have, the number of cases are going to be tiny. And as with all cases, there's an initial uptick of claims until people settle down and realize that it's a small number that are viable, and that happens pretty quickly.  Do we ignore that simply because there might be that small uptick at the beginning?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You mean the substantial claim of IAC? This is -- no one is going to be looking at an ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim, assuming one is viable, unless there's a substantial claim, and no one will otherwise look at it.   Sonia Sotomayor  So let's go through the three pillars here.  No one is reviewing whether appellate counsel has been adequate.  Do you -- although you're not entitled constitutionally to appellate counsel on direct appeal, I don't know that we haven't, repeatedly, and so has every other court recognized the importance of counsel at the appellate level.  I think virtually every State, if not every State, gives you a lawyer.  So that prong is, in my mind, equal. The second prong is the --   Sonia Sotomayor  Yes.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  I -- I -- they're only -- they're not asking the question on the trial court whether appellate counsel has erred.  They are asking a different question.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Not just error, but error likely to result in a different outcome.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But we already know that even under plain-error review, because we've done it in -- in a number of different cases, that trial courts err.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  The question is, did appellate counsel err in failing to raise something that might ultimately go to the Supreme Court, as has happened.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  They have ruled on -- they've ruled on a question of error below, but not a question of appellate counsel error.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How many were granted?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  That's not the test -- that's not the test.  The test is, would it have resulted in a -- a difference on appellate review, not at trial.

That's a fairly radical change from the norm. And so why would it be inappropriate to assume that Congress intended for a district court to exercise its discretion and judgment in deciding how much was a reasonable time for excusable neglect or for good cause?

Or do you concede that generally or all the time -- let's not say this is a death case, let's just say this was a robbery case, all right? A robbery case. The defendant says: I wasn't the robber.  Can the lawyer come in and do what Mr. English did: Yes, he was the robber, but, no, he didn't intend to force -- to use force.   Sonia Sotomayor  So you don't think it's a Sixth Amendment violation?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So -- so you're not taking the position when you're saying generally that -- that a client has any right to say I didn't do this in court? I didn't do -- I didn't shoot, I didn't rob, I didn't make that call that that witness says I made, that the witness -- that a -- that a client, once he takes a lawyer, takes -- doesn't have a right to say I didn't do it --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- at all?   Sonia Sotomayor  One of my former colleagues said this isn't -- one must analogize these things to agency, that the defendant -- the lawyer is the agent of the defendant.  And once they disagree, the agency ends.   Sonia Sotomayor  So, if the agency has ended because the client has said: Don't do this, how can it not be a violation of the Sixth Amendment to do it?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, I thought it's been not disputed that he thought, quite wrongly, that there was no mens rea for second-degree murder but that it's been conceded that what -- there -- that there was a mens rea both for first and second degree and he was only arguing for second degree?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, but there is a mens rea for second degree murder.   Sonia Sotomayor  And so --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- you concede that there wasn't second degree?   Sonia Sotomayor  So the further --   Sonia Sotomayor  So the further footnote is it's -- only happens if your client's not rational, that that's where you have the freedom to ignore your client?   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  I thought -- I'll go back to it, but I thought the essence of his closing statement was he's not deserving of the death penalty because, as you heard him, he's a sick man.   INTERRUPTING ",16-8255
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mrs. Davidson -- Ms. Davidson, I think of the three prongs, the third and the fourth prong, the third prong as being fairness of process: Were you given the process that you were entitled to constitutionally or statutorily? And so, on the third prong, we've had many cases where elements were not given to a jury.  This is neither case.  We've had Cotton, where a drug amount wasn't given to a jury.  We look at that third prong as a substantial deprivation of some form of constitutional or state right. I think of the fourth prong as fairness of the ultimate outcome, which is very different because often, like in Cotton, where an element like drug amount wasn't given to a jury, we look at the quantum of evidence and say: Would the outcome have been different? And that's most of our cases.  Was the area -- error so substantial that the outcome was actually unfair? And so, for me, that fourth prong does serve even in sentencing guidelines a different function.  It talks -- our third-prong finding is that the fairness of a judge's process of considering your sentence from a correct guideline was frustrated.  The third -- fourth prong goes to, is there a substantial possibility that the outcome was affected, that you would have received a lesser sentence? Is there an error in the way I'm looking at this?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I think your -- your point in your brief was he got, at the low end of the guidelines, 78 months, despite all of the negative factors that the government points to in its brief, his serious criminal history, et cetera, et cetera. The judge still sentenced him at the low end of the guideline.  And so that demonstrates that it is possible, not just substantially possible, but that the judge will in fairness and upholding the integrity of the judiciary give him a lesser sentence, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  It's a possibility -- a strong possibility?   ",16-9493
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- when -- when you're talking about reasonableness, it seems like you're doing substantive reasonableness, which is what the Fifth Circuit was doing with its standard.  It borrowed a substantive due process right or standard, shock the conscience, and applied it to this sentence. And it sounds like, with all your three reasons and your argument, which is the only thing that matters is that it doesn't -- that this is a reasonable sentence no matter if it's not the sentence the district court would have given.  That's basically your argument, isn't it?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  But why? When the three prongs of the fourth -- the three arms of the fourth prong say fairness, integrity, or -- I've forgotten the fourth, but it's in --   Sonia Sotomayor  Public reputation. ""Or"" is disjunctive, not conjunctive.   Sonia Sotomayor  So why isn't it unfair?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that's a procedural right.  That's not a substantive right.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's not what this fourth prong says.  What this fourth prong appears to say is the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of our judicial system. What's fair about an error that the judge, in part, was a part of that could be easily corrected and that might very well result in a lower sentence to a defendant? What's fair about not correcting that error?   ",16-9493
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  So what do we make of the words ""except as otherwise authorized by law""? It seemed to me that what was the purpose of the automatic termination were people who were running for public office without authority by law.  They were -- meaning there was no federal law saying they could do this. So what do you do with this -- with that ""except""?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  How have they done that?   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Vladeck, you didn't raise the amici's point, but what position do you take with respect to that point?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I know you don't -- I know you don't want to be non-suited --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- but -- but I trust -- I trust your independent judgment that you'll give us your views on that presented question.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Yes.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  Except that unlike those other agencies, territories, this D.C. court, and military organizations are explicitly -- Congress explicitly authorized to -- to file rules and regulations.  The three provisions are almost identical. And why aren't military courts virtually geographic? Most military operations happen in bases domestically or in foreign fields.  So in what ways are they different geographically?   Aditya Bamzai  Your answer -- Your Honor, a couple of answers to that.  The first is that they're not geographic in the sense in which the territorial or D.C. courts are, where we have courts of general jurisdiction that step in for state courts where no state apparatus is available. And so that is the rationale that this Court has given in a number of its territorial court cases.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, we've also said, with respect to military justice, that it -- it is -- that it is the jurisdiction -- jurisdiction of the commander in charge of either that base or that division.  So, in those ways, civil law doesn't apply either.   Aditya Bamzai  Your Honor, it's true that civil law doesn't apply.  It's military law that is applicable in these courts-martial. But I don't think we're talking about territorial jurisdiction in the same way that we are with respect to territorial governance. And if we were, then, as I pointed out in my motion for oral argument time, the government's position is that the appointments clause does not apply to the territories where currently sitting in jurisdiction in which the mayor is elected.  And none of those departures from the ordinary separation of powers could possibly be applicable within the military system. So there must be some narrower principle to explain, and this Court will have to draw a distinction between the territorial schemes of governance and the military and other schemes of governance in federal agencies.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  It was only instituted with respect to certain claims.  So I have two questions.   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm not at all clear what it is you're challenging here.  Are you challenging the Board's right to initiate partial adjudications or are you challenging the fact that they are not addressing all of the claims in their final decision? What is it that you're actually asking us to review?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So what is it exactly that you want the Board to do with respect to the claims that it didn't grant adjudication of?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you want them to say we didn't grant review on these claims because? Or do you want them to say the patent is valid with respect to these claims that we didn't grant review?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Because the only -- the only power they're given is to decide the patentability of claims.  So what exactly is it that you're asking them to do?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Ahh, you want to get around Cuozzo.   Sonia Sotomayor  That -- that's exactly what you want to do.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You want to --   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I don't see what else you're trying to do, because what will you do? You will come up on appeal and say the Board was wrong in not instituting review of those other claims? That's what Cuozzo was about, us saying you can't do that. I didn't agree with Cuozzo, so --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- you know, I mean --   Sonia Sotomayor  But -- but -- but it is what we said.  And -- and so, assuming I stick with precedent on this issue, what other purpose would there be for the Board basically to say we made a decision not to institute review?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right.  You do want to get around Cuozzo.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Because there is absolutely no way that that's anything other than that.  What's the -- if you're not challenging their decision not to institute review, why would that make any difference?   Sonia Sotomayor  So would the review on appeal be on the basis of a motion -- like a motion to dismiss? On the face of whatever you presented the Board with, at the beginning, did the Board have a reasonable basis to conclude that no reasonable basis existed to challenge the validity of that claim?   Sonia Sotomayor  So how could we -- how could the appellate court make that determination if there's no record with respect to that issue?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  If --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, no, I --   Sonia Sotomayor  If the Board didn't institute review of those claims, there would be an incomplete record with respect to those other claims.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's fine. But if the Board didn't institute review of those other claims, the other side has not had an opportunity to present its evidence in contravention of your expert. You're asking the appellate court to decide patentability on the basis of an incomplete, undeveloped record.   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So why don't you get to the first issue at all?   Sonia Sotomayor  What you really want to say is the Board shouldn't institute partial reviews; it should, if it finds -- I think what you're saying is, once it determines you have enough evidence to challenge one claim, it should hold a hearing on everything. Because without that, you can't really decide patentability in a due process way, in a fair way. So why have you limited your challenge in the way you have? What's the purpose of doing that? And what advantage does that give you? It seems to me that it's an unfair advantage to the other side.  It's an unfair advantage to the system.  So why don't you just argue what you really want to argue, which is, I should have an opportunity to litigate all of my claims?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.  How did you do that for years? It's a year and a half, isn't it, at most?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's usually a year.  How long did it take here?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  A year and a half or a year?   Sonia Sotomayor  All right.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Why bother -- why bother requiring you to set forth all your grounds for every claim you choose to challenge? Because nothing in this forces you to challenge the claims in inter partes review.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So you could choose -- you could have chosen to challenge four and still gone back to district court and challenged all 16 in district court.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So this was never -- so this was never intended to capture all litigation over validity?   Sonia Sotomayor  So -- so why bother requiring you to set forth all your grounds, particularly if you only really have to do it with respect to one? You could take your strongest case, set forth all the grounds there, and on the others, say, we also want to challenge all the other 15 because, under your theory, you don't have to do anything more than that. You just have to identify one claim that's weak.  The Board says, we'll institute review, and then you're entitled to challenge all the other claims that you didn't set forth with particularity.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Because the Board has to give you a hearing on those claims anyway.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But you don't -- you want that, but it doesn't mean the other side wants that.  It doesn't mean that the Board needs that.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You think it's an inherent right.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Could you show me where -- anywhere in this statute the Board is prohibited directly from initiation -- initiating partial review?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Of some claims -- of some claims or not? And how?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Assume there's not -- I find that 314 --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- permits -- it has no direct prohibition of partial institution, that the Board is entitled to do that, then why would we have to read the language ""patent claims challenged by the petitioner"" any different than the Board is reading it? The Board is reading it to -- to mean any patent claim challenged by the Petitioner at the review stage.   Sonia Sotomayor  Let me ask you --   Sonia Sotomayor  You talked about canceled claims.  How about settled claims? Say, in the middle of the proceedings, you settle a claim. Under your theory, the Board would still have to address that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's in the petition.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  What gives you a right to drop it then?   ",16-969X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Well, there is one very telling sign that the ""any patent claim challenged by the petitioner"" has a different meaning, and that's in 314 itself, which says ""claims challenged in the petition.""

Sonia Sotomayor  I thought --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- that that was the very reason given by the Board in encouraging these kinds of opinions to be written.

0,"Sonia Sotomayor  So why bother --   Sonia Sotomayor  This is a very complicated system for a very simple position. If you have any reason to believe someone has changed address, just send them a notice and, after two election cycles, disqualify them. Why have the Post Office provision at all? Why have any other provision? As it is, I understand Ohio now is not waiting for people to miss two election cycles; they're waiting -- every year they're purging, right?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Every year.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Now, you have taken the position in your brief that you really don't need anything; you need -- you could send out a notice any time, any place, and if someone fails to respond to it, you can purge them.  Isn't that your position?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But my point is you don't even need the failure to vote two years to use the notice --   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, let -- let's --   Sonia Sotomayor  The Senate report that supported the NVRA explicitly says that what they wanted to avoid was a mailing that is unresponded to being a cause for removing someone. So if that was its purpose, why wouldn't it make sense that the only reason that you can change -- send the notice is if you have some reasonable basis to believe someone has moved?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Failure to vote can't it be it because the Senate report says that they believe the failure to vote was a constitutional right.  You have a right not to vote.   Sonia Sotomayor  So why have the three provisions having to do with the Post Office notice?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That seems like a very reasonable -- why -- why do you need it at all under your interpretation?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Counsel, can you --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Can we get to the essence of this case? It appears as if what you're -- you're reading is that the failure to vote is enough evidence to suggest that someone has moved. That seems to be your position because it can be the only one. But is that a reasonable effort to draw that conclusion when you do results in disenfranchising, disproportionately, certain cities where large groups of minorities live, where large groups of homeless people live, and across the country they're the group that votes the least, in -- in large measure because many of them work very long hours.  And without the golden week that Ohio rescinded, many of them can't vote because the polls are not open while they're not working. Places like Cleveland have very, very, very long lines of -- of voter -- of voters trying to vote.  All of these impediments result in large numbers of people not voting in certain spots in the state. So if the word ""reasonable effort"" has any meaning with a Congress who said that the failure to vote is a constitutional right, how can we read this statute to permit you to begin a process of disenfranchising solely on the basis of that with no independent evidence whatsoever that the person has moved? You can use the Post Office.  They tell you that.  You can use Certified Mail. You could use juror change of addresses.  You can use driver license, motor vehicle change of addresses.  There are dozens of other ways that you could verify a change of address, yet you're suggesting that using a failure to appear at an election or elections as evidence of moving when people have a right not to vote if they choose.  Many have. And others like the veteran who's a plaintiff in this case explains the reasons why he failed to vote in two elections.  I have to give the meaning, the words that Congress said, don't use the failure to vote as a result -- that results in someone being disenfranchised. I don't understand how you can say that the failure to vote can be used as the sole basis for sending out notices.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It's not a reasonable inference, so how could it be a reasonable effort?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So if that's minimum, don't you think that maximum should say something a little bit more than the failure to vote?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I mean, you know, a change in the residence in accordance with (b), (c), and (d), and (b) has you using the Post Office, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  (c) has you using the Post Office. (b) says shall not be removed -- shall not result in the removal of the name of a person from any official list registered to vote in election for federal office by reason of the person's failure to vote.  So --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well --   Sonia Sotomayor  Exactly.  We're saying it's not a sole --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So please explain to me why a change of address is reasonable. What -- what are the statistics that show that the vast majority of people that you disenfranchise from voting, that you strike from the election rolls have actually moved?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, when it gave you an example, it gave you an example of an independent trigger.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So there's a minimum requirement on the voter who gets your notice to respond.   Sonia Sotomayor  But that's after you have evidence that they've actually moved?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's the problem, is --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- that there's a strong argument this is -- that at least in impact, this is discriminatory.  I understand that some don't believe in impact, but you have to look at it to determine --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- whether something is reasonable.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  General, could you tell me, there's a 24-year history of solicitor generals of both political parties under both -- presidents of both political parties who have taken a position contrary to yours. Before the amendment and after the amendment. In fact, the Federal Election Commission, when it wrote to Congress with respect to the Help America Vote Act, took the position the old solicitor generals were taking.  Everybody but you today come in and say the Act before the clarification said something different. Seems quite unusual that your office would change its position so dramatically.  I might accept it if you thought that the Help America Vote Act, in fact, clarified something that was ambiguous, but you're taking a very different position.  You're saying even before that Act, it was clear you could do it this way.   Noel J. Francisco  Your Honor, what I'm saying is I think that the Help America Vote Act and the clarification amendment made it even clearer and after that clarification amendment --   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, so please explain the change of position.   Noel J. Francisco  Sure.   Sonia Sotomayor  After that many presidents, that many solicitor generals, this many years -- the vast majority of states, over 35 -- over 40, actually, who read it the way your opponents read it, most people read it that way -- how did the solicitor general change its mind? Do you believe this doesn't have an impact, a negative impact on certain groups in this society?   Noel J. Francisco  Well, Your Honor, I believe that after Congress passed the clarification amendment, it clarified what was at the time an ongoing debate between the Department of Justice and the states. And the only plausible way to read that public context -- and with respect to some members of this Court, public context is not legislative history, it's --   Sonia Sotomayor  So point me where in the legislative history people say that with absolute clarity.   Noel J. Francisco  Well -- yeah.   Sonia Sotomayor  As I understand the legislative history, both sides are saying, in its history, this helps us.   Noel J. Francisco  And, Your Honor --   Sonia Sotomayor  So it's as ambiguous as the language may be.   Noel J. Francisco  Public context is not legislative history.  Even the most diehard textualists look to the public context in which a law was enacted.  I refer you to Justice Scalia's opinion in Branch versus Smith and Professor Manning's article in What Divides Textualists From Purposivists? And that public context makes clear that the only thing that was in need of clarification at the time the clarification amendment was passed was precisely this question, whether states like Ohio's could use a non-voting trigger in conjunction with the 8(d) process. And there's nothing in this statute that bars that.  I think it reflects the balance that Congress was trying to strike in the NVRA between, on the one hand, dramatically increasing the number of voters on the voter rolls but, on the other, giving states the flexibility they need to manage the issues that arise when you have overinflated voter rolls.

Nobody's pointing out that there's anything wrong with it, and they're the ones who submit or adopt it as final. It doesn't become final except by the actions of the SEC officers.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Now, most of the time, I don't know of many judges -- well, judges sign order to show causes.  But it's usually prepared by a function -- functionary in the court.  Why is merely issuing the order to show cause a sovereign enough power to designate someone a -- a officer rather than an employee, when it's being done on behalf of, not in the name of, on behalf of the SEC?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, could you define adversarial for me?   Sonia Sotomayor  And let's go through the various agencies.  Virtually all of them -- the SEC have -- it's adversarial because it's the government versus the individual, correct?   Sonia Sotomayor  So why isn't Social Security and the Veterans Administration, the Veterans' Board, and some of the others are all investigations by the government or benefits that the government's going to give -- but they are investigating. Social Security can issue subpoenas for -- for documents.  It can call witnesses.  It could do just about everything that happens in a -- in -- in a hearing.  So what's the difference again?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, I --   Sonia Sotomayor  So what's the line that makes somebody an agent or not? Can we speak about ALJs in this context being agents of the SEC commissioners when the SEC commissioners didn't pick them, don't supervise them, essentially don't have anything to do with their work other than reviewing it? So what defines someone acting as an agent of an office?   Anton Metlitsky  So I don't think common law agency is exactly the right frame. I think I agree, again, with Mr. Wall, the -- the initial question is where the authority, the legal authority, to act is -- is vested. I think that's -- the first example of that is the deputy marshals that were mentioned before, right? So -- so the Congress establishes in Section 27 of the first Judiciary Act the office of a marshal, who's an inferior officer, and allows the marshal to appoint deputies, who are non-officers because they're not appointed by somebody who's allowed to make an appointment under the Appointments Clause. They have all the same duties as the marshal, but they're understood to be acting in the name of the marshal's office.  That's so even though district courts, under Section 27, had authority to remove the -- the deputies, right? So -- so I don't -- again, I don't think the -- the elements of common law agency need to be satisfied.  I do think that when Congress demonstrates that it's vesting authority in a particular office, as it did here, making clear that any decision is going to be deemed the decision of the Commission, I think the agency has to have at least some ability to affect the decision.  But here, of course, the agency has plenary ability to affect the decision as to facts, as to law, as -- as to everything.  So the fact that they can't --   Sonia Sotomayor  Just so I understand, what would this do with already completed cases --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- where the period of appeal has ended both before the SEC and before the courts?

How will I then apply that test to executive officers who are not serving executive ALJ functions but other functions? That -- that word -- it seems to me that the test that you're -- the amici has proposed makes sense.  Do they bind the government in any situation?

Now, if we accept that premise that the First Amendment is valuable enough to us to protect it from government abuse and -- and the facts in this case, that's what they assumed or that's what we're assuming from the facts as alleged, shouldn't we have a remedy and shouldn't we have a remedy that takes care of those arrests that are motivated solely because of animus, because Mt.

Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Dreeben --   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Dreeben, I don't know that you fairly answered Justice Ginsburg's question. This is a 1986 statute.  The reality in 1986, if you look at the statute and its reference to stored records, to stored communications, was -- it's a past technology, old concept.  But I think it's fair to say that back then they were thinking that where these materials were stored had a geographic existence in the United States, not abroad or nowhere else, and that they were protecting the communications that were stored in particular locations. Things have changed.  But what you're asking us to do is to imagine what Congress would have done or intended in a totally different situation today.  And the problem that Justice Ginsburg alludes to is the fact that, by doing so, we are trenching on the very thing that our extraterritoriality doesn't want to do, what our jurisprudence doesn't want to do, which is to create international problems. Now I understand there's a bill that's being proposed by bipartisan senators that would give you most of what you want but with great protections against foreign conflicts. There are limitations involving records that are stored abroad. Why shouldn't we leave the status quo as it is and let Congress pass a bill in this new age --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- that addresses the potential problems that your reading would create?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You mean all those amici who have written complaining about how this would conflict with so much foreign law.

Can you tell me where it is in the legislative process? It's bipartisan.  It's supported by the Department of State and the Department of Justice. It does deal with certain rights and limitations to the access to this information when it's stored in foreign locations.  Why shouldn't we wait for that bill?

INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  How -- what do I do with the fact that where I'm having difficulty making the leap in your argument is Congress did use ""money remuneration"" in one statute and ""wages"" defined very broadly in another.  That was in 1938. Generally, when you have two different descriptions of words, you have to give them two different meanings of some sort.   Sonia Sotomayor  So what do I do with that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  You're now equating money remuneration with wages as it appears in FICA, but there -- why weren't identical words used?   Sonia Sotomayor  I don't know. That doesn't help me because, if you're equating, as the current regulations do, the railroad money remuneration with FICA's wages, what do we do -- FICA requires you to value a hard-to-value stock option, and you're telling me it's not required under money remuneration.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So I'm not quite sure how you can equate it when you yourself have recognized the major difference.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's easy because it's publicly traded, it's the known value.  But the way the regulation is reading, it seems to be equating money remuneration completely with wages.  But you're suggesting -- you're not.   ",17-530X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, I just don't understand what ""minimal"" means.  If you're answering Justice Alito the way you did, which is I can't imagine needing anything more than a judge saying I'm going to grant a reduction, but given the seriousness of this crime and how -- what you did, I think whatever number he picks, why that would become unreasonable or subject to more explanation.   Sonia Sotomayor  But you said to Justice Alito no.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm asking -- that -- that's shocking to me, to be frank with you, because that answer would mean that the judge not only has to say that the crime was serious, what you did was serious, but I think 108 is not enough because it's the bottom of the guideline range; I don't think the guideline range should control. I mean, what more of an explanation does a judge have to do than to say it was a serious crime, 114 is the right amount?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm afraid that -- you keep answering -- you're creating a rule that makes it impossible for district court judges to do anything but what you want.   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, but that's where it's coming.  Let's -- let's start at here.  We know the district court at the original sentence said, I'm troubled by this crime and the degree of your participation in it.  It's a serious crime.  You were a very active participant in it. He still gave him essentially the low end of the guideline.  But why is it unreasonable for us to infer that in the resentencing he picked 114 because he remained concerned about the seriousness of this crime and your defendant's participation in it?   Sonia Sotomayor  Since the guidelines are advisory, what would make it improper for the judge to say, I don't care what the guidelines say, I think trafficking of this type is serious, and I think that 114 months is the right amount for -- for the seriousness of the crime and the deterrence. How could you appeal that?   Sonia Sotomayor  I guess my -- I -- I have a great deal of understanding that having the judge say something makes sentencing appear to the public as being less than arbitrary.  And there is a value in explanation that -- that -- that the justice system should consider. The question is how much and why checking off a box is not enough, because I take the judge at his or her word that when they check off the box, they've done what 3553(a), I think it is, requires.  But is there a difference between checking off a box and not checking off a box?   INTERRUPTING ",17-5639
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  General, can --   Sonia Sotomayor  General, do you have a different position with respect to a denial of a motion for a reduction? If a judge just says sign this form and -- but denied the reduction, would you hold the same position?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, no, no.  Take my fact situation.   Sonia Sotomayor  The judge denied -- basically denies -- after looking at everything, I deny this motion for reduction.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Does that permit intelligent appellate review?   Sonia Sotomayor  So how about if a judge in the original sentence gives the low end of the guideline but in the -- in the revised reduction gives above the original guideline but below the sentence he gave now? Would that require more of an explanation than signing this form?   Sonia Sotomayor  The one thing I hate about absolute rules in this area, dislike intensely, is that why shouldn't we trust the court of appeals to determine how much information it needs or doesn't need to give meaningful appellate review? Some courts have said if you refuse to depart completely, you should explain why. Others have said but if you don't and you pick a sentence within the guidelines, we will infer that you've said enough if you signed the form. Others have said you should always give a little bit more. Another character -- category of court of appeals have done what the Tenth Circuit has done, but I think there's only two that have done what the Tenth Circuit has said. Why isn't it always up to the court of appeals to determine how much it needs to determine whether adequate review can be given?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So assume there wasn't a form and that the judge's real reason was that he thinks blacks who commit this kind of crime should be punished severely. How are we supposed to know or check, or the public know or check, that racism didn't play a part in this? I'm not assuming that any judge would do this, but I'm assuming --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- some impermissible motive is -- is at play.  If we don't have any statement by the judge of what he or she is doing or some basic reference to why, how do we know?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But if you know no reason, which is what Justice Kennedy started with, we don't really know why he picked 114.   Sonia Sotomayor  So -- so let's do a different hypothetical.  The judge says: I gave the 114 because he got convicted of a prison in -- infraction that was at the highest level.  And, in fact -- not the facts of this case -- the prison infraction was at the lowest level and didn't even result in anything except a warning. How would the appellate court know that the judge made a factual assumption that was erroneous in picking that 114?   Sonia Sotomayor  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But what -- how do we know if they don't articulate --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- their reason for doing something, that they're not -- that it's not based on an erroneous factual basis?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  No, but we should. I mean, when we're making a rule that says you never have to, as the Tenth Circuit has indicated, then we don't know if an impermissible factual or legal basis motivated the judge. And with factual, it's not intentional; it's just wrong.   ",17-5639
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  The problem really is that the guidelines are a little confusing. They talk about an initial guidelines range, and then they tell the court that the real guideline range is a statutory minimum.  So that it's talking about the guidelines doesn't resolve that question because which guideline are they talking about? In my mind, they're told they have to start from the statutory minimum in their departure.  So how do we get away from that fact?   Sonia Sotomayor  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So that means the departure is not -- you're suggesting that the departure -- this is the -- the effect of your rule --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- the departure starts with the lower guideline range, and then the only way they can go is down from that?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Fisher, let's start with that proposition. In my experience, district court judges use a lot of different approaches to sentencing, and I think that many of the surveys and amici brief that you have show that. There are judges who have fixed rules. Perhaps they should or shouldn't.  Let's not get into that, okay? But there's a wide berth of them who simply say my rule of thumb is you cooperate 50 percent.  And some of them never deviate, 50 percent. How can we say that for those judges, that their sentence was based on the guidelines, so that you're entitled to eligibility? They based it on the statute -- they clearly tell you I'm basing it on the statutory minimum.   Sonia Sotomayor  But it was the --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- guideline at the time.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And -- and they have discretion to say I want to use the statutory minimum.  I don't want to use the lower guideline.  I'm going to ask the other side about the many judges who do use the guidelines in substantial assistance.  They say it.   Sonia Sotomayor  Prosecutors by their own admission have gone in to judges and said, base it on the guidelines. So there are plenty of judges who -- who do depart based on the guidelines because they believe that they're more reflective of the seriousness of the crime and give them a better sense of how much of a departure they should or should not give.  So, in those ways, it informs their decision. But we're not in that case.  We're in the first type of case.   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Fisher, make the following assumptions.  Rejecting your argument that the substantial assistance has to start from the amended guideline down, let's assume we accept the government, and the 11 circuits who have ruled this way, that it has to start from the statutory minimum.  But assume further that some of those circuits have said that the court can't even consider the guideline range in determining how much of a discount to give, and that was wrong.  That, as with all factors, a district court can consider what it wants in determining, for all the reasons I said earlier, how much of a discount to give can be informed by the guideline range in some way. Where would that put your clients? Because it's -- I'm not clear that -- and to be frank with you, it wasn't something I was paying attention to when I read the sentencing transcripts.  A, I'm not clear that the defense attorneys in these cases below actually argued anything different than you did today, which would be rejected.  That didn't raise an argument that the guide -- that they properly raised an argument that the guidelines should inform the departure from -- from the maximum.   INTERRUPTING ",17-5716
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it is a sentencing range.  That's the force of their argument, which is the sentencing range was raised to the statutory minimum. So the original judge felt bound by that sentencing range because of the statutory minimum, but that became the new guideline.   Sonia Sotomayor  It misses the next step, which the guidelines say, if you substantially cooperate, the minimum is eliminated.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Feigin, you're just answering the very question, which is, you're right, there's a lot of judges, and I don't know that that's an abuse of discretion. You're already saying it's not a gross abuse of discretion or otherwise you would be appealing. So you're not doing that. It seems to me that the guidelines don't help a judge in their words to determine how much of a departure is just right, and judges have to figure that out by having some basis of comparison with something. What if the -- because they give you five factors to consider.  You've got someone who does a lot on Number 1, does a little on Number 2, does a whole lot more on Number 3, and then nothing on 4.  The judge mixes that all up and says: How much do I depart? And the next defendant will have a different mix, and the same question comes up. And what I see judges doing is saying the severity of this crime is measured most accurately by the guidelines.  It's based on a sampling across the country of how serious this crime is.  Now I'm going to take that and compare it to all of those other factors, and I'm going to decide a percentage, both based on the statutory minimum but also on the guideline, of how much seems right to me. So I -- it's not an abuse of discretion in my view.  And if it's not, what do we do to ensure the equity that Mr. Fisher is calling for?   Sonia Sotomayor  Yeah, because --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- there's different ways to get to the same reduction.   ",17-5716
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  General Keller, I know you want to get to the merits, but I don't want to leave the jurisdiction question.  And this last point raises it for me in stark relief, which is your -- you just said you can't draw this map.  The court below said you can. By not waiting for the remedy in this case, we are not in a position to be fully informed on that question.  And so I still don't understand how you distinguish Gunn, that said that in these cases, unless a district court has made clear that it is issuing an injunction or prohibiting you from using your map or some portion of your map, that you can't appeal. So could you address the -- our jurisdiction first?   Sonia Sotomayor  Well, it did at least in one of the challenges, when there were --   Sonia Sotomayor  I think that's subject to dispute by your adversary, so let -- let's -- but the point still remains, which is every time you're ordered to change one district, it affects other districts. And in the end, the court, in drawing maps, may find that something it concluded initially is proven wrong by the map drawing. So that goes to why finality requires us to often wait for a remedy --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- before we permit appeal.  So tell me why that's not true -- why that's not the case under Gunn.   Sonia Sotomayor  No.  It asked the legislator to tell it whether it intended to do redrawing.  It didn't order it to do it.  It just said, do you intend to? And it hadn't even started the process.  But that goes only to one prong of effectively final. The other prong is, could you have gotten relief at the end of this process? You were granted a stay within less than two weeks of your filing -- filing a motion.  So, even if you had gone through the remedial stage, you still would have had time to use your maps for the next election.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, that's quite -- that's quite odd.  You always had the choice of not participating and simply letting the court draw the map.   Sonia Sotomayor  You still -- well, it hasn't happened, but you could have had a -- an appeal from that.  My point --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  My point goes back to --   Sonia Sotomayor  What you're now saying to us is we have an appeal after the preliminary injunction.  Every time a law is declared unconstitutional -- a map is declared unconstitutional, we have an appeal. And then we have a third appeal at the end of a remedy.  So automatically, because I don't see how to distinguish this from Gunn still, and I still don't know how to distinguish it from the millions of others -- not millions, I'm exaggerating greatly -- from the hundreds of these that we have received where a court has said something's unconstitutional and we have said that doesn't end the case. What ends the case is the final injunction that imposed -- that stops you from doing something and requires you to do something else.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  That's in 1291. I'm talking about 1253.  What you're saying is automatically -- you're not giving me any way to distinguish any three-court decision on liability that doesn't result in an immediate appeal. You're basically saying every single one of them, where a court says even one district was drawn wrong, that that's immediately appealable.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But that goes back to Justice Breyer's question.  I don't think that ever ordering someone to come to court and give an explanation has been considered a final order. What is considered a final order is a contempt finding, something else that happens as a result of your failure to act, not the request for you to come to court.   Sonia Sotomayor  But we don't know that --   Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. General --   Sonia Sotomayor  General, one of the things in this recitation that you forget is that it wasn't just that court opining on these maps.  It was also in August of 2012 the D.C. district court who -- who found these maps and the districts that were left untouched suspicious and who found intentional discrimination with respect to some, that found questionable some of the claims and reasons that were given by the legislature for these districts. There were serious questions raised by the D.C. circuit court.  So the -- this Court basically said when it ruled: This is tentative.  It's been done hurriedly.  You can't rely on these findings until we have a -- a full hearing. But the D.C. district court made findings contrary to your position.  So should -- wouldn't -- aren't we obligated to look at the full picture, not just the picture you want us -- the piece of the picture you want us to look at?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So, I guess --   Sonia Sotomayor  So why don't we remand --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- then all of this just proves to me that, at best, all you get is a vacate this order and send it back under the right legal test.   Sonia Sotomayor  It's a very simple argument.  You know that what you wanted to do, which was to block Hispanic voters or other voters, and -- and get certain candidates elected, that your own counsel is telling you that in those -- in certain of those districts, that's exactly what you got, and you say we want to get the district court not to change these maps, that that's enough for the three-judge panel to conclude that you wanted to put in place the discriminatory intent and effect. That's the simple argument.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, I have --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- I have two questions.  On racial gerrymandering, I don't think we've ever required a proof of effect. We've only required that you've intentionally gerrymandered --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- on the basis of race, is that correct?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  All right, but then -- but that just answer my question.  On racial gerrymandering, you don't have to prove it?   ",17-586X
1,"Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Kneedler, what do -- what rule do we set to know how much time is enough time? Meaning, in all of these election cases, it seems to me that every single one of them, even if it's decided today, I'm going to hear that in eight months they have to do something.  In three months after that, they have to do something else.  In this amount of time after that, they have to do something else.  Until it's clear that a district court tells a state: You can't use your map at all, even within 24 hours, this Court could intervene if need be. So I'm not sure in what other setting time constraints are a reason for immediate appeal --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- if -- if it's not permitted generally under the law.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. Kneedler --   Sonia Sotomayor  So how --   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, I thought the --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- I thought the legislature had its own attorney tell it that the findings of the district court were tentative, preliminary only, and that what -- and went through what the plaintiffs claim and told them that what they were doing would not address the constitutional issues that were raised by plaintiffs.  So --   Sonia Sotomayor  No, I think he said more.  This won't resolve the taint that -- I believe he said it won't resolve the --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I -- I -- I --   Sonia Sotomayor  But may I ask something? There's end of litigation.  Are you ending a litigation, or are you ending the possibility of a court stopping you from discriminating? Meaning, if there is a basis, and -- and you're aware that there are claims that you intentionally discriminated, there are findings not just by the 2012 court but by the D.C. circuit court -- district court, that you have intentionally discriminated in drawing a number of lines, intentionally or in results, and you're now saying I don't really care, I want to get the court outside of messing even with my discriminatory lines.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  It --   Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, there's -- there's a difference between pulling out Republicans and pulling out Democrats.  What shows -- in protecting an incumbent, because, presumably, our law would say you can protect an incumbent if it's race -- if it's based on party lines, but if you're using just race, what findings are there to show that this was race-based as opposed to incumbency-based?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry.   ",17-586X
0,"Sonia Sotomayor  I'm sorry, Mr. -- General.  I thought that Congress had looked at the situation and created a statutory system that addressed the very concern the President is expressing.  Congress said you can have visa waivers if you -- if you can meet the three criteria that this special committee of the President looked at, and if you don't, you have to have a very heightened, extreme vetting process.  And it created that vetting process and suggested its parameters. More importantly, it took terrorist countries and designated which ones supported terrorism and added another layer of review and said, if you're a national from one of those countries or you have visited one of those countries in the recent past, you also have to get the permission of the Attorney General and the Secretary of State to -- to affirm that you are not a danger to the U.S.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  So I -- but what I see the President doing here is saying, I'm going to add more to the limits that Congress set --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- and to what Congress said was enough.  Where does a President get the authority to do more than Congress has already decided is adequate?   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But -- it might, but --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- on the very grounds that Congress has already looked at?   Sonia Sotomayor  Can you represent that no other country that -- that fails all three of the criteria was excluded from this list?   Sonia Sotomayor  So given --   Sonia Sotomayor  General, the proclamations by Reagan and Carter, however, were not as broad as this one.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And -- and --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  And more -- and more immigrants, because Carter's only applied to certain immigrants, not to all.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Mr. General, you just --   Sonia Sotomayor  Why not an Establishment Clause claim?   Sonia Sotomayor  No, but the claim is that it -- that the proclamation is in place because of a dislike of a particular religion. And I thought the Establishment Clause at its heart is that we cannot be anything but neutral with respect to religion or its practice.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  But these people are saying that that negative religious attitude is stopping them --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- from doing things that they would otherwise be able to do: To associate with scholars from these countries, to bring in students, to have family members join them.   Sonia Sotomayor  Which is one of the purposes of the INS.   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Well, but I --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  General, today, can we go back to something that's been bothering me here, which is -- and it was argued in a case this week about the unitary executive theory, which basically says the President is at the head, I think -- I'm summarizing in an incomplete way --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- but that the President is the head of the executive branch and that he should have, for those who are in the extreme of this theory or -- or on one end of the theory --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- not extreme, that he can hire or fire anyone he wants and that he can put in place whatever policy he wants.   Sonia Sotomayor  If we take Justice Kagan's hypothetical President --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- who basically says to his review committee, I want to keep out Jews --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- period; find a way.  That's their charge. So, in that situation, why would the actions of the committee, whatever this is, Executive Committee, not be subject to great suspicion and to thorough review -- which actually wasn't completely --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- done here -- given that they are responsible to the executive --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- and they've been told what the outcome of their deliberations must be?   Sonia Sotomayor  General, the problem is that I don't see that that material was reviewed by the judges below, by the Ninth Circuit or the Fourth Circuit judges. I thought that the government had kept confidential and refused to share, either with the litigants or the courts, exactly what was done, how, what the evaluation and how --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- it was applied to all those countries in the world. I understand some of the confidentiality that might concern you, but if the backdrop is the way that Justice Kagan described it --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- that -- that heated --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  -- anti-Semitic background, don't you think that once you get through the Mandel preliminary stage, that you need an independent arbiter to look at all of that to ensure the process, in fact, is what is claimed it was?   Sonia Sotomayor  General, could you stop just one second?   Sonia Sotomayor  I for one am, like Justice Breyer, concerned about is this window dressing or not? What's in place to ensure it's not? What are you personally doing to represent to us that it is, in fact, a real waiver process --   INTERRUPTING Sonia Sotomayor  Have you bothered --   Sonia Sotomayor  -- to look to see if there are reasons for all of those people's exclusions?
